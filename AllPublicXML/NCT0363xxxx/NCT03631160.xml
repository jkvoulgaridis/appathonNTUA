      1. Title: Effect of Transcutaneous Acupoint Electrical Stimulation on postoperative
           spontaneous voiding for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy patients：A Randomized Clinical
           Trial

        2. Research center: Multicenter

        3. Design of the research: A randomized, double-blind and parallel controlled study

        4. Object of the research: Patients （40≤age＜75 years）planing to elective laparoscopic
           cholecystectomy under general anesthesia without preoperative placement of catheter.

        5. Sample size of the research: A total of 1,200 patients,600 cases in each group

        6. Interventions: The acupuncture points for Transcutaneous Acupoint Electrical
           Stimulation(TAES) are Zhongji ( CV3),Guanyuan ( CV4),Sanyinjiao ( SP6) and Ciliao (
           BL32) points . In treatment group patients are treated with low-frequency pulse
           electroacupuncture stimulation apparatus (HANS G6805-2, Huayi Co, Shanghai, China) at
           bilateral of SP6 and BL 32 points during the operation,and treated with a similar method
           at CV6 and CV4 acupoints for 45 minutes in postanesthesia Care Unit. Each devic is
           connected and maintained after &quot;Deqi&quot;. Participants in the control group received
           nonacupoints (located 1 inch beside acupoints) and avoided manual stimulation and no
           &quot;Deqi&quot; without actual current output.

        7. Aim of the research: Evaluate the effect of TAES on the postoperative spontaneous
           voiding in patients for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC ).

        8. Outcome：Primary outcomes: The time of the first spontaneous voiding after surgery .

           Secondary outcomes: symptoms of postoperative voiding, the incidence of Postoperative
           dysuria,postoperative catheterization rate, catheterization time, incidence of related
           complications,as well as the effects on postoperative NRS pain and sleep quality scores
           etc.

        9. The estimated duration of the study：2 years.

      This study is a large sample, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and long-term
      follow-up design. In this study, bilateralZhongji ( CV3),Guanyuan ( CV4),Sanyinjiao ( SP6)
      and Ciliao ( BL32) points were selected for perioperative TAES treatment, accompanied with
      evaluating the postoperative spontaneous voiding, the incidence of Postoperative
      dysuria,postoperative catheterization rate, as well as the effects on postoperative NRS pain
      and sleep quality scores . To clarify the effect of TAES on the postoperative spontaneous
      voiding in patients for laparoscopic surgery is of great significance to the clinical
      applications and popularization of traditional acupuncture treatment perioperatively across
      the world.

    <masking_description>Subjects who have signed informed consent were assigned to either TEAS group or control group on the basis of digital random numbers generated by SPSS.23.0 software. The acupuncturist(Z.-Y.) was informed of the randomization allocation each subject by a concealed envelope, just before the onset of TEAS. And during the treatment, the screen of all acupuncture treatment instruments was covered from to ensure the anesthesiologist and surgeon blinded. The acupuncturist, statistician, and data collectors work independently and only perform assigned tasks, besides after the agreement is initiated, all researchers will not have any private communication with the study.</masking_description>
