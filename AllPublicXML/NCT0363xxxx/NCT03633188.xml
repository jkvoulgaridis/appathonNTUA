  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone and joint infections (BJI) is a public health issue in industrialized countries.

      Implant-associated BJI, are complex hospital-acquired infections and eradication of the
      pathogen is challenging in such patients.

      A prolonged antimicrobial therapy is usually required from 6 weeks to 3 months, but some
      patients are eligible to several years of treatment and most of patients report
      gastrointestinal troubles, such as nausea and mild to severe diarrhea (but very few developed
      C. difficile diarrhea).

      Moreover, the host gut microbiota is probably largely affected in abundance, richness and
      diversity. Indeed, it is known, that few days of antibiotics are sufficient to induce
      significant alterations of the gut microbiota, also called dysbiosis.

      Severe dysbiosis, which is potentially irreversible and associated with a definitive shift in
      the gut microbiota metabolism and host homeostasis, may lead to and/or promote a large panel
      of severe diseases such as Clostridium difficile infection, diabetes mellitus, obesity,
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cirrhosis, neurological disorders and cancer. It may also
      be associated with BJI recurrence and then impact global health costs.

      The main objective of this study is to constitute biobanking of stools and perform DNA
      sequencing of the gut microbiota in patients with acute or sub-acute implant-related Bone and
      Joint Infection (BJI), caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
