  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pretending with the use of accelerometers and pressure platform, determine indicators that
      are useful to therapists to assess postural control and balance, to subsequently allow to
      evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions through therapeutic exercise of motor
      control in patients with chronic low back pain .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The records are made simultaneously with the different evaluation equipment, accelerometer
      and pressure platform. The tests are performed in a control group of healthy subjects, and in
      an experimental group with DLC receiving a program of therapeutic exercise based and pain
      education based on neuroscience.

      After the collection of the records, the behavior patterns in both groups are evaluated, the
      possible differences among them are established for the clinimetric indicators analyzed
      related to the postural control, as well as a characteristic of the sample.

      Subsequently, through the evaluation after the intervention of the experimental group we will
      analyze the effect of a physiotherapy treatment based on the therapeutic exercise of motor
      control on parameters related to postural control and clinical variables (perceived pain,
      mechanosensitivity, disability and proprioceptive repositioning of the lumbar spine )

    <description>Stay for 30 seconds each test on a pressure platform. Accelerometer in the pelvis (center of mass), fixed by velcro tape. Application of the Romberg test. (Standing with open eyes and closed on stable and unstable surface).The unit of the accelerometer is mg (1 mg = 0.001) and the kinetic energy of the signal is measured in Julians x 10-6 The displacement unit of the pressure center of the platform is millimeters</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability
Scoring instructions For each section of the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is mark ed the section score = 0; if the last statement is marked, it = 5.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>it measures the catastrophic thoughts before the pain, that is, the negative thought before the pain. In the PCS, people take the painful past experience as a reference and indicate the degree to which they experience certain thoughts and feelings. The PCS is composed of 13 items, on a Likert scale of 5 points that goes from 0 (never) to 4 (always).
Higher scores indicate higher levels of catastrophism</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is commonly used in clinical practice to quantify pain levels related to fear of activity or to a new injury in patients with back pain. Patients with high levels of kinesiofobia are often considered at greater risk of developing long-term activity limitation and chronicity</description>
