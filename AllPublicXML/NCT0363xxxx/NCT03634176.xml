    <textblock>
      Measurement of the diameter of the sheath of the optic nerve in patients hospitalized in
      intensive care, with increased intracranial pressure (&gt; 20mmHg) as a substitute measure for
      diagnosis and follow-up before and after different non-invasive strategies.

      Three groups were created in which, through strategies already proven and non-invasive
      (mannitol, hypertonic solution 7.5% NaCl, reverse trendelenburg) to decrease the intracranial
      pressure, the optic nerve diameter measurement was performed and simultaneously the
      investigators monitored intracranial pressure through an intraventricular catheter
      continuously to determine if both correspond
