    <textblock>
      This is an open label, safety and preliminary efficacy study of MRx0518 in combination with
      pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumours (non small cell lung cancer, renal cell
      carcinoma, bladder cancer or melanoma).

      Subjects will be treated with IV pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and 1 capsule twice daily of
      MRx0518. Treatment will continue as long as clinically relevant, until disease progression,
      unacceptable AEs or withdrawal of consent up to a maximum of 35 cycles (approx. 2 years).

             Investigator).

          -  Subjects must have progressed on treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor administered
             either as monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other

                  RECIST v1.1, iRECIST or irRECIST. The initial evidence of disease progression
                  (PD) is to be confirmed by a second assessment no less than four weeks from the
                  date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid clinical progression.

               3. Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of a
                  PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.

             been free from menses for ≥2 years.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication

          -  Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential should agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through
             120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

          -  Subjects who failed to show any response to initial treatment with PD-1/PD-L1
             inhibitor (i.e. no Response or no Stable Disease).

             metastases which have been stable (defined as without evidence of progression by MRI
             for at least 28 days prior to initiation of therapy and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline) following treatment with surgery or radiation therapy are
             allowed.

          -  Prior solid organ or hematologic transplant.

             agents (including but not limited to anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents, anti-CTLA4 monoclonal
             antibodies) that caused permanent discontinuation of the agent, or that were grade 3
             or 4 in severity.

          -  Subjects treated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or other
             investigational agent within &lt;5 times the half-life of the agent or &lt;21 days

             within 7 days of starting experimental therapy. Physiologic replacement doses are
             allowed if they are ≤10mg of prednisone/day or equivalent, as long as they are not
             being administered for immunosuppressive intent. Inhaled or topical steroids are
             permitted, provided that they are not for treatment of an autoimmune disorder.

             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.). Note: corticosteroids given within 24 hours of an imaging study for purposes of
             pre-medication in subjects with hypersensitivity to radiologic contrast agents are

             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator
