  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study of pegloticase (KRYSTEXXA®) given with methotrexate (MTX) in
      adult participants with uncontrolled gout. Approximately 12 to 14 participants will be
      enrolled. Study duration will be approximately 82 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and blood levels
      of pegloticase when given with concomitant MTX administered to prevent immunogenicity against
      pegloticase, in adults with uncontrolled gout.

      This is a multicenter study of pegloticase (KRYSTEXXA®) plus methotrexate (MTX) in adult
      participants with uncontrolled gout.

      The study design will include: 1) up to a 2-week Screening Period (screening should be
      complete within 2 weeks prior to Week -4), 2) a 4-week MTX Run in Period (Week - 4 through
      Day 1); 3) a 52-week Pegloticase + IMM (immunomodulator), (Pegloticase + MTX) Period 4) a
      Safety Follow-up (Phone/Email/Site Visit) and 5) a 3 and 6 month Post Treatment Follow-up.
