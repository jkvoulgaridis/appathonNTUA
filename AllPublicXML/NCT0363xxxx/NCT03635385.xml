  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO) and
      against proteinase 3 (PR3), have a pathogenic role during ANCA (AAV) vasculitis. Glomerular
      basement membrane (MBG) antibodies also have a direct pathogenic role in Goodpasture's
      syndrome and anti-MBG antibody glomerulonephritis (GN). In some patients, the severity of
      renal and / or pulmonary involvement justifies the rapid purification of these autoantibodies
      by an apheresis procedure, while waiting for the effect of immunosuppressive treatments aimed
      at reducing their production. During vasculitis, plasma exchange (PE) is recommended in
      patients with severe renal impairment or intra-alveolar hemorrhage (2012 KDIGO Clinical
      Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis).

      Given certain disadvantages related to plasma exchanges (low volume of purified plasma,
      non-selective technique for immunoglobulins (Ig), need for replacement solute, induction of
      coagulation disorders), immunoadsorption (IA), already used in transplantation, has been
      developed in these indications. IA has indeed greater selectivity for Ig with a probable
      better purification capacity due to higher volumes of plasma treated per session. The price
      of IA is however higher than that of EP.

      These two apheresis techniques, EP and IA, are commonly used in France during severe forms of
      vasculitis ANCA or anti-MBG, without the superiority of one or the other has been
      demonstrated. As a result of higher plasma volumes being purified, AI may allow faster
      purification of pathogenic antibodies. No studies to date have specifically compared the
      purification kinetics of these antibodies between EP and IA.

      The CINEVAS study (VAScularite Antibody Purification CINetic) is a multicentric pilot study
      whose main objective is to compare the purification kinetics of ANCA (anti-MPO or anti-PR3)
      and / or anti- MBG in patients treated with EP versus those treated with IA
