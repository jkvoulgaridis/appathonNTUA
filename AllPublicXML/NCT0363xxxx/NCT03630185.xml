  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the efficacy of custom-manufactured
      compression hosiery (also known as compression stockings) compared to similar off-the-rack
      (OTR) compression stockings.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a medical questionnaire used to measure pain, developed by the Pain Research Group of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care.
The score is an average of seven questions about pain interference in life. The score scale is from 0 to 10. 0 being pain does not interfere and 10 being that it completely interferes. 10 would be a worst outcome.</description>

          <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a medical questionnaire used to measure pain, developed by the Pain Research Group of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care.
The score is an average of seven questions about pain interference in life. The score scale is from 0 to 10. 0 being pain does not interfere and 10 being that it completely interferes. 10 would be a worst outcome.</description>

          <description>The short-form 12 item (SF-12) HRQoL health status instrument measures Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). It produces overall HRQoL estimates as well as sub-scale scores (Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS)) that assess both mental/emotional and physical functioning related to health.
The scoring scale is from 0 to 100, the higher the score the better the health related quality of life.</description>
