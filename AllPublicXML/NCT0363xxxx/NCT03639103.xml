  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary propose of this prospective study is to specifically evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of Minimally Invasive Distal Metatarsal Metaphyseal Osteotomy (DMMO) in
      treating patients with persistent central primary metatarsalgia, associated or not to hallux
      valgus and lesser toe deformities, identifying possible contraindications in relation to some
      demographic parameters (age, gender, BMI, and smoking). The second objective is to verify the
      potential of DMMO in restoring a harmonious foot morphotype according to Maestro's criteria
      and if these radiographic parameters are correlated with clinical outcomes, maintaining the
      predictive value of these criteria during preoperative planning also for this percutaneous
      surgery.

    <textblock>
      A consecutive series of patients with metatarsalgia is consecutively enrolled and treated by
      DMMO. According to Maestro criteria, pre-operative planning is carried out by both clinical
      and radiological assessment. Patient demographic data, AOFAS scores, 17-Foot Functional
      Index, Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire, SF-36, VAS, and complications are recorded.
      Maestro parameters, relative morphotypes, and bone callus formation are assessed. Statistical
      analysis is carried out (p &lt; 0.05).

    <description>The AOFAS score includes 9 questions related to pain, function and alignment; a score of 90-100 is considered excellent; 75-89 as good; 50-74 as fair and less than 49 points is considered a failure or a poor outcome.</description>

    <description>The Foot Functional Index to measure the persistence of pain, disability, and restriction of activity with 17 number rating scales from 0 to 10. The maximum score is 100, which indicates complete disability.</description>

    <measure>Evalutation of the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire changes</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperatively, 3-, 6-, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire to establish how frequent the restrictions in specific situations were, including 16 questions divided into three basic domains: pain (five), walking/standing (seven), and social interaction (four). Scores for each domain are calculated by summing the responses to each item within a given domain. Raw scores can be converted to a 0-100 metric where 100=most severe.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic classification according to Maestro and Besse criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>before surgery, at one-month after surgery and at different follow-ups (3-, 6-, 12-month, and last)</time_frame>
    <description>Our sample is classified radiographically according to Maestro and Besse criteria, adding to this classification one more group to include those feet that did not reflect any morphotype as defined by Maestro parameters. The radiographic evaluations includes the Maestro criteria index using the preoperative and the last follow up. The relative length of each metatarsal is determined by drawing a line perpendicular to the axis of the foot and then measuring the distances (in millimeters) from each metatarsal head to this line , while also taking into account the relationship between the length of metatarsal M1 and the length of the remaining metatarsal bones.</description>

    <description>The scalpel is advanced at an oblique angle of about 45Â° until it reaches the dorsal aspect of the distal metatarsal bone to undergo osteotomy. First a bone rasp specific for percutaneous surgery is used to separate the periosteum at the level of the osteotomy site. A Shannon Isham burr is introduced until it reaches the metatarsal neck where the periosteum was previously removed. Fluoroscopy is used to confirm the correct position of the osteotomy site. The lateral cortical surface is cut first, then the plantar, medial, and lastly, the dorsal cortical surface. During the osteotomy process, the incision site is irrigated by normal saline, as the burr can cause excessive heat, causing skin burn and resulting subsequently in fibrosis and pseudoarthrosis at the bone level.</description>
