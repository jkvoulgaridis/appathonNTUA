  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, the main objective of this study is to
      evaluate the clinical, patient-centered, and economic effectiveness of a stepped-care
      intervention for patients with panic attacks and panic disorder presenting to the busiest
      Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) departments of the largest public healthcare group in Singapore.

      The RCT will have two arms: 1) treatment via an enhanced care pathway consisting of a
      stepped-care intervention for panic attacks and panic disorder; and 2) a control arm
      consisting of screening for panic attacks and panic disorder in the A&amp;E and discharge
      (routine care). In addition to the baseline assessment, the study follow-up visits will occur
      at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses

      Aim 1 (Primary): To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention for
      A&amp;E patients with panic attacks and panic disorder as compared to screening alone.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the patient-centered effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention for A&amp;E
      patients with panic attacks and panic disorder as compared to screening alone.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care intervention for A&amp;E
      patients with panic attacks and panic disorder compared to screening alone from the health
      system perspective.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS is a 7-item semi-structured interview of panic symptom severity. Each item is rated on a 0 (none/mild) to 4 (extreme/severe) scale. A higher total score would represent severe panic symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a reliable and valid 36-item self-report questionnaire that evaluates multiple facets of health-related quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-DAS is a brief, cross-culturally valid, self-report questionnaire that is used to assess overall level of health and disability in clinical and general population settings.</description>

    <description>The PDSQ is a reliable and valid self-report diagnostic questionnaire that has been widely used to assess the most common psychiatric disorders in outpatient settings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D (EuroQol Group, 1990)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a patient self-report instrument that evaluates generic quality of life.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI; Guy, 2008)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a clinician-rated instrument used to assess global severity of symptoms.The CGI ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). A higher total value indicates more severe panic symptoms and anxiety.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In a stepped-care model, all patients start with an evidence-based intervention of low intensity as a first treatment step. Progress is monitored and patients who do not respond adequately can subsequently be 'stepped up' to a higher intensity treatment. This model is now being recommended as the best strategy for treating panic attacks and panic disorder.</description>
