  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model as a theoretical backdrop, the
      proposed study aims to provide a 10-week e-health learning strategies for Chinese cardiac
      patients, with which they can follow at home after rehabilitation discharge. The current
      study will examine whether the cardiac rehabilitation patients in intervention group would
      increase their physical activity (PA) level and fruit-vegetable intake (FVI), improve the
      social-cognitive variables of PA and FVI, and enhance mental health outcomes in comparison
      with control condition; and whether the social-cognitive variables would mediate the
      association between intervention and adopting a healthy lifestyle. The study findings may
      contribute to the current multiple health behaviour intervention research and support Chinese
      cardiac patients to maintain rehabilitation outcomes and cultivate a healthy lifestyle.

      For the main study, the sample size will be estimated by using G*Power 3.1 software with
      MANOVA of repeated measures approach. For achieving a medium effect size of 0.25 (Duan et
      al., 2017), with a power (1-β) of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05, the total sample size will be
      116. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 30%, a total of 166 participants will be
      required for the study evaluation.

      All data will be analyzed by using SPSS 23.0 software. Independent samples t-tests and
      Chi2-tests will be adopted to examine the characteristics of drop out and compare the
      differences of baseline data at T1. Statistical significance will be set at 5% level
      (two-tailed). The intervention effects on behavioural, social-cognitive and mental health
      status-related indicators will be tested by conducting the multivariate analysis of variance
      (MANOVA) with repeated measures, with time (T1, T2 and T3) as the with-in subjects factor and
      group (IG and CG) as the between-subjects factor. Missing data will be imputed within each
      measurement point in time using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. Furthermore, the
      intervention effect on healthy lifestyle indicator will be examined by performing a
      multinomial logistic regression model. The multiple-mediator model will be conducted to test
      the mediation effects with the use of SPSS macro (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008).

    <description>The level of PA will be measured through the short Chinese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-C) questionnaire.

Respondents will be asked to count the number of portions of fruit and vegetables they consumed on average during a typical day. Each item has 11 options for the number of portions such as 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, ..., and 5 or above. The total portion of fruit and vegetable consumption is the sum of each item.</description>

The item of action planning for PA will be asked such as &quot;…which concreted PA I will pursue&quot;, for FVI such as &quot;…how I will prepare the food&quot;. The items of coping planning for PA will be asked such as &quot;…how I can stay active, even if something happened&quot;, for FVI such as &quot;what I can do in difficult situations, in order to remain true to my own resolutions&quot;. Answers will be given on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from totally disagree &quot;1&quot; to totally agree &quot;5&quot;. The mean value of the total score will be calculated and the higher score denotes to the higher level of planning.</description>

    <measure>Change of perceived quality of life: WHO Quality of Life-BREF</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the 9th week (at the end of intervention) and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This indicator will be assessed by using the short version of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). Respondents will be first asked about their general quality of life as &quot;How would you rate your quality of life?&quot;, then 7 items in physical health sub-domain will be used, such as the example item &quot;To what extent do you feel that physical pain prevents you from doing what you need to do?&quot;. Answers will be given on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from very poor &quot;1&quot; to very good &quot;5&quot;.

Self-efficacy will be a fixed intervention variable involved from week 2 to week 8. Additionally, some behaviour change techniques will be employed in the intervention in order to facilitate the implementation and maintenance of behaviour.</description>
