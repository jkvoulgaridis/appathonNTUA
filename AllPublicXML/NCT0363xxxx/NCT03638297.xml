  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PD-1(programmed death protein 1)antibody has been to approved in patients with MSI-H/dMMR
      advanced cancer and has achieved significant efficacy. It is reported that the objective
      response rate of Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab are 40% and 31.1% in MSI-H/dMMR (microsatellite
      instability-high/deficiency mismatch repair )colorectal cancer. What's more, most of the
      patients who had response for PD-1 antibody achieved a long duration of disease control.
      However, not all patients with MSI-H/dMMR was sensitive to PD-1 antibody despite it is a
      biomarker for PD-1 antibody treatment. There were about 50-60% of patients with MSI-H/dMMR
      were insensitive and we don't know why. What's more, it's reported that tumor mutation burden
      (TMB) may be another biomarker of response to PD-1 therapy. COX (cyclooxygenase)inhibitor has
      been proved to prevent adenomas in colorectal and it is safe for most of the patients.
      Preclinical models also showed that COX inhibitor could act with PD-1 antibody in mice and
      control disease progress. So, this study aims to evaluated efficacy and safety of combination
      of PD-1 antibody and COX inhibitor in patients with MSI-H/dMMR or high tumor mutation burden
      colorectal cancer.

      This is a single arm, phase two study. Eligible patients with advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal
      cancer were assigned to receive BAT1306 plus COX inhibitor. All patients will receive the
      study regimen every 3 weeks. Chest/abdomen/pelvic CT with IV contrast will be performed to
      assess clinical response.
