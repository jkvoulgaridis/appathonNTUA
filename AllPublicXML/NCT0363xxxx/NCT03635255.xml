  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) resulting from atherosclerotic obstruction of epicardial
      coronary arteries accounts for more than one-third of deaths in subjects over the age of 35
      worldwide. The global incidence of CAD is on the rise owing to the international epidemic of
      obesity, type 2 diabetes and aging, all of which are potent risk factors for coronary
      atherosclerosis. Participants with CAD are at high risk for subsequent adverse cardiovascular
      (CV) events and death; it has been estimated that one out of every five CAD patients will
      experience at least one adverse CV event during a 5-year follow up period. There is, however,
      no reliable diagnostic tool to predict the risk of adverse CV events or death in participanrs
      with CAD. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs are stably present in serum, plasma,
      urine, saliva and other body fluids and are considered a novel class of non-invasive
      biomarkers for various diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular
      diseases

      Objective：To identify the novel circulating miRNA expression profiles that may serve as a
      sensitive and reliable biomarker to predict future adverse CV outcomes and death in patients
      with established CAD.

      Methods：The investigators propose to utilize next-generation sequencing (RNASeq) to identify
      the novel plasma miRNA expression signature linked to adverse CV outcomes in participanrs
      with CAD. The identified miRNA candidates that are predictive of adverse CV events will be
      validated in a larger independent cohort of CAD patients. In addition, miRNAs that are linked
      to adverse CV outcomes in CAD patients will be investigated mechanistically in human aortic
      endothelial cells to understand their functional contribution to the occurrence of adverse CV
      events.

      What is New or Innovative in this Study? This study could be one of the few studies to
      investigate circulating miRNAs as novel biomarkers for risk stratification and the clinical
      outcome prediction in patients with established CAD. This report will also demonstrate that
      some dysregulated circulating miRNAs might contribute to endothelial dysfunction and adverse
      CV events in CAD patients.

      Scientific or Clinical Implication of the Expected Results：The results from this study will
      provide a new prognostic tool to predict CV outcomes in CAD patients using plasma miRNA
      expression signature. It will also provide important scientific insights into the complex
      non-coding RNA regulatory network involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The
      insights from this study may provide a unique opportunity to improve the risk assessment of
      adverse CV events in CAD patients by targeting theses miRNAs.

      Blood and Urine Sampling After enrollment, 20 mL of blood from peripheral vessels and 10 mL
      urine were collected. Sampling collection was at the time of enrollment, and every 3 months
      thereafter in 3-month intervals during outpatient clinic visits. These samples were stored in
      a -80°C refrigerator until analysis for biomarkers and metabolomic study. Patients were
      excluded if they had ingested any drugs with antioxidant activity, vitamins, or food
      additives within the 4 weeks prior to blood/urine sampling.
