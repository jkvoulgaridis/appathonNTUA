  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia is a frequent perioperative complication. When the negative effects of anesthesia
      on temperature are aggravated by other factors, such as glycine infusion in transurethral
      resection, temperature can decrease even more. Preoperative warming prevents hypothermia,
      lowering the temperature gradient between core and peripheral compartments and reducing
      thermal redistribution. The most recent clinical practice guidelines advocate for active
      prewarming before induction of general anaesthesia since it is very effective in preventing
      perioperative hypothermia. However, the ideal warming time prior to the induction of
      anesthesia has long been investigated. This study aims to evaluate the optimal time period of
      preoperative forced-air warming to reduce the incidence of hypothermia at the end of surgery
      in patients submitted to transurethral resection. This is a clinical trial comparing
      different time periods of prewarming in patients submitted to undergo elective transurethral
      resection. We will compare different time periods: 0 minutes (control group), 15 minutes, 30
      minutes and 45 minutes. 144 patients are going to be included in this study (36 patients in
      each group). Measurement of temperature will be performed using a tympanic thermometer.
      Patients will be followed throughout their hospital admission. Data will be recorded using a
      validated instrument and will be analysed using the statistics program R Core Team.

    <textblock>
      Maintaining patient's temperature above 36 grades Celsius throughout the perioperative period
      is challenging. Thus, it is essential to monitor temperature in order to be able to take
      measures to avoid the appearance of hypothermia. Once the temperature has decreased, its
      treatment is difficult since the application of heat to the body surface takes a long time to
      reach the core thermal compartment. Intraoperative warming alone cannot avoid postoperative
      hypothermia. The application of forced-air warming system during the preoperative period has
      been shown to be the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, it would not be efficient to provide a long-time
      prewarming in short-term surgical procedures. Thus, the ideal warming time prior to the
      induction of anesthesia has long been investigated. Due to the searching of optimal
      prewarming time and the lack of evidence about the efficiency of prewarming in patients
      submitted to transurethral resection, the conductance of this clinical trial is justified.

    <masking_description>Randomization will be carried out by a collaborator investigator using a computer program (Excel 2016) when a new patient is included into the clinical trial. This collaborator investigator will call by phone the nurse in charge of receiving the patient in the preanesthetic room, telling this nurse how long prewarming has to be given to the patient: 0 minutes (no prewarming), 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 45 minutes, according to the group given by the computer program. This collaborator investigator will not provide clinical care to the patient. Thus, principal investigator will not be able to know how long prewarming will be given by the nurse to the patient (chosen by the computer program and organized by a collaborator investigator)</masking_description>
