  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized crossover trial to evaluate the effects of thoracic compression applied
      alone or in association with hyperinflation maneuver with the ventilator. In addition, the
      mobilized volume and peak expiratory flow resulting from both maneuvers will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator hyperinflation is widely used in hypersecretive patients. It consists of
      increasing alveolar ventilation by facilitating the coughing mechanism so that the secretions
      of the peripheral airways are mobilized into the central airways so that they can be removed
      by tracheal aspiration or cough. Thoracic compression consists of manually compressing the
      rib cage during expiration, in order to increase expiratory flow, mobilize and remove
      pulmonary secretions. A randomized crossover clinical trial was performed with 30 patients
      submitted to isolated compression or associated with ventilator hyperinflation, with a 6 hour
      interval. Patients were evaluated through compliance and resistance of the respiratory
      system.

    <time_frame>Baseline (before), immediately after ventilator hyperinflation or rib cage compression and five minutes after aspiration</time_frame>
    <description>The total resistance of the respiratory system was evaluated through the occlusion maneuver at the end of the inspiration, considering the resistive pressure, measured by the difference between the maximum plateau pressure. Three measurements were taken at each moment, the mean being used.</description>

    <measure>Airway Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before), immediately after ventilator hyperinflation or rib cage compression and five minutes after aspiration</time_frame>
    <description>The airway resistance was assessed by means of the occlusion maneuver at the end of the inspiration, considering the rapid fall of the pressure immediately after the occlusion, measured by the difference between the maximum pressure and P1. Three measurements were taken at each moment, the mean being used.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (before), immediately after ventilator hyperinflation or rib cage compression and five minutes after aspiration</time_frame>
    <description>The peak expiratory flow was evaluated through passive expiration, being considered the greatest value of the flow in the expiratory phase.</description>
