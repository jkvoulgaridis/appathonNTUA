  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this graduate student research study is to investigate the effects of nitrate
      from beetroot powder with additional anthocyanins from tart cherry on exercise performance in
      healthy Loma Linda University students utilizing the Wingate Anaerobic test on stationary
      bike.

      A randomized controlled double-blind crossover study with a baseline and two interventions.
      On day 1 (baseline), all subjects will have a lactate fingerstick measurement before and
      after the Wingate protocol. A random subsample (1/3 of subjects) will have 10 milliliters (2
      teaspoon) of blood drawn for determination of serum allantoin. Subjects will then be equipped
      with a pulse oximeter and a heart rate monitor after which they will perform the Wingate
      Anaerobic test protocol. The protocol includes: 4 minutes of warm up, 3 seconds of warm up
      sprint with weights, 1-minute relaxed cycling, 2-minute rest, then 10 seconds cycling without
      weights. This will be followed by 30 seconds sprint with weights and end with 2 minutes of
      relaxed cycling. A post-activity blood draw will be performed for another 10 milliliters (2
      teaspoon) of blood from the same one-third of subjects previously sampled. After baseline
      data collection, subjects will undergo a 1-week washout (avoiding high antioxidant foods)
      after which they will be randomized to treatment groups. On day 9, subjects will begin
      supplementation with nitrate from beetroot powder with additional anthocyanins, or nitrate
      from beetroot powder with a placebo for 7 days. On day 15 the subject will again repeat the
      same procedures as day 1, followed by another week of washout. They will supplement again on
      day 23 and repeat the same procedure as the first intervention on day 29.

    <description>Participants in this study should reach an anaerobic state as they perform the Wingate test. This lactate pro analyzer will be a tool to examine the participant's change in blood lactate levels by means of POC fingertip lactate measurement. Lactate levels will be measured in all participants at baseline, before and after Wingate Anaerobic test.</description>

    <description>A compound pharmacy will formulate capsules with nitrates extracted from beetroot and anthocyanins from tart cherries. A daily dose of the capsules will be taken for 7 days after the washout period. Each dose will comprise 500 mg of nitrates and 450 mg of anthocyanins. In a meta-review by Dominguez and colleagues, 6-8 mmol of nitrates from beetroot was associated with increased exercise performance. Another review by Kelley et al., showed that marathon runners and resistance trainers ingesting between 450-480 mg of anthocyanins had reduced muscle soreness and decreased oxidative stress. Subject will consume each supplement orally with only water 2 hours pre-prandial.</description>

    <description>The same compound pharmacy will formulate capsules with nitrate extracted from beetroot and a placebo element made of starch. This product will taste the same as the nitrate and anthocyanin supplementation. A daily dose of the capsules will be taken for 7 days after the washout period. Each supplementation will have 500 mg of nitrate and 450 mg of placebo. Subjects will consume each supplement orally with only water 2 hours pre-prandial.</description>
