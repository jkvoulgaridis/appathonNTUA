      Study Design:

      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study to 3 years with
      extension up to 5 years

      Number of Subjects:

      Approximately 1,605 subjects will be enrolled into the study

      Study Population:

      Post-menarcheal, pre-menopausal women up to age 45 years, who are at risk for pregnancy and
      who desire a long-term intrauterine contraceptive for birth control will be eligible for this
      study.

      Primary Endpoint:

      The primary endpoint is the contraceptive efficacy through 3 years of use, as assessed by the
      Pearl Index.

      Secondary endpoints:

      Contraceptive Efficacy:

        -  Pearl Index at Years 4 and 5, as well as cumulatively through Years 4 and 5.

        -  Pregnancy percentage by life table analysis (Kaplan-Meier) at Years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

      Study drug placement:

        -  Ease of VeraCept placement

        -  Placement success

      Safety:

        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs)

        -  Adverse events (AEs)

        -  Pelvic infection (pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis)

        -  Ectopic pregnancies

        -  Uterine perforations

        -  Dysmenorrhea

        -  Abdominal pain

        -  Expulsion rates at Years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

      Tolerability:

        -  Bleeding and spotting patterns

        -  Insertion pain assessed immediately after insertion

        -  Continuation rates at Years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

        -  Reasons for discontinuation Return to fertility

        -  Pregnancy rate in subjects who request VeraCept removal specifically to become pregnant.
           Subjects who desire pregnancy after having VeraCept removed will be followed for either
           1 year, until they decide to no longer try to conceive or they become pregnant,
           whichever comes first.

         24. Study staff or a member of the immediate family of study staff.
