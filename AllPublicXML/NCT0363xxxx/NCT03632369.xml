  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world; each year lung cancer claims
      over 20 000 lives in Canada and more than one million lives globally (1). Significant
      improvements have been made in treating many other types of cancer, but lung cancer care has
      not realized similar successes. Seventy percent of cancers are at an advanced stage at
      diagnosis, and radiation plays a standard role as a part of both radical and palliative
      therapy in these cases. Normal lung tissue is highly sensitive to radiation. This sensitivity
      poses a serious problem; it can cause radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis (RILI), which may
      result in serious disability and sometimes death. Thirty-seven percent of thoracic cancer
      patients treated with radiation develop RILI; in 20% of radiation therapy cases, injury to
      the lungs is moderate to severe (2). In addition, radiation-induced pneumonitis that produces
      symptoms occurs in 5-50% of individuals given radiotherapy for lung cancer (3, 4).

      The chances of clinical radiation pneumonitis are directly related to the irradiated volume
      of lung (5). However, radiation planning currently assumes that all parts of the lung are
      equally functional. Identification of the areas of the lung that are more functional would be
      beneficial in order to prioritize those areas for sparing during radiation planning. In order
      to limit the amount of RILI to preserve lung function in patients, clinicians plan radiation
      treatment using conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). This makes use of
      computed tomography (CT) scans, which take into account anatomic locations of both disease
      and lung but cannot assess the functionality of the lung itself. An important component of
      the rationale of IMRT is that if doses of radiation entering functional tissue are
      constrained, radiation dose can be focused on tumours to spare functional tissues from injury
      to preserve existing lung function (6). Therefore, to optimally reduce toxicity, IMRT would
      depend on data of not only tumour location, but also regional lung function.

      Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) can detect a decrease in pulmonary function due to the
      presence of tumours or RILI, but because the measurements are performed at the mouth, PFTs do
      not provide regional information on lung function. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      may be used for radiation planning, but PET is limited in its ability to delineate functional
      tissue, it requires administration of a radiopharmaceutical agent, it is a slow modality,
      and, because it requires use of a cyclotron, it is expensive. Single-photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) imaging to measure pulmonary perfusion as a means for delineating
      functional tissue has been explored (7-11). Whereas SPECT can detect non-functional tissue,
      it offers spatial resolution that is only half that of CT or PET, and it does not possess the
      anatomical resolution necessary for optimal use with IMRT. Furthermore, like PET, SPECT is a
      slow modality. Given the limitations of existing imaging modalities, there is an urgent unmet
      medical need for an imaging modality that can provide complimentary data on regional lung
      function quickly and non-invasively, and that will limit tissue toxicity in radiotherapy for
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Hyperpolarized (HP) gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to fill this unmet
      need. HP gas MRI, uses HP xenon-129 (129Xe) to provide non-invasive, high resolution imaging
      without the need for ionizing radiation, paramagnetic, or iodinated chemical contrast agents.
      HP gas MRI offers the tremendous advantages of quickly providing high-resolution information
      on the lungs that is noninvasive, direct, functional, and regional. Conventional MRI
      typically detects the hydrogen (1H) nucleus, which presents limitations for lung imaging due
      to lack of water molecules in the lungs. HP gas MRI detects 129Xe nuclei, which are polarized
      using spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) technique to increase their effective MR signal
      intensity by approximately 100,000 times. HP gas MRI has already been widely successful for
      pulmonary imaging, providing high-resolution imaging information on lung structure,
      ventilation function, and air-exchange function. The technology has proven useful for imaging
      asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis, and for assessing
      the efficacy of therapeutics for these diseases (12 -21). In this project, the investigators
      propose to develop an imaging technology for delineating regions of the lung in humans that
      are non-functional versus those that are viable; using hyperpolarized (HP) xenon-129 (129Xe)
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will better inform beam-planning strategies, in an attempt
      to reduce RILI in lung cancer patients.
