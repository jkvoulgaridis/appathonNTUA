  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      clinical trial was conducted to evaluate regenerative potentials of cultured gingival
      fibroblasts and GMSCs carried in beta tri calcium phosphate scaffold into intrabony
      periodontal defects in human by clinical and radiographic parameters
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, twenty posterior two or three osseous intrabony periodontal defects
      were involved . They were grouped in to two groups. Group I included ten intrabony posterior
      defect received beta tri calcium phosphate (β TCP) bone substitute. Group II included ten
      posterior intrabony periodontal defect and they received a mixture of gingival fibroblast(GF)
      and gingival mesenchymal stem cells(GMSCs) carried on a vehicle of β TCP covered by a
      resorbable collagen membrane. CBCT was used preoperatively and after 6 months for hard tissue
      evaluation. PDGF and BMP were measured in GCF at days 1,3,7,14.

    <description>20 patients were involved as assessed by cone beam ct at baseline (pre) and 6 months later(post). the fusion of pre and post operative cone beam ct scan of the intrabony periodontal defect to measure bone gain by mm. so that, the regenerative potentials of cultured gingival into ten intrabony defect fibroblasts and GMSCs carried by tri calcium phosphate , the bone gain was measured by radiographic fusion of pre and post image of intrabony periodontal defects in human.</description>

    <description>4 GCF samples were collected from each patient at day 1,3,7,14 after periodontal surgery then a Biochemical analysis of BMP-2 and PDGF-bb (by mg /dl) concentrations in GCF by using ELIZA kite which reflect the healing power at the initial periods of healing in different groups.</description>
