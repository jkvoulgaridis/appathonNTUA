      Objective: Mental illness is a leading cause of disease burden; however, many barriers
      prevent people from seeking mental health services. Technological innovations may improve the
      ability to reach under-served populations by overcoming many existing barriers. The
      investigators evaluated a brief, automated risk assessment and intervention platform designed
      to increase the use of crisis resources provided to individuals who were online and in
      crisis. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized that individuals assigned to the
      intervention condition would report using crisis resources at higher rates than individuals
      in the control condition. Method: Participants, users of the digital mental health app Koko,
      were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions upon accessing the app and were
      included in the study after their posts were identified by machine learning classifiers as
      signaling a current mental health crisis. Participants in the treatment condition received a
      brief Barrier Reduction Intervention (BRI) designed to increase the use of crisis service
      referrals provided on the app. Participants were followed-up several hours later to assess
      the use of crisis services.

    <description>The BRI was designed to overcome common concerns and misconceptions (i.e., barriers) related to using crisis services. It works by first asking the user about what potential barriers may keep them from using the crisis service referrals, and then, based on the user's response, by providing information intended to help the user overcome the potential barrier(s) they selected. By exploring the menu of barriers, users could read brief messages designed to dispel common misconceptions or concerns related to each barrier. For example, a common concern among Koko users was that calls to lifelines invariably result in visits by the police or other emergency services. Users who feared this possibility could tap on the associated button and learn that active rescues such as these are extremely rare, and occur in less than one percent of all cases. Whenever possible, we used language throughout the intervention to help validate the experiences of the users.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from 39,450 Koko users who signed up for the service between August 10, 2017 and September 20, 2017. Koko (née Panoply) provides safety services for large online social networks.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All potential participants (N=39,450) screened for eligibility were considered enrolled. Potential participants were randomized upon accessing the platform, not later when identified as being in-crisis, because we used the platform’s extant, AB-testing randomization tool. No other AB-tests were on the platform during the study period.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>Brief help-seeking barrier reduction intervention: The BRI was designed to overcome common concerns and misconceptions (i.e., barriers) related to using crisis services. It works by first asking the user about what potential barriers may keep them from using the crisis service referrals, and then, based on the user's response, by providing information intended overcome the potential barrier(s) they selected. By exploring various barriers, users could read brief messages designed to dispel common misconceptions/concerns related to each barrier. For example, a common concern among Koko users was that calls to lifelines invariably result in visits by the police. Users who feared this possibility could tap on the associated button and learn that active rescues such as these are extremely rare, and occur in less than one percent of all cases. Whenever possible, we used language throughout the intervention to help validate the experiences of the users.</description>
