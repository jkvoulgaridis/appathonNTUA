  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, unblinded trial to determine the
      safety and efficacy of MRI guided focal laser ablation of localized low and intermediate risk
      prostate cancer. All subjects meeting the inclusion exclusion criteria and are enrolled will
      undergo a MRI guided focal laser ablation procedure. The primary aim of the study is to study
      the safety and efficacy of the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer should be viewed as a spectrum of diseases ranging from a very indolent
      low-risk process to an aggressive high-risk potentially fatal disease. Active surveillance
      has been introduced as an alternative treatment to patients with low- risk prostate
      cancers.Focal therapy techniques have been introduced in prostate cancer to destroy the tumor
      itself with adequate safety margin with the advantage of preserving the surrounding
      non-cancerous tissue. Thus maintaining disease control at acceptable levels, while minimizing
      complications.

      With the advent of multiparametric MRI (Mp-MRI), it is now possible to identify suspicious
      prostate gland focal lesions, determining their extent and targeting them for biopsy and
      focal ablation. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is well suited for MRI environment.
      Laser fibers are flexible so they can fit into the MRI gantry. Laser has been shown to
      produce homogenous tissue necrosis that can be monitored by real time temperature maps, a
      feature that facilitates effective and safe ablation.

      20 subjects with localized low and intermediate risk prostate cancer that meet the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. During baseline evaluation, subjects will undergo
      lab tests, MR imaging, and will complete QOL questionnaires. Subsequently, subjects will
      undergo the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Guided Focal Laser Interstitial Thermal Ablation
      procedure. Subjects will be followed immediately after the procedure, at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, one year and two years after procedure for adverse events and recurrence of prostate
      cancer

    <description>Safety is assessed by percentage of grade 3 or higher complications or adverse events (AE) as defined as National cancer institute's common toxicity criteria version 4: incontinence or urinary retention necessitating surgical intervention or new-onset erectile dysfunction not responsive to medication.Grade refers to the severity of the AE. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or non invasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental ADL. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Experienced Change in Erectile Function</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in erectile function is assessed using Sexual Health Inventory For Men (SHIM) for erectile function. There are 5 questions and each question has 5 possible responses. If the patient's score is 21 or less, erectile dysfunction (ED) is present.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Experienced Change in Urinary Function</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary function will be assessed using International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) assessment for urinary function. The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) is based on the answers to seven questions (maximum score 35) concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Any score &gt; 1 indicates presence of urinary dysfunction, higher score indicates increased severity.</description>

    <description>The procedure is done under general anesthesia. Laser fiber placement will be performed by one of two approaches (Trans gluteal or trans rectal) based on the target location within the prostate gland. When the needle position is deemed satisfactory, a 1.5-cm-active tip diode laser fiber will be introduced within an internally cooled catheter through the introducing sheath.
The catheter tip location will be confirmed on Turbo Spin-Echo (TSE) T2-weighted images in the axial and sagittal oblique planes.The introducer sheath will be withdrawn to allow contact of the active laser tip with the lesion. A laser test dose will be done at 9 Watts for about 30 seconds to confirm the site of fiber placement with the subsequent delivery of full dose ablation at 12-27 Watts. Ablation duration is determined based on real time feedback of response using real time temperature and damage estimate maps.</description>

        <description>Safety is assessed by percentage of grade 3 or higher complications or adverse events (AE) as defined as National cancer institute's common toxicity criteria version 4: incontinence or urinary retention necessitating surgical intervention or new-onset erectile dysfunction not responsive to medication.Grade refers to the severity of the AE. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or non invasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental ADL. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE.</description>
