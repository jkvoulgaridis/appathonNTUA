      This trial will be conducted with the aim to investigate the dermal response (skin
      irritation, sensitization) and the adhesion of Ibuprofen 200 mg TEPI Medicated Plaster as
      compared to a Placebo TEPI Plaster in two phases:

      Induction Phase: multiple dose application of one active and one placebo plaster on 5
      consecutive days in which the plasters remain in place for 23 hours ± 30 min a day and
      Challenge Phase: single dose application of one active and one placebo plaster which remain
      in place for 48 hours ± 30 min.
