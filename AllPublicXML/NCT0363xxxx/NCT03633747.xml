  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic hemangioma is one of the most common benign tumor of the liver. Although the overall
      prognosis is good, active interventions are still needed in high-risk patients. Without
      specific drugs, the main treatment methods include surgical treatments, interventional
      therapies and radiotherapies. Effective medical treatments are needed urgently. Propranolol
      has achieved good results in infantile Facial/hepatic hemangioma, and shows some
      effectiveness in adult hemangioma. Here, investigators intend to evaluate the therapeutic
      effect of propranolol in adult hepatic hemangioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In view of the lack of medical treatment for hepatic hemangioma, investigators chose
      hemangioma patients with a diameter of 5-10 cm and no significant risk of rupture, or those
      with surgical indications but rejected of surgical, interventional/radiological
      interventions. After confirmation of no high risk for drugs, oral propranolol was given. The
      tumor size, objective remission rate, disease control rate, drugs related side effects and
      other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the propranolol could or
      couldn't effectively control the progress of hepatic hemangioma.
