  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry is frequently used to measure bone mineral density. A new
      medical device, Box 3D DXA, creates a 3D image using a statistics reconstruction model
      developed on the femur. This new imaging technique does not require additional irradiation
      and ought to improve bone measures as well as incorporating densitometric parameters into the
      diagnosis. This study will test the reconstruction of the 3D image from lombar spine
      measurements and compare accuracy against measurements made using CT scan.
