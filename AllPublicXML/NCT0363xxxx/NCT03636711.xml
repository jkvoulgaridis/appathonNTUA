      Consensual antibiotic protocols have been developed and validated locally by infectious
      disease specialists, internists and emergency physicians, in order to encourage their
      compliance. A preliminary study was conducted from June 2015 to February 2016, including 622
      patients admitted to the emergency department for infectious syndrome such as /

        -  Pneumoniae

        -  Urinary tract infection

        -  Cellulitis

        -  Meningitis

        -  Malaria

        -  Febrile neutropenia

        -  Febrile acute diarrhea

        -  Fever back to the tropics

        -  Angina

        -  sexually transmitted infection This prospective study will observe and analyze the
           adherence of prescribers to these protocols. With description of patients who benefited
           or not the antibiotic protocol, according to a syndromic approach and analysis of the
           causes of non-adherence to the protocols. In order to limit the length of stay and
           reduce the cost of hospitalization..
