  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 4-week SPN-810 treatment on brain
      functioning in patients aged 8-12 years with ADHD and associated feature of IA. This will be
      achieved using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with the point
      subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP) Task, a behavioral aggression paradigm in which
      subjects are provoked by having money indirectly taken from them by a fictitious opponent,
      simulating an aggression response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 subjects aged 8-12 diagnosed with ADHD and associated feature of IA will be
      recruited in this study. The PSAP is a behavioral aggression test used to evaluate behavioral
      response related to impulsive aggression. The task will be combined with functional MRI to
      evaluate the change in brain activity measured as BOLD signal (blood oxygenation
      level-dependent) from baseline to the end of the treatment with SPN-810.

      The level of neurotransmitters Glutamate and GABA will also be measured using magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

      Additionally, the improvement and severity in impulsive aggression behaviors will be assessed
      using validated scales.

    <measure>BOLD fMRI contrast (beta value) at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with SPN-810 in response to the aggression task. The z-score acquired during resting state fMRI before and after the treatment with SPN-810.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD fMRI contrast (neural activation) will be collected during the PSAP behavioral aggression task, while playing the game. The participant will play a computer game in which they can steal points (simulating an aggressive behavior) or have points stolen by the opponent. In addition, imaging data will be collected at resting state to understand the connectivity between regions of interest before and after the aggression task.</description>

    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During the MRI scan, imaging data will be obtained while participants are able to listen to music. GABA and Glutamate signals measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) from two brain regions (anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala) will be used to quantify the two neurotransmitters.</description>
