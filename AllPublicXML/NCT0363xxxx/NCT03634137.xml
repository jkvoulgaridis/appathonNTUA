  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers.
      Twenty four subjects will be enrolled in the study and will be assigned to receive either a
      16 mg afamelanotide bioresorbable implant from the current manufacturing process or a 16 mg
      afamelanotide bioresorbable implant from the optimized manufacturing process. Implants will
      be administered subcutaneously.

      The following procedures will be conducted throughout the study:

        -  Collection of blood samples for analysis of afamelanotide concentrations

        -  Measurement of skin reflectance for estimation of melanin density, and luminance (L*),
           blue/yellow colour hue (b*)

        -  Safety monitoring

      The objective of the proposed study is to confirm that the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties of implants eluting 16 mg of afamelanotide produced by this final
      optimized manufacturing process are essentially the same as those of implants manufactured
      with the same formulation that have been used in earlier clinical studies

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin.

      For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled release depot injection
      (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly into the body over a few
      days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after afamelanotide has been
      released and will slowly dissolve.

             surgical and medical history, physical examination, ECG, clinical laboratory testing
             and vital signs.
