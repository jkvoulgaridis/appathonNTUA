  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, 2-arm, randomized study will evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and caboplatin compared with placebo plus paclitaxel and
      caboplatin in Chinese participants with newly diagnosed, previously untreated Stage III or
      Stage IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Participants whose
      disease has not progressed after six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with either
      bevacizumab or placebo will continue treatment with either bevacizumab or placebo until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 22 cycles, whichever occurs
      first.
