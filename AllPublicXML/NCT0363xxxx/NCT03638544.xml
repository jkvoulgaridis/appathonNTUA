  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aim to manufacture bread and pasta with an reduced content of gluten and to assess
      the impact of reducing the daily intake of gluten by 50% in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      patients. Fungal proteases and selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria will be used for
      making wheat bread and pasta with a reduced content of gluten (RG) (-50% of traditional
      products). From a technological point of view, the chemical, structural and sensory features
      of the RG products approached those of the bread and pasta made with normal level of gluten.
      The efficacy and safety of new products will be compared to traditional bread and pasta by
      using a double blind randomized, crossover-controlled trial in IBS patients with persistent
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients will follow two weeks of a GFD diet containing RG bread
      and pasta and two weeks of GFD diet containing Normal Gluten bread and pasta Symptoms
      severity will be assessed by Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Score (IBS-SS), Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QoL).
