  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past decade, especially with the advancement of technology, major innovations and
      developments have been observed in the field of surgery. Cardiac surgery is one of the
      important area of the surgery who renews itself day by day and adds innovations to the nature
      in terms of patients' comfort. One of the greatest developments in cardiac surgery in this
      sense is the tendency to reduce the size of the incisions with less interventional
      procedures. Robotic surgery is getting more and more meaningful in this area. Despite the
      downsizing of the surgical incisions, postoperative pulmonary complications have not
      completely disappeared in the robotic cardiac surgery. Major respiratory problems following
      traditional cardiac surgery are gas exchange problems, atelectasis, decreased coughing force
      and sputum retention. The effectiveness of respiratory physiotherapy applied after
      traditional cardiac surgery for the resolution of these complications has been proved by
      various investigations. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been found to improve autonomic
      modulation in heart failure patients as well as to increase inspiratory muscle strength in
      applied patient populations, reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, and increase
      functional capacity in elderly individuals. Considering these benefits, when inspiratory
      muscle training is given to people with traditional cardiac surgery, respiratory muscle
      strengths, respiratory functions and functional capacities are increased compared to those
      not given to these patients. However, although there are complications after robotic cardiac
      surgery, there are no studies in the literature about respiratory physiotherapy or
      inspiratory muscle training. Thus, the subject of this study is the comparison of the effects
      of standard respiratory physiotherapy and standard respiratory physiotherapy plus inspiratory
      muscle training on the respiratory functions, respiratory muscle strength and functional
      capacity of the patients with the robotic heart surgery.

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 9 item scale which measures the severity of fatigue and its effect on a person's activities and lifestyle in patients with a variety of disorders. Assessment type: Patient reported outcomes.The items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree.The minimum score = 9 and maximum score possible = 63. Higher the score = greater fatigue severity.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The fatigue impact scale was developed to assess the symptom of fatigue as part of an underlying chronic disease or condition. Consisting of 40 items, the instrument evaluates the effect of fatigue on three domains of daily life: cognitive functioning, physical functioning, and psychosocial functioning. Respondents are asked to rate the extent to which fatigue has interfered with certain aspects of their day-to-day functioning using a scale that ranges from 0 (&quot;no problem&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extreme problem&quot;). Scores are then tallied to produce an overall score with a potential maximum of 160. Subscale scores can also be calculated to give a more nuanced impression of fatigue.</description>
