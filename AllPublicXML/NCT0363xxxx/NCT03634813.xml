  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore in a pilot randomized clinical trial, the impact of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
      with patient directed information as compared to usual care on the postoperative management
      of blood pressure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention and control groups will be defined by, 1) preoperative home blood pressure
      monitoring with a detailed report sent to the patient, and 2) usual standard of care
      including a suggestion during the pre-operative clinic appointment to follow up with Primary
      Care. Both groups will receive a brief questionnaire about their blood pressure treatment and
      medication adherence. We will examine the rate of primary care follow-up and changes in
      hypertension treatment at 60 days post-operative, through a telephone call. This information,
      along with information regarding patient acceptance of the intervention will be used to
      inform the design of a future clinical trial powered to outcomes, including follow-up visits
      and blood pressure management.

    <description>In a further analysis, we will examine the proportion of patients demonstrating HBPM elevation. Specific cut-offs for the interpretation of home blood pressure are controversial. For our own analysis, we will use the mean home blood pressure threshold &gt; 135/85 mmHg as indicating hypertension, in-line with recommendations from the American Heart Association.</description>

    <description>Enrolled patients will be fitted with a HBPM device and instructed in its use. Patients will be asked to return the HBPM device on the morning of surgery. At the same time they receive the HBPM device, they will also be provided with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) booklet called &quot;Your guide on lowering blood pressure&quot;, which has several guidelines regarding diet, exercise and lifestyle changes that can be implemented to improve blood pressure control.</description>

    <description>The usual care group will receive brief counseling after the PAT visit which will review their blood pressure readings taken at the clinic and how they compare with the American Heart Association (AHA) blood pressure guidelines. They will be offered the suggestion that they should follow up with their primary care doctor 2-4 weeks after their surgical episode is completed, or at their earliest convenience.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We propose to recruit patients who present for ambulatory surgery, aged &gt;18 years,
             with a preoperative blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mmHg taken as the mean of two readings
             during the pre-admission testing visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to be contacted by telephone, are non-English
             speaking, or are unable to operate an automated home blood pressure monitor will also
             be excluded.

          -  Healthy patients with blood pressure readings that fall within the American Heart
             Association (AHA) guidelines.
