  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression in pregnancy is common, affecting up to 10% of women and represents serious risk
      to mother and infant. Unfortunately, antidepressant medication, a first-line treatment for
      depression in pregnancy, also comes with risks, making this a complex decision. Clinical care
      appears to be insufficient for ensuring that women make decisions that are consistent with
      their own values and with which they feel satisfied. Patient decision support tools can
      address such barriers. We have created and piloted with positive results an online patient
      decision aid (PDA) that has the potential to improve the decision-making process for women
      regarding antidepressant use in pregnancy in conjunction with clinical care. The overall
      objective of this study is to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to assess the
      efficacy of our PDA for antidepressant use in pregnancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. Eligible and consenting
      women with depression will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either online PDA or a control
      condition comprising an online set of publicly available standard resources. The study will
      be stratified by preconception vs. pregnant, and by province.

      The study is based at Women's College Hospital (Toronto) but participants will be recruited
      from across Canada, as the online intervention does not require any in-person study visits.
      Participants will be recruited via social media (ex. Facebook, Twitter, mommy/baby blogs) and
      by provider referrals.

      Participants will be given a series of online questionnaires with various measures collected
      at baseline, 4 weeks post-randomization, in each trimester of pregnancy, and at 1, 3, 6 and
      12 months postpartum. Participants who are planning pregnancy will enter the longer-term
      (pregnancy and postpartum) follow-up phase once they become pregnant; those who do not
      conceive by one year post-randomization will be sent a final set of questionnaires and exit
      the study. A process evaluation will also be conducted to gain insights around trial conduct,
      and perspectives on potential for (or barriers to) scale-up. This, along with the planned
      economic evaluation, will inform clinical and policy decisions around adopting the PDA into
      real-world practice.

Review of depression treatment options (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) along with their respective risks and benefits.
Interactive &quot;values clarification&quot; exercises to help women determine which risks and benefits are most important to them.
Exercises to help women consider how partners, family, providers and the social context impacts decision-making.
A summary of how a woman feels about each option along with risks and benefits is generated which can be provided to treating clinicians for use in follow-up.
