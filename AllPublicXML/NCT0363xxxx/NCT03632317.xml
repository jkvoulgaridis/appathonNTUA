      This phase 2 trial will evaluate the activity of Panobinostat in combination with Everolimus
      for children with gliomas harboring H3.1 or H3.3K27M mutation, including newly diagnosed
      high-grade glioma or DIPG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma) after radiation (stratum A) and
      recurrent/progressive glioma (grade II-IV, including DIPG) (stratum B).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients and/or a legal guardian must sign institutionally approved written
             informed consent and assent documents.

          -  Patient must be greater than 2 years and less than 30 years

             patients &lt; 16 years of age (Karnofsky and Lansky is a scoring system used to quantify
             the general well being of cancer patients where 100% represents perfect health and 0%
             represents death). Neurologic deficits in patients with CNS tumors must have been
             relatively stable for a minimum of 7 days. Patients who are unable to walk because of
             paralysis, but who are able to sit in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for
             the purpose of assessing the performance score.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Adequate liver function

          -  Adequate renal and metabolic function

          -  Urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio of &lt; 1; or a urinalysis that is negative for

          -  Primary brain or spine tumor are eligible, including tumors with metastases, multiple
             lesions

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy.

             must be determined by neurosurgical team.

             disease and ≥ 4 weeks must have elapsed.

          -  H3K27M mutation: Participants must have a mutation in H3.3 K27M or H3.1 K27M as

             symptom management must be on a stable dose for 7 days prior to start of treatment.

          -  Allogeneic stem cell transplant: Patients within 1 year of allogeneic stem cell
             transplant, patients with active GVHD or requiring immunosuppression are excluded.

          -  Previous hypersensitivity to rapamycin or rapamycin derivatives.

          -  Baseline QTc of &gt;450 msec on EKG OR electrolyte imbalance predisposing to QTc
             prolongation (baseline ≥ Grade 1 hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; and baseline ≥ Grade 2
             Ca++, Mg++, phosphate abnormalities). Repletion/correction is allowed to achieve
             eligibility. Use of QTC prolonging medications will be monitored throughout the trial.
