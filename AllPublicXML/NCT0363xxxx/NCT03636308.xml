    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II trial comparing the first-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel
      plus S-1(AS) and nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine(AG) in advanced pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDA) with primary tumor nonexcision in Chinese patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and chemo-resistant disease
      with extremely low 5-year survival rate. Gemcitabine has been the cornerstone of metastatic
      PDAC treatment for more than a decade , although survival benefit was very poor.
      Nab-paclitaxel added to gemcitabine has showed improving survival and overall response rate
      vs gemcitabine alone in metastatic PDAC first-line treatment in the MPACT phaseIII study,
      which represents one of the standards of care in advanced PDAC therapy. S-1 is an oral
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrug, and shown to be non-inferior to gemcitabine on OS for
      unresectable pancreatic cancer. Meanwhile, adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 monotherapy was
      found to significant prolong survival of pancreatic cancer patients when compared with
      gemcitabine. This study is to explore the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus S-1(AS)
      and nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine(AG) as first-line treatment in advanced pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDA) with primary tumor nonexcision in Chinese patients.
