  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of older adults report problems with function, which can lead to difficulty with
      activities of daily living and nursing home placement. Thus, there is a need to implement
      evidence-based models of care to improve function and those factors that support function in
      older adults living in the community. One such model is Community Aging in Place, Advancing
      Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE), a person-centered, nurse and occupational therapy
      intervention supported by assistive devices and home modifications. The investigators build
      on prior work that translated CAPABLE and conducted preliminary testing of a package of
      implementation strategies entitled &quot;MiCAP&quot;. This R15 application will test site-level
      adoption and sustainability of CAPABLE after deploying the MiCAP package of implementation
      strategies (readiness assessment, training, facilitation, champions, coalition building, and
      audit and feedback). The real world setting is 18 Medicaid Home and Community Based Service
      &quot;waiver&quot; program sites in Michigan that care for community dwelling disabled older adults.
      Baseline measures of characteristics, leadership and readiness (site), and attitude and
      efficacy (clinicians) will be obtained. Investigators will train facilitators (Champions) at
      each site who will train an interdisciplinary team of nurses, occupational therapists, and
      social workers who will then provide CAPABLE. A facilitator coalition will be formed to share
      best implementation practices. The Stages-of-Implementation tool will be used to assess
      success. Sites will be randomized to internal facilitation alone or internal facilitation
      plus external facilitation. Post-intervention data from waiver sites and clinicians will be
      collected. Medicaid beneficiary-level outcomes will be examined (activities of daily living,
      instrumental activities of daily living, pain, depression, falls, emergency room and hospital
      use) over 9-months to report on intervention efficacy in this population. This work will
      impact implementation science by testing two approaches to implementation of an
      evidence-based intervention to improve outcomes among older adults in a Medicaid Waiver
      program. This natural setting approach has high generalizability for waivers, as the
      investigators learn what intensity of implementation strategies are needed to adopt evidence
      in a waiver. The investigators will engage students as members of the team and building the
      College of Nursing's research capacity.

      The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines Implementation Science (IS) as the process of
      applying evidence to the treatment or prevention of human disease. In response, this trial is
      significant because it addresses testing of multimodal implementation strategies of an
      evidence-based intervention (CAPABLE) in a Medicaid setting to improve the quality and
      effectiveness of a waiver. Investigators will utilize implementation strategies refined in
      prior work (MiCAP; Hartford/Hillman/CMS) where the investigators trained clinicians (N=34)
      and provided CAPABLE for beneficiaries (N=270).

      For this application, the investigators extend their work and train &quot;all&quot; Registered Nurses
      (RNs), Occupational Therapists (OTs), and Social Workers (SWs) (N=575) in the waiver sites in
      Michigan to implement the CAPABLE model of care for &quot;all&quot; Medicaid waiver beneficiaries
      (N=15,000). Guided by site managers, the team will select and train Internal Facilitators
      (IFs), who are supervisors/employees that work for the waiver site, to conduct facilitation
      at each site as &quot;Champions&quot;. Investigators will utilize waiver employees as External
      Facilitators (EFs), who were early adopters of CAPABLE in prior work, as &quot;Super-Champions&quot;
      for Arm 2.

      This trial is also significant as it addresses a critical barrier to implementation of
      evidence-based interventions to improve function in older adults living in the community to
      age-in-place (CAPABLE). Evidence suggest 90% of older adults prefer to age-in-place; yet a
      gap exists between their desire and ability. Thus, further testing of efficacy of an
      intervention (CAPABLE) in a Medicaid waiver population will fill a gap in science and build
      upon evidence.

      The Institute of Medicine, NIH, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality have each
      established IS as a research priority so that the benefits of evidence-based interventions
      can be realized. Consequently, strategies (MiCAP) to overcome barriers and increase the pace
      and the effectiveness of implementation are a public health priority. The multimodal
      implementation strategies (MiCAP N=6) include: assessing readiness, conducting training,
      using IF Champions, building an IF coalition, and audit and feedback is adequate.
      Additionally, investigators will examine if the additive EF is required to support adoption
      and sustainability of an evidence-based intervention (CAPABLE).

      Disabilities in basic activities of daily living (ADLs [e.g., bathing, toileting]) and
      instrumental ADLs (IADL [e.g., shopping, cleaning]) are the primary modifiable predictors of
      nursing home (NH) placement. Disability is also a major driver of increased risk of falls and
      may lead to poor quality-of-life. Disability creates an inability to carry out everyday ADLs.
      There are a number of risks for disability like complex medication regimens, poor balance and
      strength, inadequate communication with clinicians, falling, and unsafe ADL performance. In
      addition, unsafe environments and deteriorated housing increase risk.

      To address this problem, the evidence-based intervention, CAPABLE, addresses modifiable
      intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors and considers the psychological, environmental, and
      physical factors to enhance function of disabled individuals and promote aging-in-place. A
      multi-component model of care, CAPABLE was designed to reduce the effect of problems with
      physical function among low-income older adults living at home by addressing an individual's
      capabilities and the home environment.

      CAPABLE was adapted from the ABLE program. ABLE used a person-directed, consultative model
      involving 6 home sessions conducted by OTs and physical therapists who provided home
      alterations (assistive devices [e.g., shower chair, reacher, raised toilet seat],
      environmental modifications [e.g., grab bar, ramps], and select home modifications [e.g.,
      widen bathroom doorway]) and instruction in various techniques to enable participants to
      achieve self-identified functional goals. CAPABLE is a 16-week structured program delivered
      by OTs who conduct 6 home visits and provide assistive devices, RNs who conduct 4 home
      visits, and a repairperson who provides home alterations (i.e., installs devices,
      environmental modifications, and home repair). CAPABLE's interdisciplinary team provides
      consultation with older adults to help them identify daily activity goals (e.g., taking a
      shower, walking to the bathroom), evaluate barriers to achieving those goals, and attain
      outcomes collaboratively. The OT addresses ADLs, IADLs, and discretionary activities at home
      such as functional mobility, meal preparation, bathing, and dressing. The RN targets
      underlying issues that influence ADLs, IADLs, and discretionary activities at home, such as
      pain reduction, improvement in mood, fall prevention, medication review and management,
      primary care physician communication, incontinence management, sexual health, and smoking
      cessation. CAPABLE draws upon approaches to enhance uptake and adoption of strategies by
      patients by assessing readiness and using motivational interviewing.

      In this trial, the investigators move IS forward by examining a multimodal implementation
      strategy (MiCAP) approach to implement evidence (CAPABLE) in a Medicaid Waiver program. To
      fill an IS gap, investigators will use proven implementation strategies that are packaged
      (MiCAP) and delivered to clinicians in the waiver program sites to support beneficiary
      improvement in function and those factors that influence function in older disabled adults
      aging-in-place.

    <description>The Stages of Implementation Completion is an 8-stage tool of implementation process and milestones, with stages spanning 3 phases. Three scores are derived: 1) number of stages completed; 2) time spent in each stage; and 3) proportion of activities completed in each stage. Number of stages completed is a count of progression through stages; the score is the last stage in which at least one activity was performed. Time spent in each stage is calculated by taking the difference between the date of completion of the first activity and the date of completion of the last activity in the same stage. Complete all 8 stages: the final completion date is logged in stage 8. For sites that chose to discontinue implementation, the date is logged in the furthest stage that the site enters. Proportion of activities completed is calculated as number of activities completed divided by number of possible activities in each stage.</description>

    <description>Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS-50) is a 50-item tool that assesses mental health and social service providers' attitudes toward adopting EBP. The EBPAS-50 covers 12 subscales: appeal, requirements, openness, divergence, limitations, fit, monitoring, balance, burden, job security, organizational support, and feedback. The 12 subdomains sum up in a higher order total scale score representing respondent's global attitudes toward EBP. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-&quot;not at all&quot; to 4-&quot;to a very great extent&quot;. In order to assess different perspectives and to reduce response biases, 23 items belonging to five subscales (divergence, limitations, monitoring, balance, and burden) are negatively framed. For the total score these items are reversed scored, and the mean subscale scores recomputed, before a mean score for the total EBPAS-50 item score is computed. A higher total score indicate a more positive attitude towards adoption of EBP.</description>
