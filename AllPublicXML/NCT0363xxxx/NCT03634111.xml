  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) has effect to postoperative analgesia for
      cesarean section with spinal anesthesia but it was limited for cesarean section with general
      anesthesia. The hypothesis that this technique has effect to postoperative analgesia for
      cesarean section with general anesthesia and it could reduce 50% of total morphine
      consumption during 24 hours after surgery.

      This is a randomized, controlled, no-blind clinical trial. The investigators selected 60
      cases, who were cesarean section under general anesthesia, age from18 years, and American
      Society Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification was from II-III. The cases of acute fetal
      impairment, local anesthesia contraindication, tolerance opioids, liver failure, renal
      failure, and spinal anesthesia failure were excluded. All cases were randomized assigned two
      groups: the TAP block group (T group) and controlled group (C group). Each group has 30
      cases. The TAP block was performed under the ultrasound guidance with 0.25% of ropivacaine 20
      ml each side. The both groups was treated postoperative analgesia with intravenous morphine
      to patients controlled analgesia (PCA). The primary outcome was total morphine consumption
      during 24 hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes were the time of required the first
      dose of morphine, pain score, the complications of TAP block, the side effects of morphine,
      and satisfaction score of participants. Data was described and analyzed with SPSS 25.0. The
      sample size was calculated with the hypothesis that TAP block could reduce 50% of dose
      morphine during 24 hours after surgery, 80% of power, 10% of loss, and 0.05 of alpha error.
