  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of intranasal insulin on cognitive processes (behavioural
      and neural) in healthy lean and obese female adults. All subjects will receive a single-dose
      of intranasal insulin and/or placebo (on different days) before participating in several
      cognitive tasks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that eating behaviour is affected by metabolic signals (e.g. insulin,
      ghrelin, serotonin) and is also modulated via food reward processes. However, in humans,
      eating behaviour is a complex process, which involves habits, long-term goals and social
      interaction. Thus, recently it has been proposed that higher cognitive processes such as
      inhibitory control, attention and memory also modulate eating.

      Insulin seems to be involved in both metabolic processes and cognitive processes. In the last
      decade it has been shown that intranasal administration of insulin decreases food intake,
      especially in women, and enhances thermogenesis and memory. In addition intranasal insulin
      administration has been shown to affect brain areas related to homeostatic control, reward
      and memory.

      In the proposed study the investigators will examine the effect of intranasal insulin
      administration on eating, and on metabolic, reward and cognitive processes and their
      potential interplay. The investigators will also study the effect of body weight on the
      actions of insulin on these processes.
