    <textblock>
      Methods to reduce the revision rate of total hip arthroplasties (THAs) because of
      wear-related issues are important to examine, particularly because younger patients have a
      disproportionately high risk of revision. The investigators hoped to follow up patients and
      see if long-term Harris hip scores and WOMAC scores better in younger patients with a
      ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) THA compared with those with a ceramic-on-highly-cross-linked
      polyethylene (COP) THA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High success rates obtained in the general population have stimulated for total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) in young and active patients. Although there have been substantial
      improvements in THA, bearing surface wear and osteolysis are major factors limiting the
      durability of THAs in young and active patients. During the last decade, alternative bearings
      have been developed, including highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) and
      ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) bearings, with the potential to reduce wear and osteolysis in
      younger, more active patients.

      Despite contemporary cementless THA with COC bearings giving excellent clinical and
      radiographic outcomes, there is concern about squeaking, fracture of the ceramic head or
      acetabular insert or fretting and corrosion (trunnionosis). Although HXLPE have been reported
      to reduce polyethylene wear, there is concerned about a potential decrease in toughness,
      tensile strength and resistance to the propagation of fatigue cracks in a long-term
      follow-up.

      Several noncomparative studies of COC and COP THA have reported promising results in terms of
      Harris hip scores, radiographic findings, and survival rates, yet we are aware of no
      long-term comparative clinical studies with a COC THA and a COP THA in the same younger
      patients. This study aimed to see if long-term Harris hip scores and Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) score better in younger patients with a COC THA
      compared with those with a COP THA.

    <description>The Harris Hip Score(HHS) was developed by William H. Harris to assess the results of hip surgery or hip replacement. The standard evaluation applies to various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in adults. The original version of the score was first published in 1969. 100 is the best score, and 0 is the worst possible score. HHS has a subset of pain(44 points), function(47 points), absence of deformity(4 points), and range of motion(5 points)</description>

    <measure>WOMAC(Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>15 years after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A tool to evaluate patient function associated with knee. The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). The total score is summed from individual sections, and 0 is the best possible score.</description>
