      Objective:

      This study investigated the effectiveness of a core stability training Physiotherapy
      programme versus Acupuncture for the management of balance and functional capacity
      impairments of women with Fibromyalgia.

      Design:

      A single-blind randomized clinical controlled trial.

      Setting:

      University of Extremadura and Olivenza Fibromyalgia Association, Spain

      Subjects:

      Women with Fibromyalgia and balance impairment.

      Interventions:

      135 Participants were randomized to a core stability training physiotherapy programme group
      (n=45), an acupuncture treatment group (n=45) and control group (n=45) for 13 weeks.

      Main Measures:

      Measures were taken at baseline (week 0), post intervention (week 6) and at follow up (week
      13). The primary outcome measures were static balance (posturography) and dynamic balance and
      functional mobility (Berg Balance Test, Time Up and Go test and 10-metre walk). The secondary
      outcome measure was functional capacity (Fibromyalgia Health Assessment Questionnaire (FHAQ)
      and the physical function item from the Spanish Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (SFIQ)).

    <description>In the acupuncture experimental group, the technique applied included the use of the following acupuncture points of Traditional Chinesse Medicine: GV20, ST36 and BL60 . One needle insertion was performed in each session and in the case of the last two points the needle insertions were done bilaterally.
Patients laid supine on a treatment table with their legs exposed. The skin on the acupuncture points was prepared with 70% ethyl alcohol. One-time-use disposable sterile stainless steel needles (0,26x50mm) were inserted into acupuncture points.
After insertion, acupuncture needles were manually manipulated to obtain the de qi sensation. The needles remained in place for 20 minutes and there were no further manipulations during the retention time.</description>

    <description>The physiotherapy experimental group received core stability based physiotherapy treatment. Before the beginning of the treatment sessions, the basic principles of core stability exercises were explained to the participants. The exercise programme included 7 exercises. The exercises in the crook lying position were core activation with breathing, single leg lift with knees bent, single leg slides, bridging and knee drop sideways. The exercises completed in side lying included hip external rotation with knees bent and hip abduction with knees straight. After each session gentle stretching of the lower limbs and lumbar spine were performed. The sessions were administered twice a week during 30 minutes with groups of no more than 8 people.</description>
