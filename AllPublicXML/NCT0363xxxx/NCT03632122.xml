  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to use the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS)
      data to gain an understanding of how multiple chronic conditions impact the health outcomes
      of older adults with back pain.

      This study seeks to gain knowledge regarding how multiple chronic conditions affect the
      health and function of older adults with back pain. The investigators will perform a
      retrospective cohort study using secondary analysis of the National Health and Aging Trends
      Study (NHATS) data. NHATS collected longitudinal data on Medicare beneficiaries over 65 for
      six years, from 2011-2017. This set of data is comprehensive and includes self-reported
      survey data as well as physical performance data, both of which this study will utilize.

      The specific aims include to 1) Estimate the longitudinal associations of the number of
      chronic conditions, using a standard classification scheme, with long-term physical
      performance, function, and recurrent falls, 2) Identify specific combinations of chronic
      conditions that are most strongly associated with long-term physical performance, function,
      and recurrent falls, 3) Determine the association of the number and type of chronic
      conditions with rehabilitation service use. The investigator will test a corresponding
      hypothesis for each aim: 1) Medicare beneficiaries reporting back pain with a greater number
      of chronic conditions will have worse physical performance, lower functional status, and be
      more likely to experience recurrent falls over 6 years, 2) Medicare beneficiaries reporting
      back pain with common and potentially modifiable conditions of anxiety, depression, and
      arthritis (individually and combined as dyads or a triad) will have worse physical
      performance, lower functional capacity, and be more likely to experience recurrent falls over
      6 years, 3) Medicare beneficiaries with back pain and multiple chronic conditions will report
      lower use of rehabilitation services in the past one year compared to those with back pain
      alone or one additional chronic condition.

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>NHATS measures physical performance using an in-person physical performance test. The Short Physical Performance Battery, which includes walking 3 meters, balancing activities, and chair stands. Participants are scored from 0 (worst) to 12 (best).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rehabilitation Use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants asked if they had used rehabilitation services over the last year. This is a dichotomous variable of &quot;use&quot; or &quot;no use&quot;. If participants answer that they have used rehabilitation services, they are asked the purpose/conditions for which they received care, the body region for which they received care, setting, duration of services in months and weeks, improvement of treatment and whether they met their treatment goals. These are reported as categorical variables.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>NHATS used survey questions asking about pairs of less or more challenging tasks. This includes walking. The pair of questions corresponding to walking capacity ask participants about their ability to walk 3 and 6 blocks by themselves. Based on their answers participants were put into one of the following categories: unable to do less challenging task able to do less challenging task, able to do less challenging but not more challenging task, able to do the more challenging task. Unable to do less challenging task the least functional capacity and able to do the most challenging task being the highest functional capacity. Higher functional capacity is the better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stair Climbing Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>NHATS used survey questions asking about pairs of less or more challenging tasks. This includes stair climbing. The pair of questions for stairs asks about the ability to go up 10 and 20 stairs. Based on their answers participants were put into one of the following categories: unable to do less challenging task able to do less challenging task, able to do less challenging but not more challenging task, able to do the more challenging task. Unable to do less challenging task the least functional capacity and able to do the most challenging task being the highest functional capacity. Higher functional capacity is the better outcome.</description>

        NHATS is a cohort of older adults and is representative of Medicare beneficiaries age 65
        and older. It is a &quot;unique national resource for the scientific study of functioning in
        later life.&quot; The sample is drawn from the Medicare enrollment files, and the survey
        oversamples Blacks and those at older ages. Initial NHATS data collection began in 2011
        (Round 1) with in-person interviews.
