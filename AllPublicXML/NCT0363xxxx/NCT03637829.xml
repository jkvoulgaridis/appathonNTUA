  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the effects of three chocolate snacks on cognitive performance, subjective
      appetite, food intake control, and glycemic response in normal weight adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On 4 separate mornings, 7 days apart, 12 hours after an overnight fast, and 3 hours after a
      standardized breakfast of a cereal bar, orange juice and fruit cup, participants will consume
      isocaloric snacks of white chocolate, 2 types of dark chocolate or control (water), followed
      by an ad libitum pizza lunch 90 minutes later. Upon arrival, at baseline (0 minutes),
      participants will be asked to complete the motivation-to-eat, global vigor and subjective
      emotion visual analogue scales (VAS), a battery of cognitive performance tasks and have blood
      samples taken, as reported and validated in our previous studies. Over the 90 minute testing
      period, blood samples will be taken,the VAS questions will be completed and cognitive tasks
      will be completed. Cognitive performance assessments will include learning and memory,
      spatial memory, attention and processing speed, and executive functions. VAS measuring
      physical comfort is completed pre- and post-meal. Ad libitum food intake from a test meal
      will be measured.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal declarative memory</measure>
    <time_frame>At 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>One of six word lists composed of 15 words will be audio presented and participants will be asked to write them down. The word list will be presented 3 times and the participant will immediately write down words after each time the word list is presented. This test will take 5 minutes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline spatial memory</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 15, 45, and 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a spatial pattern recognition test on the Membrain Application. There will be a grid of 9 boxes with circles randomly located inside each box. Participants will be asked to remember where circles are located in each box. This test is done 6 times at each time-point, with each test having different random locations of circles. Each test will take 20 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in verbal declarative memory from the 15 minute time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>At 45 and 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to recall and write down all the words from the word list presented at the 15 minute time-point. This test will take 2 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline executive function</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 15, 45, and 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed the Stroop task via the Membrain application. Participants will be presented with a list of words presented in colors that match the word (congruent, the word 'red' presented in red) or colors that do not match the word (incongruent, the word 'red' presented in blue). Participants will be asked to identify the color of the word, not the word itself. The task is scored for the number of correct and incorrect colors identified, as well as total time to completion. This test will be at each time-point and will take 1 minute to complete.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline working memory and executive function</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 15, 45, and 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A random 3 digit number will appear on the screen of the Membrain Application and the participant will have to continually subtract 3 from this number. At each time-point, participants will also complete the same test, except will subtract 7 continuously. This is a 2 minute test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline attention and reaction time</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 15, 45, and 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Membrain Application, Aa continuous string of single digit numbers appear on the screen, one at a time (each appearing for about one second). After seeing three consecutive ascending odd numbers, participants click the 'odd' button. When they see three consecutive, ascending even numbers, they click the 'even' button. When they see the number &quot;1&quot;, they click the 'tertiary' button. This test is 5 minutes in length.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food intake</measure>
    <time_frame>At 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After other measures at the 90 minute time-point, participants will have lunch and food intake will be determined by weighing the meal before and after serving. The net weight of the test meal will be converted to kilocalories</description>
