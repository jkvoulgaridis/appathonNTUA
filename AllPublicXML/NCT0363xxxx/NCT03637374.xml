    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the use of the TAAA Debranching Stent Graft
      System to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate anatomy, as
      measured by device safety, effectiveness, costs of delivery of aortic surgery care, and
      patient quality of life domains. Additionally, the study will assess technical success and
      treatment success at each follow-up interval.

      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the use of the TAAA
      Debranching Stent Graft System to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. While surgery
      remains a standard treatment for complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA), the
      tolerance of some patients to recover from such extensive and invasive open aortic
      reconstructions is poor. Endovascular repair may offer the opportunity to reduce patient risk
      with less invasive approaches, improve quality of life, and serve to reduce the cost burden.
      The primary technical safety endpoint is freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days
      or during hospitalization if this exceeds 30 days. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the
      proportion of study subjects with treatment success at 1 year.

    <description>The TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System is comprised of two investigational devices including the Visceral Manifold and Thoracic Bifurcation and the unitary manifold. The thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold as well as the unitary manifold work to facilitate endovascular stenting of the visceral vessels (renals, celiac, SMA) while maintaining flow to the visceral and infrarenal segments.</description>
