  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study by using 89Zr-labeled KN035 (89Zr-KN035) PET imaging to evaluate
      the biodistribution and target lesion uptake of 89Zr-KN035 in patients with PD-L1 positive
      advanced solid tumors.

      The overall purpose of the study is to evaluate the biodistribution and target lesion uptake
      of 89Zr-KN035 in patients with PD-L1 positive advanced solid tumors by using PET imaging.
      Safety will be observed after 89Zr-KN035 injection, and radiation dosimetry of 89Zr-KN035
      will be calculated.
