  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INDICAPS was the first large scale, multicentre survey launched by the ISCCM. The aim was to
      gather information about ICUs, organizational characteristics, patient casemix, the types and
      severity of illness, monitoring and therapeutic modalities used, types of infections, and
      other such data. This was performed between July 2010 and April 2011 and published in
      2016.[1] Over the last 8 years, there has been a significant difference in the delivery of
      intensive care services, critical care education, socioeconomic indicators, antibiotic
      resistance patterns and other aspects of practices in Indian ICUs. It is therefore necessary
      to revisit and resurvey the current trends in intensive care practices in India, and to
      reflect the vast spectrum of critical care illness, services and practices.

      Similar to INDICAPS, which was a point-prevalence study of all patients present in the ICU on
      four different days over a one-year period, INDICAPS II will record data of all patients
      admitted to the ICU on 4 different days.

      INDICAPS II will record data of all patients admitted to the ICU on 4 different days (August
      23, 2018; October 25, 2018; December 13, 2018; April 11, 2019) in a cross-sectional design.
      Data collection includes:

        1. On admission: demographic characteristics, comorbidities, source of admission, primary
           and secondary admission diagnoses,

        2. Baseline data (on the study day), including parameters used to calculate SAPS II score
           and SOFA score and infections,

        3. Information on monitoring modalities, mechanical ventilation, nutrition, fluid therapy,
           other routine ICU practices

      c. Outcome at ICU and hospital discharge d. Organisation of ICU services
