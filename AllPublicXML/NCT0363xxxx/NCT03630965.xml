      Video or No Video to decrease HCPOA/LAR anxiety and increase knowledge as it pertains to CPR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Designated surrogate decision makers of 30 medical intensive care unit patients will be
      consented and enrolled to receive either a video describing CPR and it's outcomes after
      standard of care code discussions versus standard of care code discussions alone. All
      participants will complete a short questionnaire to determine their knowledge level regarding
      CPR and to assess their anxiety levels. Patients who view the video will also rate their
      comfort level while watching the video on a 5 point Likert scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure the impact of CPR video on the Surrogate's level of anxiety during the decision-making process on code status, in the ICU compared to the control group of surrogates (No intervention group).</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>30 surrogates in the ICU (15 in the intervention group and 15 in the No intervention group) will be administered the validated Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), to measure the surrogates' anxiety level . The HAM-A questionnaire has been validated to assess for anxiety, and classify anxiety.
The Score in HAM-A is on a scale of 0 to 56 total score, when it is less than 17 there is no anxiety or mild; 18-24 is mild to moderate; 25-30 is moderate to severe; and 30-56 is severe anxiety.
The HAM-A questionnaire has been validated to assess change in anxiety after an intervention or treatment, with a delta in total score of 8 with a Standard deviation of 1.7.</description>

    <measure>Measure the impact of CPR video on patients' surrogate's knowledge about CPR, when compared to the No intervention group.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge assessment will be performed with a 5 questions (1 point each) questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analyze the surrogates' comfort when watching the video.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate in the intervention group will be asked if he or she if feeling comfortable watching the video. This will be a single question that will be answered using a Likert Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Describe if the CPR video's impact on surrogates' anxiety level, is affected by the patient's severity of illness as per the SOFA score.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will calculate patients' SOFA score which is the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. It is used to grade patients' severity of organs dysfunction and mortality. The SOFA Score is on a scale of 0-24, with higher numbers correlating with higher organs dysfunction and mortality.</description>
