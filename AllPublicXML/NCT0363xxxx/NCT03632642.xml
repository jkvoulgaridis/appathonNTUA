      There is theroretical superiority with benzylpenicillin over orther anti-staphylococcal
      penicillins (ASP) for treatment of penicillin susceptible S. aureus (PSSA) infections due to
      a lower MIC distribution when compared with ASPs active against PSSA, combined with the
      ability to obtain higher levels of free non-protein-bound plasma drug concentrations.
      Although the data to support this theoretical advantage is limited, many clinicians in
      Australia (and worldwide) use benzylpenicillin for therapy in this situation despite many
      international guidelines cautioning against this. This uncertainty is significant given that
      1) S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is associated with a high mortality and significant morbidity,
      2) S. aureus is one of the most common organisms isolated from blood cultures, 3) SAB is the
      most common reason for consultation with an Infectious Disease specialist (which itself has
      been shown to improve outcomes) and 4) a significant proportion (up to 20%) of SAB isolates
      in Australia will be reported as susceptible to penicillin, a proportion which appears to be
      increasing over the past 10 years in Australia and internationally.

      Given the frequency of PSSA and the associated morbidity and mortality related to SABs in
      general, a definitive study to determine the optimal therapy for PSSA is required. In a
      recent survey of Infectious Diseases Physicians and Clinical Microbiologists in Australasia,
      87% of respondents were willing to randomise patients to either benzylpenicillin or
      flucloxacillin for a clinical trial, whist 71% responded that they would switch therapy from
      flucloxacillin to benzylpenicillin for treatment of PSSA BSIs in clinical practice
      (unpublished data).

      Therefore, the investigators see the opportunity to determine the feasibility of a definitive
      study comparing benzylpenicillin against flucloxacillin (or other ASP) for treatment of PSSA
      bloodstream infections.

    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:

      Resistance to penicillin was discovered in Staphylococcus aureus in the mid-1940s, soon after
      the introduction of penicillin as a therapeutic agent into clinical practice. The emergence
      of penicillin resistant S. aureus (PRSA) was widely encountered in hospitals thereafter, with
      some reports finding rates of PRSA rising from 14% to 38% in less than 1 year. Two mechanisms
      are known that result in resistance to penicillin in staphylococci. The most common, and
      earliest described, was by the production of a serine β-lactamase, known as penicillinase
      (PC1), which hydrolyses the β-lactam ring resulting in the production of penicilloic acid. A
      second mechanism leads to resistance to penicillin and other beta-lactam agents by production
      of penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a, encoded by mecA. Following the emergence of PRSA, a new
      class of anti-staphylococcal penicillins were developed that were resistant to hydrolysis of
      the beta-lactam ring by penicillinase. The isoxazolyl-penicillins, semi-synthetic penicillin
      derivatives that are stable during exposure to penicillinase, are now the most commonly used
      agents for the treatment of S. aureus infections.

      Despite widespread resistance to penicillin amongst S. aureus, a significant proportion of
      invasive isolates remain susceptible. Although penicillin and isoxazolyl-penicillins have
      been used in clinical practice for more than 50 years, the optimal therapy for patients with
      invasive penicillin susceptible S. aureus (PSSA) remains controversial. Methicillin
      susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bloodstream infections are commonly sub-divided into categories
      based upon the presence of penicillinase, the absence of which defines PSSA strains. Many
      clinicians advocate treating both MSSA and PSSA the same, irrespective of whether
      penicillinase is detected or not. One group who strongly supports this view is the American
      Heart Association, which has published recently updated guidelines on infective endocarditis.
      This recommendation is based upon literature suggesting that detection of penicillinase is
      not reliable in some clinical laboratories. Multiple publications have demonstrated that the
      previous widely used phenotypic method of penicillinase detection, by nitrocefin hydrolysis,
      lacks adequate sensitivity for detecting penicillinase. Yet, treatment failure with
      penicillin due to inability to detect penicillinase has not been previously described in the
      medical literature to our knowledge. Regardless, many laboratories have now changed methods
      to the penicillin disc test, where isolates harbouring penicillinase may be detected by
      interrogation of the edge of the disc, with a sharp edge confirming the presence of
      penicillinase and a tapered edge indicating an absence. This method is now employed in most
      Pathology services and is the method approved by international governance organisations.

      Other experts argue for potential superiority with penicillin due to a lower MIC distribution
      when compared with other beta-lactam agents active against S. aureus, combined with the
      ability to obtain high levels of free non-protein-bound plasma drug concentrations.

      To date there is only one previous study that has directly compared the outcome between a
      semi-synthetic penicillin derivative (dicloxacillin) and penicillin for PSSA infections. In
      this retrospective study, no statistically significant difference was observed between
      penicillin and dicloxacillin based on a mortality outcome. Although this study does not
      support improved outcome with penicillin compared with dicloxacillin, it should be noted that
      significantly more patients treated with penicillin had a higher Pitt bacteraemia score and
      deep-seated infection such as endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Data from the ANZCOSS study, a
      prospective observational study of SAB within Australia between 2007 - 2016, demonstrated a
      possible 30-day crude mortality benefit for patients treated with benzylpenicillin compared
      to flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin (unpublished data). Patients in this cohort were treated
      2:1 with flucloxacillin over benzylpenicillin, however, benzylpenicillin treatment was
      proportionally higher in patients with endocarditis or other deep-seated infections. In a
      multivariate logistic regression model, Flucloxacillin therapy was associated with a
      non-statistically significant increase in the odds ratio for 30-day mortality (OR 1.55, 95%
      CI 0.99 - 2.47).

      A number of recent studies internationally have reported a resurgence of PSSA, and in
      particular within the Australian setting, it was noted that 20% of S. aureus bacteraemias
      (SAB) were found to be susceptible to penicillin in 2013. Given the resurgence of PSSA and
      the associated morbidity and mortality related to SABs in general, a definitive study to
      determine the optimal therapy for PSSA is required.

      A pilot randomised controlled trial is critical to determining the feasibility for a
      definitive study due to PSSA BSIs and in order to calculate an appropriate sample size based
      upon the proportion of deep-seated infections. A definitive trial would greatly enhance the
      medical literature and help to define the optimum treatment which for both penicillin
      susceptible and penicillin non-susceptible MSSA in invasive infections, at present, remains
      unclear.

      Objectives and hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesise that penicillin is superior to flucloxacillin for treatment of
      penicillin susceptible S. aureus bloodstream infections based upon a lower distribution of
      MICs for penicillin, a higher level of free non-protein-bound drug concentration and
      favourable side effect profile.

      Primary objective:

      1. To determine feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of penicillin versus
      flucloxacillin for definitive management of penicillin susceptible S. aureus bacteraemia

      Secondary objective:

        1. To assist in calculating an appropriate sample size for a definitive study

        2. To determine the proportion of deep-seated infections

        3. To determine the feasibility of desirability of outcome rankings (DOOR) as a clinical
           endpoint

      Study design:

      The study will be a pilot open-label multicentre randomised trial that is
      investigator-initiated comparing two drug regimens: benzylpenicillin vs. flucloxacillin for
      penicillin susceptible S. aureus bloodstream infections. The investigators will aim to enroll
      60 patients over a 24-month period. The participation duration for each enrolled patient is
      90 days. Data will be collected for the participants from the date of when the first positive
      blood culture was obtained, which will be within 72 hours of enrolment.

      Consented patients will be randomised on day 1 (the day of randomisation) to either
      benzylpenicillin or flucloxacillin. Data will be obtained from the medical records
      (electronic or paper) of each participant. Data collected will include relevant
      investigations (FBC, ELFT, blood culture results, and CRP), any SAE that have occurred,
      antibiotics administered and evidence of relapse or treatment failure. Participants who are
      discharged will be followed weekly in outpatients for the duration of intravenous therapy.
      Participants will be reviewed at day 90 in outpatient clinic if they have been discharged (or
      within 1-2 weeks thereafter). For participants who do not attend the outpatients clinic,
      contact will be made by telephone. If attempts at contact are unsuccessful, then the site
      investigator will review the medical records of the participants at 6-month time intervals
      until either the vital status has been completed or the study period is complete.

      Intervention Participants will be randomised to either benzylpencillin or flucloxacillin.
      Dosage, frequency and duration of antibiotics will be determined by the treating clinician
      based upon national guidelines, eTG (Therapeutic Guidelines 15th Edition) as summarised
      below.

      The study drug will be administered for a minimum of 2 weeks (the minimal currently accepted
      duration of IV therapy for SAB.) Participants treated for 2 weeks will have to meet the
      following criteria:

        -  Negative BC at 48-72 hours from first effective antibiotics

        -  Rapid resolution of fever

        -  Normal valvular morphology and no evidence of valvular lesions on TTE or TOE

        -  An identifiable source of infection that has been removed, including drainage of simple
           skin infections

        -  No evidence of metastatic focus

        -  No intravascular prosthetic material

        -  No significant immunocompromise including any congenital or acquired quantitative or
           qualitative deficiency of phagocytic cells, complement, or humoral or cell-mediated
           immunity. This includes:

             -  Stem cell or organ transplant recipient

             -  Absolute neutrophil count less than 500/μl

             -  HIV

             -  Prednisolone &gt; 25mg/kg/day for 1 month or cumulative dose &gt; 700mg within 3 months
                of onset of SAB

             -  Use of a monoclonal antibody within 1 month of SAB onset For participants who do
                not fulfil these criteria, the duration of treatment will be 4 to 6 weeks and will
                be made by the treating clinician.

      Other antimicrobials active against S. aureus will be discouraged during the duration of IV
      therapy:

      Any missed doses of antibiotics will be recorded on the CRF. In order to ensure equivalence
      amongst the sites, TDM will not be employed during the study for the purpose of tailored
      antibiotic dosing. Therefore, to ensure participants are treated optimally, dosing will be
      based upon standard uncomplicated BSIs or critical illness/deep-seated infection and dosed as
      per eTG. Participants who were initially stratified as uncomplicated BSI may be changed to
      deep-seated or critical illness if the participants fulfil the criteria after enrolment.

      For participants with obesity or renal impairment, dosing may follow local guidelines. All
      outpatient therapy will be administered by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV). CIV will be
      discouraged for inpatients, however, if the treating clinician considers this to be
      necessary, then it will be allowed and recorded in the CRF. Non-antibiotic related management
      of the participants will be at the discretion of the treating clinician.

      Dosing in renal impairment:

      Flucloxacillin

        -  Standard Dose: 2g Q6H (8g/24 hours CIV if home IV therapy)

        -  Critical Illness or Deep-seated infection: 2g Q4H (12g/24 hours CIV if home IV therapy)

        -  CrCl &lt;50 ml/min and &gt; 10 ml/min: No change to dose

        -  CrCl &lt;10 ml/min or on haemodialysis: 50% reduction of dose

        -  On continuous renal replacement therapy: 2g Q6H

      Benzylpenicillin

        -  Standard Dose: 1.8g Q4H (10.8g/24 hours CIV if home IV therapy)

        -  Critical Illness or Deep-seated infection: 2.4g Q4H (14.4g/24 hours CIV if home IV
           therapy)

        -  CrCl &lt;50 ml/min and &gt; 10 ml/min: 25% reduction of dose

        -  CrCl &lt;10 ml/min or on haemodialysis: 50% reduction of dose

        -  On continuous renal replacement therapy:1.8g Q4H

      Change of therapy:

      Any change to the intervention drug will be discouraged, but left to the discretion of the
      treating clinician. If an intervention drug needs to be changed (such as due to an adverse
      event ie. rash) during the intravenous phase of therapy, then this will be a protocol
      violation. The participant will still remain in the study and be analysed to the group they
      were randomised, but will be excluded from the per-protocol analysis if the change occurred
      within the first two weeks from enrolment.

      Use of antibiotics with activity against S. aureus after randomisation:

      The use of any other antibiotic with activity against S. aureus after randomisation will be
      discouraged during the intravenous phase of the trial. If a participant requires additional
      antibiotics due to an indication for broadening antibiotic therapy, the PI should recommend
      an agent without useful activity towards S. aureus (such as gentamicin, ceftazidime or
      aztreonam). If a patient receives an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus during the
      first two weeks of the intravenous phase of the study, this will be recorded as a protocol
      violation. The participant will still remain in the study and be analysed to the group they
      were randomised, but will be excluded from the per-protocol analysis. If the participant
      receives anti-staphylococcal therapy after the first two weeks from enrolment and is still on
      intravenous therapy with the study drug, they will be included in the per-protocol
      population. For patients that have completed their intravenous therapy phase of the study but
      have an indication for ongoing oral therapy, any oral antibiotic may be prescribed and will
      be recorded in the CRF. The choice of antibiotic and indication for oral therapy is at the
      discretion of the treating clinician or PI.

      Strategies to improve adherence to protocol:

      All site PIs will be trained in the study protocol, SOPs and their reporting requirements by
      the project manager, a study chief investigator or delegate, prior to the site being opened
      for recruitment. All site PIs will complete a computer-based training course in Good Clinical
      Practice.

      A sticker will be placed in the patient's medical record (one on the progress notes on the
      day of randomisation, and one in the front inside cover of the medical record if one exists).
      This sticker will alert clinicians that the patient has been randomised to the PANFLUTE
      study, with a brief explanation of the study, and confirmation that the participant (or the
      person responsible) has provided written informed consent.

      A copy of the study synopsis will be placed in the bedside chart (observations and drug
      chart) of the patient. A checklist of study procedures will also be placed in the bedside
      chart. For sites with electronic medical records and/or prescribing, an electronic &quot;sticker&quot;
      will be used, and appropriate annotations will be made to the electronic drug chart.

      The medication chart (be it paper or electronic) will be checked regularly by the site PI or
      their delegate (registrar or research nurse) whilst the participant is an inpatient to ensure
      adherence to the study protocol.

      Sample Size:

      Recruitment will be from any adult patient admitted to the study site hospital with a
      bloodstream infection due to PSSA. Based upon previous retrospective case-control studies,
      the mortality from S. aureus BSI ranges from 10-30%. A sample size of 60 was chosen based
      upon feasibility of recruiting participants within the time frame for this pilot study from a
      total of 8 sites.

      Assignment of Intervention:

      Participants will be randomised to either of the two arms in a 1:1 ratio using a web based
      interactive randomisation system. Randomisation will be stratified by site. The randomised
      sequence allocation will be held on a secure server and not accessible by any investigators
      of members of study staff. The person enrolling the patient will, following obtaining written
      informed consent, obtain the treatment allocation by logging onto the web-based database and
      will then assign the allocated treatment to the patient. As the study will be an open-label
      design, the site investigators will not be blinded to the intervention, however, the
      investigators assessing the primary outcome will be.

      Outcome Measurement:

      This study aims to determine the feasibility of Desirability of Outcome Ranking (DOOR) as a
      novel outcome method for outcome analysis in clinical trials. Participants are classified
      according to outcomes by using ordinal categories with the aim to evaluate if an intervention
      is superior to standard care strategy. This approach takes into account a risk/benefit
      assessment by including participant centered outcomes such as treatment failure, adverse
      events and complications of the disease process.

      Participants will be ranked according to the following stratification:

        1. Alive, Treatment failure or Infectious complication - No, Grade 2 or greater AE - No

        2. Alive, Treatment failure or Infectious complication - No, Grade 2 or greater AE - Yes

        3. Alive, Treatment failure or Infectious complication - Yes, Grade 2 or greater AE - No

        4. Alive, Treatment failure or Infectious complication - Yes, Grade 2 or greater AE - Yes

      Endpoint Assessment:

      The primary endpoint will be assessed by a blinded adjudication committee in order to rank
      participants according to the DOOR outcomes. This committee will include 2 independent
      Infectious Diseases Physicians appointed by the trial management committee. The information
      provided to the committee will not include any participant identifiers or any antibiotic
      details. The data provided will include:

        1. Demographic details (such as age and sex)

        2. Comorbidities

        3. Clinical details (including focus of infection and relevant investigation results)

        4. Date and result of all blood cultures taken during days 1-90

        5. Date and result of all other available clinical cultures taken from days 1-90 (e.g.,
           cultures of aspirated pleural fluid or pus).

        6. Any adverse events recorded

        7. Vital status at day 90 and date of death if applicable.

      Additional information will be provided to the adjudication committee providing it does not
      contain antibiotic data or patient identifiers. Each of the committee members will
      independently rank participants according to DOOR outcomes. If there is discrepancy between
      the assessments, the committee will refer to a third independent assessor and the majority
      will determine the rankings.

      Discontinuation/withdrawal of participants from trial treatment:

      The participants or NOK have the right to choose to withdraw from the study at any time and
      the investigator may discontinue a participant from the study or from treatment if deemed
      appropriate at any time. Reasons why a participant may be withdrawn from the study include,
      but are not limited to, participant or person responsible request, primary treating
      clinician's request, participant was enrolled and is ineligible (either arising during the
      study or was overlooked at time of screening and enrolment). Participants will not be
      withdrawn due to adverse events, unless the adverse event is life threatening. The decision
      to withdraw a participant from the study must be discussed with the coordinating
      investigators.

      If the participant or person responsible withdraws consent from participating in the study
      and also withdraws consent for collection of future information, no further evaluations will
      be performed, and no additional data will be collected. The sponsors may retain and continue
      to use any data or samples collected before such withdrawal of consent. Participants that
      abscond will continue to be followed, if possible, until the end of the trial to avoid
      missing data. Participants withdrawn from the treatment by the treating clinicians will
      continue to be followed up to the end of the trial to avoid missing data and will be used in
      the intention-to-treat analysis. Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. If a
      participant is withdrawn the reason will be recorded in the database.

      Statistical Analysis Plan:

      Data for this study will be reported as per CONSORT guidelines. All-cause mortality will be
      represented in a Kaplan-Meier graph. The primary analysis will be performed by a modified
      intention to treat principle, whereby all participants with data available for the endpoint
      will be assessed. A per-protocol analysis will also be performed, whereby participants in
      this population will have to have received at least 2 weeks of the intravenous phase of the
      study drug and 90 day outcome data.

      A summary of baseline participant characteristics with totals and proportions (%) for
      categorical variables, and minimum, maximum, inter-quartile ranges and standard deviations
      for continuous variables will be presented. For assessment of the primary outcome, 2
      independent clinicians, blinded to the therapy given to each participant, will assess all
      participants and rank each participant's outcome according to the pre-designed DOOR groups.
      The probability that a randomly selected patient will have a better DOOR if assigned to the
      benzylpenicillin arm vs. the flucloxacillin arm will be estimated along with a confidence
      interval. If there is no difference in DOOR distributions between the 2 arms, then the
      probability will be near 50%.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a pilot open-label multicentre randomised trial that is investigator-initiated comparing two drug regimens: benzylpenicillin vs. flucloxacillin for penicillin susceptible S. aureus bloodstream infections. We will aim to enrol 60 patients (30 in each arm) over a 12-month period. The participation duration for each enrolled patient is 90 days. Data will be collected for the participants from the date of when the first positive blood culture was obtained, which will be within 72 hours of enrollment. Consented patients will be randomised on day 1 (the day of randomisation) to either benzylpenicillin or flucloxacillin.</intervention_model_description>
