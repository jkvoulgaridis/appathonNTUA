      This study is a non-randomized, observational, non-comparative prospective study to evaluate
      the safety, efficacy and performance of the LMA Supreme laryngeal mask airway when used
      according to the device's Instructions for Use. During surgery, standard treatment will be
      applied, complemented with the recording of study parameters related to safety, efficacy and
      performance of the LMA Supreme laryngeal mask airway.

    <description>Outcome being measured intraoperatively is the ease of manual ventilation via the LMA Supreme. Measuring, no air leaks, air leak / elevated airway pressure needed for adequate ventilation, removal and reinsertion needed to achieve adequate ventilation, no ventilation after 2 attempts (airway managed using alternative techniques</description>

    <description>Outcome being measured preoperatively and at 4 weeks +/- 5 days is the Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Short Questionnaire. Measuring the ability to swallow (any difficulty in swallowing), incorrect swallowing (any coughing associated with swallowing), lump feeling (any lumps in the throat), involuntary loss of weight (any weight loss recently), Pneumonia (any bouts with pneumonia).</description>

    <description>An appropriately sized LMA Supreme will be prepared by removing all air from the cuff while applying manual pressure. A water soluble non-local anesthetic containing lubricant gel will be applied to the fully deflated airway before insertion. A 1 cm column of the gel will be preloaded into the gastric port of the LMA Supreme for the Gel Test.
The cuff will be inflated with a manometer to a pressure of approximately 30cm H2O. If a significant leak is detected, the cuff will be inflated in increments of 5cm H2O until a satisfactory seal is obtained. The final cuff pressure will be recorded. The lungs will then be gently inflated by applying manual pressure to the anesthesia circuit bag while observing the gel column in the LMA Supreme gastric port for movement.</description>
