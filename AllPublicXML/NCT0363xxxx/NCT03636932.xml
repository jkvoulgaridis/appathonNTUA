  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a known risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality.

      In CKD, decline of renal function results in the accumulation of uremic toxins in blood and
      tissue, such as Indoxyl Sulfate (IS). IS plasma level is predictive of mortality and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with CKD have increased oxidative stress and
      circulating tissue factor (TF) levels. In vitro, IS induces an inflammatory, pro-oxidative
      and pro-coagulant phenotype on endothelial cells and activates TF. N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
      protects endothelial cells from the effects of IS. NAC reduces oxidative stress and
      production of activated TF. A prospective study evaluating an oral NAC treatment versus
      placebo in chronic hemodialysis patients showed a better cardiovascular outcome but the
      physiopathology was unclear.

      The hypothesis is that NAC reduces cardiovascular risk by its effect on uremic toxin-induced
      pro-coagulant TF production.

      The primary objective is to compare the effect of NAC intravenously administered at each
      dialysis session (2gram on 3 dialysis sessions per week) to placebo on circulating TF levels
      in patients with CKD on chronic hemodialysis after 4 weeks of treatment. The objective is to
      show a 33% decrease in circulating tissue factor (TF) levels in the NAC group compared to the
      control group.

      It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial that includes chronic
      hemodialysis patients from La Conception Hospital (AP-HM) in Marseilles, France. This is an
      interventional biomedical research project.

      20 patients will be included in each group and will receive during 4 weeks intravenous
      injection.

      This study will give a pathophysiological rationale for the use of NAC to reduce thrombotic
      and cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD. This step will provide the rationale for a
      clinical trial to reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events with IV NAC in
      hemodialysis (HD) patients.
