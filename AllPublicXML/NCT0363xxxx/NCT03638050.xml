      Background: The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is widely used as an instrument for assessing the
      functional capacity of cardiac patients. It's a simple, low cost test that better reflects
      day-to-day activities when compared to other tests. Its use to evaluate the functional
      capacity of cardiac patients in the in-hospital phase after acute myocardial infarction
      requires further studies. Objective: To evaluate the safety of the 6MWT performed on the
      third day after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: It's a cross-sectional study, to
      be accomplished in Hospital São Paulo - Federal University of Sao Paulo. Individuals, of both
      genders, aged 18 years and over, will be assessed on the third day after acute myocardial
      infarction. The 6MWT will be performed according to the norms of the American Thoracic
      Society. The distance covered during the 6MWT will be measured as weel as adverse events.
