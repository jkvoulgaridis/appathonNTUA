  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients usually have difficulties with moving and are venerable to secondary problems
      such as sarcopenia and strength loss. These problems may accelerate the disability process
      during aging. It is well known that exercise helps to maintain or promote human fitness. This
      study is conducted to explore the beneficial effects of exercise and protein supplement on
      fitness and body composition among patients with chronic stroke.

      This is a multicenter randomized control trial. Participants will be recruited from 4
      teaching hospitals in Taipei. Participants are randomly assigned to 2 groups:

        1. protein supplementation + exercise (PRO group);

        2. carbohydrate supplementation + exercise (CHO group);

      The 1-hour exercise intervention includes aerobic cycling exercise followed by progressive
      resisted exercise with TheraBand. PRO group receives PS immediately before and after the
      exercise while the CHO group receive sham product (the same calories with no protein). The
      Interventions are arranged 3 sessions a week for 10 weeks. The outcome measurements are
      performed at 0-week, 10-week, and 20-week.
