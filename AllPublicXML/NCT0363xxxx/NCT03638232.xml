  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of an oral treatment regimen in ambulatory practice, certain uses in connection with
      drug consumption associated could alter treatment outcomes observed in randomized clinical
      trials.

      The increase in progression-free survival in myeloma may be accompanied by an impaired
      quality of life and a resurgence of pain symptoms over time, which could potentially lead to
      medication overuse involving painkillers but also psychotropic drugs. These combined
      consumption may affect survival through mechanisms of pharmacological or non-pharmacological
      interactions.

      As part of this project, we wish to explore the scheme of adherence to myeloma drugs, and
      thus validate the decision diagram of hypothesis of not adequate of drug use in ambulatory
      conditions, from observational data. This discrepancy could result from poor adherence or
      suboptimal drug use but also from concomitant exposures to other drugs which may interact
      with myeloma. Before considering a study of greater magnitude that could address the
      consequences of non optimal drug use on clinical response criteria, such as duration of
      response or survival, it seems appropriate to confirm these assumptions within ' an
      exploratory study.

    <description>The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) measure compliance of prescriber with official recommendations and the one for the patient in relation to the prescription by evaluating the difference between the quantities delivered and the theoretical quantities calculated in joining recommended intake scheme. It is estimated by the ratio of number of defined daily doses delivered over a given period and the number of theoretical defined daily doses if maximum observance</description>
