  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use an Ommaya reservoir that drains into brain metastases to deliver
      activated, autolous dendritic cells to the tumor lesion, for patients who are 18 - 75 years
      old who have brain metastases from either lung cancer or breast cancer. The primary objective
      of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering DCVax-Direct to
      patients with metastatic tumors in the brain. The secondary objectives are to determine tumor
      response, the rate of intracranial recurrence (IR), the rate of neurologic deaths, decline in
      neuro-cognitive functioning and overall survival. Approximately 10 patients with injectable
      metastatic brain tumors will be enrolled initially in a dose escalation scheme, with the
      expectation to enroll a total of 24 patients.

          4. Pathologically confirmed metastatic breast or non-small cell lung cancer

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2

          6. Adequate bone marrow function, as indicated by the following:

          7. Adequate renal function

          8. Adequate liver function

          9. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

         10. Negative serum pregnancy test done ≤7 days prior to registration, for women of
             childbearing potential only.

         11. Determined prior to enrollment: sufficient number of doses of DCVax-Direct
             manufactured to complete 7 injections. A second leukapheresis is allowed to meet this
             requirement if necessary.

         12. Unequivocal evidence of newly diagnosed untreated brain metastases and/or progressive
             brain metastases after previous whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), currently
