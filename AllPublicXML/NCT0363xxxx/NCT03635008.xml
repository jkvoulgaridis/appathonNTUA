  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb recovery is not predicted by the initial severity of paralysis and the parameters
      reflecting the integrity of the corticospinal tract (e.g. motor evoked potential, fractional
      anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging). Although the inhibition of the contralesional
      hemisphere is known to be beneficial for the upper limb recovery after stroke in previous
      studies, this is not proven in the severely paralyzed upper limb. And the studies using the
      noninvasive stimulation in subacute stroke is lack. In addition, the role of contralesional
      (unaffected) hemisphere is known to be playing the important role in severe stroke.

      In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled studies, the patients with subacute stroke
      (&lt;3 months after stroke onset), severe paralysis of the upper limb with poor prognosis (poor
      motor score and no response of motor evoked potential recorded in the extensor carpi radialis
      muscle) will be recruited. Interventional group will receive the 25 mins of anodal
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the contralesional premotor area plus 25
      mins of robotic arm training per session for 10 sessions in 2 weeks. Control group will
      receive the same treatment except for sham tDCS instead of anodal tDCS over the
      contralesional premotor area. Functional outcome will be measured before and after the
      intervention (baseline, immediately after the intervention and 1 month after the
      intervention). Cortical activation pattern will be measured by the electroencephalography
      (EEG) at baseline and immediately after the intervention.

    <description>This group will receive the 25 mins of the tDCS (Yrain, Korea) over the contralesional premotor area simultaneously with 25 mins of the robotic arm training using Armeo Power (Hocoma, Switzerland), per day. Additional 30 mins of occupational therapy focusing on the arm motor recovery will be provided per day. These interventions will be provided for 10 weekdays. Other conventional rehabilitation (e.g. gait training, speech therapy) will be permitted.
Regard to the anodal tDCS, the anode will be placed over the contralesional premotor area (2.5 cm anterior to the C3 or C4 in 10-20 EEG system) and cathode will be placed over the contralateral supraorbital area. The stimulation intensity will be 2mA.</description>
