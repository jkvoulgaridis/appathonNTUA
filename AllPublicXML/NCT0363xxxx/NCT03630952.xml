  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different
      levels of conbercept intravitreal (IVT) injection as compared to the approved vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist active control, aflibercept intravitreal
      injection (2.0 mg/eye, Eylea®), in subjects with neovascular AMD.

      A multicenter, multinational, double-masked, parallel-group, dose-ranging, active-controlled,
      randomized trial, which will randomize approximately 1140 subjects in a ratio of 1:1:1 to
      receive IVT injections of 0.5 mg conbercept, 1.0 mg conbercept, or 2.0 mg aflibercept. The
      trial includes a screening period of less than or equal to 14 days, followed by a treatment
      period of 92 weeks (last assessment at 96 weeks) with primary efficacy analysis at 36 weeks.
