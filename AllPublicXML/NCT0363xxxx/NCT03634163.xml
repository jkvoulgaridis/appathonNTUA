  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a Compassionate Communities-based intervention aimed at reducing
      social isolation by mobilizing individuals to act on their health and social needs
      individually, and in collaboration with fellow members of their community. The intervention
      program includes facilitated building of neighbourhood networks (member benefits include
      access to practical help, the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships, and community
      mobilization), and coaching support to work on individualized goal setting and more detailed
      navigation support and planning.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Compassionate Communities intervention is catalyzed by professional facilitators who
      visit communities with high concentrations of elderly and vulnerable residents, and recruit
      those who are interested in a project to identify their own health and social needs, assets
      and priorities; to collectively work to support each other in achieving these; and to
      implement a neighbourhood exchange to more easily match offers of help to people who need
      help. The mobilization work starts with the facilitator, who is employed by a community or
      social service organization, but increasingly draws on the energies of the mobilized initial
      participants as volunteers who conduct further community outreach in their community,
      attracting and mobilizing other residents, peers, and neighbouring resources in the work.
      Participants also plan and implement a broad range of activities identified by the residents
      as their priorities for neighbourhood building. Participants and their caregivers have the
      option of receiving more in-depth 1:1 coaching support to work on individualized goal
      setting, more detailed navigation support or advanced care planning following the sessions.

The total SPS-10 score is formed by the summation of raw scores, with high score indicating a higher degree of social provisions (maximum score of 40)</description>
