    <textblock>
      This study establishes the safety and efficacy of vit A supplementation doses (3000 and 6000
      IU/d) over 8 weeks in children with SCD-SS, ages 9 and older and test the impact of vit A
      supplementation on key functional and clinical outcomes. Additionally, vitamin A status is
      assessed in healthy children ages 9 and older to compare to subjects with SCD-SS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suboptimal vitamin A (vit A) status is prevalent in children with type SS sickle cell disease
      (SCD-SS) and associated with hospitalizations and poor growth and hematological status.
      Preliminary data in children with SCD-SS show that vit A supplementation at the dose
      recommended for healthy children failed to improve vit A status, resulting in no change in
      hospitalizations, growth or dark adaptation. This indicates an increased vit A requirement
      most likely due to chronic inflammation, low vit A intake and possible stool or urine loss.
      The dose of vit A needed to optimize vit A status in subjects with SCD-SS is unknown.
