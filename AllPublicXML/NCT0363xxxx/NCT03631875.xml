  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Large doses of propofol needed for induction and laryngeal mask (LM) insertion in
      children may be associated with hemodynamic sides effects. Co-induction with low doses of
      ketamine 0.5 mg/ kg has the advantage of reducing dose and therefore maintaining hemodynamic
      stability.

      Aim: To examine the effect of co-induction on LM insertion, hemodynamics and recovery in
      children

      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted including120 ASA
      physical status I ‚ÅÑ II unpremedicated children, aged 1-8 years. Inhalatory induction with
      sevoflurane at 7% to insert an intravenous canula was first used then decreased to 2%. Normal
      saline or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) were administered in groups P (propofol), PK
      (propofol-ketamine) respectively, 1 min prior to the administration of the induction dose of
      propofol. Propofol 3mg/kg was used for induction in the 2 groups, LM inserted 60 s later and
      insertion conditions assessed. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded immediately after
      propofol bolus, then after LM insertion, at the 3rd ,5th and 10th minutes later. Recovery was
      assessed using Steward's Score

    <intervention_model_description>After inhalatory induction with sevoflurane7%until abolition of the eye lash reflex, an intravenous canula was inserted in the dorsum of the hand. The sevoflurane concentration was then decreased to 2% in 100% O2.A nurse not involved in the study prepared two syringes with ketamine or normal saline, and administrated it according randomization , one minute before induction with propofol. The administration of propofol was realized on 60 seconds. An experimented anesthesiologist evaluated the LM conditions insertion. When the jaw was relaxed, and deglutition and cough reflex and member movement were absent, the conditions were considered acceptable. The LM was then inserted. For analgesia,we proceeded by a locoregional bloc adapted to the surgery. We recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HR and SpO2 at the induction time at LM insertion and at the 3rd,5th and10th min.</intervention_model_description>
