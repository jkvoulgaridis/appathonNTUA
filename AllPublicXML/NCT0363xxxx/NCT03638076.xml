      Un-randomized, open Multiple-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Antiviral Activity, and
      pharmacokinetics of Morphothiadine Mesilate Capsules/Ritonavir Tablets in Patients with
      Chronic Hepatitis B

      20 subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B will be enrolled. 10 subjects will be assigned to group
      A and receive Morphothiadine Mesilate Capsule 120mg and Ritonavir Tablet 100mg twice daily
      for 48 weeks. 10 subjects will be assigned to group B and receive Morphothiadine Mesilate
      Capsule 120mg and Ritonavir Tablet 100mg three times daily for 48 weeks.
