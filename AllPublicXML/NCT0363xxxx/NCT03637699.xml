  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive psychology (PP) uses targeted activities to increase the frequency and intensity of
      positive emotional experiences such as positive affect. Examples of PP activities include
      recalling positive life events and performing acts of kindness. This pilot study will examine
      the tolerability and efficacy of a PP training program to increase positive affect in
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In the intervention phase, subjects randomized to the
      intervention group will complete five weeks of PP exercises, one exercise per week. Subjects
      will also have weekly calls with the study trainer. The control group will have no study
      activities. In the extension phase, subjects in the control group will complete PP training
      as described above. The investigators will examine the tolerability of the program by
      calculating the proportion of subjects who complete the program. The investigators will also
      examine exercise-specific ratings of ease and utility to measure the acceptability of each
      exercise. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of PP training by comparing
      subjects in the intervention and control groups on measures of positive affect, emotional
      function, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-reported functional activities such
      as work. If successful, this study will advance the use of PP as a low cost, innovative and
      effective tool for increasing positive affect, decreasing depression and anxiety and
      improving HRQOL in patients with MS.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in positive affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). PANAS is comprised of two 10-item mood scales, one measuring positive affect and the other measuring negative affect. Scores on the Positive Affect Scale range from 10-50. Higher scores are associated with greater positive affect.</description>

    <measure>Change in trait optimism</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R). LOT-R is a 6-item measure of trait optimism and pessimism. Scores range from 0-24. Higher scores are associated with greater optimism.</description>

    <measure>Change in depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). CES-D is a 20-item measure of depression with scores ranging from 20-80. Higher scores are associated with greater depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). STAI includes two 20-item questionnaires designed to measure the current temporary condition of &quot;state&quot; anxiety and the more general and longstanding condition of &quot;trait&quot; anxiety. Scores for each scale range from 20-80. Higher scores are associated with greater anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The MFIS is a 21-item measure of fatigue with scores ranging from 0-84. Higher scores are associated with greater fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36). The SF-36 is a 36-item measure of health status and quality of Life. It consists of eight scaled scores and two summary scores. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in work productivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages with higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
