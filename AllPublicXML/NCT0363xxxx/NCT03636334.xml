  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-based decision support system
      for hypertension management by physicians at primary health care (PHC) centers in China in
      order to improve the delivery of appropriate treatment and blood pressure (BP) control for
      hypertensive individuals.

      The LIGHT trial aims to assess the effectiveness of decision support system (DSS) for
      hypertension treatment in cluster clinics. At each stage, the main randomization will occur
      at the PHC center level. During the first 3 months (baseline period), the physicians at all
      sites will use an electronic data collection system to collect information about the
      individuals who attend the clinic. After site randomization, physicians at control sites will
      continue to deliver usual care, and physicians at intervention sites will receive training
      and support on the use of the DSS. And the DSS will recommend antihypertensive medications
      according to the assigned protocol. All individuals will be asked to attend the clinic at
      least once every 3 months.

    <description>At intervention sites, physicians will receive training and support on use of the DSS, which will be installed on their local IT system. Individuals eligible for DSS at Intervention sites will be randomized or assigned to different drug sequence protocols for BP-lowering therapy using their current antihypertensive medications, co-morbidities, and intolerance to medications and according to the assignment plan in the Algorithm. If the protocol is not suitable for the patient because of new co-morbidities, medication intolerance or contraindication, the DSS will recommend switching to a new protocol.</description>
