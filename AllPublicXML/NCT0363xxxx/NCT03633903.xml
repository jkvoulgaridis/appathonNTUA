  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early life stress (ELS) is associated with a number of psychiatric and medical conditions
      later in life, thought to be caused by subsequent disruptions in biological processes
      involved in regulation of stress responses. Given that these alterations have long-lasting
      effects, there is a great need for effective preventative interventions. The long-term goal
      of this project is to identify early interventions that may most powerfully mitigate risk for
      psychiatric illness among adolescents with exposure to early life stress (ELS), with a focus
      on interventions that can be widely and effectively implemented, have the potential for
      long-lasting benefits, and can effectively engage targeted neurobiological processes and
      networks. The specific aims of the present study are to 1) examine how ELS impacts biological
      processes associated with regulation of stress, and 2) identify how MBI impacts affective
      symptoms and biological processes dysregulated by ELS.

      This study supports the efforts to reduce the effects of early adversity in children by
      testing an impact of an effective psychological intervention on disrupted biological
      processes caused by early adversity. Successful achievement of the proposed aims will
      contribute to a) the knowledge base needed to reduce the effects of trauma and stress in
      children and families and b) the development of easily implemented and disseminated
      preventative interventions.

      The proposed study will utilize a multi-method design to examine the effect of mindfulness on
      biological processes (i.e., stress responses) disrupted by exposure to ELS among adolescents
      age 13 to 15. Adolescents will first complete self-report measures of childhood adverse
      experiences, trauma, and neglect. Forty eligible adolescents will be next randomly assigned
      to either an eight session mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention for teens or no
      treatment. Pre- and post-intervention assessment will include (a) self-report measures of
      symptoms and emotion regulation, (b) a blood draw for assessment of inflammatory markers and
      gene expression, and (c) a stress task with saliva cortisol collected before and after this
      task.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 13.00 to 15.99 years at time of baseline assessment

          -  Able to validly and safely complete baseline assessments

          -  All genders

          -  All races

          -  Eligibility as a subject with early life stress will be determined by:

          -  Scoring 4 or greater on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale, with at least two
             experiences having occurred prior to age 10.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             participate

          -  History of neurological disorders including seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, or other
             conditions requiring neurological or medical care, being managed for migraines (e.g.,
             daily prophylactic medication, seeing a neurologist for migraines), or a diagnosis of
             Developmental Delay, including severe learning disorder, mental retardation, pervasive
             developmental disorder, or other conditions requiring repeated and persistent
             specialized education.
