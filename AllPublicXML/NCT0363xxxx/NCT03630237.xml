  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current diagnostic criteria for a heart attack require evaluation of a patient's symptoms
      and ECG but importantly a blood test called troponin. With advancing technology this test has
      become more sensitive and is now called a high sensitivity troponin. This is a very effective
      way of rapidly excluding a heart attack if the test is negative. However there are a number
      of causes of a raised high sensitivity other than a heart attack, particularly critical
      illness states. In the absence of features of a heart attack an abnormal result therefore
      suggests that the heart is inflamed or unwell causing the release of high sensitivity
      troponin. The DIGNITY study will examine the consequences of high sensitivity troponin
      elevation in patients in intensive care and assess whether it has a role as a biomarker for
      predicting outcome.
