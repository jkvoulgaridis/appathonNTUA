  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, Dose Confirmation study. Subjects will be
      treated, once a week, with IV doses of Nerofe and low dose (20 mg/m2) Doxorubicin (6-8 hours
      from one another) in consecutive, 28-day cycles.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit
      30-33 days after the last dosing of study drug. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not
      experience progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the other withdrawal
      criteria - may continue to receive Nerofe &amp; Doxorubicin for up to 5 cycles, at the discretion
      of the Principal Investigator. Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided by the
      Clinical Safety Committee (CSC).

             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
