  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare myocardial injury of patients undergoing
      congenital cardiac defects repair surgery (RACHS Risk Score one, two or three) under total
      intravenous anesthesia compared to inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane. The primary aim of
      the study is to evaluate the troponin I levels in patients following congenital heart surgery
      and elucidate if one of the two anesthetic techniques (TIVA x inhalation anesthesia) is more
      effective in reducing troponin I levels in the first 72h after surgery..

      Sixty six are planned to be included in the study and the follow-up will take approximately 3
      days for the primary outcome.

      As a secondary outcome evaluate the BNP, CPK and CKMB postoperative levels in the same period
      (72h), also ICU and hospital lengh of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation,
      inotropic/vasoactive drugs use and incidence of renal injury (according to pediatric RIFLE
      score).

    <description>Anesthetic induction with sevoflurane by mask 3-8% and fresh gas flow 2-8 l/min (FiO2 50-100%) followed by ketamine 1-2 mg/kg, midazolam 0,1-0,5 mg/kg, fentanyl 2-4 mcg/kg and pancuronium 0,1 mg/kg.
After orotracheal intubation, anesthesia is maintained with fentanyl 10 - 30 mcg/kg according to clinical needs and sevoflurane 1-3% (end-tidal concentration) before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Specifically during cardiopulmonary bypass extra fentanyl 1-5 mcg/kg and pancuronium 0,1 mg/kg will be administered and the sevoflurane sustained 1-3% in a specific sevoflurane vaporizer included in the CPB machine.
Pressure-controlled ventilation will be applied to both groups objectifying normocarbia and normoxia.
Ringer`s lactate (RL) will be used as crystalloid solution for fluid therapy.</description>

After orotracheal intubation, anesthesia is maintained with fentanyl 10 - 30 mcg/kg according to clinical needs and continuous infusion of midazolam and ketamine 0,2-0,8 mg/kg/h and 1-2 mg/kg/h respectively before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Specifically during cardiopulmonary bypass extra fentanyl 1-5 mcg/kg, midazolam 0,1-0,5 mg/kg and pancuronium 0,1 mg/kg will be administered.
