  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of assessing HR-HPV
      DNA and HPV E6/E7 mRNA via self-collected menstrual blood in a smart menstrual pad. In other
      words, can the investigators detect the high risk strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV)
      that are associated with cervical cancer in self-collected menstrual blood, as an alternative
      to collecting vaginal swabs.

    <description>This group of women have tested positive for HR-HPV at annual cervical cancer screening and have been invited to participate in the study. They will be asked to use a menstrual pad we provide that collects a sample of their menstrual blood (strip). The strip will be mailed back to us for analysis (Menstrual Blood Analysis). These women will also be asked to conduct a self-swab vaginally to be sent back to us for analysis. These women will return 6-months after their positive HR-HPV for standard of care testing. All results of the standard of care tests, menstrual blood tests, and self-swab tests will be compared.</description>
