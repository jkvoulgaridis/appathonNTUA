  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a competency based model on program quality in Swedish
      preschools for Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Half of the participating
      preschools will receive &quot;treatment as usual&quot; (Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI)
      provided to a Child with ASD in the preschool, supervised by an external supervisor from a
      habilitation center), while the other half will receive the above as well as, in-service
      training and monthly on-site coaching sessions also involving preschool staff other than the
      paraprofessional (competency based model). It is hypothesized that the competency based model
      will improve program quality, child's engagement, preschool staff knowledge, allegiance and
      self-efficacy compared to the comparison group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost all children in Sweden between two and five years attend preschool including children
      with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). High quality and structured early intervention programs
      grounded in the principles and procedures of applied behavior analysis have been found in
      numerous research studies and reviews to significantly improve developmental outcomes,
      adaptive behaviors and learning outcomes of preschool children with ASD.

      A prerequisite of which is a high quality learning environment that includes both the
      physical set-up, learning climate and competence of staff. The primary purpose of this
      project is to improve program quality for preschool children with ASD through a competency
      based model grounded in ecological systems theory sustainable over time and applicable within
      the Swedish service support system. In total approximately 16 preschools will participate,
      half of which will receive &quot;treatment as usual&quot; EIBI to a Child with ASD in the preschool,
      supervised by an external supervisor from a habilitation center), while the other half will
      also receive obtain in-service training and monthly on-site coaching through habilitation.
      Involved habilitation specialists will obtain in-service training prior to the onset of the
      study on how to use the Autism Program Environment Rating Scale (APERS), the basic tenets of
      coaching based on the concept of reflective and collaborative dialogues in which the
      preschool teachers knowledge of the child and context are taken into account.

      It is hypothesized that the competency based model will improve program quality, child's
      engagement, adaptive behavior, increase preschool staff knowledge, allegiance and
      self-efficacy compared to the comparison group only receiving supervision in implementing a
      comprehensive program.

    <intervention_model_description>The study used a staggered design where three waves of preschools were recruited and assigned to either the experimental or the control group. The first wave of preschools (n = 6) were divided into two groups, where group assignment was made to make the two groups comparable in regards to three variables: supervisors' experience of comprehensive programs, APERS-P-SE baseline scores, and children's adaptive behavior (Vineland II ratings). Originally, the plan was to then randomize which of these two matched groups would be the experimental group, but because of unforeseen circumstances one of the groups was made the control group because there was a lack of resources for one of the preschools to be able to be in the experimental group. However, for the following two waves of recruitment, the participating preschools (n = 11) were divided into matched pairs (based only on supervisor experience), which were then randomly assigned either as the control or the experimental group.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>In total, 17 preschools, 17 children (one from each preschool), and 35 preschool staff (two from each preschool except from one preschool where three preschool staff participated) participated in the study.

    <measure>Change in overall program quality measured by the Autism Program Environment Rating Scale (APERS-P-SE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and follow-up (about 9 months from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The APERS-P-SE is a rating scale designed to examine the preschool teaching environment of children with ASD in Sweden. It is used to assess overall intervention setting quality over 10 domains including areas such as Personal Independence and Functional Behavior. It consists of 56 items rated on a 5 Point Likert-scale (1= low quality - 5 = high quality) resulting in individual item scores, subdomain scores, domain scores and a total score.</description>
