    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and performance of the VaSecure drug-coated PTA balloon catheter in the
      treatment of patients with Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) of the lower limb below
      the knee (BTK)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VaSecure Drug Coated PTA Balloon Catheter is indicated for percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty (PTA), after predilatation, of de novo lesions in the peripheral vasculature of
      the lower limb with reference vessel diameters of 2-4 mm.

      The study will include patients with lesions located in the infrapopliteal arteries diagnosed
      with CLTI of Rutherford categories 3-5. A maximum number of 46 patients will be enrolled in
      this clinical investigation in 7 sites in Europe and 2 in Singapore.
