      Objective:The purpose of this study was to explore the effect and mechanism of maternal
      chorioamnionitis on placental microvasculature and platelet activation among preterm infants
      by activating Wnt-Flt1 signal pathway .

      Methods:With clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT), the cases were matched with 1:1
      according to gestational age and divided into 2 groups according to the placental pathology
      result: chorioamnionitis group and control group. (1) To observe the platelet parameter,
      birth weight, thrombrocytopenia and hemorrhage complication, such as intracranial hemorrhage,
      retinal hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. (2) To observe the
      miscrovascular density (MVD) in placenta, platelet activating factor (CD62p,CD63) and
      thrombopotetin (TPO) in preterrn infants.The placental MVD was assessed by
      immunohistochemical method. The platelet activating factors were detected by flow cytometry.
      TPO was detected by ELISA. (3) To observe Wnt5a, Flt1 and VEGF in placenta and fetal
      circulation.The measurement data were analyzed by pair t test and conditional logistic
      regression. Pearson correlation analysis was used for relationship.

      The exclusive criteria included :(1) born to mother with no any other maternal complications;
      (2) no congenital abnormalities and neonatal asphyxia; (3) died or discharged within 72
      hours.
