  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 24-week crossover design study in adolescents enrolled in the 6-8th grade
      within the Center School District in the Kansas City, MO. This school will begin their
      'Breakfast in the Classroom' program during the fall 2018 school year. Baseline data will be
      collected to include anthropometric measures, participant characteristics, and past eating
      habits. For the first 8 weeks, the students will be provided with breakfast meals containing
      the USDA nutrition requirements. These meals are typically higher in carbohydrates and lower
      in protein. For the second 8 weeks, the students will be provided with higher-protein
      breakfast meals. These meals also contain the USDA nutrition requirements but include
      high-quality protein-rich foods. For the remaining 8 weeks, the students will be provided
      both types of meals and will be permitted to choose which they prefer to consume each day. At
      the end of each 8-week period, eating habits, appetite, mood, cognitive performance, and
      anthropometrics will be completed along with measurements of breakfast waste.
