  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm phase I/Ib safety trial. Patients eligible
      for treatment must be diagnosed with non-metastatic, biopsy-proven p16-negative histology
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx, and must be
      eligible and amenable to surgical resection.

    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer is a disease that is known to have poor survival outcomes and response
      to combination chemoradiation. This study will feature a dose escalation of Gy fractions and
      dose expansion phases of durvalumab. It will also feature surgical resection 3-6 weeks after
      radiation as recommended by the ENT surgeon.

    <description>Part 1 of this trial will use a traditional 3+3 design will be used for this trial (i.e. cohort sizes of 3 patients for the first and second cohort at each dose level). Dose escalation will occur as long as there are minimal dose limiting toxicities.The expectation is that 9 patients will be enrolled to the trial during part 1.This is based on the expectation that all dose levels are safe (i.e. patients will not experience DLTs at all dose levels). The range of patients needed will be 6-12 patients.
Part 2 of this trial will be an expansion cohort. A total of 8 additional patients will be enrolled at the dose level determined to be the MTD in part 1 of the study. These 8 patients will be used to confirm that the MTD is a safe combination, as well as provide additional patients to investigate the efficacy for the treatment combination.
Note: Standard of care surgery will follow 3-6 weeks after medication and radiation treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive one dose of neoadjuvant durvalumab 1500 mg approximately 3-6 weeks prior to standard of care surgery.

    <description>The starting RT dose level will be given as 6 Gy for 2 fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately one week to sites of gross disease only to minimize exposure to normal tissue. If toxicity develops and surgery is delayed by more than 8 weeks (qualifying as a DLT), the radiation dose will be dropped per protocol for the next set of patients. If this dose is tolerated, the dose will be increased to 6 Gy for 3 fractions (18 Gy total) for the next 3 patients.</description>
