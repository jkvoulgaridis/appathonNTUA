  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study objectives is to evaluate the efficacy of YD312 to improve visual acuity in
      patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) compared to placebo and determine optimal dose of
      phase 2b study.

      These study results present the possibility that imatinib can be used as a new DME inhibiting
      agent by involving VEGF-independent ocular angiogenesis, not action points of existing
      agents, in effectively inhibiting excessive vascular angiogenesis observed in oxygen-induced
      retinopathy.
