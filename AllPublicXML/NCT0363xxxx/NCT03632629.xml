  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a single blind, randomized controlled design to study the additional therapeutic
      effects of cognitive training on traditional rehabilitation programs for children with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental delays.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental delays
      who are receiving traditional rehabilitation programs will be enrolled.

      The participants will be randomized into two groups, including study group (traditional
      rehabilitation program with additional cognitive training: 2 times per week, 15 min per
      session, a total of 24 sessions) and control group (traditional rehabilitation program
      without additional cognitive training).

      Memory related functions, quality of life, and physical function evaluations will be
      performed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months later, respectively.

      Evaluator will be blinded to the group's classification during the whole course of study.
