  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to reduce or eliminate the use of all narcotics/opiates for post
      Cesarean section pain management. The investigators hypothesize that in comparison with
      epidural or intrathecal Duramorph, a TAP block with liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) will
      provide better, longer-acting pain control and will significantly reduce the use of
      post-operative IV or p.o. opiates. This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare the analgesic efficacy and duration of an ultrasound guided
      bilateral TAP Block (with combined bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine) to Duramorph (an
      opiate). Neuraxial duramorph provides approximately 24 hours of pain relief (analgesia),
      whereas a bilateral TAP block with liposomal bupivacaine is expected to provide up to 72
      hours of analgesia.

      All participants will have neuraxial anesthesia (either a spinal or epidural) for their
      non-urgent or elective Cesarean section.

      The control group (Group 1) will receive either intrathecal or epidural Duramorph
      (preservative-free morphine sulfate). Post-operatively, participants will have orders to
      receive, on an as-needed basis, IV/oral acetaminophen and/or IV/oral non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for mild-moderate pain, and narcotics for severe pain;
      specifically- oxycodone or hydromorphone. All patients must receive acetaminophen and NSAIDS
      (unless contraindicated) before receiving narcotics. This multi-modal pain management regimen
      is our current standard of care.

      The experimental group (Group 2) will also receive a spinal or epidural anesthetic. This
      group will not receive neuraxial Duramorph for post-operative pain. Instead, the patient will
      receive an ultrasound guided bilateral TAP block with a combination of bupivacaine and
      liposomal bupivacaine solution immediately after the Cesarean section. Additionally, all
      participants will receive the same post-operative analgesia orders as group 1.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of abdominal analgesia when using 266 mg EXPAREL delivered into the bilateral TAP blocks. TAP blocks are an excellent method for providing adequate analgesia following lower abdominal surgery.
Those patients who wish to participate will be asked to sign a study consent form. Patients that decide to participate in this study will be randomized to either group 1 or group 2 (like the flip of a coin). Both groups will receive standard neuraxial anesthesia for their Cesarean Section and post-operative standard of care breakthrough medications for post-operative pain control.</intervention_model_description>
