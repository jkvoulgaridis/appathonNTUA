      The ACTME study is an investigator initiated, single center phase I/II clinical trial for
      patients with progressive unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. The trial consists of
      both a phase I part to determine safety and feasibility and a phase II part to evaluate first
      clinical activity of IFN-alpha, nivolumab and TIL. The treatment with IFN-alpha will be added
      after the combination of TIL and nivolumab has proven to be safe.

    <textblock>
      The ACTME is an investigator initiated, single center phase I/II clinical trial for patients
      with progressive unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      Patients are conditioned by low-dose IFN-alpha and treated with ACT and PD-1 antibodies. With
      this approach the investigators hope to solve 4 of the most important aspects curtailing the
      efficacy of current immunotherapies in metastatic melanoma:

        1. the lack of sufficient numbers of activated tumor-reactive T cells in patients by
           providing ACT; and

        2. the inhibition of T-cell effector function through PD-1 signalling by administration of
           nivolumab; as well as

        3. the toxicity of high-dose IL-2, and

        4. long term hospitalization of patients due to the conditioning-regimen used in most ACT
           protocols by replacing it with low-dose IFN-alpha treatment.

      The trial consists of both a phase I part to determine safety and feasibility and a phase II
      part to evaluate first clinical activity of IFN-alpha, nivolumab and TIL.

      The treatment with IFN-alpha will be added after the combination of TIL and nivolumab has
      proven to be safe in the first cohort of the phase I part of the trial.
