      Drs. Biggs, Whiteside and Vickers will plan and oversee the randomized controlled mixed
      methods study of the phase II prototype version of the Virtual Reality (VR) exposure therapy
      system. Participants will complete a baseline study session with study staff at the Mayo
      Clinic, all of whom have experience with exposure therapy. Participants will then be assigned
      two weeks of daily exposure homework with or without VR, depending on condition, using
      Anxiety Coach to record each exposure and SUDS. Patients randomized to intervention will take
      home the VR system for homework completion, and participants assigned to control will not
      take the VR system home and will be instructed to complete imaginal exposures. Participants
      will be asked to record each exposure, even if it is not related to the fear addressed with
      the baseline exposures, in order to capture all exposures completed during the homework
      period. Use of Anxiety Coach will allow for automatic recording of the exposure's time and
      date of completion, content, maximum and final SUDS, and duration. Two weeks after the
      baseline session, all participants will return for a follow up session in which they complete
      both types of exposure (order randomized) as well as a third generalization exposure, i.e.,
      an exposure related to the baseline exposure that is higher on the fear ladder for the
      targeted fear.
