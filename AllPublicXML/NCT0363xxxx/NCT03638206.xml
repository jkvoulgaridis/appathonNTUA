  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, uni-center, phase I-II study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of CAR-T/TCR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with different malignancies
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-target gene-modified immunotherapy. CAR-T/TCR-T cells include ten
      different tumor-specific antibody.They are as following:anti-CD19 antibody for B cell
      leukemia and lymphoma;anti-CD22 antibody for B cell leukemia and lymphoma;anti-CD33 antibody
      for myeloid leukemia;anti-BCMA antibody for multiple myeloma;anti-CD38 antibody for multiple
      myeloma;anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody for multiple myeloma,esophagus cancer,lung cancer,melanoma and
      synovial sarcoma;anti-DR5 antibody for hepatoma;anti-C-met antibody for hepatoma,colorectal
      cancer,ovarian cancer and renal carcinoma;anti-EGFR V III antibody for hepatoma,lung cancer
      and glioma;anti-Mesothelin antibody for gastric cancer,pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma.
