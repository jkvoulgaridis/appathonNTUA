      Background Fractures of the distal radius are among the most common. Major complications,
      including irritation and rupture of the extensor tendons, may occur if epiphyseal screws of
      inappropriate length are used.

      Questions/Purposes The main objective of the present study was to determine whether the
      optimal epiphyseal screw length can be determined by reference to the diaphyseal screw
      length.

      Methods Forty CT scans were semi-automatically segmented. A 3D model of the volar plate was
      affixed to each distal radius with simulation. The maximum lengths of the diaphyseal screws,
      as well as the four distal epiphyseal screws, were measured. Linear regression analysis was
      performed.

    <time_frame>The measures were performed after the CT-Scans were realized. The CT-Scans were performed from October 2016 to February 2018. The measures on the CT-Scans were realized in june 2018</time_frame>
    <description>The main objective of this study was twofold: 1) to assess the anatomical correlation between diaphysis thickness in the diaphyseal screw region of volar plates and epiphyseal thickness in lateral plane with linear regression analysis for each epiphyseal screw length with regard to the diaphysis screw length, and 2) to evaluate whether the optimal epiphyseal screw lengths can be predicted by reference to the diaphyseal screw length when diaphyseal screws are first positioned.
From the CT-scans, Reconstructions in 3D of the radius were realized. Those reconstructions were used in a computer-simulation study. A Volar plate was affixed to the radius using a specific software.
Maximum length for each screw located either in epiphysis or diaphysis was measured in mm. This length corresponded with the distance between the entry point of the screw and the opposite point belonging to the wrist along the line perpendicular to the plate.</description>
