  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postoperative cognitive injury is high in elderly patients, especially after
      major surgery. The relevant pathophysiological mechanisms are still unclear, and the possible
      mechanisms that have been proposed so far include inflammation, neurotransmitter imbalance
      and metabolic disorders. In recent years, clinical studies of acute brain dysfunction after
      vascular endothelial injury have attracted attention.

      Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx layer and subsequent shedding of its constituents
      is seen as an early marker of endothelial injury, and may increase vascular permeability.Many
      preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated an association between inflammatory
      cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 and glycocalyx degradation biomarkers.

      The scholars found evidence of plasma endothelial injury after abdominal open surgery in the
      elderly. Dexmedetomidine could attenuate stress response such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Based
      on the above evidence, we hypothesize that elderly patients experience inflammatory response
      secondary to surgical traumatic stress after major surgery, greatly increasing the degree of
      endothelial injury (heparan sulphate and syndecan-1), reducing brain perfusion while
      increasing Blood-brain barrier permeability (S100B level), promoting the release of cytokines
      Interleukin-2(IL-2), Interleukin-6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α) ,and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) while reducing brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF)
      synthesis, then leading to postoperative acute spasm. We would test the hypothesis that can
      reverse these effects and improve cognitive deficits.
