  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this retrospective case series study was to evaluate long-term
      radiographic and clinical outcomes of a consecutive series of patients with diagnosis of
      isolated, displaced, closed talar neck or body fractures treated by open reduction and
      internal fixation. Secondly, it was aimed to verify the influence of the location of talar
      fractures on the outcomes, the prognostic value of the Hawkins sign, whether operative delays
      promote avascular necrosis (AVN) and if the fractures require emergent surgical management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January 2007 to December 2012, 31 patients underwent ORIF by screws at our institution.
      On the basis of Inokuchi criteria, the injuries were divided between neck and body fractures,
      which were classified according to Hawkins and Sneppen, respectively. The patients included
      were divided into two groups in relation to fracture location and complexity. Radiographic
      assessment focused on reduction quality, bone healing, Hawkins sign and osteoarthritis
      development. For clinical evaluation, clinical-functional scores (AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Score;
      MFS; FFI-17; SF-36) and VAS were determined, and statistical analysis was performed.

    <measure>Evaluation of the quality reduction after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 1 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic examination of anteroposterior, lateral and oblique view radiographs enabled to evaluate the quality of the reduction. Any offset of more than 2 mm or neck angulation of more than 5Â° between the fragment was labelled as a poor reduction.</description>

    <description>Criteria to define bone healing and union:
The bridging bone/callus formation was evaluated on radiographs The absence of radiolucent lines was verified at different follow-ups.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of osteonecrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6-8 weeks after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Hawkins sign appearance (only on the A/P X-ray), which resembles a subchondral atrophy in the talus dome, was evaluated indicating that the talus is well vascularized. On the contrary, its absence at this time suggests the presence of osteonecrosis</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the development of post-injury peritalar osteoarthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>at last follow-up (seven years)</time_frame>
    <description>Post-injury peritalar osteoarthritis was evaluated on X-ray and differentiated between necrosis without collapse (sclerosis with and without geodes) and necrosis with collapse of the talar dome at the last follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score</measure>
    <time_frame>at last follow-up (seven years)</time_frame>
    <description>The AOFAS score enabled to quantify pain and functional disability. It includes 9 questions related to pain (1 question; 40 points), function (7 questions; 50 points) and alignment (10 questions; 10 points); a score of 90-100 is considered an excellent result; 75-89 as good; 50-74 as fair and less than 49 points is considered a failure or a poor outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the Maryland Foot Score (MFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at last follow-up (seven years)</time_frame>
    <description>The MFS is a score conceptually analogous to AOFAS score, but points are differently distributed (45 for pain, 55 for functional limitation); they indicate excellent results if the score is between 90 to 100, good for a score of 75 to 89, fair for a score of 50 to 74 and poor if the score is &lt; 50.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the 17-Foot Functional Index (FFI-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>at last follow-up (seven years)</time_frame>
    <description>The FFI-17 measures the persistence of pain, disability and restriction of activity, with 17 number-rating scales from 0 to 10. The maximum score is 100, which indicates complete disability.</description>

    <intervention_name>open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).</intervention_name>
    <description>Depending on the fracture location, a single anteromedial or anterolateral approach was carried out. The fracture site was cleaned to make it visible, allowing anatomical reduction. Subsequently, fixation of provisional fragments was achieved using temporary Kirschner wires under radiographic guidance. Having obtained satisfactory reduction as seen with the radiographic intensifier, definitive fixation of the main bone fragments was carried out using two or more 3.5 mm titanium cannulated screws or 4.0 mm lag screws, placed anteriorly to posteriorly. Fractures complicated by severe comminution necessitated 3.5 mm cortical screws in order to avoid shortening, translation or angulation of the fragments.</description>
