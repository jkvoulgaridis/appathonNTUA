  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical study is to confirm the utility of chemosensitivity
      (ChemoID) tumor testing on cancer stem cells as a predictor of clinical response in recurrent
      epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, regardless of
      platinum sensitivity.

      Population studied will be female participants experiencing a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd recurrence of
      any stage epithelial ovarian cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine
      if recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients treated with Bevacizumab plus drugs
      predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated with
      standard-of-care control therapy (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician).

      Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
      relapse of EOC regardless of platinum sensitivity (both platinum sensitive and resistant)
      will have a tumor biopsy or a cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug
      response testing with multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment
      (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from the provided list), or to a study
      arm of Bevacizumab plus FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.

      A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata
      based on relapse number, platinum sensitivity, and study site to ensure balance within these
      cells.

    <description>The ChemoID test is a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited drug response assay performed by a hospital clinical pathology laboratory that uses patient's live tumor cells to indicate which chemotherapy agent (or combinations) will kill not only bulk of tumor cells, but importantly the cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are known to cause cancer to recur. During the assay, cancer stem cells and bulk tumor cells from an individual patient are exposed to FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.
The test measures the cytotoxic effect of actual doses of standard-of-care chemotherapies. The ChemoID drug response assay reports a prioritized list of effective and ineffective chemotherapies. The test is designed to target cancer stem cells to mitigate tumor relapse.</description>

             that has been pathologically demonstrated to be disease-related in the setting of a

          -  8. At least 30 days post-cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibody therapy
             prior to enrollment;

          -  9. Toxicities of prior therapy (excepting alopecia) should be resolved to less than or
             equal to Grade 1 as per CTCAE v4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocol

          -  10. ECOG Performance Status Score of ≤ 2, KPS≥70, or 0-1 GOG status

          -  11. Adequate laboratory values within 60 days of enrollment to study defined as
             follows:

               1. WBC ≥ 3000/mm3

               6. Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dl

               7. AST/SGOT ≤ 3 times ULN. If intrahepatic liver metastases are present, AST and ALT
                  must be ≤ 5 times institutional ULN.

          -  12. Appropriate for tissue sampling either by tumor biopsy or peritoneal or pleural
             fluid collection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Estimated life expectancy of &lt;6 months, as estimated by the investigator in
             consultation with participating oncologists;

          -  2. Ovarian cancer of a low grade serous, mucinous, or clear cell histology;

          -  3. Uncontrolled diabetes;

          -  4. Patients with clinically significant proteinuria; urine protein should be screened
             by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR); the UPCR has been found to correlate
             directly with the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection;
             specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24-hour urine
             collection; obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does
             not have to be a 24-hour urine); send sample to lab with request for urine protein and
             creatinine levels (separate requests); the lab will measure protein concentration
             (mg/dL) and creatinine concentration (mg/dL); the UPCR is derived as follows: protein
             concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); patients must have a UPCR ≤ 1.0 to allow
             participation in the study;

             and/or requirement for parenteral hydration or nutrition; nonhealing wound, ulcer, or
             bone fracture; bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy; known CNS disease,
             clinically significant cardiovascular disease; and a major surgical procedure within
             28 days of enrollment or anticipated to occur while participating in study;

          -  7. Enrollment in another clinical study that precludes allowing the oncologist to
             select chemotherapy regimens;

          -  8. Previously participated in this study;

          -  9. Any condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place the participant
             at an unacceptable risk, or render the participant unable to meet the requirements of
             the protocol (including long-term study follow-up).

          -  10. Documented history of ovarian cancer of a low malignant potential phenotype or
             unclear cell histology.

          -  11. CA-125 only disease without RECIST 1.1 measurable or otherwise evaluable disease

          -  12. Patients may not use any complementary or alternative medicines including natural
             herbal products or folk remedies as they may interfere with the effectiveness of the
             study treatments.
