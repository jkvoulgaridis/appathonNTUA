  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, including Gli1, is critical to treatment resistance. For
      optimizing cervical cancer treatment, the pathological prognostic factors determine whether
      to administer adjuvant therapy. However, the majority of clinical results was from squamous
      cell carcinoma, rendering conclusions for adenocarcinoma less convincing. We aimed to examine
      the role of Shh signaling in long-term clinical outcomes of cervical adenocarcinoma after
      receiving major surgery.

      Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy could achieve favorable locoregional control in
      cervical cancer. Although good local control results, distant failure plays a major role in
      patients with treatment failure.

      We were interested in the potential biomarkers for recurrence after primary treatment for the
      following reasons. We wanted to identify patients at a high risk of recurrence. Such patients
      must be intensively monitored. We required baseline data, such as the actuarial relapse rate,
      for evaluation in an additional randomized study. Hence, we retrospectively analyzed the
      potential biomarkers for recurrence in cervical cancer. Statistical analysis of the data was
      done using the chi-square test. Disease free survival curves were constructed using the
      Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons between curves were performed using the log-rank test.
      Multivariate analyses of factors associated with local and distant failure were made by
      logistic regression analysis.

      From 1987 to 2002, 62 patients with cervical adenocarcinoma that received major surgery were
      enrolled for analysis of Shh signaling with a median follow-up period for 172.6 months (IQR
      33.0-226.2 months). External beam radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy followed by brachytherapy with
      30 Gy was delivered with or without concurrent weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2. Clinical outcomes
      in terms of local recurrence, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will
      be analyzed. The expressions of Shh, Ptch-1, Smo and Gli1 were assessed by
      immunohistochemistry. Statistics will be performed using International Business Machines
      (IBM) Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) v22.
