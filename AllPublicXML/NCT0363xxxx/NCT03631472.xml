      An early feasibility study (EFS) to assess the safety and clinical utility of RheOx on
      patients with chronic bronchitis in the United States.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RheOx is a device-based, energy delivery system that delivers energy for the ablation of soft
      tissue such as the airway epithelium and sub-mucosal tissue layers. The energy is delivered
      via a proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.

      Two sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart. The right lung is treated at the
      first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session
      (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a
      respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a
      bronchoscopic procedure. The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anesthesia. It is
      anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total.
      Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the
      two bronchoscopies.

      Subjects will be required to submit tests during the study including three CT scans (lung),
      respiratory function tests, exercise testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is diagnosed with chronic bronchitis for a minimum of two years, where chronic
             bronchitis is defined clinically as chronic productive cough for three months in each
             of two successive years in a patient in whom other causes of productive cough have
             been excluded.

          2. Subject responds to the first two questions of the CAT must sum to at least 7 points.
             If the sum of the first two CAT questions is 6 points and the subject's total CAT
             score is greater than 20 points, the subject may be enrolled.

          3. Subject has preprocedure post-bronchodilator FEV1 of greater than or equal to 30% and
             less than or equal to 80% of predicted within three months of enrollment.

          4. Subject has had 1 or more COPD exacerbations, defined as an acute worsening in
             respiratory symptoms that requires additional treatment, in the 12-months prior to
             enrollment.

          5. Subject has a SGRQ score of greater than or equal to 25 and CAT score of greater than
             or equal to 10.
