      Providing access of BPX-501 gene modified T cells and rimiducid to pediatric patients who do

      This is an expanded access protocol of BPX-501 T cells infused after T cell-depleted HSCT in
      pediatric patients with non-malignant hematologic disorders eligible for treatment on the
      BP-U-004 study.

      The purpose of this protocol is to provide access to the CaspaCIDe system combination product
      (BPX-501 gene modified T cells and rimiducid) to patients on a case by case basis who do not
      meet the BP-U-004 protocol eligibility criteria. BPX-501 infusion can enhance immune
      reconstitution with the potential for reducing the severity and duration of severe acute
      GVHD.
