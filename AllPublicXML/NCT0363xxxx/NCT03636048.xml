  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator aimed to compare the effect of anesthesia on overall postoperative outcomes
      including post-operative pain score and the fetal well-being (heart rate) in patients
      undergoing transabdominal cervico isthmic cerclage(TCIC). The investigator divided the
      patients into two groups. The first group was the patients who undergo general anesthesia
      with postoperative wound patient-controlled analgesia device(PCA) and the second group was
      the patients who undergo combined spinal-epidural anesthesia(CSE) with postoperative epidural
      catheter PCA device for pain control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transabdominal cervico isthmic cerclage(TCIC) is performed for the pregnants with Incompetent
      Internal Os of the Cervix(IIOC) to maintain pregnancy. It is the operation that incise the
      lower abdomen and ligate the cervix in pelvic cavity. In our center, the surgery was
      conventionally performed under general anesthesia. Also, for pain control, operator has been
      inserting a catheter into the incision site and connected the wound PCA. In this way, there
      were some limitations that the wound PCA could only control the somatic pain and there were
      significant rates of post-operative nausea and vomiting as common complication of general
      anesthesia. Thus, the investigator planned to conduct combined spinal-epidural
      anesthesia(CSE) with postoperative pain control with epidural catheter and compare overall
      postoperative outcomes with conventional general anesthesia.

    <description>The patients undergo surgery under general anesthesia and a catheter would be inserted to abdominal incision site at the end of the operation. Propofol is used for induction of general anesthesia, and sevoflurane is used for maintenance of anesthesia. At the end of the operation, the surgeon inserts wound catheter in the surgical site and connects wound patient-controlled analgesia device filled with 0.5% ropivacaine.</description>
