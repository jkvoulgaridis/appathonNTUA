  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mood disorders, including depression and anxiety, are one of the main causes of the overall
      disease burden worldwide.

      In recent years, the efficacy of certain botanicals as an alternative solution for depression
      has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials.

      However, only few studies looked at the effects of these botanicals on mood in healthy
      subjects.

      The aim of the proposed randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups
      methodology is to assess the acute and chronic effects of daily supplementation with a
      proprietary and standardized botanical extract in comparison to placebo in healthy adults
      aged 18-60 years with self-reported low mood.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic effect of the active product on mood, anxiety, perceived stress, quality of life
      and cortisol secretion &amp; metabolism will be assessed through validated questionnaires and
      urine collection after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of daily supplementation.

      The acute effect of the product will be assessed after a single dose and exposure to an acute
      psychological stressor. Before, during and after the stressor, saliva samples will be
      collected and subjective levels of anxiety and mood will be measured. In addition, Galvanic
      Skin Response (GSR) and heart rate (HR) will be measured throughout the stressor session.

    <measure>Mood state</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Variation of the Profile of mood states (POMS-2) total score: TMD (Total Mood Disturbance score). The POMS-2 is a scale which includes six mood subscales: Anger, Confusion, Depression, Fatigue, Tension, and Vigor. Each subscale is scored between 0 and 100. TMD is determined by summing the Negative Mood State subscores and subtracting the Vigor subscore (unique Positive Mood State subscale). For each subscale except Vigor, a lower subscore indicates a better mood state. For the Vigor subscale, a higher subscore indicates a better mood state. A lower POMS-2 TMD indicates a better mood state.</description>
