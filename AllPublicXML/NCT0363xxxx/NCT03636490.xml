  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine urinary sodium excretion induced by psychological stress and its
      diurnal pattern as a novel biological mechanism that may underlie an abnormal diurnal pattern
      of blood pressure. The study will test the hypotheses that lower stress-induced sodium
      excretion is associated with an abnormal diurnal pattern of sodium excretion, and that an
      abnormal diurnal pattern of sodium excretion is associated with an abnormal diurnal pattern
      of blood pressure.

      Primary Aim 1: To examine the association between urinary sodium excretion after provoked
      psychological stress and the diurnal pattern of sodium excretion.

      Primary Aim 2: To examine the association between the diurnal pattern of sodium excretion and
      the diurnal pattern of BP.

      Secondary Aim: To examine whether the association between urinary sodium excretion after
      provoked stress and the diurnal pattern of sodium excretion is modified by ecological
      momentary levels of perceived stress, experienced during the daytime period.

      Exploratory Aim: To determine the socio-demographic, behavioral, and psychological traits,
      chronic stress, and biological stress-related factors that are associated with lower
      stress-induced sodium excretion. Identification of these factors will help determine who is
      at risk for having a differential sodium excretion response to psychological stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure (BP) has a diurnal rhythm; it is normally highest during the daytime period
      and lowest during the nighttime period (BP dipping). The diurnal pattern of BP over a 24-hour
      period can be assessed using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Evidence indicates that an
      abnormal diurnal pattern of BP on ABPM, defined by reduced BP dipping or elevated nighttime
      BP, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

      Psychological stress occurs when an individual perceives that the environmental demands
      exceed his/her adaptive capacity. An individual's response to events that are representative
      of this overload, such as perceived stress and negative affect including anger, hostility,
      depression, vital exhaustion, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, are associated
      with reduced BP dipping and/or higher nighttime BP. Exposure to environmental factors which
      tax an individual's ability to cope, including lower socioeconomic status, job strain, and
      perceived racism, are also associated with reduced BP dipping and/or higher nighttime BP.
      This study will examine the disruption of the normal diurnal pattern of sodium excretion by
      psychological stress as a novel biological mechanism underlying an abnormal diurnal pattern
      of BP.

      The study will be conducted both in the laboratory and in the naturalistic environment with a
      multi-ethnic sample of 211 adult community participants from upper Manhattan who do not have
      a history of CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or another major medical condition and
      are not taking antihypertensive medication. During a laboratory visit, urinary sodium
      excretion in response to mental stress tasks will be examined.
