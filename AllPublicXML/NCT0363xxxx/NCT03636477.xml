  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

      Nivolumab is an antibody (a kind of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will
      allow the body's immune system to work against glioblastoma tumors. Opdivo (Nivolumab) is
      currently FDA approved in the United States for melanoma (a type of skin cancer), non-small
      cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), Hodgkin's lymphoma but is not
      approved in glioblastoma. Nivolumab may help your immune system detect and attack cancer
      cells. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 and veledimex will be given in combination with Nivolumab to enhance the
      IL-12 mediated effect observed to date.

      The main purpose of this substudy is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      tumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex in combination with nivolumab.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive one dose of nivolumab, via infusion, one week prior to
      standard of care craniotomy and tumor resection (subtotal or total). On the day of surgery,
      patients will receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12
      will be administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14
      days. Following veledimex, patients will receive nivolumab via infusion every two weeks.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.
