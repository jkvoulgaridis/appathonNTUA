      A first in human phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and participants with Granulin (GRN)
      mutation causative of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) to assess AL001 safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1 study designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK
      and PD of intravenously administered AL001 in Healthy Volunteers and FTD-GRN mutation
      carriers.
