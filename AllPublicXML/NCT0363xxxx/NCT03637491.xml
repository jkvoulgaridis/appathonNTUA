  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b/2 study will examine the effects of the study drugs, avelumab, binimetinib and
      talazoparib when given in a 2 (doublet) or 3 (triplet) drug combination, in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic RAS-mutant solid tumors. The Phase 1b part of the study will
      assess if the different study drugs can be given together safely and which doses to use for
      further research. Phase 2 will test if the study treatments have an effect on tumor size and
      growth, and gather more information about potential side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open label, multi-center, safety, clinical activity, pharmacokinetic
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of combinations of avelumab, binimetinib and
      talazoparib in adult patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other
      locally advanced or metastatic KRAS- or NRAS-mutant solid tumors.

      The Phase 1b part of this study will initially assess doublet drug combinations to determine
      a recommended dose for further investigation. Following this, the recommended dose for the
      combination of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib (triplet) will be determined. The
      recommended doses for the doublet and triplet combinations will be used in the Phase 2 part
      of the study, which will assess the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the study
      treatments.
