    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pragmatic clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy,
      feasibility, and adaptability of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for
      insomnia disorder, delivered in primary care clinics. The second objective is to evaluate the
      efficacy of a sequential (stepped care) approach for persistent insomnia.

    <intervention_model_description>The study involves two treatment phases of six to eight weeks. In the first phase, participants choose medication (treatment as usual), online cognitive behavior therapy, or online cognitive behavior therapy combined with medication. Participants enter a second treatment phase if they still experience insomnia after the first treatment. The treatment arms for the second phase are medication, in-person cognitive-behavior therapy, or no additional treatment.</intervention_model_description>
