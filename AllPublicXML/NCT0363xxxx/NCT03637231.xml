  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation exposure to patients from CT for CAC scoring has steadily decreased in recent
      years. This is mainly achieved through lowering tube currents alongside with the introduction
      of iterative reconstruction algorithms which allow compensating for increased image noise.
      However, the greatest radiation dose reduction can be obtained by reducing peak tube voltage.
      Yet lowering peak tube voltage remains challenging because tissue attenuation is closely
      related to photon energy, thus rendering the established thresholds for calculating CAC
      scores (i.e. Agatston scores) incomparable if peak tube voltages other than the standard 120
      kilovolt peak (kVp) are applied. The investigators have developed novel tube-adapted
      thresholds for CAC scoring by CT at 80 kVp and 70-kVp tube voltage and have shown that these
      novel thresholds are valid, yielding results closely comparable to the standard 120-kVp
      protocol. The present study aims to optimize application of such low-dose scans in a general
      population through assessment of the impact of physiological patient parameters on image
      parameters such as image noise which per se may impact the accuracy and feasibility of
      ultra-low-dose CAC scoring with reduced tube voltage. Furthermore, the prognostic performance
      of such low-dose CAC scoring will be elucidated.
