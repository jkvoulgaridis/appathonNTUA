      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of the Nuvaira Lung
      Denervation System (Nuvaira System) in the treatment of COPD.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of targeted lung denervation
      (TLD) in addition to optimal medical care to reduce moderate or severe exacerbation's and
      related hospitalizations, compared with optimal medical care alone, in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and other efficacy assessments of
      targeted lung denervation (TLD) in addition to optimal medical care compared with optimal
      medical care alone.
