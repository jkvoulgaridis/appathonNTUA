  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain negatively affects the quality of life of adolescents with cancer (AWC). It can also
      represent a high cost to the healthcare system and families. In response, our team has built
      a smartphone-based app, called Pain Squad+, which can give AWC real-time advice to manage
      their pain. The app uses pain diaries and personalized pain advice plus support from a
      registered nurse to give real-time pain management in all settings. This study will look at
      the impact of Pain Squad+, with or without the nurse support, on AWC health quality and
      healthcare costs over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain negatively affects the quality of life (QOL) of adolescents with cancer (AWC), slows
      cancer recovery, and results in negative long-term health effects. Pain is also significant
      cost to the healthcare system and families. To address this problem, the study investigators
      have developed and used a phased-approach to test a smartphone-based app, called Pain Squad+.
      Using this app AWC report the pain they have and the app provides AWC with advice on how to
      treat this pain based on an algorithm our team developed. An email is also sent to a nurse if
      an AWC reports severe pain 3 times in a row. The nurse then contacts the AWC to assist in
      treating pain. This project will test the effect of the Pain Squad+ app, with and without
      nurse help, on treating pain and other pain-related health issues and managing costs
      associated with pain care, when compared to AWC not using the app. Investigators will enroll
      222 AWC recruited from 9 Canadian pediatric oncology care centres into a 3-group randomized
      controlled trial. AWC in the experimental groups will be asked to use Pain Squad+ for 8 weeks
      (with or without nurse involvement) and all groups will complete pain-related outcome
      measures at baseline, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-weeks. The primary study outcome will be pain
      intensity. The secondary study outcomes will be (a) pain interference; (b) QOL; (c) pain
      self-efficacy; and (d) cost effectiveness and utility. Investigators will use established
      statistical methods to analyze the health and cost data collected over the course of this
      study. A real-time and cost effective way to address the problem of pain in AWC is needed.
      Pain Squad+ can improve pain treatment and QOL for AWC as well as decrease costs incurred by
      families and the healthcare system. If effective, the Pain Squad+ as a model of
      technology-assisted care may represent a way to improve the QOL for a range of Canadian
      patients by treating a variety of physical and psychological symptoms the moment they occur.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a multi-centre, waitlist group controlled, data analyst blinded, 3-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1:1 allocation. Randomization will be stratified by recruitment site to account for differences in care across sites49 with block sizes of 6 and 9 within each stratum. This trial has been designed along the pragmatic end of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum. Our approach to study eligibility criteria, intervention intensity, and participant adherence will determine intervention effect under real-world conditions.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline Brief Pain Inventory measure at 4 time points: 2 weeks after baseline, 4 weeks after baseline, 8 weeks after baseline, 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI assesses current pain and 'worst', 'least', and 'average' pain in the preceding week using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) with verbal anchors 'no pain' at 0 and 'pain as bad as you can imagine' at 10. Item scores are averaged to give a Pain Intensity Summary Score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks after baseline, 4 weeks after baseline, 8 weeks after baseline, 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS instrument is a valid 8- item scale assessing the impact of pain on function. Higher scores represent greater interference with function. We will use the established Bonferroni correction to account for serial comparisons.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks after baseline, 4 weeks after baseline, 8 weeks after baseline, 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL 4.0 is a valid and reliable 23-item instrument not specific to pain. It is comprised of 4 subscales (physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning), which are summed to provide a total score. Higher scores represent better QOL. We will separately analyze the subscales and total scale scores of the PedsQL.</description>

    <description>Porter's scale which assesses self-efficacy for managing pain, symptoms, and function in cancer patients. This 16-item scale includes a valid and reliable 5-item subscale assessing cancer pain management self-efficacy with higher scores indicating more certainty and is adapted from a scale that has been successfully administered to adolescents.</description>
