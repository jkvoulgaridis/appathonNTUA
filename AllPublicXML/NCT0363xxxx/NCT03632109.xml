  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified antimicrobial-resistant (AMR)
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) as one of the nation's top three urgent AMR threats. Since the
      advent of antibiotics in the 1930s, NG has developed resistance to every first-line
      antibiotic. Parenteral third-generation cephalosporins are now the only class of drug with
      consistent efficacy against NG. New therapies are urgently needed. Although some novel
      antimicrobials are under development, reevaluating older drugs is another option for quickly
      identifying additional treatments for gonorrhea. We propose a demonstration study to test a
      single dose of gentamicin for the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. We chose to focus on
      pharyngeal gonorrhea because these infections are common, play an important role in fostering
      gonococcal resistance, and are harder to eradicate than genital infections. Although
      gentamicin is 91% efficacious for genital NG, its efficacy at the pharynx may be less since
      streptomycin, another aminoglycoside previously used to treat gonorrhea, was not effective
      for pharyngeal NG. It is unknown if streptomycin's poor efficacy is indicative of limitations
      of aminoglycosides as a class. We plan to enroll 60 men who have sex with men in a
      demonstration study to be conducted at the Seattle &amp; King County STD Clinic to test the
      efficacy of 360 mg of gentamicin given intramuscularly for pharyngeal gonorrhea. Secondary
      objectives include determining the ideal pharmacodynamic criterion (comparing in vitro
      minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of NG to peak gentamicin serum levels), estimating
      resistance induction among treatment failures, and assessing the tolerability of 360 mg of IM
      gentamicin.

      Objectives

      The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a single intramuscular (IM) dose of
      gentamicin in the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. Secondary objectives include documenting
      the efficacy stratified by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared with the
      gentamicin peak level in order to estimate a pharmacodynamic criterion. We will also attempt
      to determine whether gentamicin monotherapy induces antimicrobial resistance among treatment
      failures. Lastly, we will evaluate the tolerability of 360 mg of IM gentamicin, stratified by
      subject weight (i.e. weight based dosing). The specific aims are:

        1. Determine the proportion of persons whose pharyngeal gonococcal infections are cured
           with a single dose of 360mg gentamicin intramuscularly alone.

        2. Evaluate the renal safety and tolerability of 360mg IM of gentamicin.

        3. Document mean peak gentamicin levels following 360mg IM of gentamicin stratified by
           weight.

        4. Estimate the best pharmacodynamics criterion (i.e. peak/MIC ratio) for pharyngeal
           gonorrhea treated with gentamicin using individual and mean peak gentamicin levels and
           NG isolate MIC.

        5. Among treatment failures, conduct exploratory analyses comparing pre- and post-treatment
           MIC for evidence of induced resistance.
