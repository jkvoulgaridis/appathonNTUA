    <textblock>
      Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled, Crossover, in which 68 subjects (34 males and 34
      females) will receive, in each stage, an application of 4 UI, subcutaneous, single dose, of
      the investigational drug (Recombinant Human Somatropin - Biomatrop) and the comparator
      (Recombinant Human Somatropin - Hormotrop) according to randomization to evaluate the
      Non-inferiority of Pain Intensity After the Application of Hormotrop, using Visual Analogue
      Scale (0-10cm) and record the incidence of adverse events.
