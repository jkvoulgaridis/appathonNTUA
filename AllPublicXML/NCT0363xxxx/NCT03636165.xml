  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, pediatric postoperative analgesia has not been fully understood and controlled,
      particularly craniotomy surgery. On the one hand, professional evaluation of postoperative
      pain for young children is difficult; on the other hand, the particularity of craniotomy adds
      (such as consciousness obstacle, sleepiness, et al) disturbance to the pain assessment in
      children. Although opioids administration is regarded as the first-line analgesic for
      post-craniotomy pain management, it may be associated with delayed awakening, respiratory
      depression, hypercarbia and it may interfere with the neurologic examination. For the
      avoidance of side-effects of systemic opioids, local anesthetics administered around the
      incision have been performed clinically. However, some studies revealed that the analgesic
      effect of local anesthetics was unsatisfactory due to its short pain relief duration, steroid
      as adjuvant can enhance postoperative analgesia and prolong postoperative analgesia time. As
      is reported that postoperative pain of craniotomy is mainly caused by skin incision and
      reflection of muscles, preventing the liberation of inflammatory mediators around the
      incision seems to be more effective than simply blocking nerve conduction. Thus,
      investigators suppose that pre-emptive scalp infiltration with steroid (Methylprednisolone)
      plus local anesthetic (ropivacaine) could relieve postoperative pain after craniotomy in
      children.
