  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of milademetan tosylate and to
      see how well it works with cytarabine with or without ventoclax in treating participants with
      acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment
      (refractory). Milademetan tosylate and ventoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet
      known if giving milademetan tosylate and low-dose cytarabine with or without ventoclax will
      work better in treating participants with recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability. (Phase 1) II. To determine the recommended phase
      II dose. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the efficacy (by International Working Group [IWG]
      criteria - Phase 2) of the MDM2 inhibitor, milademetan tosylate (DS-3032b), in combination
      with low dose cytarabine (LDAC), with or without the addition of venetoclax in both the
      frontline and in relapsed/refractory (non-TP53 mutant) patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluation of time to response variables including overall survival (OS), event-free
      survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR).

      II. Determine biomarkers that may be predictive of DS-3032b activity. III. Molecular
      profiling at screening, on study, and at relapse to determine genomic predictors of response
      and resistance.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of milademetan tosylate, followed by a
      phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive low dose cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-10 and milademetan tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-14, 8-21, or 5-7 and
      15-17. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive low dose cytarabine SC BID on days 1-10, milademetan tosylate PO QD
      on days 8-14, 8-21, or 5-7 and 15-17, and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-14. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment participants are followed up at 30 days.
