    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in preventing colon adenomas in
      participants with Lynch syndrome and a history of surgery to remove part of the colon.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if maintenance therapy with nivolumab can decrease the incidence of colon
      adenomas in a population of patients with genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer and a
      history of hemicolectomy due to colon cancer or advanced colon adenoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of nivolumab maintenance therapy in this population. II. To obtain
      preliminary data on the short-term incidence of advanced colon adenomas (measuring greater
      than 10 mm or with high-grade dysplasia) and colon and non-colonic cancers in Lynch patients
      treated with maintenance nivolumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine biomarkers of immunologic activity associated with biologic activity of
      nivolumab in this population.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 months for a total of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3 months, every 6 months
      for 1 year, then every 12 weeks thereafter.
