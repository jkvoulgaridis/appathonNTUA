      Primary Objective:

        1. To describe the antibody titers to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and
           W) present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menveo® measured by serum bactericidal assay
           using human complement (hSBA), for Groups 1 and 2 when administered concomitantly with
           routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico

        2. To describe the antibody titers to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and
           W) present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine measured by hSBA, for Group 3, when administered
           concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in the
           Russian Federation

      Secondary Objective:

        1. To describe the hSBA vaccine seroresponse to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A,
           C, Y, and W) for Groups 1 and 2, 30 days after the last vaccination of the infant series
           (Dose 2 of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Dose 3 of Menveo®), when administered
           concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico

        2. To describe the hSBA vaccine seroresponse to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A,
           C, Y, and W) for Group 3, 30 days after the last vaccination of the infant series (Dose
           2 of MenACYW conjugate vaccine), when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric
           vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in the Russian Federation

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0 C*). A prospective subject
             should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile
             event has subsided.
