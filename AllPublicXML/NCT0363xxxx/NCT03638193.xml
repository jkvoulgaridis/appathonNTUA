  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in which pancreatic cancer patients receive a immunotherapy with CART-meso
      cells administered at 3 days after one dose of cyclophosphamide. CART-meso cells are
      patients' own T cells lentivirally transduced to express anti-mesothelin scFv fused to TCRζ
      and 4-1BB costimulatory domains.The lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide may prolong the
      persistence of CART cells.

      This study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy with
      CART-meso cells in dose escalation design. The trial will begin in Cohort 1 and progress to
      Cohorts 2, depending upon dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment .

      Subjects will be enrolled serially, but infusions will be staggered to allow assessment of
      DLTs for determination of cohort progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.

      Cohort 1 subjects will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced CART-meso
      cells after conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Cohort 2 subjects will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced CART-meso
      cells cells after conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Dose limiting toxicity is defined as any adverse reactions at level 3 or above that may be
      associated with CART-meso within 4 weeks after infusion.

    <description>CART-meso is a 2nd CAR, with mesothelin as target protein, 4-1BB as co- stimulator. The infusion will be scheduled to occur 3 (±1) days after a single dose of 1.5 grams/m^2 of cyclophosphamide, which will be administered according to standard procedures, Thereby enhancing the efficacy of anti-tumor, reducing the potential of side effects.</description>
