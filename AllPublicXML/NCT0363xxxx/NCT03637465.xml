    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial with n=28 City of Philadelphia recreation
      centers (14 matched pairs) designed to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive
      multi-level intervention to increase water access and appeal in community recreation centers
      on 1) center-level water intake as measured by water meters, and 2) purchase of outside
      beverages as measured by observations of recreation center youth.

    <intervention_model_description>This cluster RCT involves 14 matched pairs; study recruitment and randomization occurs at the recreation center-level. Participating sites are matched based on center size, summer program enrollment, presence of indoor gym, neighborhood income &amp; race/ethnicity. Then, an intervention site and control site are randomly determined by a coin flip within each pair.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hydrate Philly is a multi-component intervention that includes water safety testing, provision of 1-2 hydration stations per recreation center, distribution of reusable water bottles for youth, a campaign to promote the acceptability of tap water, and the reduction of access to competing unhealthy beverages through vending machine standards and discouraging &quot;black bags&quot; (characteristic small, black, plastic bags provided to customers with their corner store purchases, typically including a sugar sweetened beverage and/or unhealthy snack foods).</description>
