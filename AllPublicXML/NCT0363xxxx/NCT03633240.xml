  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's population is living longer than prior generations. Senior patients, defined as 65
      years or older, are therefore increasing in number, and representing a larger number of
      hospitalized patients. Thus, assessing and addressing the needs of the growing number of
      older ER users is essential. The overall objective of the study is to examine the feasibility
      and the epidemiology of two screening tools (&quot;Programme de Recherche sur l'Intégration des
      Services pour le Maintien de l'Autonomie&quot; (PRISMA-7) and Emergency Room Evaluation and
      recommendations (ER2)) used in the Emergency Room of Jewish General Hospital to screen older
      patients (i.e.; ≥65 years) at risk of adverse health events. A prospective observational
      cohort design will be used for the study's two phases; phase 1- assessment and phase 2-
      assessment as well as recommendations.

    <description>To measure the effects of recommendations of ER2, the investigators will use ER users who will have an ER2 assessment without any recommendations as the referent group the older. This choice is possible because ER2 will be integrated into ER care in two steps:
The first step will be limited to its assessment component in order to learn how to use the tool.
The second step will be to follow the recommendations provided after the assessment.
Participants will follow-up during their hospitalization via a review of their chart. They will be censored when they will be discharged from the JGH or when the duration of hospitalization will exceed 31 days.</description>

        They will be separated in four main groups:

          1. Those without any PRISMA-7 and ER2.

          2. Those with PRISMA-7 and without ER2.

          3. Those with ER2 and without PRISMA-7.

          4. Those with PRISMA-7 and ER2. Each group of participants with PRISMA-7 and ER2 will be
             divided in two subgroups: those with all items completed and a score, and those with
             incomplete tools.
