  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a severe form of endometriosis in which lesions
      affect retroperitoneal tissue and pelvic organs wall. It is often a cause of significant pain
      (dysmenorrhea, dysuria, dyspnea, dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain) and infertility,
      drastically reducing patients' quality of life.

      Surgical therapy with complete removal of endometriotic lesions is often necessary when the
      disease is resistant to medical therapy.

      The minimally invasive surgical approach has proved to be the most advantageous.

      Over time, there has been a growing use in the gynecological field of robot-assisted
      laparoscopic surgery.

      Several clinical cases and retrospective studies on robotic surgery for DIE have highlighted
      favorable surgical outcomes, with the exception of operative times, compared to standard
      laparoscopic approach.

      However, a randomized control studies comparing surgical outcomes and postoperative pelvic
      organs function in women with DIE submitted to robotic-assisted or conventional laparoscopy
      is missing.

      In order to analyze the real impact of robotic advances the present study sought to assess
      surgical outcomes and urinary, bowel and sexual functions in women with DIE requiring
      minimally invasive surgery through robot-assisted or conventional lps approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with clinical and trans-vaginal / abdominal ultrasound diagnosis of deep
      endometriosis, undergoing surgery for the removal of endometriotic lesions are included in
      the study.

      Patients are divided into 2 groups:

      Group A: standard laparoscopic approach

      Group B: robot-assisted approach

      After surgery, patients will be included in the post-operative follow-up, as usual in our
      clinical practice.

    <description>Evaluation and comparison of sexual function in patients underwent standard laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery before and after surgery, using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The FSFI is a validated questionnaire useful to measure sexual functioning in women. It was developed for the specific purpose of assessing domains of sexual functioning (e.g. sexual arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, pain) in clinical trials. The full scale score range goes from a minimum of 2.0 to a maximum of 36.0.</description>

    <description>Evaluation and comparison of urinary symptoms in patients underwent standard laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery before and after surgery, using the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (BFLUTS) questionnaire. It is a validated questionnaire with 3 subscale scores for incontinence symptoms (BFLUTS-IS) (range from 0 to 20), voiding symptoms (BFLUTS-VS) (range from 0 to 12), and filling symptoms (BFLUTS-FS) (range from 0 to 15), with the addition of single subscales for sexual function (BFLUTS-sex) (range from 0 to 6) and quality of life (BFLUTSQoL) (range from 0 to 18).</description>

    <description>Evaluation and comparison of bowel symptoms in patients underwent standard laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery before and after surgery, using the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire (KESS). The KESS is a validated questionnaire for diagnosis of constipation. KESS has an added advantage of differentiating between various subtypes of constipation. Total scores can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 39 (high symptom severity). A cut-off score of &gt; 11 indicates constipation.</description>

    <description>Evaluation and comparison of disease recurrence rate in patients underwent standard laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery before and after surgery.
Endometriosis recurrence can have different levels: symptoms recurrence based on patient history (VAS pain score ≥ 5), but no proof of recurrence by imaging and/or surgery; endometriosis recurrence based on non-invasive imaging in patients with or without symptoms; recurrence of histologically proven endometriosis: when the patient is re-operated, endometriosis is visually observed and confirmed histologically.</description>
