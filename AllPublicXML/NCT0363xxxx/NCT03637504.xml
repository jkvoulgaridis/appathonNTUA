  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study to evaluate the
      feasibility of an innovative medication adherence intervention utilizing a web-based, mobile
      medication management application [MedActionPlan® (MAP)] to encourage self-management by
      reinforcing adherence and education about treatment regimens in Participants with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) (ages 12 years and older).

      Outcomes of interest for this study are 1) feasibility of MAP in real-world setting which
      will be evaluated using patient/caregiver and clinician feedback regarding value, ease of
      use, and challenges with use, 2) effect of MAP on patient/caregiver knowledge and perception
      of medication use, 3) effect of MAP on adherence to inhaled and oral medications used in
      chronic management of CF. Preliminary data regarding outcomes on exacerbations, lung
      function, and health care system utilization (e.g., emergency department visits,
      hospitalization) will also be examined as part of this study.

    <description>This measure was developed for this specific study to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of patient use through aspects of usability and quality (engagement, usefulness, functionality/ease of use, aesthetics, information, and satisfaction) of the web portal and application. Assessed by 5 point Likert Scale: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree or Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Knowledge of Disease Management-CF questionnaire (KDM-CF) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This validated measure was developed for studies of adherence and disease management. It assesses the practical knowledge of patients with CF. The measure evaluates knowledge of disease management in four areas (general health, lung health, nutrition, treatments).Data regarding changes in knowledge (using KDM-CF), from baseline to end of study visit, will be analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Data regarding changes in knowledge (using KDM-CF and CF-MQ) between groups (Intervention vs. Control) will be analyzed using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in CF Medication Belief Questionnaire (CF-MBQ) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Developed and validated to measure impact of interventions on specific social cognitive beliefs. Data regarding perception of medications (using CF-MBQ), from baseline to end of study, will be analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Data regarding perception of medications (using CF-MBQ), between groups (Intervention vs. Control), will be analyzed using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The CF-MBQ has 60 questions. There are five domains for this measure: motivation, self-efficacy, perceived importance of medication, and decisional balance to take or miss medications. Questions related to self-efficacy, motivation and importance items use a scale from 1 to 10. Questions related to decisional balance use a scale based on a 1 to 5 scale. Scores for each subscale's items will be summed and divided by the number of items to produce an average score ranging from 1 to 10 (self-efficacy, motivation and importance) OR 1 to 5 (decisional balance).</description>

    <measure>Mean change in adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the preliminary effect of MAP on medication adherence from data collected from AdhereTech pill bottles and eTrack nebulizers that will be scored as a 'per drug analysis' of adherence with a ratio of competed to total prescribed doses in the study period. A composite score will be determined based on prescribed medications and medication/doses taken.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in CF Medication Questionnaire (CF-MQ) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to approximately week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Developed to assess Patient Participant knowledge about prescribed CF medications including purpose, dose, and administration. Question items will evaluate knowledge of medication purpose, administration, dose, and dosing frequency. Correct response for dose and dosing frequency will be based on each patient's prescribed regimen. Questions regarding medication purposes and appropriate administration each have 1 correct answer. Total score will be defined as proportion of correct items to total items asked. Each Patient Participant will only be asked about items that are associated with that Patient Participant's prescribed treatment plan. Total score for a Participant will not be calculated if greater than 20% of the items are missing responses.</description>
