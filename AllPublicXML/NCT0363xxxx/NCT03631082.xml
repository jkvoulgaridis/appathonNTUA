    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine the effects of slump stretching vs lumbar
      mobilization with exercises in relieving non-radiculating low back pain. There will be two
      groups; Group I will receive Slump stretching along with standardized exercises and Group II
      will receive Lumbar mobilizations along with standardized exercises.

      Physical therapist commonly examines and treats patients with low back pain. For this
      purpose, they utilize a wide range of interventions for the management of Low back pain.

      The rhythmical movement is thought to modulate pain and muscle spasm by stimulating receptors
      within the mobilized structures while, In recent years, neurodynamic test procedures, have
      also been used as interventions to potentially resolve abnormal physiology within the nervous
      system.

      So for this purpose not only the present study can provide an additional evidence to the
      literature but also can can also demonstrates a structured Physiotherapy plan for treating
      the Non-Radiculating Low back pain

    <intervention_model_description>The two groups will be Slump stretching group and Lumbar mobilization group. All physical therapy techniques in both groups will be applied 3 times in a week up to 2 weeks with each session consisting of 25-40 minutes.
Group 1 will receive slump stretching along with standardized exercises while group 2 will recieve lumbar mobilization along with standardized exercises.
Demographic details of the patients will be collected at baseline (1st Visit) while Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire,Numeric pain rating scale,Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire,Active range of motion (AROM) of lumbar spine and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) will be measured at baseline, 1st week, and final week.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Slump stretching will be performed with the patient in the long sitting position. The position will be held for 30 seconds. A total of 5 repetitions will be completed.
Patients will also complete a standardized exercise program consisting of pelvic tilts, bridging, wall squats, and quadruped alternate arms/legs activities as described by Cleland et al.
Patients will perform 10 repetitions of each exercise.</description>
