      Prospective Open-label Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial. high-risk preterm pregnancy
      is that there are at least one history of spontaneous preterm birth and/or late abortion
      before 34+0 weeks, for high-risk pregnant women that meet the inclusion criteria, the early
      treatment with cerclage pessary at 12-18weeks compare with routine treatment. The patients
      will be informed of the intended therapeutic effect and possible side effects. If they agree
      and after obtaining their informed consent, they will be randomized to test group (cerclage
      pessary group) and control group (Utrogestan group).
