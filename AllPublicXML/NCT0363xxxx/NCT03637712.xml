    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the role of machine learning and computer
      aided diagnostics in automatic polyp detection and to determine whether a combination of
      colonoscopy and an automatic polyp detection software is a feasible way to increase adenoma
      detection rate compared to standard colonoscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting for routine colonoscopy for screening and/or surveillance
             purposes.

          -  Ability to provide written, informed consent and understand the responsibilities of
             trial participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People with diminished cognitive capacity.

          -  The subject is pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the study period.

          -  Patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy (e.g. as an evaluation for active GI bleed)

          -  Patients with incomplete colonoscopies (those where endoscopists did not successfully
             intubate the cecum due to technical difficulties or poor bowel preparation)

          -  Patients that have standard contraindications to colonoscopy in general (e.g.
             documented acute diverticulitis, fulminant colitis and known or suspected
             perforation).

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Patients with any polypoid/ulcerated lesion &gt; 20mm concerning for invasive cancer on
             endoscopy.
