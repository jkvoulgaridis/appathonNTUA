  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for leading people, managing work, and governing organizations never changed over
      the civilization paths of society. However, people in every pole of the globe observe:
      over-led and under-managed, over-managed and under-governed, and even out of these
      organizations. These disparities have remained worse in the health system of developing
      countries like Ethiopia.

      To date, Ethiopia put a goal of ending preventable child and maternal death, in achieving
      universal healthcare by 2035. Nevertheless, the investment on integrated leadership,
      management and governance is limited.

      Therefore, this study hypothesize that institutional delivery are expressively linked with
      integrated health system leading, managing and governing for results model among health
      facilities staff in northwest Ethiopia?

      The investment on integrated health system leading, managing and governing for result model
      narrow down health system gaps.

      The need to integrate these three distinct, but not hostile paths is that mostly: leading is
      people oriented process, managing is task oriented process and governing is organization
      oriented path.

      Moreover, these paths are reflected even in a single person, task, or organization. Thus,
      testing and implementing integrated model is cost effective.
