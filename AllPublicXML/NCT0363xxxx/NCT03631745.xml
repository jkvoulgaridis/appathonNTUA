      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial of a Latino church-based intervention in
      Los Angeles and Riverside Counties. This study aims to leverage the collective resources of
      Latino religious congregations and the National Alliance on Mental Illness to test the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention directed at reducing stigma, increasing
      mental health literacy, and improving access to mental health services.

      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial of a Latino church-based intervention in
      Los Angeles and Riverside Counties. This study aims to leverage the collective resources of
      Latino religious congregations and the National Alliance on Mental Illness to test the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention directed at reducing stigma, increasing
      mental health literacy, and improving access to mental health services. A total of 12
      churches (6 intervention and 6 wait-list control) will be enrolled in the study. Churches
      within each study site, the Riverside County parishes and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
      will be matched in pairs based on size and geography. Three matched pairs from each study
      site will be randomly selected and then randomly assigned within each pair to intervention or
      control. The planned study will involve 2400 participants (1200 intervention and 1200
      control) who will be part of congregations that are randomly assigned to receive the
      church-based intervention immediately or a wait list control condition. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up to evaluate intervention
      effects on mental health service use and potential mediators (i.e., mental health literacy,
      stigma).

    <intervention_model_description>The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of California has developed Mental Health 101, a suite of contact-based education programs tailored for culturally diverse populations including Latino populations. Another NAMI program, FaithNet, provides resources and training on how churches can shape norms and overcome shame and stigma related to mental illness and treatment. NAMI FaithNet also assists with facilitating linkages to mental health services from providing referrals to partner mental health agencies to forming multi-sector collaboratives of social service organizations, clergy, and mental health providers to create a more holistic, coordinated system of care. The multi-component, church-based, intervention will build on NAMI's existing resources, with tailoring for Latino church-based settings.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Change in mental health service use among participants in intervention churches versus those in control churches.
Mental health service use will be measured with the following modified item from the California Health Interview Survey: &quot;In the past 12 months have you seen a professional, such as a counselor, psychiatrist, or social worker for problems with your mental health, emotions, nerves, or your use of alcohol or drugs?&quot;
Response options are dichotomous (Yes/No).

    <description>Change in stigma among participants in intervention churches versus those in control churches. Personal stigma will be assessed with social distance measures, one of the most widely used indicators of stigma. Social distance is assessed by asking respondents to rate their degree of willingness to interact with someone with a mental illness in various interpersonal situations (e.g., work closely on a job; live next door; spend an evening socializing; marry into the family; as a friend).
