    <measure>Quality of life score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the QLQC30 (Quality of Life questionnaire) questionnaire.
It is a specific questionnaire to determine the quality of life a patient with cancer. It is composed of 30 questions with 4 potential answers going from: not at all, a little, enough or a lot, within 28 questions and with a visual scale going from 1 to 7 (7 being excellent and 1 being very bad) for the last 2 questions. The raw score is established by adding the score of each question and a linear transformation range it from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the worse the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>IPSS score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary function will be assessed using the IPSS (International Prostate Score Symptom) questionnaire.
The IPSS questionnaire is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35. The score is then categorized as follow: Mild (symptoms score less than or equal to 7), Moderate (symptom score range 8-19), Severe (symptom score range 20-35). The higher the score, the worse the symptoms.</description>

    <description>Sexual function will be assessed using the IIEF-5 (The International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaire.
The IIEF-5 Questionnaire is composed of 5 items with 5 possible answers rating from 1 to 5 (very low, low, moderate, high, very high).
The score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 56 items. It is then categorized as follow: 22-25: No erectile dysfunction, 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction, 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction, 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction. The higher the score, the better the sexual function.</description>
