  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Electronic cigarettes (EC) mainly containing nicotine (88-95 % of users) are widely and
      growingly used worldwide. It is estimated that there were 1.7 million daily users in France
      in 2016. Although the number of publications about its use is increasing exponentially, there
      are no evidence based, unbiased, head-to-head comparison data about its efficacy as an aid to
      smoking cessation. As of today, only two head-to-head randomized studies have been published,
      both reported negative results at the main endpoint but they used first and second generation
      EC delivering nicotine with low or unknown bioavailability. Recent EC deliver nicotine with
      largely improved bioavailability.

      One of the randomized studies compared EC with and without nicotine to nicotine patch and
      reported similar smoking cessation rate at main outcome. However, there is no published,
      double blind study comparing EC use with a well-studied, licensed smoking cessation
      medication.

      Superiority of EC with nicotine compared to EC without nicotine and to a reference smoking
      cessation medication while collecting also straightforward information about safety, would
      allow proposing EC with nicotine to the large population of smokers who intend to quit and
      situate it among the approved smoking cessation treatments.

      The clinical study's hypothesis:

      EC containing nicotine can be considered as a nicotine replacement therapy having, probably,
      a better bioavailability of nicotine than the marketed pharmaceutical NRTs, first line
      medications of smoking cessation. It is therefore of interest to compare EC containing
      nicotine to EC without nicotine but also to a reference medication with demonstrated efficacy
      in smoking cessation. We hypothesize that EC with nicotine provides a higher smoking
      abstinence rate than EC without nicotine and may be as good as varenicline, our reference
      medication.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, multicenter, double dummy, parallel groups, phase
      III type pivotal trial.

      Included participants are randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups:

      A) Control group: Electronic cigarette without nicotine (ECwoN) plus placebo tablets of
      varenicline: placebo condition B) Experimental group: Electronic cigarette with nicotine
      (ECwN) plus placebo tablets of varenicline: ECwN condition C) Reference group: ECwoN plus
      varenicline tablets: varenicline condition Ratio: A:B:C= 1:3:3 Each participant uses an EC
      and 2x2 tablets per day. Group allocation is stratified by age at cut off of 45 years.

      Enrolment is initiated by two ways:

      • Potential participants aware of the study register at the study's recruitment website; call
      in or send an email followed by a phone screen. The screening starts with the participant's
      information about the study's aims, constraints, benefits and risks. A maximum one week delay
      of reflection is allowed if the potential participant is asking for a delay to sign his/her
      consent form.

      After screening, an appointment for the inclusion visit is provided at the closest
      investigation center.

      • Referred or self-referred potential participants consulting for smoking cessation are
      proposed an inclusion visit.

      The participant is informed that in this study, the smoking cessation shall occur within 15
      days following the signature of the written consent.

      Baseline visit = inclusion visit = V0 The Inclusion visit can immediately follow the
      screening visit if the participant does not need time for reflection.

      The investigator checks the inclusion and exclusion criteria and if the participant is
      conform to them, the investigator collects informed written consent from the participant and
      he/she is included in the trial. The randomization can immediately follow the inclusion.

      A target quit date (TQD) is defined together with the participant. The TQD defines the date
      when the randomized participant stops smoking. This is the starting date of the post-quit
      period. Start of treatment should occur within 7 days after the randomization visit.

      All treatments are launched one week before the TQD. During this period smoking conventional
      cigarettes is allowed.

      Follow-up visits : Visit 1 to Visit 6 Target quit date (TQD) should occur between 7 and 15
      days after randomization. The first post-quit date visit (Visit 1)is at Week 2 after TQD i.e.
      3 weeks after treatment initiation = Day 21 after treatment initiation.

      Visit 2 is at Week 4 after TQD i.e. 5 weeks after treatment initiation = Day 35 after
      treatment initiation.

      Visit 3 is at Week 8 after TQD i.e. 9 weeks after treatment initiation = Day 63 after
      treatment initiation.

      Visit 4 is at Week 10 after TQD i.e. 11 weeks after treatment initiation = Day 77 after
      treatment initiation.

      Visit 5 is at Week 12 after TQD i.e. 13 weeks after treatment initiation = Day 91 after
      treatment initiation.

      Visit 6 is at Week 24 after TQD i.e. 25 weeks after treatment initiation = Day 175 after
      treatment initiation.

      The visits should be realized +/- 5 days with respect to the planned date of the visits.

      End of study visit The end of research visit is the Visit 6, at week 24 after TQD. This visit
      is identical to the previous follow up visits.

    <description>The ECwN group use EC liquids containing 0 mg/mL of nicotine. Because nicotine delivery can be adjusted according to the user's need, all participants are able to adjust their individual nicotine dose by varying the wattage of their EC, by varying puff frequency and puff volume similarly as they are doing (or used to do) with conventional cigarettes.
EC device:
Mini iStick kit (20 W) Eleaf Clearomiser :GS Air M with resistance of 1.5 ohm, the clearomiser's Pyrex window is of blue colour not allowing to distinguish an eventual coloration of the e-liquid containing nicotine. Liquids for EC use are delivered in white opaque 10 mL vials not allowing to distinguish the color of the liquid.
