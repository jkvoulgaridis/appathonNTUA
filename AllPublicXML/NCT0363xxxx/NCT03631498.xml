  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is a major environmental risk factor associated with common forms of human chronic
      periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate apoptotic tissue alterations and
      tissue destruction in smoker and non-smoker chronic periodontitis patients and healthy
      individuals. The investigators of the study suggest that smoking decrease tissue quality and
      increase inflammation level in gingival tissues in both healthy individuals and periodontitis
      patients. One possible mechanism for this is suggested to be increased apoptosis.

    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease disrupts soft tissue metabolism in the gingiva through a decrease in the
      production of collagen, the quality, and quantity of the connective tissue. The etiology and
      pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis are mostly revealed, however, the mechanism of
      environmental factors such as smoking yet to be clarified. Major consequences of smoking in
      gingival tissues are suggested to be the reduction in neutrophil and fibroblast function,
      decreased immunoglobulin G production, increased periodontal pathogen bacteria prevalence,
      difficulty in eliminating pathogens with mechanical therapy, and reduction in growth factor
      production. In the present study, markers of tissue destruction, matrix metalloproteinase-8
      and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, hypoxia markers, vascular endothelial
      growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor and apoptotic markers, bax, bcl-2, and caspase-3
      were evaluated.

        Healthy individuals who were either smokers or non-smokers, chronic periodontitis patients
        who were either smokers or non-smokers older than 30 years old and younger than 50 years
        old were enrolled. The age was specifically chosen because aging changes periodontal and
        gingival tissues independently of other variables. Any possible factor which might alter
        connective tissue metabolism were excluded.
