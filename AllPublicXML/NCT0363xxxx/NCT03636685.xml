  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China，and
      platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for the wild-type
      NSCLC,however the overall survival still less than one year.Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor
      of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2、VEGFR3、PDGFRβ and c-Kit, which
      has strong effect of anti-angiogenesis.This study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of the combination regimen of anlotinib plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line
      treatment for NSCLC.
