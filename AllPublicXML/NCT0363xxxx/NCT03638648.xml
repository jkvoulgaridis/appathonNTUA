  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The luminal subtype of breast cancer means hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 negative (HR+HER2-), which counted 60%-70% of breast cancer but achieve low
      pathologic complete response (pCR) rate (7.5%-15%) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is
      controversial whether additional chemotherapy after surgery is necessary for those non-pCR
      HR+HER2- patients. Multiple gene is a mature diagnose tool for recurrence score in adjuvant
      treatment strategy. This study is to investigating the value of multi gene detection tool
      based recurrence score for guiding additional chemotherapy after surgery in HR+HER2- non-pCR
      breast cancer.

      This study is designed as stratified cluster randomized, parallel-control research. The
      HR+HER2- breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including anthracyclines and
      taxane, at least 6 cycles) assessed non-pCR are recruited, receiving multiple gene test
      before neoadjuvant treatment and after surgery. After enrollment, the patients were
      stratified according to multiple gene test based recurrence risk level (High risk or Low
      risk) and then randomized into two groups respectively in each cluster: receiving additional
      chemotherapy (Capecitabine) group or negative control group. The primary endpoint is 2-year
      disease free survival. The second endpoint is 5-year disease free survival (DFS), 2-year
      overall survival (OS), 5-year OS, safety of additional chemotherapy. The exploratory endpoint
      is the variety of multiple gene test based recurrence risk after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      non-pCR patients.
