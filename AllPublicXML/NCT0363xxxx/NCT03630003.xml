  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to gather initial information about the testing of a novel
      manual communication system - which is currently called MOCS, for Manually Operated
      Communicated System - for mechanically ventilated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) subjects. This
      study is not hypothesis based; the goal is to gather data about which interaction modes and
      teaching approaches of MOCS are most intuitive for subjects and caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions constitute a major part of hospital activity and
      resource allocation, and the number of patient days in ICUs and on mechanical ventilation is
      increasing. More than 5 million patients are admitted to an ICU annually in the United
      States, and approximately 55,000 critically ill patients are cared for each day. The most
      common cause for admission is respiratory insufficiency or failure; a study of data from
      2005-2007 estimated that nearly 40 percent of ICU patients require mechanical ventilation.

      Patients experience frequent emotional and psychiatric complications from ICU stays,
      including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. One 2011 study found a
      prevalence of &quot;clinically significant&quot; depressive symptoms ranging from 17 percent to 43
      percent among post-ICU patients. In 2013, it was reported that up to 50 percent of patients
      experience general anxiety symptoms one year after discharge, a rate much higher than in the
      broader US population.

      Patients who temporarily lose the ability to speak report a high level of frustration. A
      study of 127 patients reported that, &quot;two stressors, being intubated and not being able to
      talk, were significantly more stressfulâ€¦ than all the other stressors. The mean stressfulness
      score for [25] other stressors was between no distress and mild distress.&quot; Improving subject
      communication with ICU care team will likely require better technological interventions, and
      current best practice for assessing the optimal patient communication method is dependent on
      the evaluation of an experienced speech-language pathologist (SLP). Current approaches are
      insufficient for patient's needs, as one representative study described: &quot;Patients rated 40%
      of the communication sessions with nurses as somewhat difficult to extremely difficult.
      Assistive communication strategies were uncommon, with little to no use of assistive
      communication materials (e.g., writing supplies, alphabet or word boards).&quot; Designing an
      effective mode of communication for ICU patients unable to speak due to mechanical
      ventilation will likely improve patient's experiences and, potentially, long-term outcomes.

      Some limited technologies exist to address these issues; however, they are not in widespread
      use due to a variety of reasons, including cost, lack of intuitiveness, and design that is
      not appropriate for the ICU setting. The investigators are designing a technological solution
      to assist ICU subjects in communicating with their caregivers, particularly nurses. The
      investigators are planning to do the initial testing of MOCS in the adult ICUs at the UMass
      Medical Center (Memorial and University ICUs) or at MGH (Bigelow 13, Lunder 6, Blake 7, Blake
      12, or Ellison 4).

      The purpose of this stage of the project is to determine whether the device that has been
      designed in the previous study will be suitable for the needs of patients, families, and
      nurses. The investigators will be measuring duration of use, frequency and type of
      engagement, and mechanical stability.

    <description>Patients, nurses, and family members will be asked to indicate their level of satisfaction with the communication software using a homegrown instrument to assess usability (modeled partly on the System Usability Scale, or SUS). Four questions are derived from the SUS; they assess likelihood of recommending, ease of use, ease of learning, and perceived ability to use the system for communication. Each of these questions are assessed on a 1-5 scale, with higher values representing a better outcome. The subscales of these questions are averaged to reach a total score.</description>

    <description>The patients in this arm will be asked to utilize the Manually Operated Communication System (MOCS) device and will then be asked to provide feedback on their experiences.
Subjects will be asked to complete up to 3 sessions using the device. Each session is expected to last between 10 and 30 minutes. If the subject is interested in continuing, the session may last up to one hour.
The study team will perform post-study interviews with each subject to ask about their experience with MOCS. The data collection forms will be filled out during the session by a member of the research team.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are awake with a Glasgow Coma Scale score &gt;10 (Motor 6, Verbal 0-1 [T],
             Eye opening 4) adult subjects at UMass Medical Center (Memorial and University ICUs)
             or at MGH (Bigelow 13, Lunder 6, Blake 7, Blake 12, or Ellison 4) are eligible for
             this study.

          2. Both subjects who are able to speak and subjects who are unable to speak (due to
             intubation or tracheostomy) will be sought to be included in the study, although the
             focus will be on subjects who are unable to speak. (If additional feedback about the
             system from subjects who can speak would be helpful, this type of subject may be
             enrolled.)

          3. Eligible subjects must have a history of being able to understand and communicate in
             written and spoken English, since the device software is in English.

          4. May enroll both adults capable of consent and cognitively impaired adults, who will
             provide assent, if possible, and will have consent given by their legally authorized
             representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:
