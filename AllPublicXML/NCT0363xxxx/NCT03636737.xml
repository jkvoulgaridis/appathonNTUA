  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare disease. She is often under diagnosed and a source of
      diagnostic wandering and inadequate care. Moreover, its association in more than one case out
      of two to a significant underlying pathology, such as inflammatory bowel disease,
      inflammatory rheumatism, or hematology, makes its diagnosis essential. Its pathophysiological
      mechanisms remain controversial and many other comorbidities have been reported in the
      literature, including endocrinological, cardiovascular and metabolic, neoplastic and
      autoimmune comorbidities.

      The objective is to study the field, comorbidities and pathologies associated with PG on a
      series of patients diagnosed with PG, as well as to characterize the clinical and
      histological aspects of lesions.

      A retrospective observational non-interventional multicenter study is proposed. 10 French
      centers. The recruitment will be done via the DIM using coding software: codes L984 , L982
      and L97 according to 2 major criteria (typical clinical appearance with ulceration well
      limited and purulent or pustule hutches, exclusion of differential diagnoses) and at least 2
      minor criteria (among compatible histological aspect, classically compatible associated
      pathologies, corticosensitivity of lesions, pathergie phenomenon, painful lesions).

      Demographic data, clinical appearance of the lesions, cardiovascular and metabolic
      comorbidities, other associated pathologies, histological findings of the ulcer biopsy and
      biological results to describe the population and associated pathologies or comorbidities to
      PG
