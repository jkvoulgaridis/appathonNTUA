  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) is adapted from Football Fans in Training and the
      HealtheStepsâ„¢ lifestyle prescription program. Hockey FIT is a 12-month (3-month active phase
      and 9-month minimally-supported phase) weight loss and healthy lifestyle program for
      middle-aged, overweight/obese male hockey fans, delivered by trained coaches in collaboration
      with teams in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).

      In the proposed study, 32 sites (affiliated with CHL teams and local YMCA branches) will be
      randomly assigned to either immediate delivery (Hockey FIT program) or delayed delivery
      (wait-list control). At each site, 40 male hockey fans at risk for chronic diseases will be
      recruited to take part in the study. Sites assigned to the delayed delivery group will offer
      the Hockey FIT program to their enrolled participants after 12 months.

      Through the Hockey FIT program, the investigators aim to promote weight loss, increase
      physical activity levels, and improve other health measures through a cost-effective solution
      that is acceptable and appealing to men who are overweight or obese.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to reduce preventable chronic diseases in Canadian men by
      improving health behaviours and health indicators. To achieve this goal, following a
      successful pilot study providing strong evidence to proceed with a definitive trial, the
      investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the
      Hockey FIT program.

      The primary specific aim is to conduct an outcome evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of
      Hockey FIT in middle-aged Canadian men who are overweight or obese. Specifically, the
      investigators will: examine whether Hockey FIT (vs. wait-list control) leads to: greater
      weight loss at 12 months (primary outcome), as well as improved health behaviours (PA;
      sedentary time; eating habits) and health indicators (physical measures; health &amp;
      psychosocial measures) at 3 and 12 months.

      Following the pilot study, the investigators will use the affiliation of being a fan of major
      junior hockey teams as a powerful draw to engage men. Sites will be selected based on
      availability of both a major junior team and a YMCA branch located in the city. In total, 32
      Canadian sites will be randomized to the intervention (Hockey FIT program: immediately
      delivery) or comparator (wait-list control: delayed delivery); at each site, 40 men will be
      recruited. Intervention sites will begin Hockey FIT immediately while comparator sites will
      offer Hockey FIT after a 12-month delay. The measurement sessions involving both groups will
      take place at 0 (baseline), 3 and 12 months.
