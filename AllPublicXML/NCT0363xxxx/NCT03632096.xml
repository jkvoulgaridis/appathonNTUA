  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is a quantitative and qualitative alteration of saliva, a symptom present in
      individuals who make continuous use of medications to control chronic diseases, including
      hypertension. Difficulties in mastication, swallowing, phonation and palate are present,
      besides oral burning syndrome, periodontal disease, root caries and bad breath that will
      interfere in the quality of life, making it difficult to socialize in society. Currently, the
      methods presented for treatment of xerostomia are palliative, so their use does not consist
      of an effective treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      photobiomodulation in the production of saliva in patients with xerostomia induced by
      antihypertensive drugs. The method consists in the application of the low intensity laser in
      the three pairs of salivary glands - parotid, submandibular and sublingual. The parameters
      that will be used are: Laser Diode ArGaAl, DMC, 808nm, 4J per point, continuously and in
      contact with the irradiated surface, resulting in irradiance of 3571 mW/cm2, distributed as
      follows: 6 points in each parotid, 2 points in each sublingual (external) and two in each
      submandibular (internal), totaling 16 extra oral and 4 intra oral, totaling 20 points. The
      exposure time will be 40s per point, corresponding to 800s per session and 3600s at the end
      of the four treatment sessions. The radiant exposure will be 142J/cm2. The control group will
      have a simulation of the application of the laser, with the device turned off. Because it is
      an infrared light, it is invisible and this will not induce the patient to notice that the
      device is turned off. In the group that receives the photobiomodulation the device will have
      its timer turned off, to avoid the perception of sound difference. At the end of the
      sessions, a sample of saliva will be collected, which will be compared to the initial sample.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Sialometry (measurement of the amount of produced saliva before and after treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be instructed to keep the head forward allowing all saliva to passively pass through the collection tube, resting on the lower lip, for five minutes. In the last second, the patient will be instructed to spit out all the accumulated saliva in the collection tube. The amount of saliva and foam will be evaluated and properly recorded. Then, the dimethicone (removal of the air bubbles) will be used to obtain the final result. At the end of the photobiomodulation sessions a sample of saliva will be collected to be compared to the initial sample. The measurement will be made as follows: milliliters of saliva produced per minute. For stimulate sialometry, a sialogogue will be used. The quantity will be classified as follows: Production of normal saliva: 1.5 to 3.0 ml/minute; Light hyposalivation: from 1.05 to 1.45 ml/minute; Moderate hyposalivation: 0.55 to 1.0 ml/minute; Severe hyposalivation: from 0.05 to 0.50 ml/minute; Sialorrhea: above 3.0 ml/min.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 3 applications of low intensity light directly in the region of the three pairs of salivary glands already described. The ArGaAl diode laser, DMC 808nm 4J/point equipment will be used. The parameters that will be used are: Laser Diode ArGaAl, DMC, 808nm, 4J per point, continuously and in contact with the irradiated surface, resulting in irradiance of 3571 mW/cm2, distributed as follows: 6 points in each parotid, 2 points in each sublingual (external) and two in each submandibular (internal), totaling 16 extra oral and 4 intra oral, totaling 20 points. The exposure time will be 40s per point, corresponding to 800s per session and 3600s at the end of the four treatment sessions. The radiant exposure will be 142J/cm2. The first application will be after the stimulated collection of saliva and the following applications will be given once a week for another 2 weeks.</description>
