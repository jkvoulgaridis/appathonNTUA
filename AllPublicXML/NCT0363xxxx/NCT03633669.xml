  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a
      condition that causes inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The disease goes through
      periods of remission and flare. Biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin have been proposed as a
      tool to monitor disease activity. Fecal calprotectin is a test that measures the amount of
      inflammation in the stool. Monitoring fecal calprotectin levels can assist
      gastroenterologists in making decisions regarding patients' IBD treatment such as whether to
      increase the dose of medications. A recent study showed that frequent measurement of fecal
      calprotectin every 3 months, also called the tight-control strategy, was associated with
      improved clinical outcomes in IBD patients. The purpose of this study is to assess whether
      the tight-control monitoring strategy, which includes fecal calprotectin monitoring every 3
      months, improves clinical outcomes in IBD when performed in the real world compared to
      routine clinical practice.
