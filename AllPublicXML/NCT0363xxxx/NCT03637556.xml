  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-period cross-over, patient-pilot study evaluating the safety,
      overall tolerability, and preliminary evidence of DST-0509 (investigational deferasirox
      tablets) iron chelating activity compared to commercial Jadenu or Exjade in adult and
      pediatric patients (≥6 years) patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT),
      major or intermedia, with iron overload and inadequate response to their current iron
      chelation therapy (ICT).

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, two-period cross-over, patient-pilot study that is
      enrolling adult and pediatric patients (≥6 years) with TDT and iron overload who are
      currently receiving iron chelation therapy (ICT) with Jadenu or Exjade and demonstrating
      inadequate response. Inadequate response is defined as serum ferritin levels that are
      persistently &gt;800 mcg/L, determined by 2 separate assessments over the previous 2-4 weeks and
      not showing a decreasing trend over these weeks. Patients should also have an LIC of &gt;5 mg
      Fe/g dw measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 52 weeks prior to study entry and
      are receiving the maximal dose range of oral commercial deferasirox (DFX), Jadenu: 21-28
      mg/kg or Exjade: 30-40 mg/kg. Patients should be medication compliant in the opinion of the
      Investigator and willing to comply with treatment in the study.

      This study is is a multi-center, open-label, two-period cross-over, patient-pilot study

      comparing DST-0509 to patient's prior ICT (Exjade or Jadenu) administered orally once daily
      (QD) for 28-days in each period, with a 7-day washout before the first treatment period,
      between treatment periods, and at the end of the study before patients recommence their
      prescription regimens. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences: DST
      0509→Exjade/Jadenu or Exjade/Jadenu→DST-0509 (with subjects who were taking Exjade prior to
      study start receiving Exjade and those taking Jadenu at study start receiving Jadenu). This
      study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, evidence of iron chelating activity,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of DST-0509 compared to Jadenu or Exjade in inadequately
      responding patients.

      Up to 36 patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment sequences (study arms), of
      which up to 100% may be on Jadenu or Exjade at study entry, or a mix of the two. The planned
      randomization will assign up to 18 patients in each of two sequences: Sequence A: DST-0509
      crossed to Exjade or Jadenu; Sequence B: Jadenu or Exjade crossed to DST-0509. The comparator
      treatment will be the patient's current chelation treatment. At the end of the study,
      patients previously on Jadenu or Exjade will revert to receiving their pre-study medication
      and dose following a 7-day washout period.

    <description>Exjade is commercially available as tablets and Exjade as tablets for oral suspension and will be provided by the patient with their ongoing prescription. Dosing will be at equivalent (mg for mg) doses of DST-0509 or Jadenu. If converting from Exjade, the dose will be scaled for each treatment by 28 mg/40 mg (treatment/Exjade). Jadenu and Exjade are taken once daily, Jadenu is taken with or without a light meal, and Exjade is recommended to be taken without food. However, either Jadenu or Exjade can be administered according to the patient's current prescription regimen.
