  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), a plasma transglutaminase, is known as the final enzyme of
      the coagulation cascade, responsible for a cross-linking of fibrin to strengthen blood clot.
      It also minimizes fibrin degradation by its cross-linking it with alfa2-antiplasmin
      molecules. It has been found that similar to plasma fibrinogen level, FXIII activity can be
      reduced in the early phase of severe trauma. Therefore, its immediate substitution is of
      potential therapeutic interest in trauma-induced coagulopathy. However, unlike plasma
      fibrinogen level evaluation, measurement of the FXIII activity is not routinely available.
      Therefore, targeted substitution of FXIII is practically impossible. The plasma fibrinogen
      level is routinely measured in severe trauma patients. Based on pathophysiologic assumptions
      and a limited number of published data we hypothesize that the FXIII activity correlates with
      fibrinogen level. In such case, indirect FXIII activity prediction by fibrinogen level
      measurement would be a convenient approach to enable FXIII targeted substitution. Therefore
      we decided to perform a prospective observational clinical trial to determine whether the low
      plasma fibrinogen level in severe trauma correlates with decreased FXIII activity.
