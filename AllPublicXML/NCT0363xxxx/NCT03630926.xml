  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, study to evaluate the performance of NV-VPAC1 PCa Urine Diagnostic
      Test in three distinct populations being treated at the Intermountain Urology Clinic. The
      first population (positive control) is comprised of men with biopsy-confirmed PCa who are
      scheduled for prostatectomy. The second population (negative control) is comprised of men
      with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) who are scheduled for transurethral resection of the
      prostate (TURP). The third population (negative control) is comprised of men or women with
      bladder/kidney stones who are scheduled for a cystoscopy.
