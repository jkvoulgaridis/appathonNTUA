  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many elderly suffer from nutritional problems that can cause (or can be caused by) a number
      of complications such as weakened immune systems and chronic health conditions (diabetes type
      2, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases or even osteoporosis).

      Through appropriate adjustments in the diets, on the basis of nutritional advice, the burden
      of established diseases as well as the risks of developing further conditions can be
      diminished. The goal of our proposed project LIFANA is to develop and evaluate the LIFANA
      Nutrition Solution to support healthy nutrition.. This may include general preferences, such
      as culture, taste, and budget, but more importantly automated and personalised nutritional
      recommendations based on advice provided by professional nutritionists and allergists. This
      is a national project co-funded by the European Union.

      One of the activities of the project is to collect information through a survey with
      patients. These questions will contribute to creating solutions that can explore the
      perspectives of patients.

      Patients will be approached in the clinic by a neurologist and health care professionals. The
      questionnaire will take place at cereneo. The group will consist of 25 participants and last
      between 1h. The Survey will be conducted by a clinician who will take notes. Semi-structured
      discussion guide will be used. With regard to the communication, the moderator will identify
      factors that will influence communication in a positive or negative way.

      The health professionals will perform content analyses on the transcripts; the schema of
      categories will be oriented towards the research questions, using open questions, directly
      addressing quiet participants, and handling the discussion guide in a flexible way.

    <description>The group in question is part of a research program aimed at developing and evaluating the LIFANA Nutrition Solution, a meal planning recommended system, which suggests meals based on the user's personal profile. This may include general preferences, such as culture, taste, and budget, but more importantly automated and personalised nutritional recommendations based on advice provided by professional nutritionists and allergists.</description>
