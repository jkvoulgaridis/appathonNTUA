      Sixty postmenopausal women participated in this study from gynecological outpatient clinic,
      at Al-Zahra universal Hospital, Al Azhar University, and Cairo. They were first diagnosed to
      be hypertensive in their early postmenopausal period .Their blood pressure ranged between
      140/90mmHg to 170/105mmHg, their ages ranged from 50 to 60 years and their body mass index
      ranged from 30:35 kg/m2.

      The participants were divided randomly according to closed envelop into three equal groups in
      number: Group A (RE) consisted of twenty women who participated in the resistive exercise
      program. Group B (AE) group: consisted of twenty women who participated in an aerobic
      exercise program. All patients in both groups (A &amp; B) participated in the exercises three
      times per week for twelve weeks and every session lasted for 45 min and continues their
      antihypertensive medication
