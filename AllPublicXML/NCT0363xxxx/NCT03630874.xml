  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From a systematic review of international guidelines (2012-2018), a prescription support-tool
      synthesizing national and international guidelines on chronic management (≥ 1 month) of oral
      AT agents without considering in-hospital management and bridging therapy will be developed.
      Guidelines dealing with the use of oral ATs for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, coronary
      artery disease, ischemic stroke, valvular heart disease, peripheral artery disease and venous
      thromboembolism in adults will be included. These pathologies were selected because most
      prescriptions of ATs are related to neuro-cardiovascular diseases and because this study
      would provide a synthesis relevant for clinicians in charge of the follow-up of patients with
      oral AT combinations. Studies are needed to assess the impact of this tool on appropriate
      prescribing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral antithrombotic (AT) drugs are widely implicated in serious and preventable bleeding
      events, which justifies the implementation of risk minimization actions. Avoiding
      inappropriate oral AT combinations is a major concern, particularly for patients with
      multiple chronic conditions. The first step is to provide fast and easy access to the latest
      recommendations. From a systematic review of international guidelines (2012-2018), a
      prescription support-tool synthesizing national and international guidelines on chronic
      management (≥ 1 month) of oral AT agents without considering in-hospital management and
      bridging therapy will be developed. Our main objective in this study is to evaluate the
      accuracy of this tool by measuring the appropriateness of oral AT prescriptions according to
      the most recent guidelines.

      Methods and analysis: In this web-based randomized controlled trial, participating French
      general practitioners and cardiologists in the outpatient setting will be randomized by use
      or not of the prescription support-tool. They will be asked to provide the number of drugs,
      drug class, duration and dosage of ATs, within a time window of 10 minutes, for 3 different
      clinical situations presented as clinical vignettes (multiple-choice questions). The
      scientific committee has created and validated 30 clinical vignettes illustrating outpatient
      clinical situations for which the use of oral ATs (single, dual or triple therapy) is
      recommended or not according to the guidelines. All data will be treated anonymously.

      Ethics and dissemination: If the prescription support-tool is associated with more
      appropriate prescription of AT combinations, its dissemination to further evaluate outcome
      data including haemorrhage, ischemic events, and death will be considered.

    <measure>The primary outcome measure is the rate of the &quot;right prescription of oral ATs&quot; as defined according to the guidelines in terms of number, class, duration and dosage between the two groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one</time_frame>
    <description>How will be defined the &quot;right prescription of oral ATs&quot; :
From a systematic review of international guidelines (2012-2018), has been developed, a prescription support-tool synthesizing 70 national and international guidelines on chronic management (≥ 1 month) of oral AT agents without considering in-hospital management and bridging therapy.
The scientific committee of this study (cardiologist, internist-geriatricians, general practitioner and epidemiologists) created and validated 30 clinical vignettes.
The expert committee of this study had to review all clinical vignettes with the prescription support-tool (external validation) to confirm their agreement with clinical practice and their readability.
Thus, the &quot;right prescription of oral ATs&quot; was defined a priori (right or false) thanks to the prescription support tool and validated by the expert committee and the scientific committee.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of the &quot;right prescription of oral ATs&quot; performed by physicians' specialty.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one</time_frame>
    <description>Physicians' specialty: french physicians who are involved in outpatient settings, including general practitioners and cardiologists. Physicians with an exclusive hospital practice will not be considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference between the control and intervention groups in the degree of confidence physicians have in their AT prescriptions in line with the guidelines.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of confidence was defined a priori with this question: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, what is your degree of confidence in the adequacy of your prescription in relation to the guidelines?&quot;</description>

    <description>From a systematic review of international guidelines (2012-2018), we developed a prescription support-tool synthesizing national and international guidelines on chronic management (≥ 1 month) of oral AT agents without considering in-hospital management and bridging therapy.
In the experimental group, the tool will be provided with an explanatory guide. Selected physicians will receive 3 different clinical vignettes, each corresponding to a specific situation for which the physician will have to indicate (thanks to the tool) the &quot;right prescription&quot; of ATs by answering a multiple-choice question, with the number, type, duration and dosage of AT provided.</description>
