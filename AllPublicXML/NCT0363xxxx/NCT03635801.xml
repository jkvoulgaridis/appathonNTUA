      Purpose of this clinical investigation: clinical evaluation/accuracy of HeartSciences
      MyoVista High-Sensitivity (hsECG) 12 lead Electrocardiogram device, for patients presenting
      with cardiac related chest pain and/or Non ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction
      (NSTEMI). To assess the early intervention of N-STEMI patients. Determine if clinical
      outcomes can be improved. Assessment will be made on the MYOVISTA's indices, numerical
      values, and sensitivity/specificity for early detection of cardiac dysfunction/disease,i.e.
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Primary objective to ascertain efficacy of the MyoVista and
      evaluate its usefulness in expediting patients that require further investigation/procedure
      by way of angiography, thus improving the patient care pathway. Recruitment will take place
      at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, the Sponsor who will fund the research. A single
      centre study. Participants will undergo a 12 lead MyoVista ECG in addition to a standard 12
      lead ECG. This is not an invasive procedure and carries no risk to the patient. There will be
      no change in the patient care pathway. The study will last c. 2 years, enrolment of patients
      ceasing once the statistically significant number to power the study has been met which is
      sufficient and ethical. Prerequisites for inclusion to the clinical investigation include:

        -  Signed informed consent prior to any procedure relating to the investigation

        -  Patient compliance with the clinical investigational plan

        -  Follow-up appointment(s) attendance

        -  Patient(s) presenting to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of Non ST-segment Elevation
           Myocardial Infarction

        -  Notable Electrocardiogram morphological changes, consistent with Myocardial Ischaemia
           (MI) i.e. T-wave inversion, Biphasic T-wave, ST-segment depression

        -  Symptom onset of &lt;12 hrs

        -  Elevated High Sensitivity Troponin Score

        -  GRACE score of &gt;140 It is hoped that &gt; 75% of patients seen will show willingness and
           compliance throughout the duration of the clinical investigation. Clinical benefits,
           early diagnosis of heart disease, streamlined triage of patients, reduction in
           morbidity/mortality, reduction in costs to National Health Service (NHS) and improved
           patient centered care.

      The purpose of this clinical investigation is the clinical evaluation and accuracy of
      HeartSciences MyoVista High-Sensitivity (hsECG) 12 lead Electrocardiogram devices, for
      patients presenting with cardiac chest pain and/or Non ST-segment Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (NSTEMI). To assess the early intervention of N-STEMI patients and determine if
      clinical outcomes can be improved. In addition, assessment will be made on the MYOVISTA's
      indices, numerical values, and sensitivity/specificity for early detection of cardiac
      dysfunction/disease, namely Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The Primary objective to ascertain
      efficacy of the MyoVista and evaluate its usefulness in expediting patients that require
      further investigation/procedure by way of angiography, thus improving the patient care
      pathway. This clinical investigation will answer an important clinical question, i.e. can
      outcomes in 'high-risk' N-STEMI patients be improved with the intervention of MyoVista 12
      lead Electrocardiogram in the detection of heart disease/diastolic dysfunction, compared to
      current standard practice?This clinical investigation anticipates that outcomes are improved
      in 'high-risk' patients when early detection and diagnosis is made using the MyoVista. The
      clinical investigation should therefore determine whether there is a need for a change in
      patient management, specifically those patients presenting as N-STEMI. This will allow for
      earliest intervention, with the results and data of this clinical investigation informing
      National/International guidelines, practice and healthcare service provision. The Primary
      endpoint will be the acute reperfusion/revascularization of target coronary vessels by way of
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with specified follow-up at six (6) and twelve (12)
      months, with twelve (12) month being the specified termination of the clinical investigation
      plan.This clinical investigation is a prospective, single-centred Pilot study. The total
      investigation duration is expected to be approximately 2 - 3 years.

    <description>The primary outcome is one that the MyoVista is a good predictor of the need for an Angiogram in those patients presenting with cardiac related chest pain, more specifically, NSTEMI patients. The Primary objective is to ascertain the efficacy of the MyoVista and evaluate its usefulness in expediting those patients that require further investigation/procedure by way of angiography/angioplasty, thus improving the patient care pathway.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolling in this clinical investigation will undergo a standard 12-lead ECG using the MyoVista 12-lead hs ECG device. An ECG is a quick, safe and painless test. No electricity is put into the body while it's carried out.
There may be some slight discomfort when the electrodes are removed from the skin - similar to removing a sticking plaster - and some people may develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached.
An ECG is performed under controlled conditions.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion Criteria

          -  Have a recent documented Myocardial Infarction within 40 days prior to enrolment and
             commencement of this investigation

          -  Have had a recent Trans-Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) within
             3 months prior to enrolment and commencement of this investigation

          -  Have undergone cardiac surgery or coronary revascularisation within 3 months prior to
             enrolment and commencement of this investigation

          -  Be less than 18 years of age

          -  Involvement of vulnerable subjects (e.g. those lacking capacity to provide informed
             consent)

          -  Be pregnant or planning to become pregnant at commencement of this investigation

          -  Participation in another clinical investigational study. Justification for which is
             two fold - firstly, a conflict of interest between two clinical trials, and patient
             compliance. Use of drugs that may be contraindicated and alter the patient care
             pathway compromising the trial

          -  Have not provided a patient information sheet or patient consent form

          -  Any contraindication(s) to PCI

          -  Cardiogenic shock

          -  Awaiting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)

          -  Haemodynamic instability

          -  Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia

          -  Recurrent Ventricular Fibrillation

          -  Atrial/Ventricular Septal defects (ASD's/VSD's)

          -  Those patients presenting with suspected N-STEMI and who are subsequently enrolled yet
             are deemed to have non-cardiac related chest pain post cardiological review will be
             discharged from the study and will therefore meet exclusion criteria. Neither further
             action nor participation will be expected

          -  N.B. In the event a patient is unable to make the decision to participate in the
             clinical investigation, i.e. lacking capacity to provide informed consent, then
             exclusion criteria will thus apply to such patients. For the purpose of this clinical
             trial, it is deemed that there will be no clinical benefit to either the patient nor
             the clinical investigation should inclusion of this cohort of patients be included and
             will be contrary to their quality of life.
