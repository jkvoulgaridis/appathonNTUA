    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve access to child mental health and substance abuse (MH/SA)
      care by expanding primary care screening and increasing availability of timely mental health
      evaluation and treatment.

      This is a quasi-experimental, longitudinal study. Identified youth and families will receive
      the intervention within the four study site clinic locations. Comparison group families will
      receive usual care. Each primary care study site will have designated Family Support
      Specialist, Clinical Care Manager and Child Psychiatry resources. The intervention includes
      an integrated care consultation which combines diagnostic evaluation, family assessment, and
      multi-disciplinary, team-based treatment recommendations, with follow-up community linkages
      and support, as indicated.

    <intervention_model_description>The E-SOC Model consists of the delivery of intensively integrated clinical care within pediatrics, combined with community-based parent support from family support specialists. Innovations include child mental health specialists joining the pediatrics team for &quot;huddles&quot;, psychiatry notes shared with pediatricians via the Electronic Medical Records and active inclusion of pediatricians in pre-evaluation discussions with the E-SOC Team and post-evaluation recommendations for the families. In addition, the E-SOC model includes active communication with school personnel, child welfare, and community-based resources, when needed.</intervention_model_description>

The anchors of items rated on satisfaction are rated on a 5-point likert scale, where 1 = very dissatisfied, 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 5 = very satisfied wherein the higher the value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The four intervention sites have been selected based on their size: taken together, their pediatric populations comprise over 80% of the total number of children receiving care at Cambridge Health Alliance. At the four intervention sites, the study will involve: 1) an integrated child mental health assessment done by the E-SOC team within primary care, 2) active follow-up, collaboration with specialty providers and support to families, 3) School, child welfare and other community linkages as appropriate.</description>

    <description>E-SOC team will be increasing connections between clinical care and community partners, such as schools, juvenile justice and child-serving state agencies, to reduce disparities in access to mental health/substance use evaluation and treatment. All aspects of the care continuum will be provided in a culturally and linguistically competent manner, with child and family-driven care planning. Overall goals are: earlier identification of mental health needs including child trauma; increased treatment access and adherence; care delivered in least restrictive settings; care experience reflecting active youth and family engagement; program sustainability and replicability.</description>
