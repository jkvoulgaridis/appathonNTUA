    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN)—numbness, burning and stunning pain
      distributed in hands and feet—is a major challenge among cancer patients. Even after
      completion of chemotherapy, CIPN persists among ~30-40% of cancer patients, which can
      negatively impact quality of life. The only drug (duloxetine) better than placebo in a
      randomized control trial improved pain intensity by 0.72 points on a scale of 0-10, which
      cannot manage CIPN effectively. A better pain management strategy clearly needs to be
      developed.

      The investigators propose to test auricular point acupressure (APA), a non-invasive, easily
      administered, patient-controlled, and non-pharmacological strategy, to provide rapid, safe,
      and effective pain relief so that cancer patients can self-manage their CIPN. APA involves an
      acupuncture-like stimulation of the ear without needles. With APA, small seeds are taped to
      specific ear points. The patient is taught to apply pressure to the seeds, with the thumb and
      index finger, three times a day (morning, noon, and evening) for three minutes each session
      to achieve pain relief. The investigators have developed a detailed APA protocol to teach
      health-care providers without experience in acupuncture and traditional Chinese Medicine that
      investigators can learn about APA in brief educational seminars as a treatment including the
      systematic identification of ear points (called auricular diagnosis). The investigators teach
      methods that enable patients to continue using APA to self-manage their pain. However APA is
      not available in current U.S. health care setting yet.

      Quantitative sensory testing (QST) and fMRI in acupuncture have provided new objective
      methods for measuring pain. QST provides an evaluation of peripheral and central mechanisms
      of pain by quantifying stimulus-evoked negative and positive sensory phenomena to evaluate a
      participant's perception of threshold values regarding pain generated through touch (A beta
      fibers), warmth (C fibers), cold (A delta fibers), and heat (C fibers). Studies have
      demonstrated changes in heat, pressure, and mechanical pain thresholds immediately following
      acupuncture; however no study in APA yet. Brain imaging studies in acupuncture indicate that
      acupuncture can restore normal functional connectivity related to pain reduction. In
      conjunction with the investigators pilot data demonstrating that APA impacts neural-immune
      signaling in patients with chronic low back pain, the investigators hypothesize that APA may
      likewise induce pain relief through the stimulation of A beta fibers and/or C fibers to
      increase the pain threshold, endogenous opioid binding (releasing inflammatory cytokines),
      and alter brain networks of central processing in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical
      axis to achieve analgesia.

      The investigators plan to study the mechanisms underpinning pain sensitivity and pain
      processing due to APA on CIPN. Along with the clinical and subjective CIPN outcomes,
      objective outcomes will include physiological change in pain sensory thresholds (measured by
      quantitative sensory testing), brain change associated with pain processing (measured by
      fMRI), and neuro-transmitters (measured by inflammatory cytokines).

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) questionnaire includes assessment of pain location and multiple aspects of severity of pain, numbness, tingling, and stiffness, including worst, least, average pain, and present, as well as the interference with daily activities. The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) has a total score ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more pain.</description>

    <description>The baseline rs-fMRI will be performed, followed by 10 min of APA. Immediately after the treatment, a repeat fMRI will then be performed. All MRIs will be acquired on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio Tim system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel head matrix coil T2*-weighted bold functional images covering entire cerebrum and cerebellum. fMRI will take ~45 minutes. The imaging data will be processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8.</description>
