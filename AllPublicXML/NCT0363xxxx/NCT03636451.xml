  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dilation and Curettage (D&amp;C) is often performed in the first trimester for surgical abortion
      and management of miscarriage and can be painful for patients before and after the procedure.
      Most procedures are performed while the patient is awake or with minimal sedation in the
      clinic setting, and a key component of pain control is the paracervical block, or injecting
      lidocaine into the tissue around the cervix1-10. A paracervical block with 20cc of 1%
      buffered lidocaine has been proven to provide superior pain control than a sham paracervical
      block13. However, many providers often use similar doses of lidocaine in a higher volume to
      improve pain control4-5. At UCSD and UCLA, some providers routinely use a 20cc of 1% buffered
      lidocaine block and some routinely use a 40cc of 0.5% buffered lidocaine block. This practice
      has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to
      compare pain control during D&amp;C with a 20cc 1% buffered lidocaine with vasopressin
      paracervical block compared to a 40cc 0.5% buffered lidocaine with vasopressin paracervical
      block. An inclusion criterion for this study is that patients must specifically be referred
      to family planning clinics at UCSD and UCLA for an in-clinic D&amp;C. Therefore, the D&amp;C is a
      required procedure for both study groups. The only difference in care between the study
      groups will be which paracervical block they receive.

      OVERVIEW OF DESIGN This is a double center, randomized, 2 arm (1:1), single blinded clinical
      trial comparing pain control at the time of cervical dilation with two different paracervical
      blocks in women undergoing D&amp;C in the first trimester for either surgical abortion or
      miscarriage management.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      In patients undergoing first trimester D&amp;C with minimal sedation, a 40cc buffered 0.5%
      lidocaine with 2 units of vasopressin paracervical block will improve pain control by 20-mm
      on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) compared to a 20cc 1% lidocaine with 2 units of
      vasopressin paracervical block at the time of cervical dilation.

      Secondary hypotheses:

      In patients undergoing first trimester dilation and curettage (D&amp;C), a 40cc buffered 0.5%
      lidocaine with 2 units vasopressin paracervical block compared to a 20cc 1% lidocaine with 2
      units vasopressin paracervical block will improve pain control by 20-mm on a 100-mm VAS at
      the time of paracervical block placement, uterine aspiration and 10 minutes after the
      procedure.

      In order to investigate this hypothesis, the following study design is proposed:

      The study will take place in the family planning clinics at UCSD and UCLA. At UCSD and UCLA,
      family planning clinics help guide patients in the management of their miscarriages and
      undesired pregnancies. Any clinician can refer patients to this clinic and appointments are
      coordinated by a Family Planning Coordinator. During this study, upon presentation to
      clinical care for termination of pregnancy or miscarriage, the clinician will take a full
      history, perform a physical exam, and counsel the patient about her options including using
      medications, performing a D&amp;C in clinic, and performing a D&amp;C under anesthesia in the
      operating room, all of which is standard for a clinic visit in the family planning clinics.
      If the patient desires a clinic-based D&amp;C, a dating ultrasound will be performed, and the
      clinician will assess for medical contraindications to clinic D&amp;C or chronic pain conditions,
      as is standardly done for every D&amp;C in the family planning clinics. If she is eligible for
      D&amp;C, informed consent will be obtained for the procedure, per standard clinic practice. The
      study coordinator will then assess if the patient is interested in participating in the
      study, ensure that the patient is willing to take the study medications and that she has not
      taken any pain medications that day. The study coordinator will then obtain written informed
      consent to participate and perform the baseline survey detailing her age, race, ethnicity,
      level of education, income level, height, weight, obstetric history, history of cervical
      procedures (eg LEEP procedure or Conization), current pregnancy status (undesired pregnancy
      vs. early pregnancy loss), baseline anxiety using the GAD-7 (a validated tool used to assess
      for anxiety in primary care settings18). The patient will then receive 60mg IM ketorolac,
      10mg oral Versed, and 500mg oral Azithromycin 30 minutes prior to the procedure per usual
      clinic protocol.

      Block randomization will be performed (alternating block sizes of 4 and 6). The study
      coordinator will pick the designated sealed, opaque envelope containing the type of
      paracervical block and hand it to the physician performing the procedure. The physician will
      then open the envelope and prepare the designated paracervical block, as it is standard
      practice for physicians to prepare their own paracervical blocks prior to performing any D&amp;C
      in-clinic. The paracervical block will contain 2U Vasopressin, 2cc of 8.4% sodium
      bicarbonate, and either 1% lidocaine or 0.5% lidocaine, depending on the study group. The
      physician will bring the paracervical block into the clinic room where the procedure will be
      performed on a covered tray. The physician will perform the standardized procedure for the
      D&amp;C.

      The study coordinator, who will be blinded to the type of paracervical block, will present
      the VAS to the participant ask her to mark her level of pain at baseline, speculum insertion,
      paracervical block placement, cervical dilation, immediately after uterine aspiration, 10
      minutes after the procedure, and overall pain. Additionally, after paracervical block
      placement, the participant will be asked about side effects of lightheadedness, tinnitus,
      circumoral tingling, and a metallic taste in the mouth. The physician will perform the D&amp;C in
      the usual fashion, and the study coordinator will record the time from speculum insertion to
      speculum removal.

      After the procedure, the physician will answer a questionnaire detailing if there were any
      adverse events related to either the paracervical block or the D&amp;C, such as cardiac arrest,
      uterine perforation, or hemorrhage. The physician will also note the uterine position, how
      much cervical dilation was performed, and their level of training and prior experience with
      the procedure. That patient will also answer questions about satisfaction with pain control.
