  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common and frequently-occurring disease giving rise to low
      back pain and (or) leg pain. There are about 1.5 million people with LDH-related pain,
      accounting for 10% of outpatients each year in China. The mechanism of LDH-related pain is
      that the degeneration causes the protrusion of the intervertebral disc directly to the lower
      lumbar nerve root or spinal cord, and the chemical stimulation plays a key role in it.
      Currently, LDH treatments are mainly divided into conservative treatment, surgical treatment
      and minimally invasive treatment. The minimally invasive technique is a new technology that
      has been arising in recent years, with small wound, little bleeding and quick recovery. It
      mainly includes collagenase dissolving, laser decompression, radiofrequency ablation, etc.
      Intervertebral disc radiofrequency ablation is an early application of minimally invasive
      technique with a wide range of applications in a long time. The percutaneous transforaminal
      endoscopic discectomy (PTED) is a new technique, which is applied in clinics with shorter
      time, and the implementation and efficacy of the technique need to be further discussed. A
      case-control clinical trial is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of PTED with
      radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of LDH. Main outcome is Visual Analogue Scale for
      leg pain, secondary outcomes are Oswestry disability index, quality of life assessment, Burns
      Depression Checklist, recovery rate, complications, operation time and radiation exposure
      time, etc. The follow-up time points are 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months
      post-operation.

    <description>Draw a line of 100 mm on the paper, the end of the horizontal line is 0, indicating no pain; The other end is 10, which is a very serious pain; The middle section shows varying degrees of pain.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months post-operation.</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI was developed by Fairbank to assess functional impairment. There are 10 questions evaluating various daily activities of this scale and 6 options for each question between 0-5. In this scale, the degree of clinical pain severity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, travel and change degree of the pain are questioned. The minimum score taken from the scale is 0, the maximum score is 50. 0-4 points mean there is no disability, 5-14 points are mild, 15-24 points are moderate, 25-30 points are severe and 35-50 points are considered to be complete functional disability.</description>

    <description>Short Form-36 (SF-36) will assess the health-related quality of life of individuals. The form consists of a total of 36 articles which can be filed by the patient. The scale consists of 8 subscales related to health. Physical function (10 articles), social function (2 articles), role limitations due to physical problems (3 articles), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 articles), mental health (5 articles), fitness (4 articles), pain (2 articles), general health [general overview point (5 articles) and health change (1 article)]. The scores from each subscale range from 0-100. 0 indicates the worst condition and 100 the best health condition. The SF-36 is suitable for personal evaluation, and can be applied to people over 14 years of age or face to face computerized or trained personnel.</description>
