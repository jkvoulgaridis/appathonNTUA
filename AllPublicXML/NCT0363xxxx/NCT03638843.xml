  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid metabolic improvements seen with sleeve gastrectomy are likely a result of changes in
      gastric origin. The gastric mucosa is an endocrine organ that regulates satiation pathways
      and is a complex regulator of food intake as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. This study
      aims to assess the efficacy and safety of endoscopic selective gastric mucosal devitalization
      (GMD) for the management of obesity and its related comorbidities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic approaches to obesity may help fulfill the unmet need of over half the US adult
      population that would benefit from therapy for obesity but are not receiving it. Endoscopic
      approaches to obesity have the potential to be more efficacious than antiobesity medications
      and have a lower risk-cost profile compared with bariatric surgery.

      Endoscopic approaches to obesity need to be increasingly modeled on the proposed mechanisms
      contributing to the benefits of bariatric surgery.

      The investigators seek to decipher if the gastric mucosa is an independent regulator of food
      intake, body weight, lipid and glucose metabolism and serum gut hormones. The investigators
      also wish to ascertain if selective devitalization of the gastric mucosa, without alteration
      in gastric volume, will improve obesity related comorbidities.

      This study will be divided into 3 parts. The purpose of completing the 3 phases is to develop
      a minimally invasive weight loss technique that is effective, safe and ready for more
      rigorous assessment via a future randomized control trial.

      Objectives:

      Overall:

      To assess the efficacy and safety of gastric mucosal devitalization for the management of
      obesity and its related comorbidities.

      Part 2:

      Aims to confirm that the optimal color of the tissue identified by part 1 corresponds to
      selective mucosal devitalization in the in vivo setting by histopathologic examination. For
      this, patients will be enrolled in the study after being scheduled to undergo vertical sleeve
      gastrectomy (VSG). GMD will be performed three days prior to the VSG, and the excised tissue
      including devitalized gastric mucosa will be evaluated. The degree and correlation of
      devitalization with mucosal discoloration will be assessed.
