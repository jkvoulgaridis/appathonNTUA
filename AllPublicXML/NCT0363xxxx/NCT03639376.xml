      This study investigates the salivary LL-37 in passive smoking-exposed and unexposed children
      and the association between salivary LL-37 levels and periodontal clinical parameters in
      these children.Unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 180 children (90 passive
      smoking-exposed and 90 passive smoking-unexposed)

    <textblock>
      Diverse mechanisms conduce to the detrimental periodontal effects of passive smoking,
      including alteration of both microbial and host response factors.

      Antimicrobial peptides are considered to be an important intermediate step in initiating an
      initial immune response against the microbial side of the oral gingival epithelium and in the
      transition to acquired immunity.

      LL-37 has a wide antimicrobial activity against both cariogenic and periopathogenic bacteria
      and its role in maintaining oral health has recently been stated
