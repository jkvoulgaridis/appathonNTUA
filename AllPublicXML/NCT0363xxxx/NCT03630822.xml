  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe mental illness is accompanied by cognitive fluctuations that can alter decision-making
      skills and lead to coerced care. Taking into account, on the one hand, the health, social and
      economic impact of forced hospitalization, on the other hand the importance of
      self-determination, the reinforcement of the power to act in the evolution of these
      disorders, new strategies to better reflect the views of people have been developed.

      Among these, the drafting of Advanced Directives in Psychiatric (ADP), allows people with
      mental disorders to write while their decision-making skills are restored care instructions
      in case of decompensation.

      It is a tool of &quot;advanced therapeutic education&quot; and early prevention of relapses.

      It is hypothesized that the implementation of drafting accompanied by advance directives to
      people with severe psychiatric disorders decreases in the short term the number of forced
      hospitalization care pathway of these people, compared to the subjects having not benefited
      from this device.

      This research will take the form of a randomized controlled trial on 3 sites. The
      &quot;quantitative&quot; evaluation component of results and processes will be completed with a
      qualitative anthropological and socio-political evaluation component documenting the
      trajectories of individuals and the implementation of the program, as well as a
      &quot;participatory research&quot; component aimed at a dialogue between users, researchers and
      professionals.

      The patient who is a beneficiary of the &quot;Advanced Directives in Psychiatric&quot; program will be
      encouraged to complete the &quot; Advanced Directives in Psychiatric&quot; document and will receive
      support in drafting them. The non-beneficiary patient of the program will follow up with his
      psychiatrist unchanged.

      The experimental design of the quantitative component is based on an experimental,
      randomized, prospective, controlled, parallel study, comparing two groups of subjects with
      severe psychiatric disorders.

      This research will assess the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the &quot; Advanced
      Directives in Psychiatric&quot; program compared to conventional psychiatric care alone.

      Ultimately, the objective of describing the effects of the program on health organizations
      and on the representations and practices of professionals, caregivers and users is at the
      service of a better understanding of the conditions of possibility of the generalization of
      this experimentation.
