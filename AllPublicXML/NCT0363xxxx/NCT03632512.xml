  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of Hericium Erinaceus on clinical patients with
      hearing impairment and possible mechanisms. Subjects with hearing impairment will be enrolled
      and randomly divided into experimental or control group supplemented with Hericium Erinaceus
      (430 mg/kg/day) or placebo, respectively for eight months. Basic characteristics will be
      evaluated at baseline by questionnaire. The hearing, liver and kidney functions, and
      neurotrophic factors will be examined at baseline, 4th month and 8th month.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of Hericium Erinaceus on clinical patients with
      hearing impairment and possible mechanisms. Subjects with hearing impairment will be
      enrolled. Inclusion criteria were 50 to 79 years old with symmetric sensorineural hearing
      loss, subjective sensorineural tinnitus, and all frequencies differed of ears less than 15
      dB. Exclusion conditions were patients with abnormal liver and kidney function, normal
      hearing, severe and very severe hearing loss, no tinnitus or non-subjective sensorineural
      tinnitus, moderate or more cognitive impairment, patients unable to understand the details of
      this study or patients unable to co-examine, history of alcohol or drug abuse, history of
      high ambient noise exposure, bone tone air gap of pure tone hearing threshold greater than 10
      dB, and audiogram 4 kHz air conduction threshold greater than 8 kHz, 20 dB airway threshold,
      hearing impairment before age 30, and inability to understand the details of this study.
      Participants will randomly divide into experimental or control group supplemented with
      Hericium Erinaceus (430 mg/kg/day) or placebo, respectively for eight months by a
      prospective, randomized, double-blind approach. Basic characteristics will be evaluated at
      baseline by questionnaire. The status of hearing, and CBC, GOT, GPT, BUN, Creatinine, NGF and
      BDNF expressions in blood will be examined at baseline, 4th month and 8th month.

    <measure>1.Change of Tinnitus status evaluates by Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4th month and 8th month</time_frame>
    <description>The status of tinnitus will be evaluated by Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI). THI is divided into three categories, including the functional (12 questions), emotional (8 questions), and catastrophic (5 questions) subscore. A total of 25 questions are used. The answer will be divided into three levels (will, sometimes, will not), and be scored into 4, 2 and 0 point, respectively. The subscore of functional (12 questions), emotional (8 questions), and catastrophic (5 questions) are 48, 32, and 20, respectively. The highest total score is 100 points. The higher the score, the more the tinnitus is. The difference of score will be compared from the baseline with 4th and 8th month.</description>

    <measure>Change of Tinnitus severity evaluates by visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4th month and 8th month</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of tinnitus will be scored with a visual analog scale (VAS) from point 0 to point 10 by subject. The difference of score will be compared from the baseline with 4th and 8th month.</description>

    <measure>Changes of NGF and BDNF levels of blood investigate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4th month and 8th month</time_frame>
    <description>The NGF and BDNF levels of blood will be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of NGF and BDNF. The NGF and BDN levels will be quantitative by the optical density (OD) of the sample comparing to a standard curve, which is a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule. The difference of NGF and BDNF levels will be compared from the baseline with 4th and 8th month.</description>
