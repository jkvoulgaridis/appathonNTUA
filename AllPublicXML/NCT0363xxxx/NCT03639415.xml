  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with
      strong opioids, of which oxycodone and morphine are examples, they are widely applied in
      clinical treatment because of sustained-released formulation can reduce dosing frequency.
      Goal of pain management is get adequate analgesia and minimize the adverse event at the same
      time, but in fact there are about 10%-30% patients can't get adequate analgesia because of
      intolerable adverse event. The common adverse event of Controlled-Release Oxycodone(CR
      Oxycodone ) are nausea (29.9%)、constipation （25.4%）、dizziness（22.4%） and vomit（11.9%），about
      32.8% patients treatment was discontinued because of these adverse event. The peak
      concentration of opioid is related to adverse event, while the valley concentration is
      correlated to the analgesic effect. Therefore, if we keep the daily dose while increase the
      dose frequency so that reduce the single dose, it's will help to avoid intolerable adverse
      event caused by excessive opioid peak concentration and keep the opioid analgesia at the same
      time. It's a reasonable way to solve the side effects of opioid.

      In order to explore the effect of change the dosing frequency of CR Oxycodone to treat
      refractory pain, pre-experiment have done by several clinical centrals in Fujian province.
      Preliminary results show that for the patients who can't accept the current opioid dose
      because of intolerable side effect, changing the dosing frequency is a safe and effect way.

      This is a multicenter、singe arm、prospective study.

      Study population:

      Moderate to severe cancer pain (4-6 on the standard Numerical Rating Scale [NRS], range 0-10)
      patients with unsatisfactory pain control because of intolerable nausea、vomit or dizziness
      during accept CR Oxycodone treatment.

      Therapeutic schemes:

        1. CR oxycodone dose titration scheme: adjusting the dose of CR oxycodone every 24 hours
           according to the NRS and adverse event;

        2. Increasing the dose frequency scheme; Patients with moderate to severe pain accept CR
           oxycodone treatment and if any follow situations appears, then change the dose frequency
           from every 12 hours to every 8 hours or 6 hours.

      Patients are satisfied with the pain control, but unable to tolerate nausea、vomit or
      dizziness, and can't get satisfactory pain control if reducing the CR oxycodone dose.

      Patients are unsatisfied with the pain control, but can't increase the CR oxycodone dose
      because of intolerable nausea、vomit or dizziness.

      Primary end point:

      The effective rate of treatment: the rate of patients who get satisfactory pain control
      without intolerable adverse event in two consecutive day .

      Secondary end point:

      The time of reach effective treatment； The degree of pain reduction; The incident rate of
      adverse drug reaction The reduction rate of adverse drug reaction The change of plasm
      concentration after change the dose frequency; The relationship between peripheral blood gene
      and analgesia effect; The relationship between peripheral blood gene and adverse event;

    <description>At study entry, assess the adverse drug reaction (ADR) and the pain degree by Likert scale everyday. The Likert scale of pain includes the absence of pain (a score of 0), mild pain (a score of 1), moderate pain (a score of 2), severe pain (a score of 3). The Likert scale of ADR includes the absence of ADR (a score of 0), mild ADR (a score of 1), moderate ADR (a score of 2), severe ADR (a score of 3).
The effective rate of treatment: the rate of patients who get satisfactory pain control (0 or 1 point on the 3-point Likert scale ) without intolerable adverse event (0 or 1 point on the 3-point Likert scale ) in two consecutive day .</description>
