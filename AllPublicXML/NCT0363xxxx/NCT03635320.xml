  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, two-arm, non-inferiority study
      which will be conducted in China to support registration of a cephalomedullary nailing system
      (TFNA) that currently is available globally. The study will compare the safety and the
      effectiveness of two intramedullary nails (the investigational group is TFNA and the control
      group is PFNA-II).Patients enrolled at each site will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1, i.e.
      one patient assigned to surgery implanted with TFNA for each patient assigned to PFNA-II.
      Separate block randomization schedules within each site will be used to ensure equal
      distribution of treatment and control patients. Up to 15 centers will be approved to
      participate in this study.

      Patient will be clinically followed after surgery at 1, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The data up to
      and including 24 week follow up visit will be used in determining the primary safety and
      effectiveness of the TFNA.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether fracture union rate, evaluated 24
      weeks after proximal femur fracture, for the investigational TFNA intramedullary nail is
      non-inferior to that for currently available control product PFNA-II in patients with
      proximal femur fractures.

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the investigational TFNA devices (n=94) or to the control PFNA-II devices (n=94).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is fracture union status at 24 weeks postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture union success is a composite endpoint; in order for an individual subject's surgery implanted with TFNA or PFNA-II to be considered successful he/she must satisfy all of the following criteria at 24 weeks:
1. No focal tenderness or lengthwise percussion pain, or abnormal movement
2. The frontal/lateral X-ray examination shows the vague or no fracture gap, or the continuous callus passing across the fracture line 3. No deformation or breakage is found in the test product</description>

    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 was designed to measure general health status from the patient's point of view. The SF-12 includes 8 concepts commonly represented in health surveys: physical functioning, role functioning physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role functioning emotional, and mental health. It contains 12 items from the SF-36 and provides an efficient way to measure the same health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. Most patients can complete the SF-12 in less than 3 minutes without assistance.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score was developed for the assessment of the results of hip surgery, and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in an adult population. The original version was published in 1969 [27]. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The HHS is a clinician-based outcome measure administered by a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or a physical therapist. Possible scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better clinical outcome.</description>

    <measure>EQ5D</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ5D is a patient reported outcome. It provides a simple descriptive profile and single index value for health status. This health-related, quality of life survey consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension.</description>
