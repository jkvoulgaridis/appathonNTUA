  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of hypotension after spinal
      anesthesia in patients undergoing cesarean section as predicted by preoperative carotid
      artery corrected flow time measured by Doppler ultrasound. Before entering the operation
      room, Two inspectors perform two measurements of carotid artery corrected blood flow time
      respectively, and an average of the four measurements is calculated and analyzed. At this
      time, the patient's posture is supine, and the head is turned about 30 degrees to the left.
      Corrected blood flow time (FTc) is measured using carotid ultrasound as previously described
      by Blehar and colleagues. Corrected blood flow time is calculated by Bazett's formular and
      Wodey's formular by evaluating a single cycle after several successive cycles have reached a
      stable and acceptable quality level.

      The occurrence of hypotension is recorded from the spinal anesthetic injection until the
      fetus is delivered.

      The definition of hypotension after spinal anesthesia is that the systolic blood pressure
      drops to 80 mmHg, less than 75% of the baseline value, or even if it does not meet the former
      criteria, symptoms that are consistent with hypotension (dizziness, dizziness, dyspnea,
      nausea or vomiting).

    <description>First, place a 4.5-12.0 MHz linear array transducer vertically on the neck with the probe marker facing the patient's head. A long axis B-mode image of the right common carotid artery is obtained at the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. The sample volume is then placed in the center of the lumen located approximately 2 cm proximal to the carotid bifurcation. Next, pulsed wave Doppler tracing is performed in the arterial blood flow. The cycle time using the calliper function in an ultrasonic machine is obtained by measuring the interval between heartbeats at the beginning of the Doppler blood flow upstroke and the Flow time is measured as the time from the beginning of the systolic upstroke to the dicrotic notch.</description>
