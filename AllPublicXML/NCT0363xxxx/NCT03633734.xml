  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor. Current guidelines recommend
      Nab-paclitaxel, Gemcitabine and modified Folfirinox as the first-line chemotherapeutic
      regimen. Studies have shown that sequential chemotherapeutic regimen can effectively delay
      the drug resistance and improve the effect of chemotherapy. Here investigators intend to
      assess the effect of sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified
      Folfirinox on metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators chose metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who can't meet surgical
      criteria. The planned treatment was given to the participants after enrollment. Objective
      remission rate, disease control rate, tumor size, progression-free survival, overall
      survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed,
      to assess the sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified
      Folfirinox could or couldn't effectively control the progress of metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically diagnosed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
             (excluding islet cell tumor) that can be measured according to RECIST criteria.

          2. Without Radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or experimental treatment for metastatic
             pancreatic cancer. Previous use of 5-FU or gemcitabine as a radiosensitizer in
             adjuvant therapy is allowed, but it should be taken at least 6 months ago and no
             residual toxicity. Patients receiving cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine or any other
             chemotherapy in adjuvant therapy are not eligible for this study.

          3. ECOG score 0-1 points.

          4. The first diagnosis time of metastatic pancreatic cancer should be within 6 weeks of
             the initial of treatment. Note: This interval is calculated from the date of final
             assessment of the confirmed pancreatic cancer metastasis.

          5. No jaundice symptoms before treatment. Pain should be stable, and no need to adjust
             analgesic treatment. Patients with obvious or symptomatic ascites should be drained
             before treatment.

          6. With enough blood cell counts during the screening period(less than 14 days before the
             treatment): 1) The absolute count of neutrophils(ANC) is more than 1.5 ×10^9/L; 2)
             Platelet count was greater than 100,000/mm^3 (100 x10^9/L); 3).

             Hemoglobin (Hgb) is more than 9 g/dL.

          7. With normal blood biochemical parameters during the screening period(less than 14 days
             before the treatment): 1). AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) &lt;2.5*ULN, if there is obvious liver
             metastasis, it is allowed to &lt;5*ULN. 2). Total bilirubin is less than ULN. 3). Serum
             creatinine is within the normal limit, or the serum creatinine level is higher or
             lower than the normal value of the body, but the calculated clearance rate is more
             than 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2. If creatinine clearance is used, the actual body weight
             should be used to calculate creatinine clearance (for example, the Cockroft-Gault
             formula). Patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m^2 should use fat free body
             weight.

          8. Acceptable coagulation test results (less than 14 days before treatment): prothrombin
             time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PPT) were within the normal limit (+15%).
