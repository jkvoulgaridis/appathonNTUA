      The iPeer2Peer program matches teens with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with an older
      mentor who has learned to manage their IBD well and can support them emotionally and
      socially. This study will compare two groups of teens: those who are in the iPeer2Peer
      program and those in the control group (no mentor).

      The iPeer2Peer program matches teens with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with an older
      mentor who has learned to manage their IBD well and can support them emotionally and
      socially. This study will compare two groups of teens: those who are in the iPeer2Peer
      program and those in the control group (no mentor).

      The proposed trial aims to examine the impact of the iPeer2Peer program on self-management
      skills of youth with IBD (mentees) as well as health outcomes of peer mentors in the program.
      This innovative program leverages the Internet, commonly used by youth, to improve access and
      acceptability of self-management interventions while fostering social engagement in youth
      with IBD, thereby potentially improving HRQL.

    <description>In addition to standard care, youth in the experimental group will receive the iPeer2Peer Program. The iPeer2Peer program is a peer mentorship program that will provide modeling and reinforcement of self-management by pre-screened and trained peer mentors (young adults with IBD aged 18-25 years) who have learned to function successfully with their disease. Mentors will encourage youth to develop and engage in disease self-management skills and provide social support.</description>
