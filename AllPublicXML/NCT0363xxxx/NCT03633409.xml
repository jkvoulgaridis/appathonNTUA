    <textblock>
      EBI2 is a risk gene for inflammatory bowel diseases (rs9557195). Patients of the Swiss IBD
      cohort study have been genotyped for the allelic status of EBI2. The investigators will test
      the influence of rs9557195 genoty (TT or CC allel), inflammatory activity and current
      treatment (infliximab vs. vedolizumab) on expression and activity of EBI2 on blood
      lymphocytes, mRNA expression of EBI2 and UBAC2 (located on the opposite DNA strand of EBI2)
      and activity of lymphocytes on a migraton assay.

      EBI2 is a risk gene for inflammatory bowel diseases (rs9557195). EBI2 is a G protein coupled
      receptors expressed on the immune cells. EBI2 directs migration and activity of immune cells.

      Patients of the Swiss IBD cohort study have been genotyped for the allelic status of EBI2.
      The investigators will recruit patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, assess
      epidemiological and clinical parameters (including clinical activity of IBD) draw blood,
      isolate lymphocytes, DNA and RNA.

      The investigators will test the influence of rs9557195 genotype (TT or CC allel),
      inflammatory activity and current treatment (infliximab vs. vedolizumab) on expression and
      activity of EBI2 on blood lymphocytes (by FACS using an EBI2-antibody), mRNA expression (by
      qPCR) of EBI2 and UBAC2 (located on the opposite DNA strand of EBI2) and activity of
      lymphocytes on a migration assay.
