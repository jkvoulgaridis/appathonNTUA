  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by dyspnea, as well as
      musculoskeletal and systemic manifestations. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) with use of
      low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and/or light emitting diode therapy (LEDT) is an
      electrophysical intervention that has been found to minimize or delay muscle fatigue. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the acute effect of PBMT with combined use of lasers diodes,
      light emitting diodes (LEDs), on muscle performance, exercise tolerance and metabolic
      variables during the 6-minute stepper test (6MST) in patients with COPD. Twenty-one patients
      with COPD will completed the 6MST protocol over 2 weeks, with 1 session per week. PBMT or
      placebo (PL) will be performed before each 6MST (17 sites on each lower limb, with a dose of
      30 J per site, using a cluster of 12 diodes: 4 × 905 nm super-pulsed laser diodes, 4 × 875 nm
      infrared LEDs, and 4 × 640 nm red LEDs; Multi Radiance Medical™, Solon - OH, USA). Patients
      will be randomized into two groups before the test according to the treatment they will
      receive. Assessments will be performed before the start of each protocol. The primary
      outcomes are oxygen uptake and number of steps, and the secondary outcome are perceived
      exertion (dyspnea and fatigue in the lower limbs).

      All patients will have a diagnosis of COPD according to the global initiative for chronic
      obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria. The patients will be at a stable phase of the
      disease, indicated by a lack of change in medical therapy (including oral steroids) or an
      exacerbation of symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks. Patients with other known severe chronic
      diseases, including cardiac, neuromuscular, or orthopedic disorders, will be excluded.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be held by drawing lots, which we use to determine whether the active combination of superpulsed lasers, LEDs, comprising the PBMT or the placebo will be given during the first session. During the second session, participants will receive the opposite treatment compared to their first session. Randomization labels will be created using a randomization table at a central office where a series of sealed, opaque, and numbered envelopes ensured confidentiality.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A participating researcher who programmed the PBMT device (Multi Radiance Medical™, Solon, OH) based on the randomization results performed the randomization. He will be instructed not to inform the participants or other researchers of the PBMT dose (active or placebo). Thus, the researcher who performed the PBMT will be blinded to the dose administered to the participants. To further maintain blinding, participants used opaque goggles to prevent them from seeing whether a light will be irradiated.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MST aims to measure the oxygen uptake performed on a stepper in 6 minutes. During the 6MST, the rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) will be measured using a gas analyzer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcomes are number of steps</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MST aims to measure the number of steps performed on a stepper in 6 minutes. A step was defined as a single complete movement of raising one foot and putting it down. The stepper will be placed on the ground facing a wall to allow patients to maintain their balance by placing their fingers on the wall. The step height is set at 20 cm. The number of steps performed in 6 minutes will be recorded.</description>
