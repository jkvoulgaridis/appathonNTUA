  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the short-term clinical response to all
      combinations of two lens types: fanfilcon A and comfilcon A with two care systems: Hy-Care
      and Lite. The primary variables of interest are short-term biomicroscopy signs. Other
      variables of interest include subjective response and visual performance.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The first solution, the randomisation determines that the right lens will wear the fanfilcon A lens and the left eye will wear the comfilcon A lens for two hours of wear, with a two-day 'wash-out' period and the laterality of the lenses will be swapped for the second solution for two hours of wear. Lenses will be provided in lens cases which do not detail lens or care system information.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. They are of legal age (18) and capacity to volunteer.

          2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a
             Statement of Informed Consent.

          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          4. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
             study.

          5. They can be satisfactorily fitted with the study lens for a period of approximately 2
             hours.

          6. They can attain at least 0.20 logMAR distance high contrast visual acuity in each eye
             with their habitual spectacles.

          7. They currently wear daily disposable soft contact lenses or have done so in the
             previous six months.

          8. They are willing to comply with the wear schedule (approximately 2 hours on two
             different days)

          9. They own a wearable pair of spectacles and agree to bring these to study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          3. They currently wear reusable soft contact lenses in both eyes.

          4. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          5. They have had cataract surgery.

          6. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          7. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          8. They are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          9. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

         10. They have Type 2 or greater corneal staining prior to lens application at Visit 1 or 2

         11. They have corneal staining covering greater than 20% in any corneal region at Visit 1a
             or 2a

         12. They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

         13. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
