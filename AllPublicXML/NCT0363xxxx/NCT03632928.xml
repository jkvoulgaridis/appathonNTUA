      The aim is to establish how headache and migraine can affect muscle hardness and tenderness
      in migraine patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a very common disorder, and many migraine patients have symptoms from their neck
      and muscles. 50% of migraine patients have a sensation of stiff neck in relation to migraine
      attacks. Furthermore it is well established, that migraine patients have tender muscles
      during migraine attack, which can be measured with pressure pain threshold.

      In this study the investigators aim to establish the variation in ultrasound elastography and
      pressure pain threshold in migraine patients over time. And establish the significance of
      headache, migraine and prodromes on these measurements.

      The study includes daily measurements of muscle hardness and muscle tenderness. The patients
      are asked to fulfill a headache diary and a short questionnaire asking about current
      headache, physical activity, stress and current infectious diseases. Sleep and physical
      activity is also measured objectively using a fitbit Charge2. Furthermore the patients are
      asked about symptoms which often are associated with migraine (prodromes).
