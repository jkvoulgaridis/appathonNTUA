  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of the Prevena™ System decreases the
      rate of subcutaneous seroma, superficial wound dehiscence and infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certain risk factors have been identified in patients that may lead to poor wound healing or
      infection. Many things have been tried to decrease this risk (more antibiotics, different
      types of stitches, etc) but very few have been shown to be of any significant benefit.

      The use of a special vacuum dressing called the Prevena™ System, which has received approval
      from Health Canada for the management of closed surgical incisions, has been shown to be of
      some benefit in hip surgery where wounds are identified as being &quot;at risk.&quot; Vacuum dressings
      have been used with great success in patients with open wounds and have resulted in fewer
      infections and wound related complications. It is thought that if vacuum dressings can be
      used in the treatment of existing wounds, then maybe they can be used preventatively before
      there is a problem with the wound.

      Standard wound care after spine surgery involves a dressing that seals the wound for 72 hours
      after surgery and is then changed on a daily basis until the surgical sutures or staples are
      ready to be removed. This has been routine for many years.

      The purpose of this study is to see if using a vacuum dressing (Prevena™ System) will
      decrease the number of infections and/or clinic and hospital visits for wound related issues
      compared to using a standard dressing on wounds in patients with risk factors for early wound
      infection.

    <description>The Prevena™ System, a type of vacuum assisted closure, is indicated for use over clean, closed incisions that continue to drain following sutured or stapled closure. It acts by removing exudate, helping hold the edges of the incision together, protecting the surgical site from external contamination in a clean, protected postoperative wound environment.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Patients who meet the following criteria are eligible for admission
        into the study:

          -  Require spine surgery with a posterior midline incision that involves the thoracic,
             lumbar and/or sacral spine

          -  Capable of and agree to consent and randomization

          -  Be in one of the following clinical presentation groups:

               1. Metastic tumor of the thoracic or lumbar spine (T1-S5), requiring instrumentation
                  and decompression, with or without pre-operative radiation to surgical site

               2. Thoracolumbar degeneration or deformity (T1-S5) with index surgery &gt;6 months
                  prior, requiring revision surgery with additional instrumentation

               3. Acute traumatic thoracolumbar (T1-L5) fracture(s) with neurological deficit (AIS
                  A-C), requiring instrumentation and decompression

        All study participants will remain in hospital for a minimum of 7 days post-op as per
        standard of care. As a result, the full duration of application of the Prevena dressing
        will take place in hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria: patients who fulfill any of the following criteria are not eligible for
        admission into the study:

          -  Undergoing percutaneous surgery

          -  Active Surgical Site Infection (SSI) or primary spinal column infection or distant
             site infection (urinary tract, respiratory tract, etc.) at time of admission

          -  Pregnancy

        The following are clinical scenarios that would mandate the patients' exclusion from final
        analysis:

          -  Failure to complete the 6-week clinical follow-up (Lost to Follow Up)

          -  Second surgery required, at the same anatomical site, during study time period (six
             weeks), for causes other than primary (SSI) or secondary (dehiscence, seroma) study
