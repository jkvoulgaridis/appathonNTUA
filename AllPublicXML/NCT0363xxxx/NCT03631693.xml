  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, randomised, single-blind, parallel-group clinical trial that aims at
      evaluating the use of imaging (2D and 3D) in obtaining geometric and thermometric changes of
      postoperative healing patterns and comorbidities (facial swelling, oedema and inflammation)
      following two routine surgical procedures performed for the treatment of periodontal (gum)
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A surgery in a posterior sextant will be performed per patient. The surgical procedures being
      compared for their post-operative healing patterns are:

        1. Simplified Papilla Preservation Flap (SPPF) which is a conservative flap aiming at
           preserving the tissues between teeth.

        2. Resective Periodontal Flap with Osseous Recontouring (RPFO) which is a conventional
           surgery which involves hard and soft tissues resection.

      Geometric (3D) surface imaging and thermal (2D) surface imaging will be used to assess the
      post-operative healing patterns and comorbidities (facial swelling, oedema and inflammation)
      following either of the surgical procedures.

    <masking_description>The calibrated examiners will be blinded to the study treatment. Samples will be labelled anonymously with subject ID and without codes relating to treatment group; therefore, all sample analyses will be blinded.
Blinding of the statistician will also take place. Data will be coded during data entry according to treatment group with a number disallowing group identification during analyses. Code details of which each treatment group will be revealed only once analyses are complete.</masking_description>
