        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with T2DM, which was defined bypublished Criteria of World Health
             Organization in 1999;

          2. Patients were using glargine with or without oral hypoglycemic drugs and having a
             stable dose of glargine for more than 2 month would be recruited into this study;

          3. Patients had relatively constant diet and exercise in 2 month before the study.

          4. Fasting blood glucose was between 6.1 and 16mmolL, and postprandial (or random) blood
             glucose &lt;22.2mmol/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with severe cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, transient ischemic
             attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting,
             percutaneous coronary intervention, and heart failure;

          2. Patients with severe infectious diseases;

          3. Patients with acute complications of diabetes on admission, such as diabetic
             ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, and lactic acidosis;

          4. Patients with history of psychiatric disorders and were unsuitable to use CGMS;

          5. Patients used GLP-1 analoguesï¼ŒSGLT2 or more than once insulin injection in the past 3
             months

          6. Any other situations that made patients unsuitable to participate in the study, such
             as alcoholism and drug abuse.
