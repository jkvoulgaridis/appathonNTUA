  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a short audio clip about mindfulness implemented during NST
      appointments can lower pregnant women's levels of anxiety and depression. Subjects will be
      placed into either the intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will be
      asked to listen to a short audio clip on mindfulness during their NST appointments, and the
      control group will receive the standard of care during NST appointments. Subjects will be
      asked to take two surveys about anxiety and depression three times throughout the study:
      before the intervention, after the intervention, and 6 weeks postpartum.

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the course of 6 intervention sessions, followed by 6 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We are looking for the members of our intervention group to see a change in their scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory after completing 6 sessions of listening to a mindfulness clip. We expect to see this score change after the full-course of the intervention is complete. We also hope to see this change in score persist at the 6-week postpartum visit. This scale aims to measure anxiety symptoms, and total scores range from 0-36. Lower scores indicate lower levels of anxiety symptoms, and thus a better outcome.</description>
