  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) has a number ofiRB
      approved research studies involving human subjects, both normal volunteers and patients. As a
      means of identifying interested volunteers and other participants in the research process,
      this screening mechanism is established to identif'y potential eligible participants for NlA
      protocols.

      To participate, volunteers/patients must meet the specific requirements of at least one of
      the available NlA research studies; this protocol serves as a first step for admitting
      volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved protocol and creating a contact database for
      approved NlA studies.

      This protocol will facilitate their recruitment into NIA approved studies and provide NlA
      staff the opportunity to examine subjects where diagnostic observations can be documented and
      evaluated for research potential.

      The screening protocol is designed to evaluate volunteers/patients for participation in IRB
      approved clinical studies of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). An additional purpose of
      this protocol is to develop a registry of individuals who have been evaluated through the NIA
      Clinical Research Unit screening clinic. To participate, volunteers/patients must meet the
      specific requirements of at least one of the available NIA research studies. This protocol
      serves as a first step for admitting volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved protocol,
      and it is used to develop a registry of individuals who meet eligibility criteria for
      existing research projects.
