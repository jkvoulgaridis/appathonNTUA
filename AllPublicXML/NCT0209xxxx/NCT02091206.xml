  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study consisted of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Only Part A is described in
      this record. Part A was a randomized, double-blind 21-day treatment study period.
      Participants were randomized to one of 3 doses of active drug or placebo at a 4:1 ratio.

      Participants who satisfied all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were assigned a
      unique participant number and then began a 28-day baseline observation period.

      Eligible participants were then randomly assigned to receive one of 3 dose levels of
      GWP42003-P: 5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) per day, 10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, or
      matching placebo.

      There were three groups of ten participants. In each group, participants were randomly
      assigned so that eight participants received active treatment and two participants received
      placebo. Participants received GWP42003-P or placebo for a 21-day exposure period, which
      consisted of a titration period, followed by a stable dose period.

      A PK assessment took place after the first single dose of GWP42003-P. There was a second PK
      assessment after 21 days of consecutive dosing with GWP42003-P. Participants who took
      clobazam (CLB) as an adjunctive treatment were asked to take their usual dose 2 hours prior
      to attending the clinic. The same recommendation was made for other concomitant antiepileptic
      drugs (AEDs), if applicable. This was so that the pre-treatment (with GWP42003-P) plasma
      concentrations of CLB, its major metabolite N-desmethylclobazam, and any other concomitant
      AEDs could be measured, and the impact of GWP42003-P treatment on these levels evaluated.
      Interim clinic visits to (primarily) evaluate safety and adherence to the titration regimen
      took place at 7 and 14 days of treatment.

      After 21 days of treatment, all participants commenced a 10-day down-titration taper period.
      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed unblinded safety and PK data and
      recommended the target dose (up to 20 mg/kg/day) for Part B of the study and for an open
      label extension study. Once the safety review of Part A data had taken place, participants
      had the option of entering the open label extension study.

      A follow-up telephone call was made 28 days after the end of dosing for participants who did
      not enter the open label extension study within this time-frame.

      Throughout the 21-day treatment period and the 10-day taper period, there were regular safety
      telephone calls (approximately every 2 days) to check participant status. Weekly safety
      telephone calls were made during the 28-day follow-up period.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) through Safety follow-up visit (Day 60)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) with an onset date on or after the first dose of IMP. If an AE had a partial onset date and it was unclear from the partial date (or the stop date) whether the AE started prior to or following the first dose of IMP then the AE was considered a TEAE. The number of participants who experienced one or more severe TEAEs after dosing on Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Visit (Day 60) is presented.
A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Adverse Events module.</description>

    <description>AUC0-t for CBD and its major metabolites, 6-hydroxy-CBD (6-OH-CBD), 7-hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD), and 7-carboxy-CBD (7-COOH-CBD) were calculated using blood samples collected before and after IMP dosing on Days 1 and 22. One sample was collected predose, 2 to 3 hours postdose, and 4 to 6 hours postdose for CBD and its metabolites. Results are presented for participants who received GWP42003-P at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day during the study and for participants with a numeric result for the given evaluation.</description>

    <description>Plasma concentrations of CLB and N-CLB were measured on Days 1 and 22. Participants were instructed to take their daily dose of CLB 2 hours prior to the anticipated pre-IMP blood specimen collection on both days. Blood samples were collected prior to administration of IMP. Results are presented for a subgroup of participants who took CLB during the study and had PK samples analyzed at both PK sampling visits (Days 1 and 22).</description>

        <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) with an onset date on or after the first dose of IMP. If an AE had a partial onset date and it was unclear from the partial date (or the stop date) whether the AE started prior to or following the first dose of IMP then the AE was considered a TEAE. The number of participants who experienced one or more severe TEAEs after dosing on Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Visit (Day 60) is presented.

        <description>AUC0-t for CBD and its major metabolites, 6-hydroxy-CBD (6-OH-CBD), 7-hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD), and 7-carboxy-CBD (7-COOH-CBD) were calculated using blood samples collected before and after IMP dosing on Days 1 and 22. One sample was collected predose, 2 to 3 hours postdose, and 4 to 6 hours postdose for CBD and its metabolites. Results are presented for participants who received GWP42003-P at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day during the study and for participants with a numeric result for the given evaluation.</description>

          <title>Area Under The Concentration-Time Curve Calculated To The Last Observable Concentration At Time T (AUC0-t) For CBD And Its Metabolites At Days 1 And 22</title>
          <description>AUC0-t for CBD and its major metabolites, 6-hydroxy-CBD (6-OH-CBD), 7-hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD), and 7-carboxy-CBD (7-COOH-CBD) were calculated using blood samples collected before and after IMP dosing on Days 1 and 22. One sample was collected predose, 2 to 3 hours postdose, and 4 to 6 hours postdose for CBD and its metabolites. Results are presented for participants who received GWP42003-P at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day during the study and for participants with a numeric result for the given evaluation.</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set: included all participants randomized to treatment who received at least 1 dose of IMP. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment they received. Only participants for whom it had been confirmed that they did not take any IMP were excluded from the safety analysis set.</population>

Participants titrated GWP42003-P to 5 mg/kg/day over 3 days and remained at this dose for the rest of the 21-day treatment period (19 days). The 21-day treatment period was followed by a 10-day taper (10% per day) period.</description>

To maintain the blinded aspect of the study, participants titrated the placebo dose over 3 to 11 days according to the matched IMP group (3, 7, and 11 days for the 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P groups, respectively) and remained at this dose for the rest of the 21-day treatment period. The 21-day treatment period was followed by a 10-day taper (10% per day of the matched dose) period.</description>
