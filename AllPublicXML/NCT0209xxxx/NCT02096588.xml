  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), one of the drugs commonly used for the treatment of breast cancer,
      is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Anthracyclines may cause heart damage
      that can lead to weakening of the heart muscle. This heart damage may happen right away or
      may occur many years after the anthracycline is given

      Simvastatin is an oral medication approved by the FDA to lower cholesterol. Simvastatin is in
      a class of medications called statins. Some research has shown that statins may prevent heart
      damage that can be caused by anthracyclines like Doxorubicin (Adriamycin).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if taking simvastatin while receiving the
      chemotherapy Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) will minimize damage to the heart.

      This study is for women who will be receiving the anthracycline doxorubicin (Adriamycin) as
      part of their breast cancer treatment.
