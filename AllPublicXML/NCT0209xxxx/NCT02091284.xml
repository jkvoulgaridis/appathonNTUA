  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, eligible alcoholic inpatients recruited from a specialized clinic for
      addiction treatment, filling inclusion criteria and not showing any exclusion criteria, were
      randomized to receive the repetitive (10 sessions, every other day) bilateral dorsolateral
      Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC: cathodal left / anodal right) tDCS (2 milliamperes, 5 x 7 cm2, for
      20 min) or placebo (sham-tDCS). Craving to the use of alcohol was examined before (baseline),
      during and after the end of the tDCS treatment.

      Based in our previous data, our hypothesis was that repetitive bilateral tDCS over dlPFC
      would favorably change craving in alcoholism and this would be a long-lasting effect.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before (baseline) and after tDCS or sham-tDCS treatment, subjects were clinically examined
      regarding craving (obsessive compulsive drinking scale) and they were followed-up for
      relapses at least 3 months after treatment.

    <measure>Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Five applications: first week before tDCS treatment (baseline), second, third and fourth weeks, during the treatment, and in the fifth week, after the end of the tDCS treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Five items from the original obsessive compulsive drinking scale, which are believed to reliably assess craving in a narrow sense were used. Questions of this brief scale allow quantification of thoughts and feelings (obsessions), and behavioral intentions, and are answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in a total score between 0 and 20. Higher scores reflect more severe craving. These items were applied at the beginning, during and at the end of the treatment with sham-tDCS or tDCS.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (initial) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (final)</time_frame>
    <description>The FAB was used to explore six different domains of executive function. Each of these items is scored from 0 (zero) to a maximum of 3. Thus, the maximum score, meaning better scores, of FAB is 18. A single well trained examiner administered this assessment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (initial) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (final)</time_frame>
    <description>An adapted version of the MMSE in Portuguese was used. This version included an 11-item examination that examined five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score, meaning better scores, that could be achieved was 30, while a mean score between 23 and 26 or between 26 and 29 would be expected according to the age and educational level of the alcoholics.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (initial) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (final)</time_frame>
    <description>A structured multiple-choice questionnaire was used to assess the severity of depression symptoms. This instrument assesses the severity of symptoms observed in depression, such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss (Hamilton, 1960). Each question has between 3 and 5 possible answers that increase in severity. In the original scale, the first 17 questions contribute to the total score, while questions 18 to 21 provide additional information about depression (e.g., diurnal variation, paranoid symptoms), but are not included in the total score of the scale. Scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression; the maximum score is 52.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (initial) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (final)</time_frame>
    <description>A structured multiple-choice questionnaire designed to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms was employed. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (e.g., mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (e.g., physical complaints related to anxiety). The higher the scores, higher the severity. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where below 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (initial) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (final)</time_frame>
    <description>Electrophysiological recording was obtained through a 32-channel system placed on the scalp according to the International 10/20 EEG system.
A cue-reactivity paradigm was adapted following standard cue-reactivity paradigms well established for pictures and videos. During picture presentation the subjects were asked to press a button whenever the drug-related pictures were presented, and to withhold the response when the neutral pictures were presented (50% of the time). The percent change of ventral medial Prefrontal Cortex current density was analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (initial) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (final)</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated instrument of cross-culturally valid assessment of quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF) with 26 questions translated to Portuguese was applied at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment. This instrument yields four domains (physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment) and two individually scored items regarding overall perception of quality of life (Q1, i.e., first question) and health (Q2, i.e., second question). The four domain scores are scaled in a way that higher scores stand for higher quality of life. These scores were transformed to be comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100.</description>

        <title>Craving</title>
        <description>Five items from the original obsessive compulsive drinking scale, which are believed to reliably assess craving in a narrow sense were used. Questions of this brief scale allow quantification of thoughts and feelings (obsessions), and behavioral intentions, and are answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in a total score between 0 and 20. Higher scores reflect more severe craving. These items were applied at the beginning, during and at the end of the treatment with sham-tDCS or tDCS.</description>
        <time_frame>Five applications: first week before tDCS treatment (baseline), second, third and fourth weeks, during the treatment, and in the fifth week, after the end of the tDCS treatment.</time_frame>

            <description>Ten sessions (every other day) of bilateral transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS: 2 milliamperes, 3 x 7 cm2, during 20 minutes) over dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (cathodal left / anodal right).
transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: Direct currents were transferred via a pair of carbonated-silicone electrodes (35 cm2) with a thick layer of high conductive gel for EEG underneath them. The electric current will be delivered by an electric stimulator. To stimulate the left DLPFC, the cathode electrode was placed over F3 according to the 10-20 international system while the anode was placed over the contralateral F4 region. The currents flowed continuously for 20 minutes with an intensity of 2 milliamperes.</description>

            <description>Ten sessions (every other day) of placebo control (sham procedure) of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (sham-tDCS) during 20 minutes with electrodes placed over the dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (cathodal left / anodal right). Current was delivered for 20 seconds and was turned off for the rest of the stimulation period. In this way, subjects experienced the initial itching sensation at the beginning of stimulation, but received no current for the rest of the session.</description>

          <title>Craving</title>
          <description>Five items from the original obsessive compulsive drinking scale, which are believed to reliably assess craving in a narrow sense were used. Questions of this brief scale allow quantification of thoughts and feelings (obsessions), and behavioral intentions, and are answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in a total score between 0 and 20. Higher scores reflect more severe craving. These items were applied at the beginning, during and at the end of the treatment with sham-tDCS or tDCS.</description>

        <title>Changes in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</title>
        <description>A structured multiple-choice questionnaire was used to assess the severity of depression symptoms. This instrument assesses the severity of symptoms observed in depression, such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss (Hamilton, 1960). Each question has between 3 and 5 possible answers that increase in severity. In the original scale, the first 17 questions contribute to the total score, while questions 18 to 21 provide additional information about depression (e.g., diurnal variation, paranoid symptoms), but are not included in the total score of the scale. Scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression; the maximum score is 52.</description>

        <description>A structured multiple-choice questionnaire designed to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms was employed. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (e.g., mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (e.g., physical complaints related to anxiety). The higher the scores, higher the severity. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where below 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

        <description>Electrophysiological recording was obtained through a 32-channel system placed on the scalp according to the International 10/20 EEG system.
A cue-reactivity paradigm was adapted following standard cue-reactivity paradigms well established for pictures and videos. During picture presentation the subjects were asked to press a button whenever the drug-related pictures were presented, and to withhold the response when the neutral pictures were presented (50% of the time). The percent change of ventral medial Prefrontal Cortex current density was analyzed.</description>

        <description>An abbreviated instrument of cross-culturally valid assessment of quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF) with 26 questions translated to Portuguese was applied at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment. This instrument yields four domains (physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment) and two individually scored items regarding overall perception of quality of life (Q1, i.e., first question) and health (Q2, i.e., second question). The four domain scores are scaled in a way that higher scores stand for higher quality of life. These scores were transformed to be comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100.</description>

          <description>Ten sessions (every other day) of bilateral transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS: 2 milliamperes, 3 x 7 cm2, during 20 minutes) over dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (cathodal left / anodal right).
transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: Direct currents were transferred via a pair of carbonated-silicone electrodes (35 cm2) with a thick layer of high conductive gel for EEG underneath them. The electric current will be delivered by an electric stimulator. To stimulate the left DLPFC, the cathode electrode was placed over F3 according to the 10-20 international system while the anode was placed over the contralateral F4 region. The currents flowed continuously for 20 minutes with an intensity of 2 milliamperes.</description>

Current was delivered for 20 seconds and was turned off for the rest of the stimulation period. In this way, subjects experienced the initial itching sensation at the beginning of stimulation, but received no current for the rest of the session.</description>
