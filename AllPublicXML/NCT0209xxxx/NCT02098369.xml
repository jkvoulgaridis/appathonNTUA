  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 1 million individuals in the US have a prescription for supplemental oxygen (O2). Using
      O2 can prolong life and increase quality of life. Patients often do not use their oxygen as
      prescribed, which means that they are not benefiting as much as they could be from this
      therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a PEer-Led O2 Infoline for patients
      and CAregivers (PELICAN) will increase adherence to supplemental oxygen prescription and
      improve health in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COPD Foundation operates a peer-led telephone-based information line, but its
      effectiveness in promoting adherence to O2 therapy and patient-centered outcomes is unknown.
      Our overall hypothesis is that a patient-centered Peer-Led O2 InfoLine for patients and
      CAregivers (PELICAN) will increase adherence and improve health. We have developed a
      broad-based collaboration with patients/caregivers, advocacy groups, a national O2 supplier,
      and others to conduct a 3-arm pragmatic clinical trial, to evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness of proactive vs. reactive PELICAN interventions vs. usual care on adherence to
      O2 (primary outcome) and on other patient-centered outcomes (secondary outcomes).
