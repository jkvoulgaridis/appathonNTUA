    <textblock>
      This trial assesses blood and tumor samples for the effect of trametinib with or without
      uprosertib on biomarkers in patients enrolled on trial GOG02290 with endometrial cancer that
      is persistent or has come back. Biomarkers found in the blood and tissue may be related to
      the reaction or response to the study drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the impact of trametinib alone or in combination with uprosertib (GSK2141795)
      on RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K pathway signaling.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine associations with early changes in functional proteomic biomarkers in tumor
      biopsies before and after treatment and tumor response in two subgroups of patients with
      recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer who are treated with trametinib alone or in
      combination with GSK2141795.

      II. To examine levels of circulating tumor cells in blood samples before and after treatment
      and correlate with tumor response in two subgroups of patients with recurrent or persistent
      endometrial cancer who are treated with trametinib alone or in combination with GSK2141795.

      III. To examine the bRaf/cRaf dimer or Raf/KSR/Mek1 dimers in paraffin sections from these
      patients before treatment by proximity ligation assay (PLA) assays.

      IV. To quantify exosomes from these patients before and after treatment by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay with CD63 antibody and explore bRaf/cRaf dimer or
      Raf/KSR/Mek1 dimers in exosomes from these patients before and after treatment by PLA assays.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood at screening, between days 3 and 5, 28, and 56. Patients
      also undergo collection of tumor biopsy at screening and day 28.

    <measure>Change in biomarker expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will use descriptive statistics and graphical methods to compare pre-treatment to post-treatment changes in biomarker expression between patients with and without each type of response for each treatment arm and subgroup. Will estimate mean changes from pre-treatment to each post-treatment assessment with 95% confidence intervals. will use a 2-sample t-test to compare treatment arms with respect to the mean change in biomarker expression. Will use a 2-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare treatment arms with respect to the median change in biomarker expression. This testing may also be restricted to specific subgroups (e.g., patients with complete response), depending on the characteristics of patients accrued. Will also use regression methods to model the change in biomarker expression with time and type of response.</description>

    <measure>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will use descriptive statistics and graphical methods to compare the numbers of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) over time for patients with and without each type of response for each treatment arm and subgroup. Will estimate with 95% confidence intervals the mean number of CTCs at each assessment time for patients with and without each type of response for each treatment arm and subgroup.</description>
