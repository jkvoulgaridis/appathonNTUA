  <brief_summary>

      Primary Objective: To quantify the benefits of the SENATOR decision support software on the
      reduction of ADR rates in older hospitalized patients. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the
      effect of SENATOR with regard to use of appropriate non‐pharmacological therapies in subjects
      with one core geriatric syndrome.

      Tertiary Objectives: to examine the association of SENATOR use with subject survival,
      morbidity and health related quality of life.

      Health Economic Objective: To examine the potential health economic consequences of using
      SENATOR.

      There are two study phases:

      Phase I: Prospective multinational, multicentre observational study to estimate the baseline
      adjudicated medical and surgical ADR rates by clinical subspeciality in 6 international
      sites.

      Phase II: Prospective multinational, multicentre, block randomized, two parallel arm, open
      label, controlled trial, with blinded outcome ascertainment, of the efficacy of SENATOR
      software in reducing ADRs in older hospitalized subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I is designed to test the electronic case report form (eCRF) and the ADR ascertainment
      method in the six clinical sites in advance of Phase II (randomization phase).

      In Phase I, we recruited 644 older multi-morbid patients from the 6 clinical sites. After
      obtaining written informed consent, patients' demographic, clinical and medication details
      were entered to the eCRF. In the event of one a 12 item Trigger List of adverse clinical
      events occurring, the eCRF automatically generated a Trigger List assessment proforma. The 12
      items in the Trigger List included:

        1. New onset falls

        2. New onset unsteady gait

        3. Acute kidney injury

        4. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension

        5. Serum electrolyte disturbance

        6. Symptomatic bradycardia

        7. New onset major constipation

        8. Acute bleeding

        9. Acute dyspepsia/nausea/vomiting

       10. Acute diarrhea

       11. Delirium

       12. Symptomatic hypoglycemia

      In addition, we have included 'Unspecified adverse event' in order to capture the wide range
      of well recognized ADRs associated with various medications. For example, the rapid onset of
      a generalized maculopapular rash in a patient with penicillin hypersensitivity would be
      identified as an ADR under the 'Unspecified adverse event' category.

      ADR adjudication in Phase I was blinded and no ADR adjudications were undertaken by the site
      principal investigator (PI). ADRs were defined as 'definite', probable', 'possible',
      'unlikely' or 'indeterminate' according to WHO-UMC ADR causality critria. ADR severity was
      defined according to a modified Hartwig ADR severity scale ranging from Level 1 (trivial) to
      Level 7 (fatal).

      Consensus on ADR causality was achieved through a potential endpoint adjudication committee
      (PEPAC), whose members were the 6 clinical site PI's. A matrix for achieving consensus was
      devised, such that there was a final decision on the causality of all potential ADRs.

    <masking_description>For outcome data, details were extracted from patients' case records to determine if trigger list adverse clinical events had occurred following randomization. These trigger list events represented the great majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and were independently adjudicated by a blinded end-point committee comprised of the co-PI's, such that no co-PI adjudicated potential ADRs at his own site.</masking_description>
