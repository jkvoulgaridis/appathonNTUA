      This phase II open label study will evaluate adolescents (≥ 16 years of age) and adults with
      neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas treated with the MEK inhibitor
      PD-0325901. The primary aim of the study will be to assess quantitative radiographic response
      in a target lesion. Subjects will receive PD-0325901 by mouth on a bid dosing schedule of 2
      mg/m2/dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg bid. Each course is 4 weeks duration, and subjects
      will receive drug on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule. Subjects may receive additional courses
      beyond course 8 only if there is at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor.
      Subjects who have a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume at the end of 12 courses
      can continue on therapy for up to an additional year (maximum of 24 total courses). However,
      subjects who do not achieve at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor after 8
      courses (~8 months) will be considered treatment failures and taken off study.

      The Primary purpose of this protocol is to determine whether PD-0325901 results in objective
      radiographic responses based on volumetric MRI measurements in adolescents and adults with
      NF1 and growing or symptomatic inoperable PN.

      There are several secondary aims of this protocol:

      To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of chronic PD-0325901 administration in this patient
      population

      To estimate the objective response rate of up to 2 non-target plexiform neurofibromas to
      PD-0325901 by MRI

      To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of PD-0325901 when administered to this patient
      population

      To evaluate quality of life and pain during treatment with PD-0325901

      This phase II open label study will evaluate adolescents (≥ 16 years of age) and adults with
      neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas treated with the MEK inhibitor
      PD-0325901. The primary aim of the study will be to assess quantitative radiographic response
      in a target lesion. Subjects will receive PD-0325901 by mouth on a bid dosing schedule of 2
      mg/m2/dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg bid. Each course is 4 weeks duration, and subjects
      will receive drug on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule. Subjects may receive additional courses
      beyond course 8 only if there is at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor.
      Subjects who have a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume at the end of 12 courses
      can continue on therapy for up to an additional year (maximum of 24 total courses). However,
      subjects who do not achieve at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor after 8
      courses (~8 months) will be considered treatment failures and taken off study.

      Subjects will have retinal screening performed before starting PD-0325901 and regularly while
      on study drug. Patients with glaucoma, intraocular pressure &gt;21 mmHg, or any other
      significant abnormality (excluding chronic, stable ophthalmological findings secondary to
      Optic Pathway Glioma) on ophthalmic examination (performed by an ophthalmologist) will not be
      eligible. Patients who have received radiation or cytotoxic therapy within 4 weeks of study
      entry and patients who have received radiation to the orbit at any time previously, will not
      be eligible for the study. Patients with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical
      disease will also be excluded. In addition, pregnant women will not be eligible for
      enrollment and subjects of reproductive age will be required to practice birth control while
      on treatment.

      Subjects entered on the trial will be carefully monitored for the development of PD-0325901
      associated toxicities.

      In all consenting subjects entered on this trial, a complete pharmacokinetic profile of
      PD-0325901 after administration will be evaluated during course 1. Involvement with this part
      of the study will be required.

      Consenting subjects with dermal neurofibromas will have punch biopsies of dermal
      neurofibromas at two time points to determine if the PD-0325901 is affecting the biologic
      target. Involvement with this part of the study will be optional.

      Since plexiform neurofibromas may significantly impact the lives of patients with NF1, this
      study will evaluate the effects of the disease and treatment with PD-0325901 on the quality
      of life (QOL) of adolescents and adults. Involvement in this part of the study will be
      required. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module
      will be used to assess the QOL of subjects. The PedsQL NF1 Module is a self-reported
      disease-specific QOL scale developed for adolescents and adults with NF1. It assesses 16
      domains of functioning including physical functioning, emotional functioning, social
      functioning, cognitive functioning, physical appearance, worry, pain and hurt, fatigue, and
      daily activities. Preliminary data collected on this scale indicates good reliability and
      validity in adults. The preliminary data in a small sample of adolescents also looks
      promising. Data collected from this trial may be used toward validating this instrument since
      no disease specific QOL measure for NF1 currently exists, but such a tool is critically
      needed. Pain will be assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11), which is an
      11-point self-report scale of pain intensity. In addition, the Brief Pain Inventory Pain
      Interference Scale is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures the extent to which
      pain interferes with daily functioning. Both of these brief measures have been recommended to
      assess different aspects of pain in clinical trials.

      For subjects who respond to PD-0325901 (≥20% tumor volume reduction of target lesion by 12
      courses), an MRI scan of the target lesion is requested (but not required) at 4 and 12 months
      after stopping drug (as long as the subject is still on protocol) in order to determine
      whether response is maintained post-therapy. These studies will not be requested from
      subjects who experience disease progression while on study drug.

      Before the subject can be enrolled, the responsible institutional investigator must sign and
      date the completed eligibility checklist. The completed eligibility checklist should be faxed
      to the NF Operations Center to confirm eligibility prior to subject enrollment.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL™ NF1 Module asks how much of a problem each item has been during the past one month. A 5-point response scale: 0= never a problem...4= almost always a problem). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 0-100 Higher scores = better HRQOL. The total scale score is the sum of items divided by the number answered. Subscale scores are computed similarly. If more than 50% of the items in the scale are missing, the scale score is not computed. The Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) is a self-report segmented 11-point numeric scale that assesses pain intensity with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; at the right end of the line and 10 representing &quot;worst pain you can imagine&quot;. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)—Pain Interference Scale is a 7-item self-report questionnaire asking (general activity, mood, walking, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) in the past week with 0 = no interference and 10 = completely interferes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment unless otherwise indicated below. All clinical and laboratory data required
             for eligibility of a subject must be available in the subject's medical or research
             record.

          -  All subjects must have EITHER the clinical diagnosis of NF1 using the NIH Consensus
             Conference criteria OR have a constitutional NF1 mutation documented in a CLIA/CAP
             certified lab.

          -  Subjects must have plexiform neurofibroma(s) that are progressive OR are causing
             significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that are
             compromising the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that are
             causing nerve compression and loss of function, lesions causing major deformity (e.g.,
             orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring lesions of the extremity that cause
             limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions. Subjects with paraspinal
             plexiform neurofibromas will be eligible for this trial. Histologic confirmation of
             tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and radiographic
             findings

          -  For subjects enrolled for tumor progression, progression is defined as:

               -  Presence of new plexiform neurofibroma on MRI or CT (documented by comparison
                  with prior MRI or CT), OR

               -  A measurable increase in plexiform neurofibroma size (≥ 20% increase in the
                  volume, or a ≥ 13% increase in the product of the two longest perpendicular
                  diameters, or a ≥ 6% increase in the longest diameter) documented by comparison
                  of two scans (MRI or CT) approximately one year or less prior to evaluation for
                  this study.

          -  For subjects enrolled for a &quot;major deformity&quot; or &quot;significantly disfiguring&quot; tumor,
             eligible tumors will be limited to tumors of the head &amp; neck or those on other areas
             of the body that are unable to be concealed by standard garments. In order to enroll a
             plexiform neurofibroma for these indications, the Study Chair or Co-Chair must be
             contacted to review subject eligibility prior to enrollment.

          -  Measurable disease: Subjects must have measurable plexiform neurofibroma(s) amenable
             to volumetric MRI analysis. The target lesion must be seen on at least 3 consecutive
             MRI slices and the field of view must contain the entire tumor of interest. Tumors
             must be at least 3 mL in volume (most PNs 3 cm in longest diameter will meet this
             criteria). If the tumor is &lt;3 cm in longest diameter, the subject may still be
             eligible. Central review of the MRI of the target plexiform is required prior to
             enrollment to ensure that the tumor is measurable and amenable to volumetric analysis.
             After consenting, images will be sent for Central review

          -  Age: Subjects must be ≥ 16 years of age at the time of study entry.

             be enrolled on this study.

          -  Performance Level: Karnofsky greater than or equal to 50% Note: Subjects who are
             unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be
             considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.

          -  Prior Therapy: Subjects are only eligible if complete resection of a plexiform
             neurofibroma with acceptable morbidity is not feasible, or if a subject with surgical
             option refuses surgery.

          -  Subjects who underwent surgery for a progressive plexiform neurofibroma will be
             eligible to enter the study after the surgery, provided the plexiform neurofibroma was
             incompletely resected and is evaluable by volumetric analysis.

          -  Subjects may have been previously treated for a plexiform neurofibroma or other
             tumor/malignancy, but must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

          -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 4 weeks of entry onto
             this study.

          -  Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a
             growth factor that supports platelet, red or white cell number or function.

          -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 14 days since the completion of therapy
             with a biologic agent. These subjects must be discussed with the Study Chair on a
             case-by-case basis.

          -  Investigational Drugs: Subjects must not have received an investigational drug within
             4 weeks.

          -  Steroids: Subjects with endocrine deficiencies are allowed to receive physiologic or
             stress doses of steroids if necessary.

          -  6 months from involved field radiation to index plexiform neurofibroma(s); 6 weeks
             must have elapsed if subject has received radiation to areas outside index plexiform
             neurofibroma(s). Subjects who have received radiation to the orbit at any time are
             excluded.

          -  Surgery: At least 2 weeks since undergoing any major surgery and must be recovered
             from effects of surgery.

          -  Subjects who have received radiation to the orbit at any time previously

          -  Subjects with glaucoma, intraocular pressure &gt;21 mmHg, or any other significant
             abnormality on ophthalmic examination (performed by an ophthalmologist).

          -  Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing Optic Pathway Glioma such as
             optic nerve pallor or strabismus will NOT be considered significant for the purposes
             of the study.

          -  Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed
             to use an effective contraceptive method during the period they are receiving the
             study drug and for 3 months thereafter. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth
             control. Women of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to administration of PD-0325901 and must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test.

          <description>The primary aim of the study will be to assess quantitative radiographic response in a target lesion. Subjects will receive PD-0325901 by mouth on a bid dosing schedule of 2 mg/m2/dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg bid. Each course is 4 weeks duration, and subjects will receive drug on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule. Subjects may receive additional courses beyond course 8 only if there is at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor. Subjects who have a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume at the end of 12 courses can continue on therapy for up to an additional year (maximum of 24 total courses). However, subjects who do not achieve at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor after 8 courses (~8 months) will be considered treatment failures and taken off study.

            <description>The primary aim of the study will be to assess quantitative radiographic response in a target lesion. Subjects will receive PD-0325901 by mouth on a bid dosing schedule of 2 mg/m2/dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg bid. Each course is 4 weeks duration, and subjects will receive drug on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule. Subjects may receive additional courses beyond course 8 only if there is at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor. Subjects who have a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume at the end of 12 courses can continue on therapy for up to an additional year (maximum of 24 total courses). However, subjects who do not achieve at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor after 8 courses (~8 months) will be considered treatment failures and taken off study.

        <title>Quality of Life Using the Pain Subscale of the NRS-11 and PedsQL™ NF1 for Subjects Receiving PD-0325901 Using Age-based Assessments</title>
        <description>The PedsQL™ NF1 Module asks how much of a problem each item has been during the past one month. A 5-point response scale: 0= never a problem...4= almost always a problem). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 0-100 Higher scores = better HRQOL. The total scale score is the sum of items divided by the number answered. Subscale scores are computed similarly. If more than 50% of the items in the scale are missing, the scale score is not computed. The Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) is a self-report segmented 11-point numeric scale that assesses pain intensity with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; at the right end of the line and 10 representing &quot;worst pain you can imagine&quot;. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)—Pain Interference Scale is a 7-item self-report questionnaire asking (general activity, mood, walking, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) in the past week with 0 = no interference and 10 = completely interferes.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to 12 Months</time_frame>
        <population>NRS-11 are on a scale of 0-10 with 0 being no pain, higher scores are greater intensity. BPI pain interference scale yields a total score (each item 0–10 and total score=mean all items) higher scores are more pain interference.Remaining items are initially a 5-point Likert scale (0-4) and transformed to a 0-100 scale with higher scores better QOL.</population>

            <title>Agent PD-0325901</title>
            <description>The primary aim of the study will be to assess quantitative radiographic response in a target lesion. Subjects will receive PD-0325901 by mouth on a bid dosing schedule of 2 mg/m2/dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg bid. Each course is 4 weeks duration, and subjects will receive drug on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule. Subjects may receive additional courses beyond course 8 only if there is at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor. Subjects who have a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume at the end of 12 courses can continue on therapy for up to an additional year (maximum of 24 total courses). However, subjects who do not achieve at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor after 8 courses (~8 months) will be considered treatment failures and taken off study.

          <description>The PedsQL™ NF1 Module asks how much of a problem each item has been during the past one month. A 5-point response scale: 0= never a problem...4= almost always a problem). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 0-100 Higher scores = better HRQOL. The total scale score is the sum of items divided by the number answered. Subscale scores are computed similarly. If more than 50% of the items in the scale are missing, the scale score is not computed.

            <description>The primary aim of the study will be to assess quantitative radiographic response in a target lesion. Subjects will receive PD-0325901 by mouth on a bid dosing schedule of 2 mg/m2/dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg bid. Each course is 4 weeks duration, and subjects will receive drug on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule. Subjects may receive additional courses beyond course 8 only if there is at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor. Subjects who have a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume at the end of 12 courses can continue on therapy for up to an additional year (maximum of 24 total courses). However, subjects who do not achieve at least 15% reduction in volume of the target tumor after 8 courses (~8 months) will be considered treatment failures and taken off study.
