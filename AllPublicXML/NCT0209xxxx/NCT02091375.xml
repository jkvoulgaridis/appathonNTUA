      GWEP1332 Part B recruited an entirely new group of participants than GWEP1332 Part A.
      Participants who failed the entry criteria for Part A were eligible to take part in Part B.

      Part B was a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week comparison of
      GWP42003-P versus placebo. The aim of Part B was to assess the antiepileptic efficacy of
      GWP42003-P as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment compared with placebo, with respect to
      the percentage change from baseline during the treatment period of the study in convulsive
      seizure frequency in children and young adults.

      Following the establishment of initial eligibility and baseline measurements, participants
      entered Part B and began a 28-day baseline observation period.

      Eligible participants were then randomized to receive either GWP42003-P or placebo on a 1:1
      basis and titrated up to the target dose that was identified in Part A (up to 20 milligrams
      [mg] per kilogram [kg] per day), which was confirmed following completion of Part A by an
      independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee who reviewed unblinded safety and
      pharmacokinetic data from Part A.

      Participants received investigational medicinal product for 14 weeks, consisting of a
      titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period.

      Efficacy and safety were monitored at various clinic visits and via telephone. After 14 weeks
      of treatment, all participants were offered the option of entering an open label extension
      (OLE) study. Entry was within seven days of the final treatment visit. Participants who did
      not immediately enter the OLE study commenced a down-titration taper period lasting up to 10
      days. The taper period was interrupted if the participant wished to enter the open label
      extension study within the seven-day timeframe.

      For participants who opted not to enter the OLE study, a follow-up telephone call was made 28
      days after the end of dosing and weekly safety telephone calls were made during the 28-day
      follow-up period.

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline In Convulsive Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT) (Day 99) or Early Termination (ET)</time_frame>
    <description>Convulsive seizures (atonic, clonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic) were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as: ([frequency during the treatment period - frequency during baseline]/frequency during baseline) * 100. The frequency during each period was based on 28-day averages and calculated as: (number of seizures in the period/number of reported days in the IVRS period) * 28. Baseline included all available data prior to Day 1 (28-day average). Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Global Impression Of Change In Seizure Duration (CGICSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure duration was assessed qualitatively using the CGICSD. Caregivers were asked &quot;Since the patient started treatment, please assess the average duration of the patient's seizures (comparing their condition now to their condition before treatment)&quot;; responses included decrease, no change, or increase in average duration. For each seizure type, only participants with at least 1 seizure for the corresponding seizure type, reported at any time during the study, were included.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline In Sleep Disruption 0 To 10 Numerical Rating Scale (0 to 10 NRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption 0 to 10 NRS questionnaire was completed by the participant's caregiver. The caregiver was asked 'On a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your child's sleep disruption in the last week.' The markers ranged from 0 = 'slept extremely well' to 10 = 'unable to sleep at all'. The change from baseline in the sleep disruption 0 to 10 numerical rating scale score was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline and age group (2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. A negative change from baseline represents an improvement in sleep. Last visit for endpoints assessed at clinic visits was defined as the last scheduled visit (not including the end of taper or safety follow-up visits) at which participant's last evaluation was performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS questionnaire was completed by the participant's caregiver. The change from baseline in the ESS score was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline and age group (2 to 5 years, 6- to 2 years and 13 to 18 years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. The total score was the sum of the 8 item-scores and ranged from 0 to 24. A higher total score represents greater levels of daytime sleepiness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life In Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLCE questionnaire was completed by the parent or caregiver of participants aged 4 years and above. The change from baseline in the overall quality of life score was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline and age group (2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. Zero represents the lowest or poorest category and 100 represents the highest level of functioning. The overall quality of life score was calculated by taking the mean of the subscale scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Vineland-II) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland-II scores (standard scores and adaptive levels for each adaptive behavior domain, the adaptive behavior composite, and the maladaptive behavior index score and level) were assessed by the participant's caregiver. Scores were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline and age group (2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. Higher scores represent greater levels of functioning except for the maladaptive behavior index, for which a negative change from baseline represents an improvement in condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Global Impression Of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC was used to assess the participant's overall condition on a 7-point scale using the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse, or very much worse&quot; (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline In Convulsive Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Convulsive seizures (atonic, clonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic) were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as: ([frequency during the treatment period - frequency during baseline]/frequency during baseline) * 100. The frequency during each period was based on 28-day averages and calculated as: (number of seizures in the period/number of reported days in the IVRS period) * 28. Baseline included all available data prior to Day 1 (28-day average). Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Sleep Disruption 0 To 10 Numerical Rating Scale (0 to 10 NRS) Score</title>
        <description>The sleep disruption 0 to 10 NRS questionnaire was completed by the participant's caregiver. The caregiver was asked 'On a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your child's sleep disruption in the last week.' The markers ranged from 0 = 'slept extremely well' to 10 = 'unable to sleep at all'. The change from baseline in the sleep disruption 0 to 10 numerical rating scale score was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline and age group (2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. A negative change from baseline represents an improvement in sleep. Last visit for endpoints assessed at clinic visits was defined as the last scheduled visit (not including the end of taper or safety follow-up visits) at which participant's last evaluation was performed.</description>

The change from baseline in the ESS score was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline and age group (2 to 5 years, 6- to 2 years and 13 to 18 years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. The total score was the sum of the 8 item-scores and ranged from 0 to 24. A higher total score represents greater levels of daytime sleepiness.</description>

            <description>Participants received placebo (0 mg/mL CBD), volume-matched to the 20 mg/kg/day dose level, administered orally, half in the morning and half in the evening. To maintain the blinded aspect of the study, participants titrated the placebo dose over 11 days and remained at this dose for the 12-week maintenance period. If the participant did not immediately enter the OLE study, the maintenance period was followed by a 10-day taper (10% per day of the matched dose) period.</description>

          <description>The CGIC was used to assess the participant's overall condition on a 7-point scale using the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse, or very much worse&quot; (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set: included all participants in the Part B safety analysis set who had post-baseline efficacy data. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. The ITT analysis set was the primary analysis set for all efficacy outcome measures.</population>
