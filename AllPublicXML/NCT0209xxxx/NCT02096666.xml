  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 study. The study will evaluate the tolerability, safety and
      activity of AMG 337 in Asian subjects who have advanced solid tumors (Phase 1) or subjects
      with MET amplified tumors with a focus on gastric/gastroesophageal junction/esophageal
      adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, single arm, open-label study to assess the safety, efficacy
      and pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 in solid tumors. In the Phase 1, approximately 3 to 45
      subjects enrolled in a 3+3+3 dose escalation scheme evaluating two dose levels. In the Phase
      2, approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort 1 (subjects with MET
      amplified /gastroesophageal junction/esophageal (G/GEJ/E) adenocarcinoma with measurable
      tumor) or Cohort 2 (subjects with MET amplified solid tumors with measurable tumor and
      subjects with MET amplified G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma with non-measurable tumor). All subjects
      will self-administer AMG 337 daily until disease progression or other protocol specified end
      of treatment criteria are met. Tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1 will be followed during study
      treatment.

      Tumor tissue, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics and Patient Reported Outcomes will be assessed.

          -  Phase 2: Subjects must have a pathologically confirmed, advanced G/GEJ/E
             adenocarcinoma (cohort 1) or other solid tumor (cohort 2) for which the subjects have
             received prior therapy for advanced disease, or for which no standard therapy exists,
