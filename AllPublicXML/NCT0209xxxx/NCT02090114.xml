  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single site, open label study of the effects of parenteral testosterone followed
      by enzalutamide, abiraterone or castration-only therapy in men with metastatic CRPC who
      previously progressed on one of these forms of therapy. The study will enroll four cohorts of
      patients: men with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on enzalutamide (Cohort A; n=30); men
      with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on abiraterone acetate (Cohort B; n=30); men with
      metastatic CRPC who have progressed on first line castration-only therapy (Cohort C; n=30);
      men with metastatic CRPC with inactivating somatic or germline mutations in ≥2 of the genes
      TP53, PTEN, or RB1 (Cohort D; n=20).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 110 patients, 30 for each Cohorts A-C and 20 for Cohort D.
      Eligible patients will continue on androgen ablative therapy with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex,
      Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) if not surgically castrated to suppress endogenous testosterone
      production. Patients will also receive intramuscular injection with either testosterone
      cypionate or testosterone enanthate at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dosing scheme was
      designed to produce rapidly fluctuating serum testosterone levels from the supraphysiologic
      to the near-castrate range (i.e. Bipolar Androgen Therapy [BAT]). Assessments for response to
      testosterone will be made approximately every 3 months. Upon displaying evidence of
      progression, patients will then go on to receive either abiraterone (Cohort B) or
      enzalutamide (Cohort A), whichever agent they had previously progressed on prior to study
      enrollment. Patients in Cohort C will remain on LHRH agonist therapy and receive no
      additional androgen ablative hormonal therapy while those in the mutation-positive Cohort D
      will receive enzalutamide regardless of prior therapy.
