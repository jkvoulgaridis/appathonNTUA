  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose for this study is to provide access to 3,4 DAP, a drug which has
      demonstrated to be effective in treating weakness associated with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic
      Syndrome. LEMS is a rare autoimmune cause of a defect in neuromuscular transmission. The
      disorder is clinically characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness, hyporeflexia and
      autonomic dysfunction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of LEMS cases are associated with malignancy, usually small cell lung cancer.
      These paraneoplastic cases progress more quickly than primary autoimmune LEMS. An overlap
      syndrome with other autoimmune diseases is often detected in LEMS patients.

      3,4 DAP is effective in LEMS because it increases calcium influx into the nerve terminal by
      blocking potassium efflux and thereby prolonging the presynaptic action potential. 3,4 DAP is
      less likely to provoke epileptic seizures than its precursor, 4-aminopyridine, because it is
      less able to cross the blood-brain barrier. 3,4 DAP is effective in increasing strength and
      improving autonomic symptoms in LEMS patients of both the primary autoimmune and
      paraneoplastic etiologies.

    <time_frame>Participants were followed until they withdrew or the study ended. Time frame ranged from 1 month to 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle weakness will be assessed monthly for the first 3 months based on clinical assessment during office visits. Muscle weakness will then be assessed every 6 months once the patient is stabilized based on clinical assessments during office visits. The assessment of whether there was an improvement in muscle weakness, based on the PI's clinical judgment, was noted during the last study visit completed by the participant.</description>
