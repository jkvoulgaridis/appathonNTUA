  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in patients with
      hypovitaminosis D can decrease nonunion (failure to heal) incidence in patients with
      fractures of the humerus, femur, or tibia. The central hypothesis of the study is that
      vitamin D supplementation in patients with fractures and hypovitaminosis D will decrease the
      risk of nonunion compared to placebo treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining calcium and phosphate balance in the body
      and is important for maintenance of bone formation, remodeling, and healing. An extensive
      literature search indicates that although there is evidence that vitamin D deficiency is
      associated with fracture risk, there is no evidence of the role of vitamin D deficiency in
      subsequent failure to heal. The aims of study were to: 1) quantify the rate of
      hypovitaminosis D in an orthopedic trauma population in the Southeastern United States; 2)
      determine the rate of nonunion in vitamin D deficient patients, and 3) assess the feasibility
      of acute high-dose vitamin-D supplementation in hypovitaminosis D patients.

    <measure>Fracture Union</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture Union is define as either clinical or radiological union. Clinical union defined as the absence of pain at the fracture site with the ability to bear full weight on the extremity without pain for activities of daily living (ambulation, lifting, carrying). Radiological union was determined by two blinded, independent review-ers and defined as the presence of bridging callus across at least three of four cortices or two of four cortices with a stable implant. When discrepancies between clinical and radiological union arose, the clinical assessment of union was preferred. Discrepancies in radiological outcomes were re-examined and a consensus view was obtained between reviewers if needed, to determine the outcome.If a patient did not meet the criteria for union and had at least nine months of follow•up or underwent re-operation for a diagnosis of a nonunion, they were deemed to have a nonunion.</description>

        <title>Fracture Union</title>
        <description>Fracture Union is define as either clinical or radiological union. Clinical union defined as the absence of pain at the fracture site with the ability to bear full weight on the extremity without pain for activities of daily living (ambulation, lifting, carrying). Radiological union was determined by two blinded, independent review-ers and defined as the presence of bridging callus across at least three of four cortices or two of four cortices with a stable implant. When discrepancies between clinical and radiological union arose, the clinical assessment of union was preferred. Discrepancies in radiological outcomes were re-examined and a consensus view was obtained between reviewers if needed, to determine the outcome.If a patient did not meet the criteria for union and had at least nine months of follow•up or underwent re-operation for a diagnosis of a nonunion, they were deemed to have a nonunion.</description>
