  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is the first of its kind and will allow health care professionals and
      researchers to answer many questions about the reasons why anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      injury leads to knee pain and disability and osteoarthritis. We also hope that this study
      will be the beginning of new, more powerful and safer drugs to help patients with ACL
      injuries heal sooner and return to sports or daily activities pain free. Study participants
      will be recruited from the University of Kentucky and Vanderbilt University.

      The purpose of this research is to gather information on how safe and effective Kenalog® is
      in alleviating knee pain following ACL rupture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injury to the knee during sports participation often involves partial of full detachment of
      the ACL. ACL tears cause pain, swelling and inflammation. While the swelling and inflammation
      usually goes away in time, individuals with ACL injuries may experience pain and notice knee
      instability (knee slipping, etc.). Often surgery can repair or replace the ACL within the
      joint, allowing individuals the ability to walk or run again pain free or participate in
      sports. Unfortunately, osteoarthritis of the knee, which also causes pain and swelling, can
      occur in that same knee 10-20 years later for reasons which are not well understood.

      In this research study, we hope to prevent and reduce the initial post-operative pain. The
      reduction of pain will allow for earlier movement of the knee joint and preparation for
      surgery. It may also reduce the risk to develop osteoarthritis in individuals with ACL
      injuries by treating them within 1-2 days after their injury.

          <title>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Scale (KOOS) Pain Subscale</title>
          <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales with five questions per scale; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life QOL. The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The baseline KOOS Pain scores are presented here.</description>

        <title>Synovial Matrix Metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) Concentration</title>
        <description>Participants will have a knee joint aspiration during their initial orthopedic consult and during pre-op assessment. Synovial fluid will be aspirated and spun at 3500RPM for 10 minutes then the supernatant will be pipetted and frozen. The supernatant will be used to measure MMP-1 concentration using an immunoassay. Data will be presented as the change in MMP-1 concentration from knee aspirate collected during the initial orthopedic consult after injury and during the participant's pre-operative assessment, usually 1-7 days after the initial consult.</description>
