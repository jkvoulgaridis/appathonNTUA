    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, parallel, placebo-controlled, phase III study
      for evaluation of clinical efficacy and immunogenicity of drug Eritromax® - (rHuEPO Blau
      Farmacêutica S/A.) compared to Eprex® (Janssen-Cilag rHuEPO) for the treatment of patients
      with secondary anemia to chronic kidney disease (CKD), throughout the correction phase by
      assessing the change in hemoglobin levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III study, in which participants with secondary anemia to chronic kidney
      disease will receive two subcutaneous injection of 50 UI/Kg of the investigational product
      (Eritromax®) or Eprex® per week. After four weeks of treatment, the dose of drugs will be
      change by clinical judged throughout study according to laboratory results. The evidence of
      efficacy will be evaluated by hemoglobin levels alteration throughout the correction phase
      (first four weeks). Secondary efficacy and safety endpoints will be assessed by: maintenance
      of hemoglobin levels (baseline vs. end of treatment) over maintenance phase; dose of EPO
      required during correction and maintenance phase; Transfusion needs; report of adverse events
      (including type, frequency, intensity, serioussness, severity and relation to the
      investigation product) throughouht 12 months of follow-up. Additionally, the immunological
      response of products over study will be evaluated by quantification of anti-erythropoietin
      every six months.

    <description>In the correction phase, change in serum Hb levels (baseline vs. end of initial treatment (EOIT) = levels of Hb presented before the V0 treatment compared to the Hb levels presented at the end of the correction phase) will be evaluated for a maximum period of 6 months after starting treatment. This one parameter will be demonstrated through: Percentage of participants achieving Hb levels within the target (≥ 10.5 to ≤ 12 g / dL).</description>
