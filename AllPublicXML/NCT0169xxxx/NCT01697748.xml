  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the placement of silver impregnated dressings beginning
      in the OR will improve wound healing in patients undergoing cesarean delivery compared to
      traditional Telfa pads. This study will also explore the presumed improvement in scar
      integrity when silver impregnated dressings are used compared to the Telfa pads.

      The study will compare the percentage of patients who develop a surgical site infection after
      application of silver impregnated dressings versus standard Telfa dressings. Investigators
      will also assess the cosmetic appearance and pain of the cesarean section scar at the
      patient's one week and 6 week post-operative visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective study involving 660 patients undergoing cesarean sections
      at Tampa General Hospital. The control group (n=330) will receive standard Telfa pad dressing
      and the treatment group (n=330) will receive the silver impregnated dressing.

      The primary objective is to compare the percentage of patients who develop a surgical site
      infection between the two groups at the 1-week and 6-weeks post operative visits. The
      secondary objective is to assess the cosmetic outcome of the cesarean incision observed at
      the 1-week and 6-week post-operative visits. A plastic surgery investigator will also conduct
      a blinded assessment of cosmetic outcome by review of photographs taken of the wounds at
      1-week and 6-weeks.The tertiary objective is to evaluate the amount of narcotic and non
      narcotic medicine consumed during the hospitalization and query the patient with regards to
      pain involving the cesarean wound at 1 and 6 week post-operative visits

    <description>A surgical site infection involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue is defined as either
The presence of a purulent discharge from the wound on inspection, or
Purulent discharge obtained from the wound after exploration based on the suspicion of the provider (erythema, swelling, heat or pain), or
The presence of a seroma or hematoma discharge from the wound on inspection or after exploration that also involves isolation of an organism from an aseptically obtained culture based on suspicion of the provider (erythema, swelling, heat or pain). Seromas or hematomas with negative cultures will not be considered a surgical site infection.</description>

        <description>A surgical site infection involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue is defined as either
The presence of a purulent discharge from the wound on inspection, or
Purulent discharge obtained from the wound after exploration based on the suspicion of the provider (erythema, swelling, heat or pain), or
The presence of a seroma or hematoma discharge from the wound on inspection or after exploration that also involves isolation of an organism from an aseptically obtained culture based on suspicion of the provider (erythema, swelling, heat or pain). Seromas or hematomas with negative cultures will not be considered a surgical site infection.</description>
