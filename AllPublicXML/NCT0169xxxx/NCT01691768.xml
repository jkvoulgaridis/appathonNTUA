      The CAPRISA 008 trial is a two-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial that is being
      conducted at the CAPRISA eThekwini and CAPRISA Vulindlela Clinics and their neighboring
      public sector family planning services in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Up to 700 consenting
      sexually active, HIV-uninfected women aged 18 years and older who previously participated in
      an antiretroviral (ARV) prevention study will be enrolled and followed for a maximum 30
      months. All women will be provided with 1% tenofovir gel but will be randomised to either
      receive their gel through a public sector family planning services with 2-3 monthly provision
      (intervention arm) or through the CAPRISA research clinics with monthly provision (control
      arm).

      All women in the trial will be provided with the standard package of HIV prevention and
      reproductive health services. Participants in both study arms will be provided with a supply
      of single-use, pre-filled applicators of 1% tenofovir gel. While in the study, participants
      will be advised and supported to follow the CAPRISA 004 pre- and post-dosing strategy, namely
      BAT24, where the first dose of tenofovir gel is applied within 12 hours before anticipated
      coitus and a second dose as soon as possible but within 12 hours after coitus, with a maximum
      of two doses of gel in a 24-hour period.

      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of an implementation model
      for tenofovir gel provision through family planning services.

    <measure>Mean Number of Returned Used Applicators Per Month (i.e in 30 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2012 to 2015, up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the mean number of returned used applicators per month. Since participants in the intervention arm followed two and three monthly schedule (as opposed to monthly in the intervention arm), the number of returned used applicators per month for each participant will be estimated as the total number of returned applicators at that visit divided by the number of days since the previous visit, multiplied by 30. Thus a uniform distribution of gel use will be assumed in participants whom we did not see monthly. Intent to treat and per protocol analyses were carried out of this outcome. Intent to treat population includes all participants who were randomized, met pre-randomization eligibility criteria and who have post-enrollment follow-up data. The per protocol population is a subset of the intent to treat population.The per-protocol analysis excluded visits where no gel had been dispensed for &gt;120 days.</description>

    <measure>HIV Incidence Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2012 and 2015, up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to HIV infection was calculated as the difference between estimated date of infection (midpoint between the last negative HIV test date and the first confirmed positive HIV test date) and enrolment date, plus one. Where a participant has a positive PCR and a negative rapid test on the same date, the date of infection is calculated as 14 days prior to this date. Women who do not become HIV positive before their last study visit will be censored on the day of their last negative HIV test. Their follow-up time will be calculated as the difference between date of censoring and enrolment date, plus one.</description>

    <measure>Pregnancy Incidence Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2012 and 2015, up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to pregnancy, was as the difference between the estimated date of conception and the enrolment date, plus one. The date of conception was defined as 14 days after the last normal menstrual period or the estimated date of delivery minus 40 weeks if the first date of last normal menstrual period is not available or the midpoint between the date of the first positive pregnancy test and the date of the previous negative pregnancy test. The censoring time for a woman who did not become pregnant during the study equals the difference between the calculated censoring date and the enrolment date, plus one.</description>

    <time_frame>Between 2012 and 2015, up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported adherence to the tenofovir gel dosing strategy.Gel adherence was defined as the estimated proportion of reported sex acts covered by two gel doses and calculated for each woman by dividing half the number of returned used applicators each month by the number of reported sex acts that month.For participants attending 2-3 monthly clinic visits, their number of gels used in the last 30 days will be estimated as the total number of returned used gels, divided by the number of days between the current and the previous visit, times 30.</description>

        <title>Mean Number of Returned Used Applicators Per Month (i.e in 30 Days)</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is the mean number of returned used applicators per month. Since participants in the intervention arm followed two and three monthly schedule (as opposed to monthly in the intervention arm), the number of returned used applicators per month for each participant will be estimated as the total number of returned applicators at that visit divided by the number of days since the previous visit, multiplied by 30. Thus a uniform distribution of gel use will be assumed in participants whom we did not see monthly. Intent to treat and per protocol analyses were carried out of this outcome. Intent to treat population includes all participants who were randomized, met pre-randomization eligibility criteria and who have post-enrollment follow-up data. The per protocol population is a subset of the intent to treat population.The per-protocol analysis excluded visits where no gel had been dispensed for &gt;120 days.</description>

Thus a uniform distribution of gel use will be assumed in participants whom we did not see monthly. Intent to treat and per protocol analyses were carried out of this outcome. Intent to treat population includes all participants who were randomized, met pre-randomization eligibility criteria and who have post-enrollment follow-up data. The per protocol population is a subset of the intent to treat population.The per-protocol analysis excluded visits where no gel had been dispensed for &gt;120 days.</description>
