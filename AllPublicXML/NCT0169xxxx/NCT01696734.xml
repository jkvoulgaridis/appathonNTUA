  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well domperidone works in treating patients with
      gastrointestinal disorders. Domperidone may help control chronic gastrointestinal disorders
      and their symptoms, such as pain, bloating, and nausea and vomiting, by stimulating
      contraction of the stomach to increase its ability to empty itself of food.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide treatment with domperidone to patients &gt;= 16 years of age where, according to
      the investigators' judgment, a prokinetic effect is needed for the relief of gastrointestinal
      (GI) motility disorders.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive domperidone orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) or four times daily (QID).
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.

    <measure>Attenuation of symptoms associated with disorder(s) of gastrointestinal motility, measured by change in Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GSCI) score from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scale ranges from &quot;0&quot; meaning &quot;None&quot; to &quot;5&quot; meaning &quot;Very Severe&quot;.
Patients will be classified as either &quot;new&quot; or &quot;continuing&quot; at the baseline visit. A new patient will have a &quot;response&quot; if he/she has a 25% reduction in GCSI at 8 weeks. A continuing patient will already have early benefit to treatment so will have a &quot;response&quot; if the GCSI score does not increase more than 20% over baseline at 8 weeks. Summary statistics including number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be computed. Bayesian 95% credible intervals will be computed.</description>
