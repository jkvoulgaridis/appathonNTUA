      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 23 study centers between 15 February 2013 (first participant first visit) and 16 November 2018 (last participant last visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>It was a 3 part study (Part 1: Pharmacokinetic assessment, Part 2: [Part 2a-calcium carbonate and lanthanum carbonate {crossover comparison} or Part 2b-lanthanum carbonate], Part 3: lanthanum carbonate treatment for 6 months). Overall 63 participants enrolled in the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Part 1: Single Dose Lanthanum Carbonate</title>
          <description>Participants aged 10 to 12 years received 500 milligram (mg) and greater than (&gt;) 12 years received 1000 mg single dose of lanthanum carbonate oral powder in the morning following breakfast.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Part 2a: Calcium Carbonate, Then Lanthanum Carbonate (8 Weeks)</title>
          <description>Participants received calcium carbonate oral tablet until the target serum phosphorus level achieved or until a maximum daily dose of 6500 mg was reached and once serum phosphorus control was achieved the dose was maintained until the end of 8 weeks calcium carbonate, followed by 3 weeks of washout period (if necessary). At the end of first 8-week treatment period of part 2a, participants received lanthanum carbonate powder orally at a daily dose of 1500 mg mixed into meals and given three times a day or twice daily with a single dose not exceeding 1000 mg, total daily dose was titrated bi-weekly until a maximum dose of 3000 mg was reached and once the serum phosphorus control was achieved the dose was maintained until the end of 8 weeks lanthanum carbonate treatment period.</description>

          <title>Part 3: Lanthanum Carbonate (6 Months)</title>
          <description>Participants who completed in Part 2 (2a or 2b) could continue to receive lanthanum carbonate for an additional 6 months. Dosage of lanthanum carbonate was determined by the investigator based on serum phosphate levels taken at each study visit up to a maximum dose of 3000 mg/day.</description>

Eligible participants received lanthanum carbonate oral powder for 8 weeks at a daily dose of 1500 mg, which was titrated bi-weekly until a daily dose of 3000 mg was achieved (part 2b). Participants who completed part 2 continued the same treatment for additional 6 months during the part 3.</description>

        <description>KDOQI serum phosphorus targets were defined for: Adolescents aged greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 12 to less than (&lt;) 18 years to be less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (1.78 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]); Children aged &gt;=10 years to &lt;12 years to be &lt;= 6.0 mg/dL (1.94 mmol/L). Percentage of participants achieving age-specific KDOQI targets for serum phosphate level was reported only for the participants who had received lanthanum carbonate during part 2 or part 3. Data was analyzed and presented as per the intervention received in this study related to this outcome and not analyzed based on each part of the study.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in calcium-phosphorus product levels at the last visit of each 8-week treatment period during Part 2 and monthly during the 6-month extension phase (Part 3) were reported. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the first dose of investigational product. Here, number of participants analyzed refers to the number of participants evaluable for this outcome at specified time point. The unit of measure of this outcome was millimole square per square liter. Data was analyzed and presented as per the intervention received in this study related to this outcome and not analyzed based on each part of the study.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline in bone turnover markers including bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, and sclerostin was reported for combined Part 2 and 3. End of the study (EOS) was defined as the completion if the participants benefited from and desired to continue dosing with lanthanum. Here, number of participants analyzed refers to the number of participants evaluable for this outcome at specified time point. Data was analyzed and presented as per the intervention received in this study related to this outcome and not analyzed based on each part of the study.</description>
          <population>PP1 included participants who had taken at least 1 dose of investigational product and completed 8 weeks of calcium carbonate followed by 8 weeks of lanthanum carbonate and who had serum phosphate assessment data available during Part 2 to allow summarizing the percentage of participants achieving age-specific KDOQI target.</population>
