    <textblock>
      The treatment of chronic low back pain is a major objective of public healthcare, because it
      causes an important number of sick leaves. A correlation between clinical observations and an
      inflammatory discopathy has been underlined, but there is currently any reference treatment.
      In this study, the main objective is to assess the efficacy of an intradiscal injection of
      corticoids versus local anaesthetic on the treatment of pain of patients with low back pain
      associated to a Modic I discopathy.

    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months,6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Low back pain parameters will be assessed by the Oswestry scale. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>
