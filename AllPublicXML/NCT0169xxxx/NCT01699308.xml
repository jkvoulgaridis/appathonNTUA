    <textblock>
      The current protocol aims to compare the brain-functioning (fMRI &amp; EEG) and white matter
      structural integrity (DTI) of persons with mild to severe TBI with and without Growth Hormone
      deficiency during cognitive tasks; and to examine changes in cognitive and motor performance,
      EEG/fMRI and white matter integrity associated with growth hormone treatment for twelve
      months using an open-label design in persons with GH deficiency/insufficiency following mild
      to severe TBI. To meet this aim, we are in the process of screening 40 persons with mild to
      severe TBI, ages 18-55, who are at least six months post injury. After screening, 10 persons
      with TBI and GHD (Growth Hormone deficiency) will receive daily rhGH injections titrated to
      bring their GH levels into the normal range over the course of twelve months. Treatment will
      be initiated using rhGH (Genotropin). Subjects with TBI and GHD will be assessed at baseline,
      6 months, and 12 months with EEG, fMRI and DTI, and neuropsychological measures. 5 persons
      with TBI who do not have GHD will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months with EEG, fMRI and
      DTI, and neuropsychological measures.

    <description>10 persons with TBI and GHD will receive daily rhGH injections titrated to bring their GH levels into the normal range for one year. Treatment is initiated using Genotropin (rhGH) at an initial daily dose of 200mcg/day subcutaneously with a titration schedule calling for an increase in daily dosage by 200 mcg every two months until the target daily dose, 600 mcg/day, is achieved. The 10 GHD subjects will be assessed at baseline with EEG, fMRI and DTI and neuropsychological measures, again at 6 months, and a third time at 12 months.</description>
