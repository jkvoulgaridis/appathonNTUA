  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children is coupled with the
      increased prevalence of childhood obesity in the last two decades. Obesity during the
      adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences, including T2DM,
      hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial problems. The first step toward effective obesity management
      and T2DM prevention is monitoring of physical activity (PA) and dietary intake. With the
      rapid expansion of cellular networks, and advancements in smartphone technologies, it is now
      possible to monitor PA and dietary intake and at the same time to transmit data digitally to
      their primary care providers (PCP). The proposed pilot study will include the collaboration
      among UCSF, North East Medical Services (NEMS), mHealth teams, and overweight and/or obese
      adolescents. The study will adapt and implement smartphone-based technologies and integrate
      these technologies with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to increase PA and dietary intake.
      Two specific aims of this proposed study include: (1) adapt fitbit Ultra applications for the
      smartphone-based technologies and EHR and (2) and assess the feasibility and estimate the
      effect for patient outcomes (self-efficacy, physical activity, dietary intake, BMI, and lipid
      profile), at 3 months post intervention between the intervention and control groups. The
      smartphone app for the intervention group will allow the teens to graphically compare daily
      PA and dietary intake with the goal, participate in a reward program where they can collect
      virtual points for achieving the goal, and play interactive games related to PA and diet. A
      total of 40 overweight and/or obese adolescents at NEMS will be recruited and randomized to
      the feasibility study (Aim 2).

    <textblock>
      Using evidence to inform the design of clinical practice is a foundational principle of
      modern health care practice. In the present pilot study, using evidence from research on
      technology in clinical practice facilitated development of a hybrid intervention that
      combined lifestyle modification with routine clinical care. Chief among the benefits of this
      hybrid smartphone technology-based intervention (STB) was the potential to improve health
      outcomes and reduce obesity in overweight and obese adolescents. The purposes of this study
      were to (1) measure effects of an innovative smartphone-technology-based (STB) intervention
      for overweight and obese adolescents and to (2) examine the intervention's feasibility for
      use in primary care clinics.The STB intervention had 3 components: use of Fitbit Flex,
      participation in the online educational program, and receipt of bi-weekly text message during
      the maintenance phase. A randomized control study design was utilized. Data regard to
      anthropometrics (BMI and waist-hip ratio), blood pressure, levels of physical and sedentary
      activity, diet, and self-efficacy regarding physical activity and diet were collected at
      baseline, 3 month and 6 months after the baseline assessment.

    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' BMI was determined by dividing body mass (weight) by height squared (kg/m2). Adolescents' weight and height were measured while the adolescents wore light-weight clothes and no shoes. For BMI, adequate sensitivity and specificity has been reported in children and adolescents, with sensitivity ranging from 29% to 88% and specificity ranging from 94% to 100%.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Diastolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were measured by using a mercury sphygmomanometer with specific cuff size appropriate for adolescents (Baumanometer, W. A. Baum Co., Copiague, New York). After participants sat for 10 minutes, blood pressure was measured twice in the adolescent's right arm; blood pressures were measured to the nearest 2 mmHg. Average score of two measures was used.</description>

        <description>Participants' BMI was determined by dividing body mass (weight) by height squared (kg/m2). Adolescents' weight and height were measured while the adolescents wore light-weight clothes and no shoes. For BMI, adequate sensitivity and specificity has been reported in children and adolescents, with sensitivity ranging from 29% to 88% and specificity ranging from 94% to 100%.</description>
