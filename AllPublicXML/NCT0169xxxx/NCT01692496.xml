  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue and bone sarcomas are rare malignant tumors, which encompasses a large family of
      more than 50 histologically distinct tumor subtypes, all of which share a putative
      mesenchymal origin. In the case of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) surgical excision is the
      mainstay of treatment, but despite curative surgery, around half of patients develop distant
      metastases and die from disease. Few therapeutic approaches are currently available to
      patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic STS and only anthracyclines,
      ifosfamide and trabectedin have shown activity, with response rates of 20-40% in previously
      untreated patients. Recent and ongoing trials have investigated a variety of combination
      chemotherapeutic regimens (variously employing ifosfamide, doxorubicin, gemcitabine,
      temozolomide, vincristine, cisplatin, and dacarbazine, among others) as well as targeted
      therapies, which in some cases have yielded improvements in response rate but which have had
      little impact on survival. No other medical option is currently available, and the median
      survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma with non-resectable metastases is around 12-15
      months, and approximately 8 months after second line chemotherapy.

      Liposarcomas are STS which account for at least 20% of all STS in adults. They can be further
      classified into 3 histologically and biologically different subtypes: well-differentiated
      liposarcoma/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (ALT-WD), myxoid or round cell liposarcoma and
      pleomorphic liposarcoma.

      ALT-WD liposarcomas are locally aggressive rarely metastasizing tumors characterized by ring
      or giant marker chromosomes on the cytogenetic analysis and by amplification of the 12q13-21
      region on Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) (MDM2, CDK4 and HMGIC). They account for
      about 40% iv of liposarcomas with a 5 year Overall survival (OS) around 80%. In a series of
      WD/DD treated with several regimens response rate was 12.5% OS 15 months and median PFS 3.6
      months(95 confidence interval (CI): 3.3-5.9) Mixoid /round cell liposarcoma accounts for
      45-50% of all liposarcomas. They tend to metastasize to unusual soft tissue and bone
      locations. High histologic grade with more than 5% of round cell component is associated with
      a 5-year OS of 50% approximately. They are characterized by t(23;16)(q13-14;p11) which leads
      to the fusion of CHOP and TLS genes Pleomorphic liposarcoma accounts for approximately 5-10%
      of all liposarcomas, characterized by high grade features with frequent and early lung
      metastasis and cytogenetically by high chromosome counts and complex structural
      rearrangements.

      VEGF is expressed in many STS in which increased expression is associated with higher grade
      and worse prognosis.

      Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that targets mainly VEGFR, PDGFR and c-kit.
      Recently the results of a phase II trial of pazopanib in STS have been published. It was a
      four-cohort 2-stages study. The liposarcoma stratum was closed after the first stage because
      of a PFS at 12 weeks of 17% (3 out of 17 patients did not progressed after 12 weeks). After
      central pathologic review, 2 other patients initially classified as other STS were found to
      have liposarcoma with stable disease at 12 weeks (5/19: 26% PFS12w), thus fulfilling criteria
      for cohort expansion. Phase II study had been completed and in phase III study patients with
      liposarcomas were excluded so therefore data on the liposarcoma cohort are inconclusive.

      Furthermore the positive results of the phase III study PALETTE have been recently
      communicated, encouraging this treatment in other sarcomas: progression-free survival (PFS)
      per independent review was significantly prolonged with pazopanib (median: 4.6 vs 1.5 months;
      HR=0.31, 95% CI 0.24-0.40; P&lt;0.0001). The interim analysis for overall survival shows a
      statistically non-significant improvement of pazopanib vs placebo (median: 11.9 vs 10.4
      months, HR=0.83, 95% CI 0.62-1.09).

      Soluble factors associated with efficacy and toxicity of pazopanib in these patients had been
      also reported. Decreases in VEGFR2 and increase in PlGF were both associated with toxicity
      (HTA and TSH elevation) and poorer prognosis.

    <measure>Growth Modulation Index (GMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Imaging studies required to investigate known disease should be repeated every 6 weeks for the first 12 weeks and every 8 weeks up to 36 months. At patient progression confirmed by means RECIST criteria V 1.1</time_frame>
    <description>GMI is the ratio between time to progression (TTP) with pazopanib (TTPp) divided by the TTPp-1 with the previous line of therapy.
GMI index values higher than 1 indicate that Pazopanib treatment has an increased time to progression when compared to previous line of treatment.
GMI index values lower than 1 indicate that Pazopanib treatment has a reduced time to progression when compared to previous line of treatment.
Higher GMI values are associated to a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed 12 Weeks After Start of Treatment</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of Pazopanib in patients with advanced and/or metastatic liposarcoma by means of progression-free survival (PFS) assessed 12 weeks after start of treatment. (According the RECIST criteria 1.1 and central radiology review).
Progression was defined according to RECIST criteria 1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions</description>

        <description>GMI is the ratio between time to progression (TTP) with pazopanib (TTPp) divided by the TTPp-1 with the previous line of therapy.
GMI index values higher than 1 indicate that Pazopanib treatment has an increased time to progression when compared to previous line of treatment.
GMI index values lower than 1 indicate that Pazopanib treatment has a reduced time to progression when compared to previous line of treatment.
Higher GMI values are associated to a better outcome.</description>
