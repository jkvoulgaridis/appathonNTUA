  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical research study to find out if it is safe to stop the drug nilotinib (Tasigna) in
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Patients who started treatment with imatinib
      (Gleevec) when they were first diagnosed with CML, then switched to nilotinib (Tasigna) for
      at least 2 years with the combined time on imatinib (Gleevec) and nilotinib (Tasigna) for at
      least 3 years and have very small amount of leukemia cells remaining after the nilotinib
      (Tasigna) treatment will qualify for the study.

    <description>TFR is defined as no confirmed loss of MR4 (Molecular response 4.0 log reduction from baseline) or loss of MMR (major molecular response) and no re-starting of nilotinib therapy within 12 months following cessation of nilotinib. Confirmed loss of MR4 is two consecutive BCR-ABL &gt; 0.01% IS. Loss of MMR does not require confirmationTFR is calculated by dividing the number of patients with no documented confirmed loss of MR4, no documented loss of MMR and no re-starting of nilotinib therapy in the first 48 weeks after starting nilotinib TFR phase by the number of patients who entered nilotinib TFR phase.</description>

    <description>Nilotinib will be labeled as AMN107 and supplied as 150 mg and/or 200 mg hard gelatin capsule. Nilotinib will not be dosed by weight or body surface area. Nilotinib will be administered orally at 300 mg twice daily (BID) or 400 mg BID, at approximately 12 hour intervals, and must not be taken with food. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours before the dose is taken and no additional food should be consumed for at least one hour after the dose is taken. Patients who were previously treated with 400 mg BID, and required subsequent permanent dose reduction to 400 mg QD will be allowed to enter this study on the same dose, 400 mg once daily.</description>

                  contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
