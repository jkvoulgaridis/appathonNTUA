      The primary objective of this post-approval study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes in a
      cohort of patients with non-paroxysmal forms of atrial fibrillation (persistent or
      long-standing persistent) treated during commercial use of the AtriCure Synergy Ablation
      System by physicians performed the Maze IV procedure.

      This prospective, open label, multi-center, observational, single arm registry is designed to
      monitor the AtriCure Synergy Ablation System continued safety and efficacy during the
      peri-procedural and long-term phase during commercial use in patients being treated for
      non-paroxysmal forms of atrial fibrillation who are undergoing a concomitant open, on-pump
      cardiac surgical procedure.

    <description>The number of participants free from atrial fibrillation (AF), i.e., episodes lasting &gt;30 continuous seconds duration of either AF, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia while off Class I and III antiarrythmic drugs for at least 4 weeks as determined by core last assessment of a 48 hour Holter, Zio Patch or Pacemaker Implantation (PPM) interrogation recording performed at a minimum of 36 months postoperatively.</description>

    <description>Patient will undergo an elective open cardiac surgical procedure to be performed on cardiopulmonary bypass for one or more of the following:
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; or equal to 18 years of age

          -  History of non-paroxysmal form of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) as defined by the Heart
             Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society
             Consensus Statement:

               -  Persistent AF shall be defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond seven
                  days. Episodes of AF in which a decision is made to electrically or
                  pharmacologically cardiovert the patient after greater than or equal to 48 hours
                  of AF but prior to 7 days, should also be classified as persistent AF episodes.

               -  Longstanding persistent AF shall be defined as continuous AF of greater than 12
                  months duration. The performance of a successful cardioversion (sinus rhythm &gt;30
                  seconds) within 12 months of an ablation procedure with documented early
                  recurrence of AF with 30 days should not alter the classification of AF as
                  longstanding persistent.

          -  Subject is scheduled to undergo elective open cardiac surgical procedure(s) to be
             performed on cardiopulmonary bypass for one or more of the following: Coronary Artery
             Bypass Grafting, Mitral valve repair or replacement, Aortic valve repair or
             replacement, Tricuspid valve repair or replacement. In conjunction with these
             procedure patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD) repair are allowed.

          -  The patient (or their legally authorized representative) agrees to participate in this
             study by singing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form.

          -  Willing and able to return for scheduled follow up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stand along AF without indication(s) for concomitant cardiac surgery.

          -  Need for emergent cardiac surgery (i.e., cardiogenic shock).

          -  Preoperative need for an intra-aortic balloon pump or intravenous inotropes.

          -  Pregnancy or desire to get pregnant for the duration of the study concomitant surgical
             procedure through the thirty six (36) month follow up period).

          -  Enrolled in another clinical trial that could confound the results of this study.

          <description>Patients with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (persistent or longstanding persistent)who are scheduled to undergo elective concomitant open, on-pump cardiac surgical procedure and the Maze IV ablation procedure. This single arm registry is designed to monitor the AtriCure Synergy Ablation System for continued safety and efficacy during the peri-procedural and long term phase during commercial use.
Synergy Ablation System: Patient will undergo an elective open cardiac surgical procedure to be performed on cardiopulmonary bypass for one or more of the following:
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)
Mitral valve repair or replacement
Aortic valve repair or replacement
Tricuspid valve repair or replacement The aim of the treatment is a complete bi-atrial Maze IV procedure which includes pulmonary vein isolation coupled with lesions made on both the left and right atria.</description>
