  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to provide further evidence regarding a groundbreaking
      psychological treatment for suicide prevention in individuals with moderate to severe
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), Window to Hope (WtoH). The study will be one of the first five
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) internationally to evaluate a psychological treatment for
      affective distress after TBI and the first conducted in the United States (U.S.) to
      specifically address suicide risk as an outcome.

      The current project aims to adapt WtoH for U.S. military personnel/Veterans (expert Consensus
      Conference, participant total up to 15), implement the intervention in a Veterans Affairs
      Medical Center (VAMC) (Pilot Groups 1-4, participant total up to 12), and replicate the
      results from the original trial in this novel context with a larger sample size (n=70
      completed protocols [up to 90 recruited]. Deliverables are expected to include an
      intervention suitable for both dissemination and larger Phase III trials.

      Prior to implementing the intervention, Dr. Simpson will work with VA study team members
      (e.g., Drs. Brenner, Matarazzo, Signoracci) to modify WtoH manual semantics and graphics to
      meet the needs of the U.S. Veteran population. Dr. Brenner has a long history of working
      within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and is a Diplomate in Rehabilitation
      Psychology. An expert committee (up to 15 participants) will also be convened for a meeting
      focused on the cross-cultural adaptation of WtoH. All efforts will be made to include experts
      in treating TBI and stakeholders (e.g., Veterans with or without TBI and/or family
      members/support persons) on the committee. Members of the research team will contact
      potential committee members by phone, email, mail or in person. Presentations may also be
      made to Veterans/family members/support persons receiving care, participating in patient
      advocacy activities, or providing peer support. Prior to reviewing the content, the expert
      committee will be provided background on the current state of knowledge about suicidality and
      hopelessness after TBI, available treatment options, and information regarding the underlying
      theoretical basis and key features of the WtoH program. The committee will then review the
      ten sessions to identify potential changes required to the therapeutic content, exercises,
      language and graphics to ensure that it is culturally appropriate for the VAMC context.
      Modifications will be made employing a consensus approach among the expert committee.

      The adapted program will then be trialed across four pilot groups. Once the pilot groups have
      been completed (see below) the expert committee will be reconvened for a final review of the
      program. Data collected on acceptability and feasibility will be presented to the committee
      and test therapists. Any necessary final modifications to assessment procedures and/or the
      intervention to ensure that the program is appropriate for the Veterans' condition will be
      made employing a consensus approach.

      The revised version of the manual will be used to conduct the RCT. Up to 90 Veterans will
      participate.

    <measure>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 2 BHS was assessed 3-months after Time 1 baseline assessment for both arms of the trial. Time 3 BHS was assessed 6 months after Time 1 baseline for both arms of the trial.</time_frame>
    <description>The BHS is a 20-item true-false self-report scale that measures the level of negative expectations about the future held by respondents over the previous week. Scores range from 0 to 20 representing nil (0-3), mild (4-8), moderate (9-14), and severe (&gt;14) levels of hopelessness. Beck et al. found that BHS scores equal to or greater than 9 were associated with significantly elevated levels of suicide risk (Beck et al., 1985). As such, to be eligible to participate in this treatment trial individuals must have a score of 9 on the BHS at the time of screening and at the Time 1 baseline assessment. BHS outcome administered at the following study timepoints: Time 1 (Baseline for both arms), Time 2 (Post-Intervention for WtoH Intervention arm and Baseline 2 for Waitlist Control arm), and Time 3 Assessment (3 month follow up for WtoH Intervention arm and Post-Intervention for Waitlist Control arm.</description>

    <time_frame>Time 2 BSS was assessed 3-months after Time 1 baseline assessment for both arms of the trial. Time 3 BSS was assessed 6 months after Time 1 baseline for both arms of the trial.</time_frame>
    <description>The BSS is a 19-item scale that assesses severity of suicide ideation within the previous week with total scores ranging from 0 (no suicide ideation) to 38. High levels of internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .93) and concurrent validity have been reported with the Beck Depression Inventory (r =.64 to r =.75, Beck &amp; Steer, 1993) as well as the BHS in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) (r =.60, Simpson &amp; Tate, 2002) and non-brain-damaged populations (r =.52 to r = .63, Beck &amp; Steer, 1993). BSS outcome administered at the following study timepoints: Time 1 (Baseline for both arms), Time 2 (Post-Intervention for WtoH Intervention arm and Baseline 2 for Waitlist Control arm), and Time 3 Assessment (3 month follow up for WtoH Intervention arm and Post-Intervention for Waitlist Control arm</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) is a self-report instrument measuring the severity of common depressive symptoms. Each of its 21 items is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3; total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater degrees of depressive symptomatology. High levels of internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.93) have been reported as well as concurrent validity with the BDI (r = 0.64 to r = 0.75), and the BHS among those with TBI (r = 0.60) (Beck and Steer, 1998) and general population samples (r = 0.52 to r = 0.63). (Beck and Steer, 1993). BDI-II outcome administered at the following study timepoints: Time 1 (Baseline for both arms), Time 2 (Post-Intervention for WtoH Intervention arm and Baseline 2 for Waitlist Control arm), and Time 3 Assessment (3 month follow up for WtoH Intervention arm and Post-Intervention for Waitlist Control arm</description>

        <title>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</title>
        <description>The BHS is a 20-item true-false self-report scale that measures the level of negative expectations about the future held by respondents over the previous week. Scores range from 0 to 20 representing nil (0-3), mild (4-8), moderate (9-14), and severe (&gt;14) levels of hopelessness. Beck et al. found that BHS scores equal to or greater than 9 were associated with significantly elevated levels of suicide risk (Beck et al., 1985).

          <title>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</title>
          <description>The BHS is a 20-item true-false self-report scale that measures the level of negative expectations about the future held by respondents over the previous week. Scores range from 0 to 20 representing nil (0-3), mild (4-8), moderate (9-14), and severe (&gt;14) levels of hopelessness. Beck et al. found that BHS scores equal to or greater than 9 were associated with significantly elevated levels of suicide risk (Beck et al., 1985). As such, to be eligible to participate in this treatment trial individuals must have a score of 9 on the BHS at the time of screening and at the Time 1 baseline assessment. BHS outcome administered at the following study timepoints: Time 1 (Baseline for both arms), Time 2 (Post-Intervention for WtoH Intervention arm and Baseline 2 for Waitlist Control arm), and Time 3 Assessment (3 month follow up for WtoH Intervention arm and Post-Intervention for Waitlist Control arm.</description>

          <title>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II)</title>
          <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) is a self-report instrument measuring the severity of common depressive symptoms. Each of its 21 items is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3; total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater degrees of depressive symptomatology. High levels of internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.93) have been reported as well as concurrent validity with the BDI (r = 0.64 to r = 0.75), and the BHS among those with TBI (r = 0.60) (Beck and Steer, 1998) and general population samples (r = 0.52 to r = 0.63). (Beck and Steer, 1993). BDI-II outcome administered at the following study timepoints: Time 1 (Baseline for both arms), Time 2 (Post-Intervention for WtoH Intervention arm and Baseline 2 for Waitlist Control arm), and Time 3 Assessment (3 month follow up for WtoH Intervention arm and Post-Intervention for Waitlist Control arm</description>
