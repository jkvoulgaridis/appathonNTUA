      FEELBREATHE®, a nasal ventilatory restriction device, used during an exercise test in
      treadmill produces changes on breathing efficiency in patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 20 men with COPD with a forced expiratory volume in the first
      second between 30% and 70% of its predicted value were selected. Then, a maximal incremental
      cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed to determine ventilatory and cardiac parameters.
      During the second day, each participant conducted two tests with 30 min of rest between them.
      Exercise protocol was an identical walk on a treadmill for 10 minutes at a constant rate at
      50% of VO2peak. Each test was performed randomnly in two different conditions: 1) oronasal
      breathing (ONB); and 2) nasal breathing through the FB.

      Rationale: A device called FeelBreahte (FB)® has been designed, developed and patented for
      inspiratory muscle training in dynamic situations.

      Objetive: To examine the effects of FB on lung ventilation, gas exchange and heart rate
      during exercise in patients with COPD.

      Methods: 20 men with COPD with a forced expiratory volume in the first second between 30% and
      70% of its predicted value were selected. In the first visit to the laboratory, baseline
      static maximum inspiratory pressure and spirometry were performed previous to the exercise.
      Then, a maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed to determine
      ventilatory and cardiac parameters. During the second day, each participant conducted two
      tests with 30 min of rest between them. Exercise protocol was an identical walk on a
      treadmill for 10 minutes at a constant rate at 50% of VO2peak. Each test was performed
      randomnly in two different conditions: 1) oronasal breathing (ONB); and 2) nasal breathing
      through the FB.

      Results: Lung ventilation and gas exchange during exercise in COPD patients was modified
      during exercise using FB. Our results showed a positive effects of FB vs ONB on dynamic
      hyperinflation, an improved breathing pattern and breathing efficiency, higher expiratory and
      inspiratory time and higher perceived effort. Despite these differences, blood oxygen
      saturation percentage, oxygen uptake and heart rate showed similar response between both
      conditions.

      Conclusions: The new device FB used during exercise in COPD patients influenced ventilatory
      responses to an efficiency breathing compared to oronasal mode.

    <time_frame>Subjects were assessed during 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators measure minute ventilation, peak oxygen uptake (VO2p), peak carbon dioxide production (VCO2p), breathing frequency (BF), ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (CO2 Eq), ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (Eq O2), expiratory tidal volume (Vtexp), inspiratory tidal volume (Vtins), end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2), end-tidal oxygen tension (PETO2), inspiratory time (T.in), ratio of inspiratory duration to total breath duration (ti/t), expiratory time (Tex), oxygen saturation measure by pulse-oximetry SpO2), heart rate (HR), duration of the test and dyspnea and leg fatigue measures by Borg scale. Each subject performed two identical submaximal exercises at 50% of VO2peak under different breathing conditions: 1) nasal breathing with FB and 2) oronasal breathing without FB. Incremental exercise tests were performed on a treadmill ergometer using a one minute step protocol to a symptom-limited maximum.</description>

    <time_frame>Subjects were assessed during 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Before experimental trials each subject performed an incremental protocol on a treadmill ergometer (MONARK, Hamburg, Germany) for the determination of gas exchange. The test was stopped upon volitional fatigue of the subject. Gas-exchange data were measured breath by breath using an Oxycon cardiopulmonary exercise system (Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany).</description>

    <measure>Maximum static inspiratory pressure (PImax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were assessed during 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory muscle testing was performed using a mouth pressure meter (Micro Medical Inc., Chatham, Kent, UK). The manufacturer states that the test-retest reliability of this device is ±3%. PImax was measured at residual volume and the best result from three inspiratory attempts was taken. Al least one minute was allowed between attempts to minimize the effects of muscle fatigue.</description>

    <description>Device: Feel Breathe, restriction device ventilatory nasal The Feel Breathe (FB) consisted of a small adhesive strip that is place across the bridge of the nose during exercise. The FB was place following procedures for placement as indicated by the manufacture's directions, while the placebo nasal, was placed over the nostrils of the subject, without interfering nasal breathing; thus, nasal airflow resistance was not increase. 10 min at 50% of VO2 Peak achieve during a first incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test CPET using FeelBreathe device (FB)</description>
