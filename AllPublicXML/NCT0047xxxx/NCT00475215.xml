    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to research the safety and to show faster recovery after
      administration of 2.0 mg/kg or 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex (Org 25969, MK-8616) given as a reversal
      agent for 0.6 mg/kg (0.15 mg/kg maintenance dose) rocuronium (Zemuron®) in participants
      diagnosed with or having a history of pulmonary disease. All drug administration will be via
      the intravenous (IV) route.

    <measure>Time From Start of Sugammadex Administration to Recovery of T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 in Participants With or Having a Past History of Pulmonary Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The mean time from the start of sugammadex administration to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was determined. Less time indicates faster recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The ratio of T4 (fourth twitch; amplitude of fourth response to train of four [TOF] stimulation is expressed as percent of control T4) over T1 (first twitch; amplitude of first response to TOF stimulation is expressed as percent of control T1) ranges from 0 (complete loss of T4 twitch response) to 1.0 (complete recovery of T4 twitch response). For TOF stimulation, 4 consecutive square wave supra-maximal stimuli of 0.2 msec duration were delivered at 2 Hz every 15 seconds. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with the TOF-Watch® SX.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing ≥1 Adverse Event(s) (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing ≥1 AE(s) was determined for each arm. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Sugammadex Administration to Recovery of T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 in Participants With or Having a Past History of Pulmonary Disease</title>
        <description>The mean time from the start of sugammadex administration to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was determined. Less time indicates faster recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The ratio of T4 (fourth twitch; amplitude of fourth response to train of four [TOF] stimulation is expressed as percent of control T4) over T1 (first twitch; amplitude of first response to TOF stimulation is expressed as percent of control T1) ranges from 0 (complete loss of T4 twitch response) to 1.0 (complete recovery of T4 twitch response). For TOF stimulation, 4 consecutive square wave supra-maximal stimuli of 0.2 msec duration were delivered at 2 Hz every 15 seconds. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with the TOF-Watch® SX.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who received sugammadex and had ≥1 post-baseline assessment of the outcome measure. For 11 participants (2.0 mg/kg n=6 and 4.0 mg/kg n=5), data were missing due to watch malfunction (n=2), the data that was obtained was considered unreliable (n=6), or the watch was removed prior to recovery to 0.9 (n=3).</population>

          <title>Time From Start of Sugammadex Administration to Recovery of T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 in Participants With or Having a Past History of Pulmonary Disease</title>
          <description>The mean time from the start of sugammadex administration to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was determined. Less time indicates faster recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The ratio of T4 (fourth twitch; amplitude of fourth response to train of four [TOF] stimulation is expressed as percent of control T4) over T1 (first twitch; amplitude of first response to TOF stimulation is expressed as percent of control T1) ranges from 0 (complete loss of T4 twitch response) to 1.0 (complete recovery of T4 twitch response). For TOF stimulation, 4 consecutive square wave supra-maximal stimuli of 0.2 msec duration were delivered at 2 Hz every 15 seconds. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with the TOF-Watch® SX.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received sugammadex and had ≥1 post-baseline assessment of the outcome measure. For 11 participants (2.0 mg/kg n=6 and 4.0 mg/kg n=5), data were missing due to watch malfunction (n=2), the data that was obtained was considered unreliable (n=6), or the watch was removed prior to recovery to 0.9 (n=3).</population>
