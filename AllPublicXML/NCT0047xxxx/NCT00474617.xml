    <measure>Mean Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 minutes from start of sugammadex</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive train-of-four (TOF) electrical stimulations with the TOF-Watch® SX to the ulnar nerve of one forearm every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 are the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches respectively after TOF nerve stimulation, where stimulation was continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached 0.9. A higher T4/T1 ratio indicates a lower degree of neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery.</description>

    <description>Participants level of consciousness was assessed post-extubation and prior to transfer to recovery room.

    <time_frame>Prior to Transfer to the Recovery Room After Extubation (up to 24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing general muscle weakness was assessed by the investigator as a measure of recovery from neuromuscular blockade post-extubation and prior to transfer to recovery room. A standardized examination form was used to determine the presence or absence of muscle weakness in various muscle groups and the overall assessments were reported as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to general muscle weakness. Participants who were not cooperative with the examination were not included in the assessment.</description>

    <description>Participants were asked to lift their head off the table while in a supine position post-extubation and prior to transfer to recovery room.

        <title>Mean Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive train-of-four (TOF) electrical stimulations with the TOF-Watch® SX to the ulnar nerve of one forearm every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 are the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches respectively after TOF nerve stimulation, where stimulation was continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached 0.9. A higher T4/T1 ratio indicates a lower degree of neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery.</description>
