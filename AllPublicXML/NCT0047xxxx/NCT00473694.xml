  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to demonstrate a faster recovery from neuromuscular block (NMB)
      induced with rocuronium or vecuronium after reversal by 4.0 mg/kg of Org 25969 compared with
      reversal by 70 μg/kg of neostigmine in combination with 14 μg/kg glycopyrrolate.

    <measure>Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex or Neostigmine to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 After Neuromuscular Block (NMB) Induced by Rocuronium</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 hours after administration of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Mean time from start of sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was assessed by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9. The greater the T4/T1 ratio represented the greater the recovery from NMB; with a value of 0.0 representing no recovery and 1.0 representing full recovery. Reduced recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 indicated faster recovery from NMB. Mean time was collected in minutes and seconds but converted to and presented in minutes only. The analysis included a procedure for the imputation of missing recovery times.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Awake and Oriented After Anesthesia (Clinical Assessment of Level of Consciousness)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who were awake and oriented was assessed as part of an overall assessment of the clinical level of consciousness by the investigator. The clinical level of consciousness was used as a measure of recovery from NMB at 2 timepoints: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. Attempts were made to arouse participants every 15 minutes with mild prodding, mild shaking, and asking questions regarding name, location, and day of the week. The assessment ended once the participant was awake and fully orientated, 24 hours, or discharged from the hospital if discharge occurs before 24 hours; whichever occurred first. Participants were given a level of consciousness based on what type of stimulation they responded to. Participants who were not cooperative with the examination were not included in the assessment.</description>

The assessments were performed every 15 minutes until the absence of general muscle weakness. A standardized examination form was used to determine the presence or absence of muscle weakness in various muscle groups.

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex or Neostigmine to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 After Neuromuscular Block (NMB) Induced by Rocuronium</title>
        <description>Mean time from start of sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was assessed by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9. The greater the T4/T1 ratio represented the greater the recovery from NMB; with a value of 0.0 representing no recovery and 1.0 representing full recovery. Reduced recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 indicated faster recovery from NMB. Mean time was collected in minutes and seconds but converted to and presented in minutes only. The analysis included a procedure for the imputation of missing recovery times.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex or Neostigmine to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 After Neuromuscular Block (NMB) Induced by Vecuronium</title>
        <description>Mean time from start of sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was assessed by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9. The greater the T4/T1 ratio represented the greater the recovery from NMB; with a value of 0.0 representing no recovery and 1.0 representing full recovery. Reduced recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 indicated faster recovery from NMB. Mean time was collected in minutes and seconds but converted to and presented in minutes only.

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of Sugammadex or Neostigmine to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.8 After Neuromuscular Block (NMB) Induced by Vecuronium</title>
        <description>Mean time from start of sugammadex or neostigmine administration to recovery of T4/T1 ratio to 0.8 was assessed by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.8. The greater the T4/T1 ratio represented the greater the recovery from NMB; with a value of 0.0 representing no recovery and 1.0 representing full recovery. Reduced recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.8 indicated faster recovery from NMB. Mean time was collected in minutes and seconds but converted to and presented in minutes only.

        <title>Number of Participants Awake and Oriented After Anesthesia (Clinical Assessment of Level of Consciousness)</title>
        <description>The number of participants who were awake and oriented was assessed as part of an overall assessment of the clinical level of consciousness by the investigator. The clinical level of consciousness was used as a measure of recovery from NMB at 2 timepoints: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. Attempts were made to arouse participants every 15 minutes with mild prodding, mild shaking, and asking questions regarding name, location, and day of the week. The assessment ended once the participant was awake and fully orientated, 24 hours, or discharged from the hospital if discharge occurs before 24 hours; whichever occurred first. Participants were given a level of consciousness based on what type of stimulation they responded to. Participants who were not cooperative with the examination were not included in the assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responsive Only to Tactile Stimulation After Anesthesia (Clinical Assessment of Level of Consciousness)</title>
        <description>The number of participants responsive only to tactile stimulation was assessed as part of an overall assessment of the clinical level of consciousness by the investigator. The clinical level of consciousness was used as a measure of recovery from NMB at 2 timepoints: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. Attempts were made to arouse participants every 15 minutes with mild prodding, mild shaking, and asking questions regarding name, location, and day of the week. The assessment ended once the participant was awake and fully orientated, 24 hours, or discharged from the hospital if discharge occurs before 24 hours; whichever occurred first. Participants were given a level of consciousness based on what type of stimulation they responded to. Participants who were not cooperative with the examination were not included in the assessment.</description>

        <population>The analysis population was the Intent-to-Treat population that included all participants who received study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment and were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized (initial treatment assignment and not by the actual treatment received).</population>
