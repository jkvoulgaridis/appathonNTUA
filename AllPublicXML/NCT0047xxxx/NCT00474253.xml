  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to demonstrate a faster recovery from neuromuscular block induced
      by 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium after reversal at 3 minutes by 16.0 mg/kg of sugammadex compared with
      recovery after a neuromuscular block induced by 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine.

    <time_frame>Up to 15 minutes after administration of rocuronium + sugammadex or succinylcholine</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 refers to the amplitude (height) of the first twitch after TOF nerve stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Level of Consciousness: Number of Participants Awake and Oriented</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after administration of rocuronium + sugammadex or succinylcholine</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who were awake and oriented was assessed as part of an overall assessment of the clinical level of consciousness. The clinical level of consciousness was used as a measure of recovery from neuromuscular blockade at two time points: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. Attempts were made to arouse participants every 15 minutes with mild prodding, mild shaking, and asking questions regarding name, location, and day of the week. The assessment ended once the participant was awake and fully orientated.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after administration of rocuronium + sugammadex or succinylcholine</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants aroused with minimal stimulation was assessed as part of an overall assessment of level of consciousness. The level of consciousness was used as a measure of recovery from neuromuscular blockade at two time points: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. Attempts were made to arouse participants every 15 minutes with mild prodding, mild shaking, and asking questions regarding name, location, and day of the week.

    <measure>Level of Consciousness: Number of Participants Responsive Only to Tactile Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after administration of rocuronium + sugammadex or succinylcholine</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants responsive only to tactile stimulation was assessed as part of an overall assessment of the level of consciousness. The level of consciousness was used as a measure of recovery from neuromuscular blockade at two time points: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. Attempts were made to arouse participants every 15 minutes with mild prodding, mild shaking, and asking questions regarding name, location, and day of the week.

    <measure>Number of Participants Able to Perform 5-Second Head Lift</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after administration of rocuronium + sugammadex or succinylcholine</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who were able to lift their head for 5 seconds was assessed as a measure of recovery following neuromuscular blockade at two time points: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. The assessment was performed every 15 minutes until the first successful 5-second head lift was achieved.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing General Muscle Weakness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after administration of rocuronium + sugammadex or succinylcholine</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing general muscle weakness was assessed by the investigator as a measure of recovery from neuromuscular blockade at two time points: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. The assessments were performed every 15 minutes until the absence of general muscle weakness. A standardized examination form was used to determine the presence or absence of muscle weakness in various muscle groups.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Experiencing General Muscle Weakness</title>
        <description>The number of participants experiencing general muscle weakness was assessed by the investigator as a measure of recovery from neuromuscular blockade at two time points: prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and prior to discharge from the recovery room. The assessments were performed every 15 minutes until the absence of general muscle weakness. A standardized examination form was used to determine the presence or absence of muscle weakness in various muscle groups.</description>
