  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine 1) the role of hereditary factors in cystic fibrosis; i.e., the
      relationship of the disease to specific gene variations, and 2) the role of bacterial
      products involved in lung infections substances produced by bacteria may worsen the disease.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis who are being followed by the Medical College of Wisconsin or
      the University of Wisconsin-Madison are eligible for this study. Participants will have blood
      tests, pulmonary function tests, a sputum culture, and buccal swabbing (cotton swabbing of
      the inside of the cheek to collect cells for DNA study). In addition, their medical records
      will be reviewed for a history of lung infections and the results of various tests, including
      pulmonary function studies, chest X-rays and bacterial cultures. Blood samples collected
      previously at the Medical College of Wisconsin or the University of Wisconsin-Madison will
      also be analyzed for antibodies to bacteria.

      Although this is a one-time study, participants may be asked to return for repeated tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are susceptible to chronic bacterial colonization by
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which results in deterioration of lung function and, eventually,
      death. In this study, we hope to improve our understanding of the innate immune response to
      infection by strains of P. aeruginosa that express type III cytotoxins and to delineate
      better the role of modifier genes in disease progression.

      We will examine relationships between the patient's clinical course, the presence of
      antibodies to P. aeruginosa, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in suspected CF modifier
      genes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with cystic fibrosis who have a defined mutation in CFTR (e.g., any of the known
        variants of the CFTR gene, such as the delta F508 allele) born in the state of Wisconsin
        since 1985 or otherwise followed by the cystic fibrosis centers at the Medical College of
        Wisconsin or University of Wisconsin-Madison.

        Patients will have been tested or will be tested for the CFTR gene under another protocol
        (96-H-0100).

        Patients may be colonized with P. aeruginosa or other organisms (e.g., Burkholderia
        cepacia).

        The age range of NIH participants in this study is from 9 to 80 years old.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
