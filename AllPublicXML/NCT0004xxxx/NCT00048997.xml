      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet
      known if giving radiation therapy to the head is effective in preventing CNS metastases in
      patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well radiation therapy to the head
      works in preventing CNS metastases in patients who have been previously treated for stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether prophylactic cranial irradiation improves survival after effective
           locoregional/systemic therapy in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Determine the neuropsychologic impact of this therapy in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life of patients receiving this therapy.

        -  Determine the impact of this therapy on the incidence of CNS metastases in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB), histology (non-squamous cell vs squamous cell), and prior
      surgery (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation.

      Patients are followed 3 months during the first year, every 6 months for 2-3 years and then
      annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 6, 12, 24, 36, and
      48.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,058 patients (529 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 36 months.

    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurred after all patients had been on study for at least 12 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 96 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. This analysis was planned to occur when all patients had been potentially followed for at least 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Deterioration in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) Recall Score at One Year</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one year post study entry</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. It incorporates 6 different forms to mitigate practice effects of repeated administrations. Each form includes 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from 3 semantic categories, which differ across the 6 forms. The recall part of the test involves memorizing a list of 12 targets for 3 consecutive trials for immediate recall. The raw score is derived by summing the number of targets correctly recalled and ranges from 0 to 36 with a higher score indicating better functioning. A patient was classified with deterioration if there was a statistically significant decrease in score from baseline to one year as determined by the method of reliable change index.</description>

    <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. It incorporates 6 different forms to mitigate practice effects of repeated administrations. Each form includes 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from 3 semantic categories, which differ across the 6 forms. The delayed recall part of the test involves memorizing a list of 12 targets and recalling them after a 20-minute delay. The raw score is derived by summing the number of targets correctly recalled and ranges from 0 to 12 with a higher score indicating better functioning. A patient was classified with deterioration if there was a statistically significant decrease in score from baseline to one year as determined by the method of reliable change index.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and one year from randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ is an integrated system for assessing the health-related quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. The QLQ Core-30 (QLQ-C30 ) is a 30-item self-report questionnaire that has patients rate the items on a 4-point scale, with 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;very much&quot; and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures, including 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), a global health status, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The raw score is calculated as the mean of component items. This score is then standardized such that all of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0-100. A high score for the global health status represents a high QOL. An increase from baseline to one year by &gt;= 10 points was considered deterioration.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and one year from randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-B20 is a 20-item self-report that assesses 11 symptom scales/items such as future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit. Items are presented as questions on a scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; It is meant for use among brain cancer patients varying in disease stage and treatment modality (i.e. surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.) and should always be complemented by the QLQ-C30. The raw score is calculated as the mean of component items. This score is then standardized such that all of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems. An increase from baseline to one year by &gt;= 10 points was considered deterioration.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Deterioration in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) Recall Score at One Year</title>
        <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. It incorporates 6 different forms to mitigate practice effects of repeated administrations. Each form includes 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from 3 semantic categories, which differ across the 6 forms. The recall part of the test involves memorizing a list of 12 targets for 3 consecutive trials for immediate recall. The raw score is derived by summing the number of targets correctly recalled and ranges from 0 to 36 with a higher score indicating better functioning. A patient was classified with deterioration if there was a statistically significant decrease in score from baseline to one year as determined by the method of reliable change index.</description>

Each form includes 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from 3 semantic categories, which differ across the 6 forms. The delayed recall part of the test involves memorizing a list of 12 targets and recalling them after a 20-minute delay. The raw score is derived by summing the number of targets correctly recalled and ranges from 0 to 12 with a higher score indicating better functioning. A patient was classified with deterioration if there was a statistically significant decrease in score from baseline to one year as determined by the method of reliable change index.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Deterioration in Global Health Status From the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at One Year</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ is an integrated system for assessing the health-related quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. The QLQ Core-30 (QLQ-C30 ) is a 30-item self-report questionnaire that has patients rate the items on a 4-point scale, with 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;very much&quot; and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures, including 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), a global health status, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The raw score is calculated as the mean of component items. This score is then standardized such that all of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0-100. A high score for the global health status represents a high QOL. An increase from baseline to one year by &gt;= 10 points was considered deterioration.</description>
