  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of antiretroviral (ARV)
      and tuberculosis (TB) medications in pregnant women and their infants. (Pharmacokinetics are
      the various interactions between a drug and the body.) This study will also evaluate the PKs
      of certain ARVs in postpartum women before and after starting hormonal contraceptives. The
      PKs of these drugs will be evaluated by measuring the amount of medicine present in blood
      and/or vaginal secretions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women experience unique physiological changes that may result in clinically
      significant alterations in drug PKs. Unfortunately, there have been few clinical trials to
      study the PKs of ARV, TB, and hormonal contraceptive drugs in pregnant women. The development
      of appropriate dosing regimens for the HIV-infected pregnant woman is critical to the health
      of both mother and fetus. Overdosing may lead to maternal adverse events and increased risk
      of fetal toxicity, while underdosing may lead to inadequate virologic control, increased risk
      of developing drug resistance mutations, and a higher rate of perinatal HIV transmission.
      This study will evaluate the PKs of ARVs used during pregnancy; evaluate TB drugs used during
      pregnancy, both in women who are HIV-positive and also taking ARVs and in women who are
      HIV-negative and not taking ARVs; and evaluate the PKs of hormonal contraceptive medications
      taken along with ARVs.

      There will be five main groups of study arms: HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs without
      TB treatment, HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs with first-line TB treatment,
      HIV-uninfected pregnant women taking no ARVs with first-line TB treatment, HIV-infected and
      HIV-uninfected pregnant women with or without ARVs with second-line TB treatment for
      drug-resistant TB, and HIV-infected postpartum women taking ARVs and hormonal contraceptives.
      Participants will not receive medications through this studyâ€”they will continue on ARV, TB,
      and/or contraceptive medications prescribed by their health care providers.

      Women who are 20 0/7 weeks to 37 6/7 weeks pregnant will be enrolled in this study and will
      remain in the study for up to 12 weeks after delivery. Postpartum women will be enrolled at 2
      to 12 weeks after delivery and followed until 6 to 7 weeks after starting contraceptives.
      Infants will be followed for 16 to 24 weeks of life. At all study visits, participants will
      undergo a medical history, a physical exam, and blood collection. At some visits, women in
      some arms will undergo a vaginal swab. Blood collection from the mother and the detached
      umbilical cord will occur during delivery. Intensive PK sampling will be performed at study
      visits during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and/or postpartum, depending on the
      study arm. Additional study visits may occur depending on the ARV drug regimen prescribed.

        Maternal Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must belong to one of the following 5 groups:

               1. HIV-infected pregnant women greater than or equal to 20 weeks gestation NOT on TB
                  treatment receiving one or more of the ARV drugs/drug combinations specified in
                  the protocol

               2. HIV-infected pregnant women greater than or equal to 20 weeks gestation receiving
                  one of the ARV drugs/drug combinations specified in the protocol and TB treatment
                  with at least one of the TB drugs, specified in the protocol, at study entry

               3. HIV-uninfected pregnant women greater than or equal to 20 weeks gestation
                  receiving at least two of the first-line TB drugs, specified in the protocol, at
                  study entry

               4. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women greater than or equal to 20 weeks
                  gestation receiving at least two of the second-line TB drugs, specified in the
                  protocol, at study entry

               5. HIV-infected women 2 to 12 weeks (14 to 84 days) post-delivery receiving one of
                  the ARV drug combinations listed in the protocol AND starting postpartum
                  contraceptives as listed in the protocol

          -  The woman must be stable on the ARV drug/drug combination and/or TB drug combination
             for at least 2 weeks prior to PK sampling

          -  If a woman is receiving a specific generic ARV formulation, the protocol team has
             approved this formulation

          -  HIV-infected pregnant women must be planning to continue on current ARV regimen until
             postpartum PK sampling is completed. HIV-infected postpartum women on hormonal
             contraceptives must be planning to continue on ARV and contraceptive regimens until
             final PK sampling is completed.

          -  For HIV-infected women: confirmed HIV infection, documented by positive results from
             two samples collected at different time points prior to study entry. More information
             on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  HIV-uninfected pregnant women must have documented negative HIV antibody test during
             current pregnancy. Note: adequate source documentation, including the date of specimen
             collection, date of testing, test performed, and test result, must be available.

          -  Participants enrolling in the 3rd trimester must enroll by 37 6/7 weeks gestation

          -  Participant can provide legal informed consent per local regulations

          -  If a woman has completed this study and becomes pregnant again, she may re-enroll in

             initial enrollment

        Maternal Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women on medicines known to interfere with absorption, metabolism, or clearance of the
             drug being evaluated (see protocol for more information). Rifampicin is permitted for

          -  If pregnant, carrying multiple fetuses

          -  Clinical or laboratory toxicity that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would
             be likely to require a change in the medicine regimen during the period of study

        Infant Enrollment Criteria:

          -  All infants of mothers enrolled during pregnancy (meeting criteria specified above)
             are enrolled, in utero, immediately after maternal enrollment.

        Infant Requirements for Washout Pharmacokinetic Sampling:

          -  Born to HIV-infected mother enrolled during pregnancy in an ARV arm (does not include

          -  Born after singleton delivery (not after multiple birth)
