      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S):

      To evaluate the efficacy of the BBT-I in treating insomnia among breast cancer patients
      receiving chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the BBT-I in treating cancer-related symptoms such as
           cancer-related fatigue and cognitive difficulties in breast cancer patients receiving
           chemotherapy.

        -  To examine potential moderators and mediators of BBT-I intervention effects on insomnia,
           cognitive difficulties, and fatigue. In particular, we are interested in age, depression
           and anxiety and side effects (hot flashes) as potential moderators of the intervention
           effects as well as evaluating modifiable behavioral and physiological mechanisms as
           hypothesized mediators

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of the BBT-I intervention on insomnia will be measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). ISI survey questionnaire is a 7-question survey, with each question having 5 possible answers (none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe), scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. The full range of ISI scores is from 0 to 28. Lower scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly higher scores are considered to indicate greater insomnia. Clinical interpretation is as follows:
0 to 7 No clinically significant insomnia 8 to14 Subthreshold insomnia 15 to 21 Clinical insomnia (moderate severity) 22 to 28 Clinical insomnia (severe) ISI survey will be conducted at baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months. The outcome is reported as the mean ISI score with standard deviation for each time points of Baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) survey questionnaire is a 9-question survey, with each question having 11 possible answers (&quot;No fatigue&quot; to &quot;As bad as you can imagine&quot;), scored from 0 to 10, with each patient's overall BFI score being the mean of the values from each question (overall range 0 to 10). Lower scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly higher scores are considered to indicate greater fatigue.
The BFI survey was conducted at baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months. The outcome is reported as the mean of the overall BFI scores with standard deviation for each time points of Baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Difficulties using Clinical Assessment of Depression (CAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive Difficulties will be assessed using a cognitive battery of self-rating questionnaires including the Clinical Assessment of Depression (CAD). It has a 50 questions, assessed on 1 to 4 Likert Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Difficulties using Mobile Cognitive Assessment Battery (MCAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive Difficulties will be assessed using a Self-Rating subtest of the Mobile Cognitive Assessment Battery (MCAB). The MCAB is comprised of three neuropsychological tests (in addition to a self-report measure) measuring cognitive flexibility, accuracy, processing speed, working memory and multitasking and is delivered through the MCAB iPad application.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological assessments using Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT) measures simple attention and executive function, it consists of five dot to dots that increase with complexity and difficulty. Higher values indicate better outcomes for all scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological assessments using Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R) is a list memory exercise that measures verbal learning and memory, as well as delayed recall. Higher T scores indicating better memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological assessments using Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, post intervention, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) is a verbal fluency task that assesses complex cognition. Outcome is the count of words that meet criteria within 1 minute, so the minimum is 0 and no fixed maximum exists. Higher scores reflect a better outcome.</description>

          -  Have a history of substance abuse or meet criteria for current alcohol abuse or
             dependence
