  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase II trial
      aiming to demonstrate an improvement of median PFS when treating locally advanced
      unresectable or metastatic patients suffering from an intra-hepatic or hilum (mass-forming)
      cholangiocarcinoma with Regorafenib as compared to placebo, and after progression after
      GEM-CDDP (or GEM-OX), or gemcitabine alone followed or preceded by platinum (CDDP or
      oxaliplatin)-based chemotherapy.

      The principal objective is to investigate Regorafenib efficacy by prospectively evaluating
      the PFS after the administration of Regorafenib combined with BSC as compared to placebo with
      BSC. Hypothesis is a 50% improvement in median PFS (from 6 weeks to 12 weeks in Regorafenib
      group).
