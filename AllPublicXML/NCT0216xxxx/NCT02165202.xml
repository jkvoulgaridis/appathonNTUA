    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, double-blinded, two-arm, two:one randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      comparing the safety of TMC278 LA for 48 weeks after the initial 1M injection to a saline
      (0.9%NaCI) placebo IM injection among sexually active, HIV-uninfected women who are assessed
      by the clinic staff as being at &quot;low risk&quot; for HIV acquisition (in keeping with a safety
      trial). Approximately 132 women will be randomized to TMC278 LA and placebo in approximately
      a two:one ratio (88 and 44 in the TMC278 LA and placebo arm, respectively).

      Approximately 96 women will be enrolled in SSA and approximately 36 women will be enrolled in
      the US. In order to screen for initial safety and tolerability of the active product, a
      run-in period with oral rilpivirine will precede the injection of TMC278 LA. Participants
      randomized to the placebo arm will receive oral placebo capsules prior to injection of saline
      solution (0.9%NaCI). Participants will be observed while taking the study product by site
      staff on approximately six occasions during the first two weeks of the oral run-in at Week 0
      (Enrollment), at Week 2 (Oral Run-in Safety Visit), and on four separate DOT visits between
      Weeks 0 and 2. Cervicovaginal and rectal fluid will be collected for PK studies at a single
      follow-up visit. A subset of approximately 24 women at US sites will have vaginal tissue
      collection for PK studies at a single follow-up visit (Tissue Subset).

      Participants who present with Grade 2 or greater RELATED AEs during the oral-run in phase
      will not receive the injectable TMC278 LA. Participants who present with Grade 3 or 4
      UNRELATED AEs will not proceed to the injectable phase unless approved by the Clinical
      Management Committee (CMC).

      Arm 1: Participants randomized to the active arm will receive rilpivirine 25 mg capsules once
      daily for four weeks to be taken orally with a meal. Participants will then receive IM
      injections of TMC278 LA, 1200 mg dose, at eight week intervals (at Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28, 36
      and 44). On each dosing occasion 1200 mg of TMC278 LA will be delivered in two, 2 mL
      injections, one in each gluteus maximus muscle. All participants will receive a total of six
      doses (12 IM injections).

      Arm 2: Participants randomized to the placebo arm will receive placebo capsules once daily
      for four weeks to be taken orally with a meal. Participants will then receive IM injections
      of saline (0.9% NaCI) at eight week intervals (at Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 44). On each
      dosing occasion placebo will be delivered in two, 2 mL injections, one in each gluteus
      maximus muscle. All participants will receive a total of six doses (12 IM injections).

    <description>Rilpivirine (TMC278), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) is a substituted diaryl-pyrimidine (DAPY) derivative with potent antiviral activity against HIV. It is approved by the US FDA for once daily oral administration and is effective as part of treatment for ARV-na'ive HIV-infected patients as rilpivirine 25 mg capsules. It is also co-formulated with TDF and FTC for use as a once- daily single fixed-dose combination (Complera™).</description>

        3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria for the Tissue Subset (US sites only) A subset of approximately 24
        participants at US sites will participate in more intensive sampling of vaginal tissue
        during Week 36 (preferred) or Week 44.

        For these participants, the following additional criteria need to be met:

        •Satisfactory Pap results in the 12 calendar months prior to biopsy consistent with Grade 0
        according to the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to
        the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004

        Grade 1 or higher Pap result per American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology
        (ASCCP) guidelines in the 12 calendar months prior to biopsy is required, as indicated.

        If there is no documentation of satisfactory Pap results, and if indicated, the participant
        should be offered to have the test performed by the site prior to enrollment in the Tissue
        Subset. If Pap testing is indicated and participants decline, they are not eligible for the
        Tissue Subset.

          -  In addition to documentation of satisfactory Pap results, women must have normal

             insertion of anything in the vagina (drug, douche, penis, or sex toy) for 3 days prior
             to vaginal biopsy and for 7 days post-biopsy, to minimize risk of HIV-1 infection and
             bleeding complications after the procedure.

          -  Participants must not be pregnant at the time of vaginal sampling, based on pregnancy
             test results from previous visits and on the result of urine pregnancy test performed
             on the same day before the proposed vaginal sampling.

          -  Women undergoing biopsy must have received all prior injections of study product, in
             accordance with the protocol, to be eligible for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria: Women who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the

             study objectives (e.g., at increased risk of cardiovascular vents)

        the site loR.

            <description>Arm 1: Participants randomized to the active arm will receive rilpivirine 25 mg capsules once daily for four weeks to be taken orally with a meal. Participants will then receive IM injections of TMC278 LA, 1200 mg dose, at eight week intervals (at Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 44). On each dosing occasion 1200 mg of TMC278 LA will be delivered in two, 2 mL injections, one in each gluteus maximus muscle. All participants will receive a total of six doses (12 IM injections).
Rilpivirine: Rilpivirine (TMC278), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) is a substituted diaryl-pyrimidine (DAPY) derivative with potent antiviral activity against HIV. It is approved by the US FDA for once daily oral administration and is effective as part of treatment for ARV-na'ive HIV-infected patients as rilpivirine 25 mg capsules. It is also co-formulated with TDF and FTC for use as a once- daily single fixed-dose combination (Complera™).</description>

            <description>Arm 2: Participants randomized to the placebo arm will receive placebo capsules once daily for four weeks to be taken orally with a meal. Participants will then receive IM injections of saline (0.9% NaCI) at eight week intervals (at Weeks 4, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 44). On each dosing occasion placebo will be delivered in two, 2 mL injections, one in each gluteus maximus muscle. All participants will receive a total of six doses (12 IM injections).
Placebo: Participants randomized to the placebo arm will receive oral placebo capsules prior to injection of saline solution (0.9%NaCI). Participants will be observed while taking the study product by site staff on approximately six occasions during the first two weeks of the oral run-in at Week 0 (Enrollment), at Week 2 (Oral Run-in Safety Visit), and on four separate DOT visits between Weeks 0 and 2. Cervicovaginal and rectal fluid will be collected for PK studies at a single follow-up visit.</description>
