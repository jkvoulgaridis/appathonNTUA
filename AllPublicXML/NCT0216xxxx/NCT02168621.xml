  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment directed towards the control of periodontal infections is to about 90% non-surgical
      procedures. There is evidence from a large number of randomized controlled studies that the
      efficacy in terms of clinical outcomes of a full-mouth ultrasonic debridement approach (FMUD)
      is comparable to that of traditional section-wise scaling and root planing (SRP). A
      hypothesis for the current effectiveness study is that comparable clinical effects will be
      obtained with the FMUD approach as with conventional section-wise SRP, but with significantly
      more favourable patient-centred and health-economic outcomes.

      This randomized study involves about 100 professionals (dental hygienists) and more than 850
      patients at 40 dental clinics in the Vastra Gotaland Region, Sweden. The project not only
      evaluate treatment effects in terms of pertinent clinical outcomes, it also has a strong
      focus on patient-centered measures - patient-reported experience measures (PREM) and
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) - as well as health-economics.

      All patients with chronic periodontitis (age 30 years and older) attending the selected
      Public Dental clinics in VG are eligible. The patients should have at least 8 teeth with
      pathological pockets (probing pocket depth ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing). Only patients
      providing signed informed consent are included.

      Reported data in the study by Wennström et al. (J Clin Periodontol 2005) were used for power
      calculation. Thus, a total sample of 834 patients will provide a power of 95% at a
      significance level of p&lt;0.05 to detect a difference of 5% in proportion of sites with &quot;pocket
      closure&quot; i.e. PPD ≤4 mm and BoP negative (primary efficacy variable) between treatment
      groups. For a power of 80% a total sample of 506 patients is required.

Before initiation of the subgingival debridement the patient must show sufficient self-performed infection control (full-mouth plaque score &lt;30%).

A follow-up visit after 2-4 weeks is scheduled for oral hygiene control and re-motivation/re-instruction if indicated. At 3 and 6 months re-evaluation is performed and re-instrumentation of all sites showing a remaining probing pocket depth of ≥5 mm carried out. Final evaluation at 18 months.</description>
