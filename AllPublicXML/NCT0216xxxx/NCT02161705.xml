      Primary Objective To determine if post-operative static pain scores differ between women
      undergoing bilateral mastectomy followed by bilateral immediate tissue expander
      reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline- (placebo)
      pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.

      Post-operative pain scores will be measured by a 0-10 Likert scale 6 hours after the end of
      surgery while the patient is still hospitalized (post-operative day 0). This will be
      patient-provided data. Unblinded data analysis will compare scores between treatment and
      control groups.

      Secondary Objectives To determine if post-operative moving pain scores, opioids use, nausea,
      and sleep interference differ between women undergoing bilateral mastectomy followed by
      bilateral immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine-
      (treatment) or saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.

      Pain score, opioids use, nausea, and sleep interference data will be collected via patient
      self-report. When possible (i.e., while hospitalized) objective data on opioids and other
      pain medication administered to the patient will be used.

      Tertiary Objectives To determine if long-term changes in Quality of Life scores [the RAND-36
      Health Survey, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick DASH) questionnaire, and
      Breast-Q scores] differ between women undergoing bilateral mastectomy followed by bilateral
      immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or
      saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.

      This data will be collected via validated questionnaires through patient interviews at
      3-months, 2-years, and 4-years (±14 days) after surgery.

      Once enrolled in the study, participants will be encouraged to remain in the study for the 4
      years following surgery in order to get final pain scores and quality-of-life/health outcome
      survey information. Participants who cannot be contacted after several phone attempts and the
      sending of 2 certified letters via US Postal Service for 3-month, 2-year, and/or 4-year
      outcome assessments will be considered lost to follow-up.

      This double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing patient-reported pain and
      pain medication/narcotic use between patients randomized to treatment (ropivacaine) or
      placebo (saline) delivered via paravertebral block to the mastectomy site. Candidates will
      have chosen to have a mastectomy on one side immediately followed with tissue expander
      placement breast reconstruction.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline-(placebo) paravertebral
      blocks in a double-blinded design. Patient-specific surgical details will be recorded
      intraoperatively. Following the surgery, post-operative pain, pain medication/opioid use, and
      the occurrence of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed on Days
      1, 2, and 3. A clinic visit occurs on Day 7 when additional data are collected (updated
      medical history, pain medication/opioid use, AEs/SAEs, and study questionnaires. Using two
      pain scales, the Patient Pain Assessment Questionnaire (Appendix A) and Subjective Pain
      Survey (Appendix B), the post-operative pain will be compared between treatment and control
      groups. Differences in opioids use between groups at different time points will also be
      assessed as a more objective measure of post-operative pain.

      Long-term quality-of-life/health outcomes assessments will be done on post-operative Day 90
      (±14 days), Year 2 (±14 days), and Year 4 (±14 days). The Year 2 and Year 4 follow-ups are
      included as tertiary endpoints to capture differences in chronic pain, and patients will be
      asked to complete the same questionnaires as at the Day 90 follow up.

      The investigators hypothesize that post-operative static pain scores will be lower in
      ropivacaine patients vs. placebo patients in women undergoing mastectomy and immediate
      reconstruction with placement of tissue expanders. We believe that post-operative moving pain
      scores, opioids use, nausea, and sleep interference will be likewise improved. We further
      hypothesize that this decreased post-operative pain may lead to improvements in long-term
      health outcomes as measured by validated questionnaires. In the presence of clear need and
      lack of published studies regarding this precise patient population, it is important to
      determine if paravertebral blocks do reduce post-operative pain, and improve opioids use,
      nausea, sleep interference, and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing immediate
      tissue expander breast reconstruction.

    <description>To determine if post-operative static pain scores differ between women undergoing bilateral mastectomy followed by bilateral immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.
Post-operative pain, pain medication/narcotic use, and assessment for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed the Day of surgery through post-operative Day 7. A clinic visit occurs on Day 7 where additional data collected (updated medical history, pain medication/narcotic use, AEs/SAEs, and study questionnaires).
Static pain refers to pain when the patient is at rest. Patients report pain on a scale of 0-10 were in 0 represents no pain and 10 the most severe pain they have experienced.</description>

    <time_frame>Postoperative Day-30, Day-90 , 2-years, and 4-years (±14 days) after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if long-term changes in Quality of Life scores [BREAST-Q scores] differ between women undergoing mastectomy followed by immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.
The BREAST-Q score questionnaire items in each scale are arranged in a clinically relevant hierarchy (e.g., Satisfaction with Breasts scale ranges from &quot;How satisfied are you with how you look in a mirror clothed?&quot; to &quot;How satisfied are you with how you look in the mirror unclothed?&quot;). Scores will range from 0-100. Lower scores indicate lower quality of life and vice versa.
This data will be collected via validated questionnaires through patient interviews at 1-month, 3-months, 2-years, and 4-years (±14 days) after surgery.
Once enrolled in the study, participants will be encouraged to remain in the study for the 4 years following surgery in order to get final pain scores and quality-of-life/heal</description>

          <description>The Subjective Pain Assessment tool is a likert scale model tool (e.g. 0-5, 0-10) which asks patients to score their perception of how painful a particular act is (e.g How painful is biting your tongue?) on a scale of 0-5, from a preset list of questions regarding pain. This is used to establish a baseline value for a patients pain threshold.</description>

        <description>To determine if post-operative static pain scores differ between women undergoing bilateral mastectomy followed by bilateral immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.
Post-operative pain, pain medication/narcotic use, and assessment for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed the Day of surgery through post-operative Day 7. A clinic visit occurs on Day 7 where additional data collected (updated medical history, pain medication/narcotic use, AEs/SAEs, and study questionnaires).
Static pain refers to pain when the patient is at rest. Patients report pain on a scale of 0-10 were in 0 represents no pain and 10 the most severe pain they have experienced.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Scores as Assessed by the BREAST-Q Score</title>
        <description>To determine if long-term changes in Quality of Life scores [BREAST-Q scores] differ between women undergoing mastectomy followed by immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.
The BREAST-Q score questionnaire items in each scale are arranged in a clinically relevant hierarchy (e.g., Satisfaction with Breasts scale ranges from &quot;How satisfied are you with how you look in a mirror clothed?&quot; to &quot;How satisfied are you with how you look in the mirror unclothed?&quot;). Scores will range from 0-100. Lower scores indicate lower quality of life and vice versa.
This data will be collected via validated questionnaires through patient interviews at 1-month, 3-months, 2-years, and 4-years (±14 days) after surgery.
Once enrolled in the study, participants will be encouraged to remain in the study for the 4 years following surgery in order to get final pain scores and quality-of-life/heal</description>

          <title>Quality of Life Scores as Assessed by the BREAST-Q Score</title>
          <description>To determine if long-term changes in Quality of Life scores [BREAST-Q scores] differ between women undergoing mastectomy followed by immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomized either to ropivacaine- (treatment) or saline- (placebo) pre-operatively placed paravertebral blocks.
The BREAST-Q score questionnaire items in each scale are arranged in a clinically relevant hierarchy (e.g., Satisfaction with Breasts scale ranges from &quot;How satisfied are you with how you look in a mirror clothed?&quot; to &quot;How satisfied are you with how you look in the mirror unclothed?&quot;). Scores will range from 0-100. Lower scores indicate lower quality of life and vice versa.
