  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity amputations are a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, loss of function
      and reduced quality of life. Self-management (defined as the process by which an individual
      adopts an active role in managing the symptoms, treatment, consequences, and lifestyle
      changes inherent in living with a chronic condition) is an important mechanism for improving
      health and reducing disability. This study will evaluate a 5-week group-based self-management
      intervention for Veterans with lower extremity limb loss (VETPALS) and determine its impact
      upon physical and psychosocial functioning, patient activation, self-efficacy, problem
      solving, quality of life and positive affect. This study represents one of the only
      prospective randomized controlled trials of a behavioral intervention for individuals with
      limb loss. It is expected that results will be used to inform the integration of
      self-management interventions into the VA Amputation System of Care. The specific primary
      hypotheses are:

        1. Individuals randomized to VETPALS will display greater improvements from baseline in
           physical functioning as measured by the MFA-SF than Veterans in the individual education
           support condition post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up.

        2. Individuals randomized to VETPALS will display greater improvements from baseline in
           psychosocial functioning as measured by the PHQ-9 than Veterans in the individual
           education support condition post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up.

      Self-management interventions have been successful in improving outcomes across a broad
      variety of chronic illnesses including arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. Initial
      evidence of the effectiveness of self-management following limb loss is promising, but
      limited. Only one published trial to date has examined self-management for amputees. The
      Promoting Amputee Life Skills (PALS) project, conducted by members of the current study team,
      designed and implemented an 8-week group-based intervention to improve self-management
      following limb loss. The current proposal builds upon previous research that has demonstrated
      the efficacy of the PALS self-management intervention, but addresses important next
      questions:

        1. Is the PALS self-management intervention appropriate for Veterans, specifically
           considering the very high prevalence of diabetes and vascular disease?

        2. Can it be housed and delivered within a health care system as opposed to existing
           community support groups?

        3. Will the intervention be more effective for individuals who are new amputees?

        4. Will a shorter format that also incorporates an option for video teleconferencing retain
           the efficacy of the original PALS intervention?

      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of
      VETPALS. Study staff will screen and enroll Veterans with recent lower extremity limb loss
      within the last 6 months. Each participant will complete a baseline interview and then is
      sequentially placed into a cohort of 6-10 participants; each cohort will be randomized to the
      VETPALS group based self-management program (intervention) or an individual education support
      program (control). Once participants complete the randomized arm and follow-up assessments,
      they are free to participate in the other group. This ensures participants are offered both
      programs and are not deprived of a potentially valuable healthcare service.
