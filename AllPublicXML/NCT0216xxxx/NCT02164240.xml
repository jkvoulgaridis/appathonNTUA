      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and tolerability of sunitinib
      alternating with regorafenib in participants with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor
      GIST, if the standard approved therapies (imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib) have failed to
      control the disease. Additionally, this study seeks to determine the highest dose that can be
      given safely for this combination of drugs.

      This is a non-randomized, open label, single-center, single-arm, phase Ib study to evaluate
      the safety and the preliminary efficacy of short cycles of sunitinib alternated with
      regorafenib in participants with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal
      tumor GISTs with prior failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). The study consists of two
      cohorts: a dose-escalation, dose-finding cohort, and dose-expansion cohort. Between 6 to 15
      patients are expected to be included in the escalation cohort. A total of 20 eligible and
      evaluable patients will be included in the expansion cohort to further assess toxicity and
      evaluate preliminary efficacy.

      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time you will be taking the study
      drug, sunitinib, for the first 3 days of the week, followed by the study drug, regorafenib,
      for the last 4 days of the week. The study drugs will be taken continuously for 4 weeks each
      cycle, unless the study team instructs you otherwise. Each participant will receive a study
      diary. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the study drugs.

    <description>The treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. Treatment consists of 3 days of once daily sunitinib alternating with 4 days of once daily regorafenib throughout each cycle. The starting dose level is sunitinib 37.5 mg/d and regorafenib 120 mg/d, and doses will be escalated in subsequent cohorts following a classical 3+3 design up to sunitinib 50 mg/d and regorafenib 160 mg/d or until maximum tolerable dosage and recommended phase II dose is determined. An alternative scheme of 4-week cycles of the same regimen but with 21 days of dosing followed by 7 days of rest will be studied in case of toxicities during d 22-28 of the starting 4-weeks continuous cycles. Tumor assessments performed at baseline and after every two dosing cycles to assess response. Toxicity monitored throughout the study.</description>
