    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, open-label study with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      drug withdrawal period in children with Alagille Syndrome (ALGS) designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of LUM001.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 6 parts: a 6-week open-label, dose escalation period, a 12-week
      open-label stable dosing period, a 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug
      withdrawal period, a 26-week long-term stable dosing period, and an a 52-week optional
      follow-up treatment period, and a long-term optional follow-up treatment period for eligible
      participants who choose to stay on treatment with LUM001.
