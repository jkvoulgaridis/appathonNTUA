    <description>Our primary outcome measure is patient empowerment based on changes in the Patient Activation Measure or PAM. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 13-item measure that assesses patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management. People who score high on the PAM normally understand the importance of taking an active role in managing their health and have the skills and confidence to do so.The scores for the 13-item measure range in value from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater activation.
LEVEL 1 (0-47): May not yet believe that the patient role is important LEVEL 2 (47.1 - 55.1): Lacks confidence and knowledge to take action LEVEL 3 (55.2 - 67.0): Beginning to take action LEVEL 4 (67.1 - 100): Adapting new behaviors, but may have difficulty maintaining over time</description>

    <measure>Change in HIV Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Our fifth secondary outcome measure is HIV adherence self-efficacy based on changes in the HIV Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale or ASES. The HIV Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) is a 15-item measure that assesses patient self-efficacy for adherence to HIV treatment plan including but not limited to taking HIV medications. People who score high on the ASES normally are very confident of sticking to their HIV treatment plan even when it is hard. The scores for the 15-item measure range in value from 0-150, with higher scores indicating greater adherence self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Our sixth secondary outcome measure is adherence to combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) based on changes on survey of recommended items for assessing self-reported antiretroviral adherence. Our survey included two recommended assessment items with the focus on one-item measure that assesses patient self-reported adherence to taking HIV medications. People who score high on the self-reported adherence cART normally are very confident of being more adherent to taking their HIV medications. The score for the one-item measure range in value from 0-100 percent, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to cART.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Evidence-based Preventative Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Our eighth secondary outcome measure is prevention-seeking behavior based on chart abstracted information based on our preventive care index. We created a preventive care index for each participant by assigning one point of each intervention they received post-randomization divided by the total number of interventions for which they were eligible. The index included eleven preventive care measures: Human Papillomavirus, Influenza, Tetanus, Hepatitis A, B, C testing, Hepatitis A &amp; B vaccinations, cervical cancer screening (PAP), mammography and any colon cancer screening. People who score high on the evidence-based preventative care normally are more able to prevent illnesses or diseases. The score for the measure range in value from 0-1, with higher scores indicating greater ability to stay healthy.</description>

People who score high on the SF-12 are normally in good mental and physical health. The scores for the 12-item measure includes two scales whose range in value from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>
