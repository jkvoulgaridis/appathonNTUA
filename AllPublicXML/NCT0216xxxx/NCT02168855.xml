      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of as-needed oral Nicotine Replacement
      Therapy (NRT) - 2 mg nicotine gum - for smoking cessation in non-daily, or intermittent,
      smokers, and to study the process of relapse in ITS, using Ecological Momentary Assessment
      (EMA).

      Our aim is to study the effect of as-needed oral Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - 2 mg
      nicotine gum - for smoking cessation in non-daily, or intermittent, smokers (ITS), and to
      study the process of relapse in ITS, using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). This is a
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral NRT for smoking cessation in ITS.
      600 ITS who are interested in quitting will be recruited through multiple channels. Enrollees
      will be randomized 1:1 to active 2 mg nicotine gum or an inert control gum. Participants will
      attend 6 sessions with brief behavioral support, with a planned quit day at week 2. Short and
      long term abstinence will be assessed and biochemically validated. EMA data collection
      includes two weeks of baseline data on ad lib smoking patterns and 6 weeks of post-quit data.
      This will capture data on craving, withdrawal, and relapse among ITS, and relate relapse
      contexts to baseline smoking patterns.

    <measure>Smoking Cessation, Continuous 6-month Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>up to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Long term abstinence assessed and biochemically validated. The results reported are the number of participants self-reporting continuous abstinence throughout the 6-month, post-quit follow-up period. To be considered abstinent, a participant must have self-reported having not smoked during this period, demonstrated carbon monoxide levels less than or equal to 3 at each study visit, and cotinine values assessed via urinalysis at levels less than or equal to 25 ng/ml.</description>

    <measure>Characteristics of Quit and Relapse Process - Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Six-week post-quit period</time_frame>
    <description>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods will be used to study the craving, withdrawal, and relapse processes among ITS and relate relapse contexts to baseline smoking patterns. This measure assessed the intensity of craving experienced by participants during their attempt to quit smoking, via self-report. To ensure the results were not influenced by the use of active nicotine replacement gum, only the participants receiving inactive gum (containing no nicotine) are included in this analysis.
The scale's range was 0-100, with higher values reflecting higher levels of self-reported craving (maximum score of 100), whereas a score of 0 indicates no craving. &quot;Background&quot; craving is defined as that experienced when a participant was not smoking or feeling a temptation to smoke. &quot;Temptations to smoke&quot; refers to situations where a participant was tempted to smoke and did, or tempted to and did not.</description>

    <measure>Characteristics of Quit and Relapse Process - Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Six-week post-quit period</time_frame>
    <description>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods will be used to study the craving, withdrawal, and relapse processes among ITS and relate relapse contexts to baseline smoking patterns. This measure assesses the intensity of negative affect participants experienced during their attempt to quit smoking. To ensure the results were not influenced by the use of active nicotine replacement gum, only the participants receiving inactive gum (containing no nicotine) are included in this analysis.
The scale's range was 0-100, with higher values reflecting higher levels of self-reported negative affect (maximum score of 100), whereas a score of 0 would indicate no negative affect. 50 indicates the population mean with a standard deviation of 10. &quot;Background&quot; reports are defined as those experienced when a participant was not smoking or feeling a temptation to smoke. &quot;Temptations to smoke&quot; refers to situations where a participant was tempted to smoke and did, or tempted to and did not.</description>

This measure reports the percentage of instances during which participants were not exposed to physical cues to smoke, such as cigarettes, ashtrays, or lighters), when experiencing temptations to smoke compared to experiencing no temptations to smoke. &quot;Background&quot; reports are defined as those experienced when a participant was not smoking or feeling a temptation to smoke. &quot;Temptations to smoke&quot; refers to situations where a participant was tempted to smoke and did, or tempted to and did not.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>While 505 participants were enrolled in and began the study, only 369 of these were ultimately randomized to the active nicotine gum or inactive (placebo) gum arms. Those who were not randomized due to either participant-initiated drop out (n=36), research-team-initiated withdrawal due to noncompliance (n=83), or loss to followup (n=17).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Cigarettes smoked per day on average, assessed over the last 28 days, including all days</title>
          <description>Collected via self-reported &quot;time-line follow-back&quot; calendar, in which participants reported on each day in the previous 28 days the number of cigarettes they smoked. The average is calculated as the number of cigarettes smoked per days, including each day of the previous 28 days in the denominator, regardless of whether the participant reported smoking on each of those days. In other words, if a participant reported smoking on only 4 of the past 28 days, the average would be calculated by adding the total number of cigarettes smoked on those 4 days and dividing that number by 28.</description>

          <description>Collected via self-reported &quot;time-line follow-back&quot; calendar, in which participants reported on each day in the previous 28 days the number of cigarettes they smoked. The average is then calculated, to arrive at this measure - the number of cigarettes smoked per day, at baseline, including in the denominator only the number of days the participant reported having smoked. In other words, if a participant reported smoking on only 4 of the past 28 days, the average would be calculated by adding the total number of cigarettes smoked on those 4 days, and dividing that number by 4.</description>

        <title>Characteristics of Quit and Relapse Process - Craving</title>
        <description>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods will be used to study the craving, withdrawal, and relapse processes among ITS and relate relapse contexts to baseline smoking patterns. This measure assessed the intensity of craving experienced by participants during their attempt to quit smoking, via self-report. To ensure the results were not influenced by the use of active nicotine replacement gum, only the participants receiving inactive gum (containing no nicotine) are included in this analysis.
The scale's range was 0-100, with higher values reflecting higher levels of self-reported craving (maximum score of 100), whereas a score of 0 indicates no craving. &quot;Background&quot; craving is defined as that experienced when a participant was not smoking or feeling a temptation to smoke. &quot;Temptations to smoke&quot; refers to situations where a participant was tempted to smoke and did, or tempted to and did not.</description>
