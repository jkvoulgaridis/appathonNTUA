    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the optimal way of
      administration of autologous mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells (MSC) compering intravenous
      injection and intrathecal injection vs. placebo, in active-progressive Multiple Sclerosis
      patients.

    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) induce immune-modulatory and neurotrophic effects and were shown
      to have an acceptable safety profile for clinical applications. We aimed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of MSC transplantation in active progressive MS and investigate possible
      neuroprotective effects.

      Methods: This single-center double-blind crossover trial enrolled 48 patients with
      progressive MS (expanded disability status scale (EDSS) range: 3.5-6.5, mean: 5.6+/-0.8).
      Patients were randomised into three groups and treated intrathecally (IT) or intravenously
      (IV) with autologous MSCs (1x106/Kg) or placebo. At 6-months, treatment groups were crossed
      over and patients re-treated with either MSC or placebo. During the 2-months run-in period
      and the 12-months after treatment, participants were followed using EDSS, 25-foot timed
      walking, 9-hole peg test, neurocognitive tests, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), functional MRI, optic coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and
      dynamic visual tests.
