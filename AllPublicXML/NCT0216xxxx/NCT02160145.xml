  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether tolvaptan is effective and safe for the
      treatment of late-stage chronic kidney disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol will extend the understanding of the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan treatment
      in ADPKD patients with late stage 2 to early stage 4 CKD (chronic kidney disease).

      This trial will compare the efficacy of tolvaptan treatment in reducing the annualized change
      in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment
      follow-up, as compared with placebo, in subjects who tolerate tolvaptan during an initial
      run-in period. The change in eGFR, calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology
      (CKD-EPI) formula, will provide kidney function data that are complementary to the data
      demonstrating the benefits previously observed primarily in ADPKD subjects with earlier
      stages of disease.

      Also, it will compare the efficacy of tolvaptan treatment in reducing the decline of
      annualized eGFR slope, as compared with placebo, in this type of subjects. Finally, it will
      compare the overall and hepatic safety profile of tolvaptan with placebo and to compare
      incidence of ADPKD complications (outcomes) during the trial

    <time_frame>Pretreatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up (up to 61 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The mean annualized change in eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) formula from pretreatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up, annualized (divided) by each subject's trial duration.
The baseline for the primary endpoint was defined as the average of up to 3 eGFR values observed during the screening and placebo run-in periods.</description>

    <measure>Mean Annualized Slope of eGFR Change</measure>

    <description>To compare the efficacy of tolvaptan treatment in reducing the decline of annualized eGFR slope, as compared with placebo, in subjects with late-stage CKD due to ADPKD who tolerated tolvaptan during an initial run-in period, the annualized rate of eGFR change was derived from each individual subject's eGFR slope using the CKD-EPI formula.
The annualized eGFR change slope was derived from all eGFR observations from placebo-run-in, tolvaptan run-in, double-blind treatment and post-treatment follow-up periods using the linear mixed model of analysis. The mean annualized slope of eGFR change is presented.</description>

      <recruitment_details>First subject first visit: 21 May 2014; Last subject last visit: 18 April 2017. Subjects were recruited from 213 sites in 21 countries. Of 2292 subjects screened, 1519 entered the 6-week run-in period; 23 were placebo run-in failures and 126 were tolvaptan titration/run-in failures.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects with Stage 2 - 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) were stratified by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (≤ 45 or &gt; 45 milliliters/minute/ 1.73 square metres [mL/min/1.73 m^2]), by age (≤ 55 or &gt; 55 years), and total kidney volume (≤ 2000 mL, &gt; 2000 mL, or unknown).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Following screening, the single-blind prerandomization period (Day -42 to Day -1) consisted of:
Placebo Run-in: All subjects received a daily split-dose of placebo (0/0 milligrams [mg]) in a form identical to 15/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose for 1 week.
Tolvaptan Titration: Over 2 weeks all subjects received a split-dose of 30/15 mg (2 x 15mg tablets upon waking, then 1 x 15 mg tablet 8-9 hours later) which was titrated up every 3-4 days to 45/15 mg, then 60/30 mg, and up to a maximum dose of 90/30 mg.
Tolvaptan Run-in: Eligible subjects who tolerated at least 60/30 mg tolvaptan during titration entered the 3-week run-in period and continued on a stable dose of 60/30 mg or 90/30 mg tolvaptan to confirm eligibility and establish prerandomization baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Annualized Slope of eGFR Change</title>
        <description>To compare the efficacy of tolvaptan treatment in reducing the decline of annualized eGFR slope, as compared with placebo, in subjects with late-stage CKD due to ADPKD who tolerated tolvaptan during an initial run-in period, the annualized rate of eGFR change was derived from each individual subject's eGFR slope using the CKD-EPI formula.
The annualized eGFR change slope was derived from all eGFR observations from placebo-run-in, tolvaptan run-in, double-blind treatment and post-treatment follow-up periods using the linear mixed model of analysis. The mean annualized slope of eGFR change is presented.</description>
