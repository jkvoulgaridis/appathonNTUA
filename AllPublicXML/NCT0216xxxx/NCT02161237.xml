    <textblock>
      Primary purpose of this study is to compare renal function between subjects receiving
      optimized dose Advagraf® over 52 weeks after kidney transplantation and subjects receiving
      standard dose Advagraf®. Pilot results of safety and efficacy in optimized dose Advagraf®
      over 52 weeks after kidney transplantation will also be obtained.
