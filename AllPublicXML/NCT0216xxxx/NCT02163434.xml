    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare the effectiveness of gabapentin to metoclopramide for 1 week
      among 60 women with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in this randomized, double-blinded trial.
      After completion of the 1-week double-blind phase, subjects will be offered open-label
      gabapentin with rescue metoclopramide until their symptoms no longer require treatment.
      Enrollment will occur at the University's at Buffalo, of Rochester and of Wisconsin.
