    <textblock>
      the gold standard for the diagnostic of acute heart failure is based on clinical, biological
      (BNP levels) and echocardiographic findings, but still in some cases, the diagnosis is
      difficult and requires further investigations.

      BNP dosages and echocardiography are not always available in many medical centers, especially
      in emergency departements, and are expensive.

      we investigated the use of alternative methods, such as the systolic time intervals (STI), in
      the diagnosis of acute heart failure (AHF) in emergency departement patients consulting for
      dyspnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AHF is a common cause for dyspnea, but still hard to diagnose. in emergency departements,
      physicians dispose of a variety of techniques helping them to identify patients with acute
      onset dyspnea due to cardiac causes and allowing them to initiate the appropriate
      therapeutics.

      techniques such as the N type brain natriuretic peptid (NT BNP) dosages and echocardiography,
      in addition to the clinical exam, are efficient in these cases but they encounter many
      problems:

        -  the BNP dosages are non-conclusive in some cases (grey zone) and must be repeated wich
           takes time.

        -  echocardiography is operator - dependent technique and could be misleading in some
           conditions.

        -  both BNP and echocardiography are expensive and not found in many emergency structures,
           especially in poor countries.

      all the arguments pushed us to investigate other simpler and cheaper techniques to apply in
      these conditions.

      STI is an old technique based on the recording of two parameters: electrocardiogram and
      phonocardiogram, and from them measuring the different systolic intervals:

        -  pre-ejection period (PEP): defined as the interval between the beginning of the QRS wave
           and the first heart sound (B1).

        -  electro-mechanic activation time (EMAT): defined as the interval between the two heart
           sounds B1 and B2

        -  the PEP / EMAT time in acute onset heart failure, the conduction times are increased,
           due to tissular lesions, which prolong the PEP, also the myocardial contractility is
           deficient and the heart puts less time to eject the blood volume which decrease the EMAT
           and in summary the PEP/EMAT is increased significatively.

      in this study protocol, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of STI compared to
      conventional methods in the diagnosis of acute heart failure in emergency department
      settings.

    <description>STIs were measured using simultaneous recording of the electrocardiogram and acoustic cardiography signals using an analogic numeric system (Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA). A3-minute acoustic cardiographic tracing for all patients was obtained and stored electronically. We measured the electromechanical activation time (EMAT) which is the time between the initial deflection of the electrocardiographic Q wave and the first phonocardiographic complex corresponding to the first heart sound (S1). The left ventricle ejection time (LVET) defined as the interval between the peak components from the S1 and S2 complexes was measured on the same cardiac cycles. All studies were performed in patients in a semi-recumbent position with head at 30 degrees position. For each patient, the acoustic cardiographic parameters were calculated from a 10-second free of artifact recording of data averaging 8 to 12 beats measurements.</description>
