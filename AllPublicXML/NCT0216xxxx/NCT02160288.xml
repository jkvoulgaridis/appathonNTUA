      The purpose of this study is to determine if Botulinum Toxin-A (Botox) injection will improve
      symptoms of constipation in obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constipation represents one of the five most common physician diagnoses for gut disorders.
      Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is an under-treated condition which accounts for 30%-
      50% of all patients with constipation and it is more common as people age. ODS is due to the
      abnormal contraction of the puborectalis muscle (a muscle around the anus that should relax
      during defecation).

      Biofeedback therapy and medical management are the standards of care for ODS. Typically
      patients are first managed with dietary modifications (fiber supplementation, increased
      fluids) and medication (laxatives, enemas). If constipation is not improved, they will
      undergo biofeedback, which lasts from 3-8 sessions on average. Biofeedback acts on the cause
      of ODS and it has good short-term success, but around 50%-70% of treated patients
      re-experience constipation after one year. The main drawbacks of biofeedback for ODS are the
      facts that it is expensive, time-consuming, available in few select-centers and its success
      depends very much on the provider. Biofeedback is delivered in multiple 1-hour clinic
      sessions, so many patients don't finish all recommended sessions and their constipation may
      recur faster.

      Botox also acts on the cause of ODS and was shown to improve constipation within 1-3 weeks
      after the injection. Botox is delivered as a one-time injection in the puborectalis muscle
      and external anal sphincter (the muscle right around the anus). The injection can be
      performed in the clinic under local anesthesia, and the patient goes home afterwards.
      Currently, Botox is used for treatment of patients who fail biofeedback and medical
      management, to avoid the options of last resort (resection of the colon with stoma). To this
      day, no adequately designed study has confirmed that Botox is indeed superior to placebo
      (normal saline) for the treatment of ODS. The results from this study will provide valuable
      data on the ability of Botox to improve symptoms of constipation and the duration of its
      effect. This project has the potential to increase the availability of effective treatments
      for ODS.

    <measure>Changes in the Altomare Obstructed Defecation Syndrome- Score (ODS-S) and Patient Assessment of Constipation- Quality of Life Score (PAC-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline in the sum of ODS-S and PAC-QoL at 1 month after the Botox injection.
This measures the symptomatic improvement in ODS. ODS (altomare obstructed defecation syndrome score) scores range from 0 (minimum) to 31 (maximum) where 31 is the most severe (worse outcome) and 0 is no symptoms (better outcome).
The scale for PAC-QoL (Patient Assessment of Constipation- Quality of life score) is a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 112 where 0 is highest quality of life (better outcome) and 112 is lowest quality of life (worse outcome)
Larger number for change would suggest a better outcome</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after injection and value compared from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale title is obstructed defecation score, the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 31 for the ODS score. This measures the symptomatic improvement in ODS. ODS scores range from 0-31 where 31 is the most severe and 0 is no symptoms. A higher score would suggest a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after injection and value compared from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PAC-QoL is Patient Assessment of Constipation- Quality of Life Score. The scale for PAC-QoL is 0 minimum score to 112 maximum score where 0 is highest quality of life (better outcome) and 112 is lowest quality of life (worse outcome). Since we are looking for a change in score, the minimum change would be 0 and the maximum change would be 112. A higher change would suggest a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Medical outcomes survey short form (SF-36 version 1) will be used to measure changes in the health-related quality of life.This is a measure of efficacy. The score ranges from 0-100 where 0 is maximum impact on health and 100 is no impact on health</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after injection and value compared from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of Botox-specific adverse events. The score is a total of answers of questions. The score range is 0-20 where 0 is perfect incontinence and 20 is complete incontinence.</description>

    <description>This is a measure of Botox-specific adverse events. This fecal incontinence quality of life scale (FIQoL) scale ranges from 4 as the minimum and 20 as maximum. lower score indicates lower quality of life (worse outcome) and higher score has better quality of life (better outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change in Anal Sphincter Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in anal sphincter function will be assessed by anorectal manometry. This test will measure the resting sphincter pressure, maximal resting anal pressure, maximum squeeze pressure. The change in anal sphincter function is a measure of treatment efficacy. The minimum score for resting sphincter pressure is 0 and the maximum is 200. The minimum squeeze pressure is 10 and the maximum is 200. The lower score is suggested of decreased tone and worse outcome, where high scores may suggest worse outcome in terms of sphincter function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Defecation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The defecation index=maximum rectal pressure during attempted defecation/minimum anal residual pressure during attempted defecation. This is calculated based on measurements obtained from anorectal manometry and is a measure of treatment efficacy. Scores can change from 0 (meaning no change- least effective) to 1 meaning that the change shows complete relaxation with defecation.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline in the sum of ODS-S and PAC-QoL at 1 month after the Botox injection.
This measures the symptomatic improvement in ODS. ODS (altomare obstructed defecation syndrome score) scores range from 0 (minimum) to 31 (maximum) where 31 is the most severe (worse outcome) and 0 is no symptoms (better outcome).
The scale for PAC-QoL (Patient Assessment of Constipation- Quality of life score) is a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 112 where 0 is highest quality of life (better outcome) and 112 is lowest quality of life (worse outcome)
Larger number for change would suggest a better outcome</description>

        <title>Change in Anal Sphincter Function</title>
        <description>The changes in anal sphincter function will be assessed by anorectal manometry. This test will measure the resting sphincter pressure, maximal resting anal pressure, maximum squeeze pressure. The change in anal sphincter function is a measure of treatment efficacy. The minimum score for resting sphincter pressure is 0 and the maximum is 200. The minimum squeeze pressure is 10 and the maximum is 200. The lower score is suggested of decreased tone and worse outcome, where high scores may suggest worse outcome in terms of sphincter function.</description>
