  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat adult patients who have relapsed or
      refractory B-ALL with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically
      modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that will bind to leukemia cells that
      express the CD19 protein on the cell surface. The study will determine if these modified T
      cells (called JCAR015) help the body's immune system eliminate leukemia cells. The trial will
      also study the safety of treatment with JCAR015, how long JCAR015 cells stay in the patient's
      body, the extent to which JCAR015 eliminates minimal residual disease, and the impact of this
      treatment on survival.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will have the
      following sequential phases: Part A (screening, leukapheresis, cell product preparation, and
      cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for
      each participant is approximately 12 months after the final JCAR015 infusion. The total
      duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years. Long-term follow-up for
      survival, toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term
      follow-up protocol per health regulatory authority guidelines, currently up to 15 years after
      the last JCAR015 infusion.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 82 participants were enrolled at 15 study centers within the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were adults with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>JCAR015</title>
          <description>Participants received up to two intravenous (IV) infusions of JCAR015 separated by 14 to 28 days. In Part A, participants received at the Investigator's discretion, cytoreductive chemotherapy based on the Investigator's choice and/or supportive care. In Part B, eligible participants received two IV doses of JCAR015 CAR T cells. JCAR015 infusion was preceded by lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide alone or cyclophosphamide + fludarabine.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission (CR) or Complete Remission With Incomplete Hematopoietic Recovery (CRi), as Determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)</title>
        <description>Overall remission rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with CR or CRi based on IRC assessment. For CR, all of the following must be met: (1) in bone marrow, trilineage hematopoiesis and &lt; 5% blasts; (2) in peripheral blood, neutrophils &gt; 1,000/µL, platelets &gt; 100,000/µL, and circulating blasts &lt; 1%; (3) no clinical evidence of extramedullary disease by physical examination and no symptoms suggestive of CNS involvement (if additional assessments such as CSF assessment by lumbar puncture or Ommaya reservoir tap, CNS imaging, or biopsy are performed, results must show no evidence of disease); (4) no platelet and/or neutrophil transfusions ≤ 7 days before the date of peripheral blood sampling, and (5) no clinical evidence of recurrence for 4 weeks. For CRi, all criteria for CR are met except that one or more of the following exists in the peripheral blood: neutrophils ≤ 1,000/µL, platelets ≤ 100,000/µL, or platelet transfusions ≤ 7 days before blood sampling.</description>

AUC calculation includes PK results up to the second JCAR015 infusion for subjects who received the second infusion prior to Day 29 after the first JCAR015 infusion.</description>
          <population>The analysis population includes all participants who received at least one infusion of JCAR015.</population>
