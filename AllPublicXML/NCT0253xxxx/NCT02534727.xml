      Background:

      Many people around the world get tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
      infections. Sometimes medicine that treats these infections does not get to where the
      bacteria are in the lungs. Researchers want to find a way to tell if enough medicine is
      getting to where it is needed in the lungs. They will look at how much medicine is in your
      sputum (what you cough up) compared to how much is in your blood. They will also investigate
      a new test to quickly figure out what medicines are likely to treat TB effectively.

      Objective:

      To determine the relationship between the concentration of TB drugs in plasma and sputum over
      time.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who have TB or NTM infection that is suspected to be drug resistant.
      They must be taking TB or NTM medicines.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history.

      Participants will be in the study for 2 8 days.

      Participants will give 3 or more sputum samples over at least 2 different days. They will
      cough sputum into a cup.

      Participants will have blood drawn 4 times a day on 2 different days.

      This study will support two avenues of research, pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs used to treat
      tuberculosis and resistance to those drugs that has been developed by the pathogen. Given the
      high inter-individual variability in TB drug exposure, therapeutic drug monitoring would be
      of value to adjust the drug dose in TB patients in order to improve clinical outcome and
      minimize toxicity. It is not practiced in most settings for reasons associated with costs but
      also because blood collection is an invasive procedure. Sputum on the other hand is often
      produced spontaneously and discarded as waste. Drug levels can be measured in sputum just as
      in plasma. Here we will test the hypothesis that sputum drug levels are predictive of drug
      concentrations in plasma and/or in specific lesion compartments such as the caseum of open
      cavities. We will also characterize the exposure of standard 1st and 2nd line TB drugs at one
      of the sites of infection, since sputum is in direct contact with cavity caseum. The subjects
      will contribute three or more sputum samples spontaneously produced over at least two days
      and four blood samples following drug administration on two different days (8 blood samples
      total). The data will be analyzed using population PK modeling approaches to generate
      concentration-time profiles and 24-hour area under the curve (AUC) of each study drug in
      sputum. Correlations between these values, plasma and lesion AUCs will be examined. We will
      draw from a recently completed TB lesion pharmacokinetic study (www.ClinicalTrials.gov
      #NCT00816426) to seek correlations between drug exposure in sputum and in pulmonary lesions.
      In addition to drug concentrations, sputum will be cultured by standard methods to isolate
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), determine the drug resistance profile, and be saved for
      testing a second generation of the Xpert TB XDR assay.

        This is a prospective trial of the pharmacokinetics of TB drugs in the sputum and blood of
        drug susceptible and drug resistant subjects at the Henan Provincial Chest Hospital in
        Zhengzhou, China and at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Patients (inpatients or
        outpatients) being treated for TB (including those with NTM at the NIH CC) were asked to
        join the study.@@@@@@@@@@@@
