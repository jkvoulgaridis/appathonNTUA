  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed prospective study will evaluate whether a novel exercise approach, seated
      vibration therapy, can improve function in the target population of older adults. Therefore,
      the primary aim of this pilot is to examine the effect of vibration therapy on muscle
      function (balance, muscle power and strength) and muscle mass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four study visits; screening/baseline followed by eight weeks of training three
      times a week, visit 1 at eight weeks followed by 4 weeks of washout, Visit 2 at 12 weeks
      followed by eight weeks of training three times a week, and a final Visit 3 at 20 weeks.

      At the screening visit, volunteers will be asked to perform tests included in the short
      physical performance battery (SPPB) (gait speed, chair rise, balance). If the participants
      score is ≤ 9 or ≤ 2 in any of the three tests included in the SPPB they will be eligible for
      the intervention phase. At the baseline visit several questionnaires will be obtained and
      participants then will proceed with muscle function tests (SPPB, jumping mechanography, grip
      strength, timed-up-and-go test).

      Participants will then be randomized into one of two groups. The first group will receive
      vibration + loading treatment for the first 8 weeks, the second group will receive sham
      treatment (loading only). After 8 weeks both groups will go through a 4 week wash-out period
      and then crossover will occur. The first group will now receive sham treatment (loading only)
      while the second group will receive vibration + loading treatment. The participants will
      train for 10 minutes, 3 times a week, during the active 16 total weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Corrected Jump Power Based on Participant's Jump on the Jump Force Plate</measure>
    <time_frame>This was collected 4 times: Baseline, after 8 week loading/loading+ vibration training, after 4 week washout, after 8 week crossover training.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this pilot is to examine the effect of vibration therapy on muscle function. Weight corrected jump power will be the main outcome variable. Countermovement jumps are performed on a Leonardo force plate (Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany) following standard procedures. Jumping mechanography uses maximal countermovement jumps to quantitatively measure muscle strength in the legs. Participants will be asked to perform three countermovement jumps. Participants are asked to try to jump as high as possible using both legs. Three jumps are performed; the jump with the highest jump height is used for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, after Intervention 1, after Washout, and after Intervention 2.</time_frame>
    <description>﻿Grip Strengthwas acquired using a JAMAR hand dynamometer in the routine clinical manner. Measurements were recorded using participants' non-dominant hand and repeated 3 times to determine maximum grip strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, after Intervention 1, after Washout, and after Intervention 2.</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed will be measured by instructing participants to walk four meters at their normal pace; they are timed with a stopwatch. This test will be repeated twice. The walk performed in the least time will be utilized for scoring purposes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sway</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, after Intervention 1, after Washout, and after Intervention 2.</time_frame>
    <description>Sway is assessed by having the participants stand with feet being placed side by side for ten seconds. Participants will be wearing MobilityLabTM (APDM, Portland, OR) sensors on their chest, lower back, wrists and feet during these tests to collect computerized sway data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, after Intervention 1, after Washout, and after Intervention 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The short physical performance battery (SPPB) consists of gait speed as determined by a four-meter walk, timed repeated chair rise and standing balance. Gait speed will be measured by instructing participants to walk four meters at their normal pace; timed with a stopwatch and is repeated twice. The walk performed in the least time will be utilized for SPPB scoring purposes. The timed repeated chair rise has participants stand up from a chair five times without the use of their arms, if possible. Time to complete five stands is measured. Standing balance is assessed by having the participants stand in three positions of increasing difficulty for 10 seconds each. Standardized instructions will be given to all participants and the test performed twice. The SPPB will be conducted and scored in standard manner, score 0-12, with lower scores indicating mobility limitations. Participants will be wearing MobilityLabTM sensors to collect computerized data for these tests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, after Intervention 1, after Washout, and after Intervention 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test will be performed twice; participants will be seated in an armless chair, upon instruction, they will be asked to stand, which starts the timing, they will walk 3 meters past a mark on the floor at their normal pace, turn around and return to a full seated position, at which time the test will end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy (BIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline, after Intervention 1, after Washout, and after Intervention 2.</time_frame>
    <description>An ImpediMed SFB7 device (Eight Mile Plains, Queensland, Australia) will be used to obtain these measurements. Participants will be positioned supine for a minimum of 10 minutes prior to acquisition; adequate separation of their legs will be obtained to allow for accurate BIS measurement. Measurements will be obtained by placing four EKG-like electrodes on the skin of the participant's hand, feet and knee. Wires will be attached from the BIS device to these skin electrodes. Painless electric waves will be sent through the tissues as noted above. Each measurement lasts only a few seconds. This method will generate measurements of lean mass.</description>

        <title>Weight Corrected Jump Power Based on Participant's Jump on the Jump Force Plate</title>
        <description>The primary aim of this pilot is to examine the effect of vibration therapy on muscle function. Weight corrected jump power will be the main outcome variable. Countermovement jumps are performed on a Leonardo force plate (Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany) following standard procedures. Jumping mechanography uses maximal countermovement jumps to quantitatively measure muscle strength in the legs. Participants will be asked to perform three countermovement jumps. Participants are asked to try to jump as high as possible using both legs. Three jumps are performed; the jump with the highest jump height is used for analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>This was collected 4 times: Baseline, after 8 week loading/loading+ vibration training, after 4 week washout, after 8 week crossover training.</time_frame>
        <population>In this frail population a number of individuals were unable to perform satisfactory jumps to collect valid data with the current software.</population>

            <description>In &quot;Loading + Vibration&quot; intervention phase, subjects will be seated in the VibeTech One Rehab Chair, which allows vibration exercise while seated. A force is applied on a footplate that simulates the weight of standing or partial bodyweight. The participants will train for 10 minutes 3 days per week. The vibratory acceleration will be 30Hz and the applied load will be 50% of body weight up to a device maximum applied load of 100 lbs. Vibration intensity will initially be set to 0.2 g and will increase by 0.2 g every other week, as tolerated by the subject, and max of 1.0 g.
There will be a four week washout period between the two interventions.</description>

        <title>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</title>
        <description>The short physical performance battery (SPPB) consists of gait speed as determined by a four-meter walk, timed repeated chair rise and standing balance. Gait speed will be measured by instructing participants to walk four meters at their normal pace; timed with a stopwatch and is repeated twice. The walk performed in the least time will be utilized for SPPB scoring purposes. The timed repeated chair rise has participants stand up from a chair five times without the use of their arms, if possible. Time to complete five stands is measured. Standing balance is assessed by having the participants stand in three positions of increasing difficulty for 10 seconds each. Standardized instructions will be given to all participants and the test performed twice. The SPPB will be conducted and scored in standard manner, score 0-12, with lower scores indicating mobility limitations. Participants will be wearing MobilityLabTM sensors to collect computerized data for these tests.</description>

            <description>In &quot;Loading + Vibration&quot; intervention phase, subjects will be seated in the VibeTech One Rehab Chair, which allows vibration exercise while seated. A force is applied on a footplate that simulates the weight of standing or partial bodyweight. The participants will train for 10 minutes 3 days per week. The vibratory acceleration will be 30Hz and the applied load will be 50% of body weight up to a device maximum applied load of 100 lbs. Vibration intensity will initially be set to 0.2 g and will increase by 0.2 g every other week, as tolerated by the subject, and max of 1.0 g.
There will be a four week washout period between the two interventions.</description>

        <description>An ImpediMed SFB7 device (Eight Mile Plains, Queensland, Australia) will be used to obtain these measurements. Participants will be positioned supine for a minimum of 10 minutes prior to acquisition; adequate separation of their legs will be obtained to allow for accurate BIS measurement. Measurements will be obtained by placing four EKG-like electrodes on the skin of the participant's hand, feet and knee. Wires will be attached from the BIS device to these skin electrodes. Painless electric waves will be sent through the tissues as noted above. Each measurement lasts only a few seconds. This method will generate measurements of lean mass.</description>
