  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open label, study consisting of two cohorts. Cohort 2
      explores the combination of copanlisib and pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory NKTCL, who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. Cohort 2 will include
      a phase 1 portion (cohort 2a) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) utilizing a
      standard 3+3 design, followed by a phase II portion where patients will be treated at the
      RP2D (cohort 2b). The primary endpoint for cohort 1 was progression-free survival; the
      primary endpoint for cohort 2a will be to determine RP2D for the combination therapy; and
      overall response rate at the end of 4 treatment cycles for cohort 2b. Patients will be
      assessed for response with PET CT or CT every 12 weeks using the revised Cheson criteria.
      Correlative endpoints will be exploratory and assess PD-1 expression on peripheral blood
      lymphocytes; peripheral blood T-cell and NK-cell functional assays; PD-1 and PD-L1 expression
      on tumor tissue; tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and gene expression panels using the
      nanostring technology as prognostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as monitoring of
      minimal residual disease via high-throughput sequencing of cell free tumor DNA, and exosome
      analysis.

    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory (RR) NK and T-cell Lymphoma (NKTCL), who have received
      at least 1 prior systemic therapy, were enrolled in cohort 1. The study design for cohort 1
      was a single arm phase II 2-stage design, to explore monotherapy with the PD-1 antibody
      pembrolizumab (or MK-3475) given intravenously at a fixed dose of 200mg every 3 weeks for up
      to 36 cycles. Enrollment to this cohort has been completed.

         13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

         18. Cohort 2a: Has received an allogeneic stem cell transplant. For cohort 2b, patients
             within the first 100 days of having undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant will
             be excluded. Otherwise, patients who have received an allogeneic stem cell transplant
             are allowed as long as they have no evidence of active GVHD or are on
             immunosuppressive therapy

         19. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management

         20. Uncontrolled Type I or II diabetes mellitus as deemed appropriate by the investigator.

             itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and
             strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St.
             John's Wort) are not permitted from Day -14 of Cycle 1 until the Safety follow up
             visit. See Table in Appendix 5 for complete list

         23. Concurrent diagnosis of pheochromocytoma

         24. Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident
             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
             within 3 months before the start of study medication

         25. Prior exposure to PI3K inhibitors, unless on PI3K inhibitor therapy more than 6 months
             ago AND reason for discontinuation of prior PI3K inhibitor therapy was other than
             progression or toxicity.
