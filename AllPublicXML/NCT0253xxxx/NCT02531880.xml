  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - The blood-brain barrier separates the brain from the rest of the body. Epilepsy is a
      neurological disease that causes seizures. It can affect this barrier. Researchers think a
      contrast agent called mangafodipir might be better able to show areas of the brain that
      epilepsy affects.

      Objective:

      - To see if mangafodipir is well tolerated and safe. To see if it can show, on an MRI, areas
      of the brain that epilepsy affects.

      Eligibility:

        -  People ages 18-60 who:

        -  Have epilepsy not controlled by drugs

        -  Prior or concurrent enrollment in 18-N-0066 is required

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Participants will have up to 6 visits in 1-3 months. Those with epilepsy will have an
           inpatient stay lasting 2-10 days. Visits may include:

        -  Video-EEG monitoring for participants with epilepsy

        -  An IV catheter put in place: a needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.

        -  Getting mangafodipir through the IV.

        -  5 MRI scans over a 10-day period: a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the
           brain. Participants lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. They are in the
           cylinder for 45-90 minutes, lying still for up to 10 minutes at a time. The scanner
           makes loud knocking sounds. Participants will get earplugs.

        -  A final MRI at least 2 weeks after receiving mangafodipir. Gadolinium is given through
           an IV catheter....

      Objective: The primary goals of this pilot study is to (1) describe the safety profile of
      administration of mangafodipir in patients with epilepsy and (2) determine if peri-ictal
      administration will allow focal entry of mangafodipir through the blood-brain-barrier and
      manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) visualization of seizure foci.
      Secondary objectives are further exploration of MEMRI properties in patients with epilepsy.

      Study population: 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

      Design: Screening of enrolled participants will include a medical history, physical exam,
      blood and urine laboratory testing. Patients will be imaged interictally with a gadolinium
      enhanced MRI session. The administration of mangafodipir will be done as an inpatient during
      long-term video EEG recording, to ensure administration in the periictal period. Patients
      will receive a baseline MRI scan, IV mangafodipir injection and will then be serially scanned
      with non-contrast MRI scans.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are (1) description of the safety profile of
      mangafodipir administration in patients with epilepsy, and (2) evaluation of the difference
      between T1-weighted signal intensity in the brain measured after mangafodipir administration
      in the seizure onset zone identified by standard clinical, EEG, and imaging studies, and the
      homologous contralateral region.

          -  Drug resistant epilepsy participants will be defined as having clinically documented

             for at least one year prior to enrolling in this study and with an average of at least
