  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of the addition of sitagliptin to metformin
      with or without a sulfonylurea compared with the addition of dapagliflozin to metformin with
      or without a sulfonylurea on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) over 24 weeks of treatment as well as the
      overall safety and tolerability of sitagliptin in comparison to that of dapagliflozin after
      24 weeks of treatment. The primary hypothesis is that the change from baseline in A1C in
      participants treated with the addition of sitagliptin is non-inferior compared to that in
      participants treated with the addition of dapagliflozin after 24 weeks of treatment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 24 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product. The AE does not have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The AE can include any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease or any worsening (change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the pharmaceutical product.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Incremental 2-hour (2-hr) Postprandial Glucose Excursion (PPGE) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and 120 minutes after the standard meal at Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 2hr PPGE is the change from baseline in the mean incremental change in post meal glucose defined as T-120 minus T-0 for each participant: change from baseline PPGE = Week 24 mean (T-120 minus T-0) minus Baseline mean (T-120 minus T-0). The 2-point MMTT measured values at T-0 and T-120 while the 3-point MMTT measured values at T-0, T-60, and T-120: although only a subset of the study had the 3-point MMTT performed, all participants had a T-0 and T-120 time point. A negative (-) change from baseline to Week 24 indicates better control of postprandial glucose.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately before and 120 minutes after the standard meal at Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 2hr PPG is the change from baseline in mean post prandial glucose (change from baseline PPG = Week 24 mean T-120 glucose minus Baseline mean T-120 glucose) and shows each drugs impact on PPG. The 2-point MMTT measured values at T-0 and T-120 while the 3-point MMTT measured values at T-0, T-60, and T-120: although only a subset of the study had the 3-point MMTT performed, all participants had a T-0 and T-120 time point. A negative (-) change from baseline to Week 24 indicates better control of postprandial glucose.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glucagon Area Under the Curve (AUC0-120 Minutes) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and 60 and 120 minutes after the standard meal at Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>AUC endpoints were analyzed for participants who underwent the 3-point MMTT. Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to (T=0 minutes) and 60 and 120 minutes after the administration of the standard meal. The AUC curve was generated with the 3 time points. If any time point for a given participant was missing, the AUC was not included. Change in Postprandial Glucagon AUC after the morning meal (t=0 to 120 minutes) was calculated from the glucagon AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at baseline minus glucagon AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at Week 24. A negative (-) change from baseline to Week 24 indicates better control of postprandial glucose.</description>

If any time point for a given participant was missing, the AUC was not included. Change in Postprandial Insulin AUC after the morning meal (t=0 to 120 minutes) was calculated from insulin AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at baseline minus insulin AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at Week 24. A negative (-) change from baseline to Week 24 indicates better control of postprandial glucose.</description>

    <description>AUC endpoints were analyzed for participants who underwent the 3-point MMTT.

If any time point for a given participant was missing, the AUC was not included. The endpoint was calculated from the ratio of (insulin AUC / glucagon AUC) over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at baseline minus AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at Week 24. A negative (-) change from baseline to Week 24 indicates better control of postprandial glucose.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product. The AE does not have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The AE can include any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease or any worsening (change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the pharmaceutical product.</description>

        <description>The 2hr PPGE is the change from baseline in the mean incremental change in post meal glucose defined as T-120 minus T-0 for each participant: change from baseline PPGE = Week 24 mean (T-120 minus T-0) minus Baseline mean (T-120 minus T-0). The 2-point MMTT measured values at T-0 and T-120 while the 3-point MMTT measured values at T-0, T-60, and T-120: although only a subset of the study had the 3-point MMTT performed, all participants had a T-0 and T-120 time point.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Insulin AUC0-120 Minutes at Week 24</title>
          <description>AUC endpoints were analyzed for participants who underwent the 3-point MMTT. Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to (T=0 minutes) and 60 and 120 minutes after the administration of the standard meal. The AUC curve was generated with the 3 time points. If any time point for a given participant was missing, the AUC was not included. Change in Postprandial Insulin AUC after the morning meal (t=0 to 120 minutes) was calculated from insulin AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at baseline minus insulin AUC over the first 120 minutes following the morning meal at Week 24. A negative (-) change from baseline to Week 24 indicates better control of postprandial glucose.</description>
          <population>All randomized and treated participants who underwent MMTT for the analysis endpoint, had both baseline and Week 24 endpoint measurements, without: drug compliance &lt;75%, use of prohibited AHA medications or pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids or incorrect double-blind study drug or a change in metformin or sulfonylurea dose.</population>
