      This open-label trial is composed of two periods: Induction and Extension. All eligible
      patients will be enrolled into the 12-Week Induction period and receive study medication.
      Patients who complete the Induction period may then be eligible to enter the 100-Week
      Extension period where they will continue to receive study medication.

    <measure>Change in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The simple endoscopy score (SES-CD) assesses the degree of inflammation. The SES-CD assesses the following 4 components: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing. Each of these components are scored on a scale of 0 to 3. In the SES-CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the five segments of the ileum and colon: ileum, right, transverse, left (descending and sigmoid), and rectum. The SES-CD is the sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five segments. Mild CD is defined as an SES-CD≥3 but less than 7 points. Moderate to severely active CD is defined as a SES-CD of ≥7 points.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite score that is used to measure the clinical activity of Crohn's disease. The CDAI uses a questionnaire with responses scored numerically and weighted. Scores range from 0 to approximately 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>
