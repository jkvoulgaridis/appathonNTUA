  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a group-based health promotion
      intervention with patient education and practical exercises delivered at a Healthy Life
      Centre increases patient activation in people living with chronic pain. Due to many people
      living with chronic pain, interventions focusing on self-management and coping are on the
      agenda in primary care. This study will investigate whether a Healthy Life Centre in a
      municipality is a suitable setting for interventions targeting people living with chronic
      pain. Short and long term effect of an intervention developed in a health promotion and
      salutogenic framework will be investigated in a randomized clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      Previous research indicates that if self-management interventions are developed within a
      health promotion framework focusing on the participants' strengths, there is a beneficial
      effect on patient activation and thus on self-management behaviour. However, there is a lack
      of knowledge about which interventions will improve patient activation for persons with
      chronic pain. To be sustainable, such interventions should be delivered using the least
      possible amount of resources needed to get an effect. One way to do so is to deliver the
      intervention in primary care instead of in hospitals. The Healthy Life Centre is ideally
      situated to deliver these interventions. This is especially true due to their task of
      focusing on health promotion but also because they are set up to deliver low level
      interventions, meaning that it should be easy for everyone to access their services.
