      A Phase IV study evaluating changes in oxygen consumption and cardiac function in Subjects
      with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with resting hyperinflation after
      administration of Symbicort pMDI 160/4.5 μg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate/severe COPD are known to have static hyperinflation and to develop
      dynamic hyperinflation during exercise. Treatment with inhaled long-acting beta agonists and
      combination of the long-acting beta agonist (LABA), formoterol and the inhaled
      corticosteroid, budesonide has been shown to improve IC and decrease lung hyperinflation. In
      a similar previous pilot single centre study with budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort®) the
      analysis of cardiac outcomes demonstrated a decrease in maximum volume of oxygen (VO2)
      compared to placebo. Findings suggested that the use of Symbicort can decrease the cost of
      breathing and therefore reduce the cardiac demand experienced by COPD patients with
      hyperinflation at rest. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Symbicort therapy can
      decrease resting VO2 by decreasing static lung hyperinflation in subjects with COPD and to
      evaluate changes in cardiac function.

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 5 sites in the United States (US) between 25 August 2015 and 12 August 2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This was a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, 2 way cross over study to evaluate changes in oxygen consumption and cardiac function in COPD patients with resting hyperinflation after administration of Symbicort pMDI. The study consisted of 5 site visits and 1 phone visit for a total study duration of 6 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Pre-dose (Visit 2) to Post-dose (Visit 5) Assessment in the Modified Borg Scale for Dyspnea</title>
        <description>For all outcome measures, treatment group estimates are LS Means across visits (change between 2 or more time points, calculated as the value at the later time point minus the value at the earlier time point, e.g. LS means across visits up to Visit 5 minus pre-dose Visit 2 value). Estimate for difference = LS Mean (Symbicort pMDI 160mcg/4.5ug) - LS Mean (placebo). Modified Borg scale for dyspnea was self-administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 3 (Day 7), Visit 4 (Day 14), and Visit 5 (Day 21). The Borg scale is a 1-item instrument through which a subject reports dyspnea symptoms on a scale of 0-10 to quantify the intensity of dyspnea (where 10 is most intense).</description>
