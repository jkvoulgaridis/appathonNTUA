    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Receive and Tolerate a VIVITROL Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Toleration to the injection was demonstrated by mild opioid withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS] &lt;/=12 or Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale [SOWS] &lt;/=10) following VIVITROL administration. The COWS is a clinician-rated questionnaire designed to measure 11 common opioid withdrawal signs or symptoms. The summed score provides information about the level of physical dependence on opioids. The range of COWS scores is 0-4 (none to minimal); 5-12 (mild); 13-24 (moderate); 25-36 (moderately severe); and 37-48 (severe withdrawal. The SOWS is a 16-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure the severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms. The subject rates the intensity of symptoms using a 5-point scale. The range of SOWS scores is 1-10 (mild); 11-20 (moderate); and 21-30 (severe).</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) COWS Score During the Treatment Period Prior to VIVITROL Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>The COWS was administered 4-6 times per day during the Treatment Period (Days 1-7)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is a clinician-rated questionnaire designed to measure 11 common opioid withdrawal signs or symptoms. The summed score provides information about the level of physical dependence on opioids. The range of COWS scores is 0-4 (none to minimal); 5-12 (mild); 13-24 (moderate); 25-36 (moderately severe); and 37-48 (severe withdrawal. To determine the daily AUC COWS score, a curve was generated by plotting the COWS scores against the time the test was taken. The area under this curve was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. For the total AUC COWS score, the AUCs calculated for each day during the treatment period were added together. To normalize for time, the total AUC COWS score was then divided by the number of days with daily AUC COWS score during the treatment period. The AUC COWS has a different range than the standard scale as it measures not the score itself, but the area under the curve of the score plotted against time.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score for Desire of Opioids During Treatment Period Prior to VIVITROL Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Desire for Opioids Visual Analog Scale (VAS) uses a 100-mm, horizontal linear scale, with 0 anchored on the left representing &quot;no desire for opioids&quot; and 100 anchored on the right representing &quot;strongest imaginable desire for opioids&quot;. Subjects placed a vertical line on the scale to indicate their desire for opioids at that particular time.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Who Receive and Tolerate a VIVITROL Injection</title>
        <description>Toleration to the injection was demonstrated by mild opioid withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS] &lt;/=12 or Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale [SOWS] &lt;/=10) following VIVITROL administration. The COWS is a clinician-rated questionnaire designed to measure 11 common opioid withdrawal signs or symptoms. The summed score provides information about the level of physical dependence on opioids. The range of COWS scores is 0-4 (none to minimal); 5-12 (mild); 13-24 (moderate); 25-36 (moderately severe); and 37-48 (severe withdrawal. The SOWS is a 16-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure the severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms. The subject rates the intensity of symptoms using a 5-point scale. The range of SOWS scores is 1-10 (mild); 11-20 (moderate); and 21-30 (severe).</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC) COWS Score During the Treatment Period Prior to VIVITROL Injection</title>
        <description>The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is a clinician-rated questionnaire designed to measure 11 common opioid withdrawal signs or symptoms. The summed score provides information about the level of physical dependence on opioids. The range of COWS scores is 0-4 (none to minimal); 5-12 (mild); 13-24 (moderate); 25-36 (moderately severe); and 37-48 (severe withdrawal. To determine the daily AUC COWS score, a curve was generated by plotting the COWS scores against the time the test was taken. The area under this curve was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. For the total AUC COWS score, the AUCs calculated for each day during the treatment period were added together. To normalize for time, the total AUC COWS score was then divided by the number of days with daily AUC COWS score during the treatment period. The AUC COWS has a different range than the standard scale as it measures not the score itself, but the area under the curve of the score plotted against time.</description>

          <title>Mean Score for Desire of Opioids During Treatment Period Prior to VIVITROL Injection</title>
          <description>The Desire for Opioids Visual Analog Scale (VAS) uses a 100-mm, horizontal linear scale, with 0 anchored on the left representing &quot;no desire for opioids&quot; and 100 anchored on the right representing &quot;strongest imaginable desire for opioids&quot;. Subjects placed a vertical line on the scale to indicate their desire for opioids at that particular time.</description>
          <population>All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and provided at least 1 post-baseline measureable VAS assessment.</population>

        <title>Area Under the Curve SOWS Score During the Treatment Period Prior to the VIVITROL Injection</title>
        <description>The Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) is a 16-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure the severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms. The subject rates the intensity of symptoms using a 5-point scale. The range of SOWS scores is 1-10 (mild); 11-20 (moderate); and 21-30 (severe). To determine the daily AUC SOWS score, a curve was generated by plotting the SOWS scores against the time the test was taken. The area under this curve was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. For the total AUC SOWS score, the AUCs calculated for each day during the treatment period were added together. To normalize for time, the total AUC SOWS score was then divided by the number of days with daily AUC SOWS score during the treatment period. The AUC SOWS has a different range than the standard scale as it measures not the score itself, but the area under the curve of the score plotted against time.</description>
        <time_frame>The SOWS was administered 4-6 times per day during the Treatment Period</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline SOWS measurement.</population>
