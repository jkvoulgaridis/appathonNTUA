    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the long-term (9-months) safety of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert in
      participants with Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension who completed study FSV5-004. All the
      participants received Bimatoprost Ocular Insert and wore it for approximately 3 months (12
      weeks), then had that Insert removed and a new Insert placed for another 26 weeks
      (approximately 6 months).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Ocular and Non-ocular Adverse Events (AE) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, enrollment in this study) to end of study (Week 38)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (eg, sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness) that occurred in a study participant, regardless of the suspected cause during the study. An ocular AE is an AE that occurred in the eye and non-ocular is an AE that occurred not in the eye. The investigator assessed the worst severity of each AE as: Mild=aware of sign or symptom, but readily tolerated, Moderate=discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity or Severe=incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 in study FSV5-004) to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 38</time_frame>
    <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP measurements were taken at 8 am (Time (T)=0 hour) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 38. Diurnal IOP measurements were also taken at 10 am (T=2 hour), and 4 pm (T=8 hour) at Weeks 12, 24 and 38. IOP readings from both eyes were averaged to compute a single IOP value for each diurnal timepoint. A negative change from Baseline indicated an improvement. Baseline is defined as the IOP assessment done at the Randomization visit (Day 0) of study FSV5-004.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Subject-Reported Comfort Assessment Categories</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, enrollment in this study) Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 38</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed their overall comfort with ocular inserts using the following rating choices: Not aware of inserts, very comfortable; Aware of inserts, and comfortable; Tolerable, but mild discomfort; Moderate discomfort or Severe discomfort. The percentage of participants in each rating category is reported.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Bimatoprost Ocular Insert Retention Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, enrollment in this study) to the end of study (Week 38)</time_frame>
    <description>Insert duration was defined as the total duration (in days) that any ocular insert remained in place for each subject, measured from the date of Insert removal minus date of Insert placement + 1.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Received Rescue Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, enrollment in this study) to the end of study (Week 38)</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue treatment with topical bimatoprost was available for each eye if deemed necessary by the investigator to achieve desired IOP.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Endothelial Cell Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, enrollment in this study) to end of study (Week 38)</time_frame>
    <description>Density (number of cells/mm^2) of corneal endothelial cells was determined at four sites using specular microscopy of the central corneal endothelium at Baseline and at Week 38.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</title>
        <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP measurements were taken at 8 am (Time (T)=0 hour) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 38. Diurnal IOP measurements were also taken at 10 am (T=2 hour), and 4 pm (T=8 hour) at Weeks 12, 24 and 38. IOP readings from both eyes were averaged to compute a single IOP value for each diurnal timepoint. A negative change from Baseline indicated an improvement. Baseline is defined as the IOP assessment done at the Randomization visit (Day 0) of study FSV5-004.</description>

        <description>The participant assessed their overall comfort with ocular inserts using the following rating choices: Not aware of inserts, very comfortable; Aware of inserts, and comfortable; Tolerable, but mild discomfort; Moderate discomfort or Severe discomfort. The percentage of participants in each rating category is reported.</description>
