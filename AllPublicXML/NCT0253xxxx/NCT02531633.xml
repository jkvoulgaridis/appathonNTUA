  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sirukumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) immunoglobulin G1-kappa with a high
      affinity and specificity for binding to the human IL-6 molecule that may have therapeutic
      benefit in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) by interruption of multiple pathogenic
      pathways. Sirukumab inhibits IL-6-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
      (STAT3) phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of the biological effect of IL-6. This
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirukumab to characterize the benefit-to-risk
      profile of sirukumab in the treatment of active GCA. The study will be conducted in 2
      distinct parts (Part A and Part B) and consists of the following phases: Screening phase,
      Part A: 52-week double-blind treatment phase, Part B: 104-week extension phase with the
      option to receive open-label sirukumab based on disease status and a 16-week follow-up phase
      if applicable.

      Approximately 204 subjects with a diagnosis of GCA and active disease within 6 weeks of
      baseline will be randomized into Part A, the 52-week double-blind treatment phase, to receive
      one of two doses of sirukumab or placebo, each in addition to a pre-specified prednisone
      taper. The efficacy and safety of sirukumab in sustaining remission will be assessed at Week
      52. Subjects completing Part A of the study will be eligible to enter Part B, the 104-week
      extension phase, designed to investigate the long-term maintenance of remission and safety
      following cessation of sirukumab treatment and to assess long-term corticosteroid use.
      Subjects with active GCA at the end of Part A or those with new onset of GCA flare during the
      first 52 weeks of Part B will be eligible to receive open-label sirukumab. Subjects will need
      to have follow-up safety evaluations for at least 16 weeks after receiving the last dose of
      study drug, applicable only for those who are withdrawn prematurely from the study or whose
      open-label sirukumab treatment in Part B completes after Week 88.

    <description>EuroQoL-5 Dimensions consist of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Index score was derived from the 5 dimensions scores using UK tariff. The weights based from the UK population was used for conversion, regardless of the origin country of participant. The score ranged from -0.594 (worst score) to 1.000 (best score). Baseline was last measurement done up to and including Week 52 visit date of Part A.

        <title>Part A: Number of Participants in Sustained Remission at Week 52</title>
        <description>Sustained remission was defined as having achieved all of the following: 1) remission at Week 12, 2) absence of disease flare Week 12 through Week 52, 3) completion of the assigned prednisone taper, and 4) no requirement for rescue therapy through Week 52. Remission was defined as absence of clinical signs and symptoms of GCA and normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [&lt;30 millimeters per hour] and C-reactive Protein (CRP) [&lt;1 milligram/deciliter]) and flare was defined as recurrence of symptoms attributable to active GCA, with or without elevations in ESR and/or CRP. Data for number of participants in sustained remission at Week 52 is presented. Only those participants who completed Week 52 visit or withdrew before 10 Oct 2017 were included in the analysis.</description>

        <description>Participants who remained in sustained remission without requirement for rescue therapy or treatment change at each scheduled visit of Part B were defined as participants having achieved all of the following criteria: 1. Participants in sustained remission at the Week 52 visit of Part A, 2. Absence of disease flare, 3. No requirement for rescue therapy at any time through Week 24 of Part B, 4. No requirement for treatment change at any time through Week 24 of Part B. Remission was defined as absence of clinical signs and symptoms of GCA and normalization of ESR [&lt;30 millimeters per hour] and CRP [&lt;1 milligram/deciliter]) and flare was defined as recurrence of symptoms attributable to active GCA, with or without elevations in ESR and/or CRP.</description>

        <title>Part B: Number of Participants in Sustained Remission Over Time</title>
        <description>Sustained remission was defined as having achieved all of the following: 1) remission at Week 12 (absence of signs and symptoms of GCA and normalization of ESR and CRP), 2) absence of disease flare Week 12 through Week 52 with or without elevations in ESR and/or CRP, 3) completion of the assigned prednisone taper, and 4) no requirement for rescue therapy through Week 52. Remission was defined as absence of clinical signs and symptoms of GCA and normalization of ESR [&lt;30millimeters per hour] and CRP [&lt;1milligram/deciliter]) and Flare was defined as recurrence of symptoms attributable to active GCA, with or without elevations in ESR and/or CRP. Data for number of participants in sustained remission over time for Part B is presented. Only participants who were in sustained remission at Week 52 of Part A, who Completed the Week X Visit of Part B or who Withdraw before 10th of October 2017 were included in the analysis.</description>

          <title>Part B: Number of Participants in Sustained Remission Over Time</title>
          <description>Sustained remission was defined as having achieved all of the following: 1) remission at Week 12 (absence of signs and symptoms of GCA and normalization of ESR and CRP), 2) absence of disease flare Week 12 through Week 52 with or without elevations in ESR and/or CRP, 3) completion of the assigned prednisone taper, and 4) no requirement for rescue therapy through Week 52. Remission was defined as absence of clinical signs and symptoms of GCA and normalization of ESR [&lt;30millimeters per hour] and CRP [&lt;1milligram/deciliter]) and Flare was defined as recurrence of symptoms attributable to active GCA, with or without elevations in ESR and/or CRP. Data for number of participants in sustained remission over time for Part B is presented. Only participants who were in sustained remission at Week 52 of Part A, who Completed the Week X Visit of Part B or who Withdraw before 10th of October 2017 were included in the analysis.</description>

          <title>Part A: Number of Disease Flares Over Time</title>
          <description>This summarizes disease flares over time with no adjustment for exposure to study drugs, calculated by taking the last visit before a participant withdrew and then counting the number of participants with at least 1 flare up to that point and summing up the total number of flares experienced by each of these participants; participants who did not reach Week 2 were not included in this analysis. Data for number of disease flares per participant over time for part A were presented.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 acute health survey questionnaire consists of the following 8 multi-item scales: 1. Limitations in physical functioning due to health problems, 2. Limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, 3. Bodily pain, 4. General mental health (psychological distress and well-being), 5. Limitations in usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems, 6. Limitations in social functioning due to physical or mental health problems. 7. Vitality (energy and fatigue) and 8. General health perception. These 8 scales were scored from 0 to 100, 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score) where higher scores indicates better health. Data for Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores was presented.</description>

        <title>Part A: Mean EuroQol - 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Index Score Over Time</title>
        <description>EuroQoL-5 Dimensions consist of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Index score was derived from the 5 dimensions scores using UK tariff. The weights based from the UK population was used for conversion, regardless of the origin country of participant. The score ranged from -0.594 (worst score) to 1.000 (best score).</description>

        <title>Part A: Mean EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Over Time</title>
        <description>EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of the following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of the 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. The index score was derived from the 5 dimensions scores using UK tariff. The weights based from the UK population was used for the conversion, regardless of the origin country of participant. The score ranged from -0.594 (worst score) to 1 (best score). The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical line, VAS where the endpoints are 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>

        <title>Part A: Mean Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Scores Over Time</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire formatted for self-administration that assesses participant reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function over the past seven days. Participants were asked to answer each question using a 5-point Likert-type scale (4 = Not at all; 3 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a bit; and 0 = Very Much) where 0 is a bad response and 4 is good response. Each of the 13 items of the FACIT-Fatigue Scale ranges from 0-4, with a range of possible total score from 0-52, 0 (Extreme fatigue) to 52 (No fatigue) where 0 being the worst possible score and 52 the best (i.e. less fatigue). Scores below 30 indicate severe fatigue. Each negatively-worded item response was recoded so that 0 is a bad response and 4 is good response. All responses were added with equal weight to obtain the total score. The total score was calculated as the sum of all the individual items after recoding some of the items.</description>

        <title>Part A: Mean Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQDI) Score Over Time</title>
        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) indicates the extent of participant's functional ability during the past week, and was assessed for subgroup of participants with symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatic (PMR). HAQ-DI included 20 questions in 8 categories of functioning - dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each functional area contains at least two questions. For each question, there is a 4-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 (minimum) to 3 (Maximum), representing &quot;no difficulty&quot; (0), &quot;some difficulty&quot; (1), &quot;much difficulty&quot; (2), and &quot;unable to do&quot; (3) where, lower score indicates less disability and higher scores indicates worse disability. Total score was calculated as average scores of 20 questions which can be interpreted in terms of 3 categories: from 0 to 1: mild difficulties to moderate disability, from 1 to 2: disability moderate to severe, from 2 to 3: severe to very severe disability.</description>

        <title>Part B: Number of Participants With AEs, SAEs and Corticosteroid Related AEs Who Never Received 100mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment or all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia were categorized as SAE. Number of participants with AEs, SAEs and corticosteroid related AEs for part B have been reported.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters including Eosinophils, Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, Neutrophils and Platelets. Change from Baseline is presented for these parameters.Baseline was defined as the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Data for participants who never received 100 mg open label Sirukumab has been presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters including MCHC and Hemoglobin. Change from Baseline is presented for these parameters. Baseline was defined as the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Data for participants who never received 100 mg open label Sirukumab has been presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the chemistry parameters including Albumin and Protein. Change from Baseline is presented for these parameters. Baseline was defined as the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Data for participants who never received 100 mg open label Sirukumab has been presented.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 acute health survey questionnaire was developed as part of the Rand Health Insurance Experiment and consists of the following 8 multi-item scales: 1. Limitations in physical functioning due to health problems, 2. Limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, 3. Bodily pain, 4. General mental health (psychological distress and well-being), 5. Limitations in usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems, 6. Limitations in social functioning due to physical or mental health problems. 7. Vitality (energy and fatigue) and 8. General health perception. These 8 scales were scored from 0 to 100, 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score) where higher scores indicates better health. Data for participants (Par) who received at least one dose of 100 mg OL Sirukumab has been presented. Baseline was the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 acute health survey questionnaire was developed as part of the Rand Health Insurance Experiment and consists of the following 8 multi-item scales: 1. Limitations in physical functioning due to health problems, 2. Limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, 3. Bodily pain, 4. General mental health (psychological distress and well-being), 5. Limitations in usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems, 6. Limitations in social functioning due to physical or mental health problems. 7. Vitality (energy and fatigue) and 8. General health perception. These 8 scales were scored from 0 to 100, 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score) where higher scores indicates better health. Data for participants (Par) who never received 100 mg OL Sirukumab has been presented. Baseline was the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Index Score Over Time for Participants Who Received at Least One Dose of 100 mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>EuroQoL-5 Dimensions consist of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Index score was derived from the 5 dimensions scores using UK tariff. The weights based from the UK population was used for conversion, regardless of the origin country of participant. The score ranged from -0.594 (worst score) to 1.000 (best score). Baseline was last measurement done up to and including Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Index Score Over Time for Participants Who Never Received 100mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>EuroQoL-5 Dimensions consist of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of following 5 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self-Care, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort and 5.Anxiety/Depression. Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Index score was derived from the 5 dimensions scores using UK tariff. The weights based from the UK population was used for conversion, regardless of the origin country of participant. The score ranged from -0.594 (worst score) to 1.000 (best score). Baseline was last measurement done up to and including Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Scores Over Time for Participants Who Received at Least One Dose of 100 mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire formatted for self-administration that assesses participant reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function over the past seven days. Participants were asked to answer each question using a 5-point Likert-type scale (4 = Not at all; 3 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a bit; and 0 = Very Much) where 0 is a bad response and 4 is good response. Each of the 13 items of the FACIT-Fatigue Scale ranges from 0-4, with a range of possible total score from 0-52, 0 (Extreme fatigue) to 52 (No fatigue) where 0 being the worst possible score and 52 the best (i.e. less fatigue). Scores below 30 indicate severe fatigue. Baseline was the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Scores Over Time for Participants Who Never Received 100mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire formatted for self-administration that assesses participant reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function over the past seven days. Participants were asked to answer each question using a 5-point Likert-type scale (4 = Not at all; 3 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a bit; and 0 = Very Much) where 0 is a bad response and 4 is good response. Each of the 13 items of the FACIT-Fatigue Scale ranges from 0-4, with a range of possible total score from 0-52, 0 (Extreme fatigue) to 52 (No fatigue) where 0 being the worst possible score and 52 the best (i.e. less fatigue). Scores below 30 indicate severe fatigue. Baseline was the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Participants with post baseline data were reported.</description>

        <description>The assessment of pain severity was made using a single pain severity item on which participants were asked to rate the severity of their average pain now on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0, &quot;no pain&quot; to 10, &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;. Baseline was the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in Pain NRS Scores Over Time for Participants Who Never Received at Least One Dose of 100mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>The assessment of pain severity was made using a single pain severity item on which participants were asked to rate the severity of their average pain now on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0, &quot;no pain&quot; to 10, &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;. Baseline was the last measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Participants with post baseline data were reported.</description>

        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) indicates the extent of participant's functional ability during the past week, and was assessed for subgroup of participants with symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatic (PMR). HAQ-DI included 20 questions in 8 categories of functioning - dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each functional area contains at least two questions. For each question, there is a 4-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 (minimum) to 3 (Maximum), representing &quot;no difficulty&quot; (0), &quot;some difficulty&quot; (1), &quot;much difficulty&quot; (2), and &quot;unable to do&quot; (3) where, lower score indicates less disability and higher scores indicates worse disability. Total score was calculated as average scores of 20 questions which can be interpreted in terms of 3 categories: from 0 to 1: mild difficulties to moderate disability, from 1 to 2: disability moderate to severe, from 2 to 3: severe to very severe disability</description>

        <title>Part B: HAQDI Score Over Time for Participants Who Never Received 100 mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) indicates the extent of participant's functional ability during the past week, and was assessed for subgroup of participants with symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatic (PMR). HAQ-DI included 20 questions in 8 categories of functioning - dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each functional area contains at least two questions. For each question, there is a 4-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 (minimum) to 3 (Maximum), representing &quot;no difficulty&quot; (0), &quot;some difficulty&quot; (1), &quot;much difficulty&quot; (2), and &quot;unable to do&quot; (3) where, lower score indicates less disability and higher scores indicates worse disability. Total score was calculated as average scores of 20 questions which can be interpreted in terms of 3 categories: from 0 to 1: mild difficulties to moderate disability, from 1 to 2: disability moderate to severe, from 2 to 3: severe to very severe disability</description>

          <description>Patient-reported response to treatment was assessed using the PGIC measure, a single item completed by participant to provide a clinically meaningful summary of an individual's response to treatment. The assessment provides an estimate of the magnitude of treatment response at different time points during the study. Responses include: Much Better, Better, Slightly Better, No Change, Slightly Worse, Worse, and Much Worse. The categorical data of participant rating of change is summarized by treatment group, visit and response category.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS Over Time for Participants Who Received at Least One Dose of 100 mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of the following 6 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort, 5.Anxiety/Depression; 6.How good or or bad your health is today. Each of these 6 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical line, VAS where the endpoints are 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. Answers to 'How good or bad your health is today' were measured on a 100 point VAS scale. Baseline for Part B is the last non-missing measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part B: Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS Over Time for Participants Who Never Received 100 mg OL Sirukumab in Part B</title>
        <description>EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 elements: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of the following 6 dimensions: 1.Mobility, 2.Self, 3.Usual Activities, 4.Pain/Discomfort, 5.Anxiety/Depression; 6.How good or or bad your health is today. Each of these 6 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical line, VAS where the endpoints are 100 (Best imaginable health state) and 0 (Worst imaginable health state). Answers to 'How good or bad your health is today' were measured on a 100 point VAS scale. Baseline for Part B is the last non-missing measurement done up to and including the Week 52 visit date of Part A. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>
