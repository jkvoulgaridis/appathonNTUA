      This study is looking to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD) administered in combination
      with MR-HIFU in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors, which may include but are not
      limited to rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors,
      osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatic tumors, and germ cell tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1 trial of LTLD with MR-HIFU induced heating in children and young adults with
      relapsed/refractory solid tumors.

      Part A of the trial will be a traditional dose escalation study to determine the pediatric
      MTD/RP2D of LTLD combined with MR-HIFU ablation which allows for release of doxorubicin in
      the ablation zone and peri-ablation margins.

      Part B of the trial will combine LTLD at the MTD/RP2D with MR-HIFU induced mild hyperthermia
      (MHT) in an expanded cohort.
