  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 1-month dispensing, double-masked, randomized, contralateral study comparing
      the test lens against the control lens. The assignment of lenses to eyes (i.e. which lens
      type is to be worn in which eye throughout the study) will be selected according to a
      randomization table.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both test and control lenses will be used in a daily wear modality for 1 month. It is
      anticipated that this study will involve the following visits: Baseline (screening and
      dispense visit combined), 2-week visit and 4-week visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is at least 17 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer

          -  Has read and understood the information consent letter

          -  Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule

          -  Is correctable to a visual acuity of 20/30 or better (in each eye) with their habitual
             correction or the assigned study lenses

          -  Is an adapted soft contact lens wearer (For the purpose of this study: Current lens
             wear at least 3 days per week, 8 hours each day.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study

          -  Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          -  Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable

          -  Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable^

          -  Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study

          -  Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment (by verbal
             confirmation at the screening visit). Rationale is that systemic changes over time due
             to pregnancy/lactating may adversely affect contact lens wear e.g. ocular dryness may
             increase.

          -  Is aphakic

          -  Has undergone corneal refractive surgery.

        For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or
        inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically
        relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal
        and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease.
        Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or
        inflammation and are therefore not active.

        Participants will be excluded with significant slit lamp findings (e.g. infiltrates or
        other slit lamp findings Grade 3 or above: corneal edema, tarsal abnormalities, and
        conjunctival injection) or active ocular disease (e.g. glaucoma, history of recurrent
        corneal erosions, and intraocular infection or inflammation of an allergic, bacterial, or
        viral etiology).

        ^ For the purposes of this study, participants will be excluded, if currently taking
        medication, such as oral antihistamines, antihistamine eye drops, oral and ophthalmic
        beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g. Propanolol, Timolol), anticholinergics, oral steroids and
        any prescribed or over-the-counter eye medication, except artificial tears or eye
        lubricants
