      This study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of BonyPid-500TM implantation
      for intrabony peri-implantitis defects.

      BonyPid-500™ is a bone graft substitute, which contains an antibiotic drug - doxycycline, and
      is intended for filling and reconstruction of bone defects caused by peri-implantitis.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized, single-blind, two arm controlled, multicenter study in subjects
      undergoing surgical treatment for peri-implantitis disease. Eligible subjects will undergo a
      surgical treatment and be randomly assigned during surgical intervention (after flap opening)
      in a 1:1 ratio to adjunct BonyPid-500TM implantation or no BonyPid-500TM implantation.

      Randomization will be stratified by site and number of eligible implants, i.e., single or
      multiple.

      The study population includes male and female subjects, 20 - 80 years of age at screening,
      diagnosed with peri-implantitis and recommended for surgical treatment of peri-implantitis
      disease.

      Up to 77 subjects will be enrolled to this study which will be conducted in two medical
      centers in Israel.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test before
             radiographs, dental hygienist cleaning, and surgical procedure (Note: Females of
             childbearing age must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception
             consistently and correctly for the duration of the study period).

          -  Subjects with a minimum of one osseo-integrated implant with peri-implantitis.

          -  Subjects with at least one eligible implant within the surgical area.

          -  Subjects with bleeding on probing of selected implant with or without suppuration.

          -  Subjects with selected implant(s) having radiographic evidence, according to X-rays,
             of:

               1. Intrabony defect

               2. Bone loss ≥ 3 mm

               3. Minimum of 2 mm of bone at implant apex.
