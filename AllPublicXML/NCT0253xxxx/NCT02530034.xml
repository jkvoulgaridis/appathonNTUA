      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-PR1/HLA-A2 monoclonal
      antibody Hu8F4 (Hu8F4) in treating patients with malignancies related to the blood
      (hematologic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as Hu8F4, may interfere with the ability of cancer
      cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and minimum safe and biologically-effective
      dose of Hu8F4 when administered intravenously in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS).

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Hu8F4 following study drug administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe the anti-leukemia effects of Hu8F4 in patients with leukemias and MDS.

      II. To measure the overall survival, disease-free survival and event-free survival of
      patients with leukemias or MDS treated with Hu8F4.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive anti-PR1/HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody Hu8F4 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
