    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response in the CNS, Assessed Using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until disease progression (assessed every 6 weeks for first 2 scans, followed by every 8 weeks for 2 scans, then every 12 weeks until disease progression; up to approximately 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Responses were assessed by the investigator, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, physical examinations, routine neurological examinations, and corticosteroid dosing. An objective response in the central nervous system (CNS) was a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by repeat assessment, according to RANO-BM criteria. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all CNS target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; and stable or improved clinically; for non-target lesions, a CR was the disappearance of all enhancing CNS non-target lesions and no new CNS lesions. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum longest diameter (LD) of CNS target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable to decreased corticosteroid dose; and stable or improved clinically. The 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals were calculated for responses.</description>

    <description>Responses were assessed by the investigator, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, physical examinations, routine neurological examinations, and corticosteroid dosing. An objective response in the central nervous system (CNS) was a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by repeat assessment, according to RANO-BM criteria. Among participants who achieved an objective response, duration of response in the CNS was defined as the time from documentation of the first CR or PR to the time of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause. If a participant did not experience death or disease progression in the CNS before the end of the study, duration of response was censored on the last date the participant was known to be progression free. Duration of response was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response in the CNS, Assessed Using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) Criteria</title>
        <description>Responses were assessed by the investigator, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, physical examinations, routine neurological examinations, and corticosteroid dosing. An objective response in the central nervous system (CNS) was a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by repeat assessment, according to RANO-BM criteria. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all CNS target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; and stable or improved clinically; for non-target lesions, a CR was the disappearance of all enhancing CNS non-target lesions and no new CNS lesions. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum longest diameter (LD) of CNS target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable to decreased corticosteroid dose; and stable or improved clinically. The 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals were calculated for responses.</description>

An objective response in the central nervous system (CNS) was a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by repeat assessment, according to RANO-BM criteria. Among participants who achieved an objective response, duration of response in the CNS was defined as the time from documentation of the first CR or PR to the time of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause. If a participant did not experience death or disease progression in the CNS before the end of the study, duration of response was censored on the last date the participant was known to be progression free.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit (Confirmed CR, PR, or SD ≥6 Months) in the CNS, Assessed Using RANO-BM Criteria</title>
        <description>Responses were assessed by the investigator, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, physical examinations, routine neurological examinations, and corticosteroid dosing. Clinical benefit in the central nervous system (CNS) was defined here as a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, confirmed by repeat assessment according to RANO-BM criteria. A CR or PR were defined in the same way as for objective response in the CNS. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter (LD) while on study. The 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals were calculated for responses.</description>

        <description>Responses were assessed by the investigator, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, physical examinations, routine neurological examinations, and corticosteroid dosing. Clinical benefit in the central nervous system (CNS) was defined here as a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, confirmed by repeat assessment according to RANO-BM criteria. Among participants who achieved clinical benefit, duration of clinical benefit in the CNS was defined as the time from documentation of the first CR, PR, or SD ≥6 months to the time of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause. If a participant did not experience death or disease progression in the CNS before the end of the study, duration of clinical benefit was censored on the last date the participant was known to be progression free. Duration of clinical benefit was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as all adverse events occurring on or after Day 1 of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. All TEAEs were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0; any TEAE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living.

All SAEs were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0; any SAE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated; and Grade 5 = death related to adverse event. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each adverse event.

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as all adverse events occurring on or after Day 1 of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. All TEAEs were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0; any TEAE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to adverse event. Multiple occurrences of TEAEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants by Investigator Interpretation of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Assessments Over Time</title>
        <description>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the measurement of the percentage of blood that is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. All participants were required to have had a baseline LVEF of at least (≥)50% to participate in this study. Measurements were done by either echocardiogram (ECHO) or mulitple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan (with ECHO as the preferred method). Participants were to be reassessed with the same technique used for baseline cardiac evaluation throughout the study. The following are definitions for the three categories of LVEF findings: 'Normal' was defined as LVEF &gt;45% or LVEF 40-45% with less than (&lt;)10% points drop below baseline; 'Abnormal' was defined as LVEF &lt;40% or LVEF ≥10% points drop below baseline, and clinically significant versus non-clinically significant was subject to the investigator's assessment of whether symptoms were present or absent.</description>

The following are definitions for the three categories of LVEF findings: 'Normal' was defined as LVEF &gt;45% or LVEF 40-45% with less than (&lt;)10% points drop below baseline; 'Abnormal' was defined as LVEF &lt;40% or LVEF ≥10% points drop below baseline, and clinically significant versus non-clinically significant was subject to the investigator's assessment of whether symptoms were present or absent.</description>
          <population>Safety Population: all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. Only participants with evaluable assessments at each visit were included in the analysis.</population>

        <title>Symptom Severity Scale Score Over Time, Assessed by Participant Reporting on the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The MDASI-BT consists of 28 items and is a multi-symptom measure of cancer-related symptoms (Cleeland et al. 2000) that are sensitive to disease and treatment changes. The MDASI-BT is composed of the symptom severity scale and the symptom interference scale. In the symptom severity scale, participants rate the severity of their symptoms in the last 24 hours on 0−10 numeric scales, ranging from 0 = &quot;not present&quot; to 10 = &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The MDASI-BT symptom severity scale score will be calculated by (sum of total scores of non-missing items) divided by (total number of non-missing items), if participants answered at least 12 of the 22 severity scale items. The score will be considered missing if less than 12 items are completed.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 20, and 28, and then every 12 weeks until progression (up to approximately 5.25 years)</time_frame>

        <description>The MDASI-BT consists of 28 items and is a multi-symptom measure of cancer-related symptoms that are sensitive to disease and treatment changes. The MDASI-BT is composed of the symptom severity scale and the symptom interference scale. In the symptom interference scale, participants rate interference with daily activities caused by their symptoms on 0−10 numeric scales ranging from 0 = &quot;did not interfere&quot; to 10 = &quot;interfered completely.&quot; The MDASI-BT symptom interference scale score will be calculated by (sum of total scores of non-missing items) divided by (total number of non-missing items), if participants answered at least 4 of the 6 interference scale items. The score will be considered missing if less than 4 items are completed.</description>
