             are sexually active and have a partner who is capable of becoming pregnant, neither of
             which have had surgery to become sterilized, who are not using an effective method of

          3. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40

          4. Partial or complete joint replacement in the target knee

          5. Previous exposure to SM04690

          6. Major surgery (e.g., interventional arthroscopy) in the target knee within 52 weeks

             laboratory tests) and findings in the medical history or in the pre-study assessments,
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, constitutes a risk or contraindication for
