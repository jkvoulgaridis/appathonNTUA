    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected for the duration of a subject’s participation in the study (up to 20 days). AE reporting began after parent/legally authorized representative (LAR) signed informed consent and if applicable, after participant signed assent. AEs are reported as pre-treatment and treatment-emergent.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs were obtained as solicited comments from the study participants and as observations by the Investigator as outlined in the study protocol.</desc>
