  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that has decreased or disappeared but may still be in the body (remission), and is
      at high risk for returning (relapse). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the anti-leukemic effects of nivolumab in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) who have achieved a 1st complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy and
      consolidation chemotherapy and have high risk for relapse, or have achieved a 2nd CR.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immunologic responses to nivolumab among patients with AML in CR status
      post standard chemotherapy.

      II. To determine whether response to nivolumab correlates with immunologic responses.

      III. To evaluate assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry as a
      predictor of response to immune therapy in treatment of AML and changes during the course of
      therapy with nivolumab.

      IV. To evaluate time to relapse and overall survival. V. To evaluate the toxicity profile of
      nivolumab among patients with AML in CR.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After cycle 6,
      patients may receive nivolumab on day 1 only. After cycle 12, patients may receive nivolumab
      on day 1 of every 3 cycles. Patients experiencing disease progression may go back to
      receiving treatment on days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
