  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The InterGraft™ Venous Anastomotic Connector provides a minimally invasive, sutureless method
      for attachment of an arteriovenous graft to a vein in the upper extremity. The InterGraft™
      Venous Anastomotic Connector facilitates creation of the arteriovenous graft connection to a
      vein in support of hemodialysis in subjects with End Stage Renal Disease. The InterGraft™
      Venous Anastomotic Connector is used together with conventional suturing of the arterial
      anastomosis to facilitate creation of an arteriovenous graft in support of hemodialysis in
      subjects with End Stage Renal Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The InterGraft™ Venous Anastomotic Connector (VIG) was developed for minimally invasive
      venous anastomosis of a standard hemodialysis graft. This study will evaluate the safety and
      performance of the VIG for anastomosis of a commercially available, 6 mm diameter, ePTFE
      hemodialysis graft. Anastomoses with the VIG may potentially reduce venous vessel trauma,
      improve the local vessel wall shear stresses and promote laminar flow, thereby improving
      patency. The available InterGraft™ Arterial Anastomotic Connector (AIG) will also be used
      during the study in a subgroup of suitably qualified subjects for purposes of additional data
      collection.

      While recognizing that a native fistula is the recommended access for hemodialysis, AV grafts
      remain a frequently used access type. This study focuses on subjects who have a failed
      fistula, cannot have a fistula or are better suited for an AV graft, as determined by the
      physician. The graft implant procedural outcomes, the number and type of major adverse
      events, and patency throughout a six (6) month follow-up period will be evaluated. The
      6-month patency rate will be compared with a pre-specified patency performance goal that is
      drawn from prior surgical AV graft literature and published performance standards.10, 14-20

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the Investigational Plan, Investigational
      Device Exemption (IDE) regulations, Good Clinical Practice guidelines (GCP), and other
      applicable regulatory requirements.

      This is a pivotal multicenter, prospective, non-randomized adaptive design study. The planned
      study enrollment is 104 evaluable subjects who require AV graft placement for hemodialysis
      and who meet the entry criteria. The subjects will receive the VIG device and will have
      either a standard sutured arterial anastomosis or have received an AIG device for the
      arterial anastomosis (VIG-AIG subgroup). This number may be expanded following a planned
      interim analysis to up to 185 evaluable subjects for the primary study evaluation.

      The study will allow for a maximum enrollment of 227 subjects, including a provision for 12
      subjects lost to follow-up and up to 30 roll-in cases. Roll-in subjects will not be included
      in the primary analysis but will be analyzed separately.

      The study will include up to 15 participating clinical centers. Study site investigators will
      be physicians skilled in AV access graft placement and interventional techniques. Study data
      will be collected up to the point at which each subject has completed the 6-month endpoint.

      VIG-AIG Subgroup All study subjects will receive the VIG device. A subgroup of previously
      enrolled subjects receiving the VIG device will also have received an AIG device for the
      arterial anastomosis, rather than a sutured arterial anastomosis. This group is referred to
      as the &quot;VIG-AIG Subgroup.&quot;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Subject requires the creation of a vascular access graft for hemodialysis, secondary
             to a diagnosis of End Stage Renal Disease.

          3. Subject is able to have the vascular access graft placed in an upper extremity.

          4. Baseline imaging shows suitable vascular anatomy/ vessel size for the InterGraft™
             Venous Connector and an artery at least 3.5 mm in diameter that is suitable for
             creating the arterial anastomosis.

          5. Subject has a reasonable expectation of remaining on hemodialysis for at least 6
             months.

          6. Subject or his/her legal guardian understands the study and is willing and able to
             comply with the dialysis schedule and follow-up requirements.

          7. Subject or his/her legal guardian provides written informed consent. NOTE: In
             accordance with the requirements of some Institutional Review Boards, where
             applicable, only those subjects with capacity to consent for themselves will be
             included. Thus, where required by the Institutional Review Board, adult individuals
             who lack capacity to consent for themselves will be excluded from the study.

          8. Physician's examination at time of surgery shows no significant vessel lesions,
             calcification(s), anatomic structures or abnormalities that may limit ability to
             safely deploy the InterGraft Connectors or create a sutured arterial anastomosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a documented and unsuccessfully treated ipsilateral central venous
             stenosis as determined by imaging.

          2. Subject currently has a known or suspected bacterial, fungal, or HIV infection. NOTE:
             Patients with hepatitis B or C may be included in the study.

          3. Subject has a known hypercoagulable or bleeding disorder or requires treatment with
             warfarin or heparin.

             NOTE: The intent of this criterion is to exclude patients with high risk for bleeding
             or clotting complications. As such, patients who are taking oral anticoagulants (blood
             thinners) including, but not limited to, Xarelto® (rivaroxaban) or Eliquis® (apixaban)
             should also be excluded from the study. Patients may receive anticoagulation therapy
             any time after the study AV graft implant procedure, at their physician's discretion.
             This should be driven by an indication unrelated to the vascular access.

          4. Subject has had a previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT-2)
             or has known sensitivity to heparin.

          5. Subject has co-morbid conditions that may limit their ability to comply with study and
             follow-up requirements.

          6. The patient has had &gt;2 previous arteriovenous accesses in treatment arm.

          7. Subject is currently taking Aggrenox®.

          8. Subject is in need of, or is scheduled for any major surgery within 30 days of the
             study procedure.

          9. Subject is currently taking maintenance immunosuppressant medication such as
             rapamycin, mycophenolate or mycophenolic acid, prednisone (&gt;10 mg), cyclosporine,
             tacrolimus or cyclophosphamide.

         10. Life expectancy is less than 12 months.

         11. Subject is pregnant. NOTE: A negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of the
             study procedure is required in all female subjects with reproductive capacity.

         12. Subject is a poor compliance risk (i.e. history of IV or oral drug abuse).

         13. The subject is enrolled in another dialysis or vascular investigational study.
