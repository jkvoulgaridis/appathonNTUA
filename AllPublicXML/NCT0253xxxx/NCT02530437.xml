  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IB/II trial studies the side effects of taladegib, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
      external beam radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer found only in the tissue or organ where it
      began, and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. Taladegib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells
      and shrink tumors. Giving Taladegib, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of taladegib administered orally daily concurrently with weekly
      paclitaxel, carboplatin and radiation therapy in patients with localized nuclear
      Glioma-Associated Oncogene Homolog (Gli-1) expressing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or
      gastroesophageal junction, which is referred to as EAC. (Phase IB) II. To assess the rate of
      pathologic complete response (pathCR) when taladegib is administered orally daily
      concurrently with weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation therapy in patients with
      localized nuclear Gli-1 expressing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal
      junction. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of biochemoradiation in the phase II study. II. To assess
      additional biomarkers (Hedgehog [Hh] related and Hh unrelated) in sequentially procured
      tissues (biopsies and resected specimens).

      III. Assess if taladegib down modulates its target (Gli-1) in the first cohort (where
      taladegib will be administered alone for the first 7 days) of the phase II study.

      IV. Assess relapse-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE IB: Patients receive taladegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-38, paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on the first radiation day of each week for 5 doses,
      carboplatin IV over 2 hours on the first radiation day of each week for 5 doses, and undergo
      external beam radiation therapy 5 days per week on 28 consecutive weekdays for 5.5 weeks.

      PHASE II: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 steps.

      STEP I: Patients receive taladegib PO for 7 days, followed by taladegib, paclitaxel,
      carboplatin, and external beam radiation therapy as in Phase IB.

      STEP II: Patients receive taladegib, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and external beam radiation
      therapy as in Phase IB.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months, every 3-6 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and at years 4 and 5.
