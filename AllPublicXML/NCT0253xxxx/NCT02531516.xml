  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if apalutamide plus gonadotropin releasing hormone
      (GnRH) agonist in participants with high-risk, localized or locally advanced prostate cancer
      receiving primary radiation therapy results in an improvement of metastasis-free survival.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of apalutamide plus
      GnRH agonist compared with GnRH agonist among participants with high-risk, localized or
      locally advanced prostate cancer receiving primary radiation therapy (RT). The study will
      include a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, a Posttreatment Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up
      Phase. Participants will either receive either apalutamide (experimental) or bicalutamide 50
      milligram (mg) capsule plus placebo as control group. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of an intact prostate, and 1 of the following
             at diagnosis: 1) Gleason score &gt;=8 and &gt;=cT2c, 2) Gleason score &gt;=7, PSA &gt;=20 nanogram
             per milliliters (ng/mL), and &gt;=cT2c

          -  Charlson index (CCI) &lt;=3

          -  An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) grade of 0 or 1

          -  Prior treatment with radiopharmaceutical agents (e.g., strontium-89) or immunotherapy
             (e.g., sipuleucel-T) for prostate cancer
