  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, including whole genome (WGS),
      exome (WES) and RNA sequencing has revolutionized the ability of investigators to query the
      molecular mechanisms underlying tumor formation. Through the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project
      (PCGP), investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) have successfully used
      NGS approaches to evaluate more than 1,000 pediatric cancers ranging from hematologic
      malignancies to central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors. From these and related
      studies, it has become clear that genomic approaches can accurately classify tumors into
      distinct pathologic and prognostic subtypes and detect alterations in cellular pathways that
      may serve as novel therapeutic targets. Collectively, these studies suggest that by
      characterizing the genomic make-up of individual tumors, investigators will be able to
      develop personalized and potentially more effective cancer treatments and/or preventive
      measures.

      This protocol was initially enacted to usher NGS approaches into routine clinical care.
      During the initial phase of the G4K protocol, 310 participants were recruited and enrolled
      onto the study. Tumor and/or germline sequencing was completed on all 310 patients, with 253
      somatic reports generated (representing 96% of the 263 participants for whom tumor tissue was
      available and analyzed) and 301 germline reports generated (100% of the 301 participants who
      agreed to the receipt of germline results). Analyses of the study data are ongoing with plans
      to prepare initial manuscripts within the next several months. Due to the successful initial
      execution of the G4K protocol, clinical genomic sequencing of tumor and germline samples is
      now offered as part of standard clinical care for pediatric oncology patients at St. Jude.

      The G4K protocol has now been revised. With the revision, the study team will record, store
      and analyze germline and tumor genomic information. Through the collection of these data, we
      will examine how germline mutations in 150 cancer predisposition genes influence clinical
      presentation, tumor histology, tumor genomic findings, response to therapy and long-term
      outcomes. The overall goals of this research are to further define the prevalence, spectrum
      and heritability of germline variants in these genes and to decipher how germline mutations
      influence the phenotypes of an expanding array of cancer predisposition syndromes. These
      studies allow us to provide more accurate genetic counseling and management strategies to
      future children harboring mutations in these genes.

      This remains a non-therapeutic study. Investigators anticipate a sample size of approximately
      5000 patients who will be recruited over the next 7 years.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To use clinical genomic sequencing to define the prevalence and spectrum of germline
           mutations in cancer predisposition genes in children with cancer.

        -  For those identified with germline mutations, to correlate germline genomic information
           with clinical presentation, tumor genomic findings, treatment response, and outcome.

      OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

        -  To generate and analyze data describing patient/parent perceptions of genomic
           investigations and research at various time points throughout the study.

        -  To generate and analyze data surrounding the return of genomic sequencing results,
           examine patient/parent understanding of these results and assess the impact of results
           on patients and families.

        -  To determine the feasibility and reliability of performing WES and RNA sequencing on
           derivatives from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples alongside the
           analysis of matched frozen tumor and germline samples.

      For participants who give consent, a normal tissue sample will be obtained and used for WGS,
      WES and RNA sequence analysis. A defined list of 150 genes will be analyzed for reporting
      using the normal tissue. Once the results of these analyses are available, they will be
      disclosed to physicians, patients and parents. Mixed measures approaches will be used to
      assess understanding, acceptance and impact of genomic results on patients and parents.
      During the course of the study, the investigators anticipate the list of genes to be reported
      using normal tissue to change due to advances in the literature or other evidence linking
      additional genes to tumor formation and cancer risk, and new lists may be defined.

      To assess provider, patient and family understanding and describe the impacts of genomic
      testing and return of results, this study will also incorporate administration of surveys and
      semi-structured interviews. Surveys and interviews are optional, but will be offered to all
      primary SJCRH providers, as well as all eligible participants and parents, regardless of
      whether or not they consent to pursue the genomic testing.

      A sample of blood or a skin biopsy will be obtained as a source of germline DNA. This sample
      is necessary as it is the comparator against which tumor samples are evaluated. Skin biopsies
      may be done on patients who have a diagnosis where peripheral blood is likely to be
      contaminated by tumor cells.
