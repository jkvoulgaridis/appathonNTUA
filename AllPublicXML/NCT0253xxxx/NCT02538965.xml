  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the activity of lenalidomide in the treatment of pediatric subjects with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (with second or greater relapse or
      refractory to at least 2 prior induction attempts) measured by morphological complete
      response defined as either a CR or CRi within the first 4 cycles of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2, Simon's Optimal two-stage design
      study, with an Optional Extension Phase (OEP), that will assess the activity, safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenalidomide in pediatric subjects from 1 to ≤ 18 years of age with
      second or greater Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (rrAML). A total of 43
      evaluable participants (18 participants in Stage 1 and an additional 25 participants in Stage
      2) are required for assessment of the primary endpoint. To allow for participants found to be
      unevaluable for the primary endpoint due to an incorrect diagnosis, not having a disease
      assessment post screening, or who discontinued prior to receiving lenalidomide, up to 4
      additional participants may be enrolled for a maximum of 47 evaluable subjects across
      approximately 70 sites. Approximately 50% of enrolled participants will be younger than 12
      years of age to provide adequate PK data for this age subset.

      If during Stage 1, at least 3 of 18 participants achieve a morphologic complete response
      (either CR or CRi) within the first 4 cycles of study treatment, then the study will proceed
      to Stage 2; otherwise, the study will be terminated. Similarly, if at the final analysis, at
      least 8 of 43 evaluable subjects across Stages 1 and 2 achieve a response (CR/CRi) within the
      first 4 cycles of study treatment, it will be concluded that lenalidomide has sufficient
      activity in pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to warrant subsequent study. The optional
      extension phase (OEP) will allow participants who demonstrate clinical benefit, as assessed
      by the Investigator at the completion of 12 cycles of lenalidomide therapy, to continue
      receiving oral lenalidomide until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation. In the
      OEP, only safety, dosing, concomitant medications/procedures, and second primary malignancies
      (SPMs) will be monitored.

    <description>The morphological complete response rate was defined as the total number of participants with morphological CR observed within the first 4 cycles of lenalidomide (regardless of whether the CR/CRi was observed at the end of Cycle 1, 2, 3 or 4) over the total number of participants evaluable for this endpoint. According to Modified IWG criteria, morphologic CR was defined as:
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/μL and platelets ≥ 100,000 without transfusions and/or exogenous growth factor support (i.e., no transfusion or exogenous growth factor within 7 days of assessment;
Bone marrow &lt; 5% blasts evidence of trilineage hematopoiesis;

A serious AE = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.3 and based on the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life threatening Grade 5 = Death.</description>

    <description>Acute graft versus host disease generally occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. The 3 main tissues that acute GVHD affects are the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Chronic GVHD is scored per the National Institute of Health consensus conference grading system. Clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD include skin involvement resembling lichen planus or the cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma; dry oral mucosa with ulcerations and sclerosis of the gastrointestinal tract; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration.</description>

                  to starting treatment with lenalidomide.

        NOTE: The pregnancy test 10 to 14 days prior to initiation of lenalidomide may be omitted,
        at the discretion of the investigator, for any FCCBP/FCBP who has high acuity disease
        requiring immediate treatment with lenalidomide. The pregnancy test within 24 hours prior
        to the first dose of lenalidomide is required to be performed.

        The participants may not received Investigational Product (IP) until the investigator has
        verified that the results of these pregnancy tests performed on Cycle 1 Day 1 are negative.
        FCCBP/FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly
        for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at
        study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and at Day 28 following IP discontinuation. If
        menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28
        days and then every 14 days while on study, at study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and

          5. Participants have had prior treatment with biologic antineoplastic agents less than 7
             days before the first dose of lenalidomide. For agents that have known adverse events
             (AEs) occurring beyond 7 days after administration (ie, monoclonal antibodies), this
             period must be extended beyond the time during which acute AEs are known to occur.

               -  Participants have any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
                  psychiatric illness that would prevent the participant from participating in the
                  study.

               -  Participants have any condition including the presence of laboratory
                  abnormalities, which places the participant at unacceptable risk if he/she were
                  to participate in the study.

               -  Participants have any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Morphologic Complete Response Within the First Four Cycles of Lenalidomide Treatment According to the Modified International Working Group (IWG) Criteria</title>
        <description>The morphological complete response rate was defined as the total number of participants with morphological CR observed within the first 4 cycles of lenalidomide (regardless of whether the CR/CRi was observed at the end of Cycle 1, 2, 3 or 4) over the total number of participants evaluable for this endpoint. According to Modified IWG criteria, morphologic CR was defined as:
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/μL and platelets ≥ 100,000 without transfusions and/or exogenous growth factor support (i.e., no transfusion or exogenous growth factor within 7 days of assessment;
Bone marrow &lt; 5% blasts evidence of trilineage hematopoiesis;
No evidence of extramedullary disease.
Morphologic CRi was defined as:
ANC &lt; 1000/μL and platelets &lt; 100,000/μL or &gt; 100,000/μL without platelet recovery (requiring transfusion within 7 days of assessment);

        <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of lenalidomide and within 28 days after the last dose. A serious AE = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.3 and based on the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life threatening Grade 5 = Death.</description>

        <description>Acute graft versus host disease generally occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. The 3 main tissues that acute GVHD affects are the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Chronic GVHD is scored per the National Institute of Health consensus conference grading system. Clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD include skin involvement resembling lichen planus or the cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma; dry oral mucosa with ulcerations and sclerosis of the gastrointestinal tract; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration.</description>
