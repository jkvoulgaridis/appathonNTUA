    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide
      works in treating patients with previously untreated, stage II-IV follicular lymphoma or
      marginal zone lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Biological therapies, such as
      lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving ibrutinib in
      combination with rituximab and lenalidomide may work better in treating follicular lymphoma
      or marginal zone lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab and lenalidomide in patients
      with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (determined by
      progression-free survival at 2 years).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab and lenalidomide in subjects
      with FL as assessed by complete response rate (CR) at 120 weeks, overall response rate (ORR),
      duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment
      (TTNT), and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib combined with rituximab and
      lenalidomide in previously untreated subjects with FL and marginal zone lymphoma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate prognostic and mechanistic biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21, rituximab intravenously (IV) over 4-6
      hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and day 1 of all subsequent cycles, and ibrutinib
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year and
      then every 24 weeks for 2 years.
