  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a an ancillary study designed to explore whether an additional cell signaling pathway
      (prenylation of Rap1) that was recently identified as being under beta-adrenergic control may
      be affected by beta-blocker use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept randomized controlled pilot study assessing whether prenylation
      and membrane localization of Rap1 in PBMCs can be altered in individuals undergoing
      autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) for Multiple Myeloma by administering a daily
      beta-blocker (propranolol) to 20 participants. Outcomes of patients on this clinical trial
      will be compared to 20 participants in a control arm.

    <description>Lab will draw one tube of blood to be stored in 8 mL Becton Dickinson (BD) Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tube (CPT) tubes at three study time points as described in Table 4.7b. These time points include baseline, Day -2 (immediately prior to transplant, central line placement, or administration of any conditioning regimen), and Day +28.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from the whole blood samples collected from patients at the three designated time points (Baseline, Day -2, and Day +28). The lab will conduct western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of isolated PBMCs to determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions, and the status of Rap1 prenylation in the cells.</description>

      conduct western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of isolated PBMCs to
      determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions, and the status of Rap1

        criteria are met:

          1. 18-75 years of age

          2. ≤ 1 year since initiation of systemic anti-myeloma therapy

          3. Patient is scheduled for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant as the upfront
             therapy for their multiple myeloma
