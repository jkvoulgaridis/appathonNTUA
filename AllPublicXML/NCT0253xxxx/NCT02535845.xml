  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV vaccine coverage among adolescents in the US is suboptimal. This is particularly true
      among traditionally underserved adolescents. Few parent-targeted interventions have focused
      on the parental decision-making process. Self-persuasion, generating one's own arguments for
      engaging in a behavior, may be an effective means to influence parents' motivation to
      vaccinate their children. In a three-phase study, investigators are using quantitative and
      qualitative research methods to develop and refine a tablet-based self-persuasion
      intervention for parents who are undecided about the HPV vaccine. This clinical trial
      submission focuses on the third phase of the study (the second stage is also registered in
      clinical trials).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that HPV vaccination is recommended for male and female adolescents, HPV
      vaccine coverage among adolescents age 13-17 is poor (60% for girls, 41.7% for boys).
      HPV-related cancers are a significant burden on the US healthcare system and could be
      prevented through adolescent vaccination. Rates of vaccination are suboptimal among
      underserved populations (uninsured, low-income, racial and ethnic minorities) often seen in
      safety-net clinics. Few interventions have been designed that target decision-making among
      parents of unvaccinated adolescents. Self-persuasion, generating of one's own arguments for a
      health behavior, may be an effective means of influencing HPV vaccination behaviors among
      undecided or ambivalent parents. Through three stages, investigators will identify and
      develop a self-persuasion intervention strategy to promote adolescent HPV vaccination in
      safety-net clinics. In Stage 3, reported here, investigators will conduct a two-arm pilot
      randomized control trial in the safety-net clinics to assess feasibility of testing the
      self-persuasion intervention condition against standard of care (control group).
      Investigators will also examine the impact of the intervention on parent-provider discussions
      about HPV vaccination.
