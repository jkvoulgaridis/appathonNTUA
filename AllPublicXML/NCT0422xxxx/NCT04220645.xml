  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will assess the effect of opportunistically treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection immediately when HCV-infected people who inject drugs are hospitalized for acute
      care in psychiatric, interdisciplinary specialized drug treatment or somatic wards. We will
      compare this approach with the current standard of care (SOC), which is referral to the
      outpatient clinic at the medical department following discharge.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to show that opportunistic and immediate administration of HCV
      treatment is more efficient compared to referral-based SOC. The specific objectives are: 1)
      to compare the intervention and SOC groups with regards to treatment completion, treatment
      uptake and virologic response ; 2) to assess the rate of reinfection after successful HCV
      treatment; and 3) to assess the frequency of resistant associated substitutions before and
      after virologic treatment failure.

      We will use a stepped wedge design and include patients in 7 clusters

      Following randomization of the cluster to the immediate treatment, physicians at the
      participating wards will be notified in writing that for the next time period patients
      diagnosed with HCV infection should be treated immediately. In addition, lectures presenting
      the opportunistic approach will be given and the Department of Microbiology will add a brief
      text to the result of HCV RNA testing reminding about the opportunistic approach. In the
      medical and the psychiatric departments, consultants from the departments of infectious
      diseases or gastroenterology will prescribe immediate treatment. In the departments that
      provide addiction treatment, local physicians will prescribe treatment. Treatment will be
      prescribed in accordance with current Norwegian treatment recommendations. The intensity of
      care after discharge will be individualized at the discretion of the treating physician.
