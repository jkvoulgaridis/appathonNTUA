  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of research is to determine of the prevalence of influenza virus and influenza
      vaccination coverage rate among hospital and GPs healthcare workers.

      Course of research:

      Participation in the study is voluntary and carried out after the consent of the examined
      person. The examination consists of: 1) completing the questionnaire and 2) taking the throat
      swab twice by the researcher. Two throat swab samples will be taken at the same time. Both
      samples will be used for virological examination to determine the presence of influenza virus
      material using non-invasive tests: one sample will be analyzed by a quick 'on-site' test -
      Flu SensDx kit, while the other sample will be transported to the laboratory, where the
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) - reference method - will be
      performed to confirm the presence of influenza genetic material. Swabs are planned to be
      collected during the 2019/2020 influenza epidemic season (January-March).

      In the last stage of the study, the results obtained from the survey questionnaire and the
      results of virological tests will be subject to statistical analysis and based on the data
      obtained, conclusions will be drawn from the study, indicating their practical application.

      The results obtained from this study will be used to develop a quality improvement program to
      control influenza virus infection, which will improve the safety of both patients and medical
      staff.
