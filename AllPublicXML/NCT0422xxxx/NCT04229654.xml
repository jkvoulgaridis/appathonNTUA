      To describe the knowledge, expectations, and perception of women towards the mid-trimester
      ultrasound scan to detect fetal anomalies in a Mexican population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two prenatal diagnostic centers located in
      Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. One was a university prenatal diagnostic center and the other
      a private one. The centers were purposively selected to represent different characteristics
      of the level of care and demographic characteristics. The research instrument was a 26-item
      questionnaire divided into three sections. The first section contained 12 questions designed
      to assess women's ideas about the purpose and limitations of the scan (yes/no). The second
      was on expectations before the scan while the third dealt on women´s perception of the fetus
      during the ultrasound examination. All women attending for a mid-trimester anomaly scan were
      invited to fill out the first two parts of a pretested structured questionnaire before the
      scan and after the ultrasound examination, the third part of the questionnaire concerning
      their experience of the scan session was completed and collected.

      Additionally, the questionnaire included demographic questions (age, parity, educational
      level, marital status). The source of the questionnaire items was interviews with experts.

      Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional review board. The anomaly
      scan was performed by fetal-maternal specialists between 18 and 24.6-week gestation.

      All data were recorded and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
      version 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were used for the
      sociodemographic data. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or
      Fisher exact test. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to
      delineate the factors associated with a higher knowledge level. A p-value &lt;0.05 was
      considered statistically significant.

    <description>Consisted of 12 items that asked about women´s to evaluate the background knowledge about the purpose and limitations of ultrasound anomaly scan. The first three items asked about the women's knowledge and worries about ultrasound and their understanding of the information provided for their attending physicians. The last 3 items were completed after the ultrasound examination, those items asked about opinions regarding the utility and relief of information provided. The correct answers from the other 6 items were summed to form a total score ranging from 0 to 6. The total scores were categorized into three groups: score 0-2 as poor, 3-4 as intermediate, and 5-6 as good.</description>

        The study population consisted of pregnant women of gestational age between 18 and 24.6
        weeks. Participants were recruited from two prenatal diagnostic centers located in the
        northern part of México. The centers were purposively selected to represent different
        characteristics of the level of care and demographic characteristics.

        This study was performed according to the standards of the Helsinki Declaration and
        approval was obtained from the ethics and educational issues coordinating committee of our
        University Hospital.
