  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test whether intensive training of finger individuation during the
      sensitive window of the subacute phases can lead to a clinically-meaningful recovery of
      dexterous movement in stroke patients.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Score at 1-3 days post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Single test pulses, conditioning pulses (five of each) and paired pulses (five pairs) at an inter-stimuli-interval (ISI) of 2 ms will be delivered to the motor cortex of both hemispheres.

The SICI will be measured as the reduction in conditioned MEPs relative to baseline MEPs. Higher SICI correlates with increased inhibitory activity of the motor cortex.</description>

    <description>The patient hand will be restrained to a robotic arm AMADEO(TM) which enables the measurement and manipulation of forces at each finger individually. After appropriate calibration, the force measurements obtained from the robot will be used to move a cursor on the screen. The patient will be rewarded visually and auditory when a higher degree of finger individuation will be measured. Specifically, when the applied force of the instructed fingers hit the predefined force target and at the same, the force in the non-instructed fingers stay as low as possible</description>

    <description>The patient hand will be restrained to a robotic arm AMADEO(TM) which enables the measurement and manipulation of forces at each finger individually. After appropriate calibration, the force measurements obtained from the robot will be used to move a cursor on the screen. The patient will be rewarded in a way that is unrelated to the degree of individuation. In other words, a successful trial considered when the applied force of the instructed fingers hits the predefined force target regardless of the force exerted in the non-instructed fingers.</description>
