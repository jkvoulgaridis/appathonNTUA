      Efficacy and Safety of Locoregional treatments Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor in Patients With
      Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary and ranked as the sixth most common
      neoplasm and the third leading cause of cancer death.

      Percutaneous ablation and TACE are the effective locoregional treatments for the patient with
      HCC. Moreover, some studies suggested that TACE combined with ablation could further improve
      the survival rate and reduce the post-operation complication.

      Although PD-1 inhibitor was approved by FDA for HCC, the latest RCT indicated that no
      significant difference was found in the ORR and PFS between the groups of PD-1 inhibitor and
      Sorafenib.

      Therefore, this study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation combined
      with simultaneous TACE plus PD-1 inhibitor for the non-resectable HCC.
