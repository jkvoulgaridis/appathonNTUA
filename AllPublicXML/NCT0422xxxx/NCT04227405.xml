  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study sought to evaluate an intervention to promote healthy couple relationships
      and economic stability and mobility for low-income couples living in Northern Virginia (VA)
      and Montgomery and Prince George's Counties (MD) by improving personal well-being, couple's
      relationships, parenting and co-parenting, financial literacy and capability, employability,
      job placement, and retention. The approach proposed integrated two components: (1) a 20-hour
      evidence-informed couple group workshop called TOGETHER that integrates relationship
      education and financial literacy skills, followed by an optional three-hour booster session
      three months after TOGETHER workshop (abbreviated version of TOGETHER workshop) and (2) case
      management (assessment of participant needs, development of Individual and Couple Development
      Plan (ICDP), referrals for social and mental health services, and referrals and coordination
      with job and career enhancement services, linking and coordination of all services as
      needed). The 20-hour workshop was offered in sessions of 2 1/2 hours each and facilitated by
      couple and financial experts working together in all the sessions. The workshop included
      presentation of concepts and skills, hands-on activities to practice skills, and homework.
      The facilitators completed fidelity forms, were observed by the curriculum developers, and
      were supervised biweekly by the curriculum developers. The project involved subcontracts with
      the University of Maryland, Family Services, Inc. (FSI), and The Skillsource Group, Inc. for
      the delivery of the TOGETHER program and case management and with the SkillSource Group, Inc.
      for job and career enhancement services. Workshops were conducted at Virginia Tech,
      University of Maryland, Family Services, Inc., and community organizations that offered
      space. In addition to service coordination, case managers incorporated the input of TOGETHER
      group facilitators and employment providers to develop Individual and Couple Development
      Plans (ICDPs) and assess progress toward meeting goals. The effectiveness of the program was
      evaluated through a randomized control trial in which half of the couples were randomly
      assigned to a control group and half of the couples were assigned to the intervention group.
      Couples in the control group received no intervention but a three-hour financial workshop
      after the last assessment was completed whereas the intervention couples participated in the
      20-hour interventions and received case management. An independent local evaluator (AVAR,
      Consulting) participated in the design, implementation, and most of the data analysis of the
      evaluation component. Participants had to be at least 18 years-old, having been living
      together for at least a year, and had no severe domestic violence issues, or untreated
      substance abuse or severe psychiatric disorders. If both partners were retired, couples were
      excluded from participation. After a brief phone screening, couples were invited to
      participate in an intake and enrollment meeting in which they were more thoroughly screened.
      After screening, couples were enrolled and randomly assigned by a computer generated system
      to either the intervention or control group. Couples in both groups completed three sets of
      self-report measures. The first one (pre-test) was completed on the day of the first workshop
      session or at intake for control couples, the second one was completed on the day of the day
      of hte last workshop session, or 8 weeks after the pre-test) for control couples, and the
      last one six months after the post-test for both intervention and control couples. After the
      six month follow-up assessment, participation in the program was concluded. Reimbursement to
      licensed child care providers that provided child care to participants' children was
      available. The study was largely funded by a Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood
      grant awarded by the Office of Family Assistance, Administration of Children and Families,
      U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from the beginning of the study until May 10,
      2018. As of May 10, 2018 the funding agency continued to fund the intervention component but
      data collection and analysis fro couples that had been randomized by May 10, 2018 and
      continued to receive services and to complete assessments were funded by Virginia Polytechnic
      Institute and State University. The study was expected to recruit 360 couples in the control
      group and 360 couples in the intervention group. However, due to the discontinuation of
      funding, 147 couples were enrolled for the control group and 145 couples were enrolled for
      the intervention group.

      The current project sought to promote healthy couple relationships and economic stability and
      mobility for low-income couples living in Northern Virginia (VA) and Montgomery and Prince
      George's Counties (MD) by improving personal well-being, couple's relationships, parenting
      and co-parenting, financial literacy and capability, employability, job placement, and
      retention.

      This project was funded in its entirety until May 10, 2018 by the Department of Health and
      Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Family
      Assistance (OFA) under the Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood (HMRF) program. After
      that date, the OFA continued to fund the intervention but not the local evaluation. Data
      collection and analysis from couples that had signed the consent form for participation in
      the project and had been randomized before May 10, 2018 The evaluation plan that included a
      randomized control trial and was approved of by OFA for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 until the
      local evaluation was discontinued by OFA included the enrollment of 720 couples, out of which
      360 couples would be randomly assigned to the intervention group and 360 couples to a control
      group.However, due to the unexpected termination of funding for the local evaluation, the
      program was evaluated with 292 couples (145 intervention group couples and 147 control group
      couples).

      This project was developed and conducted by Project Director, Mariana Falconier, Ph.D. at
      Virginia Tech and Associate Director, Jinhee Kim, Ph.D. at University of Maryland. Both
      universities collaborated for this project and University of Maryland was a subawardee of
      Virginia Tech. In addition, Virginia Tech subcontracted with SkillSource Group, Inc. for
      delivery of the intervention and University of Maryland contracted with Family Services, Inc.
      for delivery of Services. Services were delivered at Virginia Tech, Family Service Inc,
      University of Maryland, and in agencies in which we have agreements to use their space (City
      of Bowie in Bowie, MD and Ebenezer Baptist Church, Alexandria, VA) The funding agency
      required the grantee to have an independent local evaluator and for that purpose Virginia
      Tech contracted with AVAR Consulting, which was involved in the implementation and outcome
      evaluations until August 31, 2018.. Avar Consulting as well as Dr. Falconier and Dr. Kim will
      only used the database without participants' identifying information to conduct their outcome
      evaluations

      Our approach integrated two components (1) a 20-hour evidence-informed couple group program
      called TOGETHER workshop that integrates relationship education and financial literacy skills
      and (2) case management (assessment of participant needs, development of Individual and
      Couple Development Plan, referrals for social and mental health services, and referrals and
      coordination with job and career enhancement services, linking and coordination of all
      services as needed).

      The main goals of this project were to promote healthy couple relationships and economic
      stability and mobility for low-income couples in Northern Virginia, Prince George's County,
      MD, and Montgomery County, MD. The main objectives were: 1) improve personal well-being; 2)
      improve couple's relationship skills; 3) improve parenting and co-parenting; 4) improve
      financial literacy and capability; and 5) improve employability, job placement, and retention
      skills.

      Short-term outcomes of this project's core intervention were expected immediately after
      completion of the last session of the 20-hour relationship/financial education program
      (TOGETHER) whereas medium-term outcomes were anticipated six months after that last session.
      Expected measurable outcomes among program participants for objective 1 (improved personal
      well-being) included increased frequency of positive stress management, reduced psychological
      distress, decreased financial stress. Expected measurable outcomes for objective 2 (improved
      couple's relationship skills) included increased frequency of positive communication
      behaviors, increased frequency of positive conflict management behaviors, increased frequency
      of positive dyadic stress management, increased frequency of conjoint problem solving
      behaviors, increased satisfaction with couple's relationship, and increased comfort with
      financial styles and roles. Expected measurable outcomes for objective 3 (improved parenting
      and co-parenting) included increased frequency of positive parenting behaviors, increased
      closeness to children, and increased satisfaction with co-parenting. Expected measurable
      outcomes for objective 4 (improved financial literacy and capability) include increased
      financial literacy skills, increased financial self-efficacy, decreased use of alternative
      financial services, and increased financial management behaviors. Finally, expected
      measurable outcomes for objective 5 (improved employability, job placement, and retention)
      include decreased perceived barriers to employability, increased intentions and motivations
      for work, increased confidence in job skills, and increased employability, employment status,
      and retention. These outcomes were expected by comparing the intervention and control group
      outcomes in the RCT.

      TARGET POPULATION Low income couples in Northern Virginia (VA) and Prince George's County and
      Montgomery County, Maryland (MD). Even though the target population for this project was
      low-income couples, any couple that wanted to participate in the program was accepted as long
      as they met the eligibility criteria: residing in Northern Virginia and Prince George's
      County and Montgomery County in Maryland, married or cohabiting for at least a year, 18 years
      of age or older, and English-speaking. Exclusion criteria included both partners being
      retired, physical domestic violence (defined as behaviors that frighten, terrorize,
      manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, often injure, and sometime kill, a current or former
      intimate partner) or feeling unsafe with partner in the last six months, current diagnosis of
      a severe psychiatric disorder that required hospitalization in the last 12 months, cognitive
      impairment, or/and severe untreated substance abuse disorder. Couples could participate as
      long as both partners consent to be part of the program.

      RECRUITMENT Recruitment activities began on June 1, 2016. Activities included producing and
      distributing flyers, brochures, and posters and/or giving presentation in schools, churches,
      faith-based community centers, child support agencies, TANF offices, WIC agencies, Head Start
      programs, Healthy Start program, child welfare agencies, community centers, libraries,
      stores, barber shops, employment centers, Virginia Tech and University of Maryland clinics
      and cooperative extension centers, and community events. The Women's Center and Family
      Services Inc. concentrated on marketing and recruitment efforts from the network of providers
      and partner organization they were part of. In addition, the program was advertised through
      social media outlets that would be used for marketing and recruitment purposes and posting
      calendars with program activities. The program was also advertised through its own website
      (www.togetherprogram.org) and online ads.

      PROCEDURES

      DATABASES The funding agency OFA requires all HMRF grantees to enter information into a
      secure system called the Information, Family Outcomes, Reporting, and Management system
      (nFORM). The information requested to enter was about (a) program operations (e.g.,
      aggregated data without personally identifiable information on outreach and recruitment
      activities, enrollment numbers, staff qualifications and training, staff supervision and
      observation, and implementation challenges); (b) services (e.g., case management activities,
      workshop attendance, and referrals); (c) participants' contact information, demographics, and
      outcome measures. The funding agency also required the use of tablets for collecting data
      from participants. This tablet was also used to collect additional participants' outcome
      measures through Qualtrics (Please see section on measures) Besides nFORM and Qualtrics, two
      additional databases were used to collect information about participants and about program
      operations. One of them was called the Initial Contact and Screening (ICS) database and was
      used to collect contact information about potential participants and screen them to see if
      they met inclusion criteria before enrollment in the program. The section with identifying
      information such as participants' name, phone number or email address were stored separately
      from the answers to the screening questions. This ICS database was cleaned once a month so
      that all contact information was erased and only the number of participants that qualified or
      didn't qualify for the program could be counted. This system had proper encryption at log in
      and data collection pages. The second database was called Participant Tracking System (PTS).
      PTS was a secure system that was developed for the purposes of automated randomization,
      entering needs assessments and individual and couple development plans..

      INITIAL CONTACT AND SCREENING Individuals interested in participating in the program dialed a
      1-800-number or could visit the program at any of the program locations (Virginia Tech,
      University of Maryland, The Women's Center, and Family Services, Inc.). Program staff (a)
      collected contact information from the individual interested in participating, (b) described
      the program and the potential compensation, (c) asked for verbal consent to proceed with
      screening questions, and (d) performed a 10-minute inclusion screening process of the
      potential participant and his/her partner. The program staff spoke with each partner during
      the call or visit if both partners are available. Otherwise, the program staff collected
      information and screening information about both partners with the only partner that was
      present. All potential participants who were eligible after the initial screening and agreed
      to participate were scheduled for an Intake and Enrollment meeting with the case managers.
      The study procedures were described and additional information was sent upon request.
      Potential participants were offered the consent form for them to review prior to the Intake
      and Enrollment meeting, given either in person or mailed to them upon request. Potential
      participants who were interested enrolling in the Together Program had the option of
      completing the screening with an ICS staff member online as well. If potential participants
      chose to complete an online screening.

      INTAKE AND ENROLLMENT MEETING:

      Part I The first part of the Intake and Enrollment meeting lasted 60 minutes. During the
      meeting, the case manager (a) presented a detailed program description and obtain voluntary,
      informed written consent for program participation from both partners; (b) conducted a formal
      assessment of domestic violence with each partner individually for 10 minutes (see Domestic
      Violence Protocol section); (c) enrolled participants and collected contact information in
      nFORM; (d) assigned couples to intervention or control group through an automated system of
      randomization that uses only state of residence (Maryland or Virginia) (PTS); (f) provides
      orientation about program procedures (one orientation for intervention couples and one
      orientation for control couples, participants were given the &quot;Welcome Letter and Instructions
      for Intervention Couples&quot; or the &quot;Welcome Letter and Instructions for Control Couples&quot; and
      the &quot;Control Group Flowchart for Participants&quot; or &quot;Intervention Group Flowchart for
      Participants&quot;; (g) described participants with detailed explanation about payment procedures
      and VA and MD Tax requirements (providing VA and MD Tax requirements letters); and (h)
      directed and assisted intervention and control couples to complete applicant characteristics
      survey nFORM and demographic information survey in a tablet Part II The second part of the
      Intake and Enrollment meeting was different for intervention and control couples. For
      intervention couples (90 minutes) , the case manager (a) provided an in-depth description of
      the study procedure (this will be supported by presenting couples with The Intervention Group
      Flowchart for Participants to enhance understanding; (b) conducted a Needs Assessment in
      areas such as health care, employment, housing, childcare, education, legal barrier, income
      and financial, transportation, food, relationships, mental health, alcohol abuse, and
      substance abuse in order to determine which areas the couple needs support; (c) scheduled the
      individual and couple development plan (ICDP) meeting, progress meetings, and exit meeting as
      part of case management; (d) enrolled couple in the eight-week TOGETHER workshop (20 hours;
      at Virginia Tech, University of Maryland, The Women's Center Family Services, Inc. or
      designated agencies/schools/churches) and a booster session which occurred three months after
      the completion of the TOGETHER workshop (3 hours); and (e) described child care support and
      provided participants with the Child Care Support Letter. The Schedule for Intervention
      Couples did not only indicate when and where the scheduled meetings and workshops took place,
      but also included the incentives that couples could receive and the content of the meetings.
      All of these materials were included in the attachments. For intervention couples that did
      not wish to stay for the 90 minutes of the second part of the Intake and Enrollment meeting,
      the case manager offered to conduct the Needs Assessment by phone with both partners at a
      later time that was agreed upon this meeting. At the end of the meeting the couples were
      compensated gift cards for participating in the Needs Assessment. During part II for control
      couples, (90 minutes), the case manager (a) provided a detailed description of the procedure
      for control group (this was supported by presenting couples with The Control Group Flowchart
      for Participants to enhance understanding); (b) oversaw and assisted couples complete
      pre-test surveys including the Pre-Program Survey (nFORM) and Pre-test Assessment (Qualtrics)
      (both surveys combined took about 90 minutes; (d) scheduled the couple for their post-test
      assessment meeting (in 8 weeks) and financial workshop/follow-up assessment (six months from
      the date of the post-test assessment meeting months). In the event that control couples could
      not stay for this second part of the Intake and Enrollment meeting, they were be offered the
      possibility of completing the pre-program survey nForm and pre-test assessment in paper
      format. If the couple chose to complete the survey and assessment in paper, they were
      provided the questionnaires, the instructions to complete the questionnaire, and a
      self-addressed envelope to mail the questionnaires.

      CONTROL COUPLES: Control Couples: Post-Test Assessment Meeting Eight weeks after the Intake
      and Enrollment meeting, control couples would return to one of the program locations to meet
      with the case manager, and complete the Post Program Survey in nFORM and the Post-test
      Assessment in Qualtrics (both surveys combined would take about 90 minutes). Couples were
      reminded about Financial Literacy Workshop (FLW) and follow-up assessment date. For couples
      that could attend the meeting in person, the questionnaires were mailed to them with
      instructions on how to complete them and return them to the program in a self-addressed
      envelope included in the package.

      CONTROL COUPLES: FOLLOW-UP SURVEY/FINANCIAL LITERACY WORKSHOP Six months after control
      couples were invited to come 90 minutes before the Financial Literacy Workshop that would
      offered for them. Trained program staff would provide tablets for these couples to complete
      the follow-up survey in Qualtrics before the beginning of the workshop. Completion of
      follow-up survey would take about 90 minutes. The trained program staff would provide the
      couple their compensation in gift cards for assessments and will ask partners to sign the
      Gift Card Receipt Form. After the participants completed the follow-up survey, they were
      invited to attend a three-hour Financial Literacy Workshop (FLW), led by workshop
      facilitators. FLW was a three-hour financial management class to improve financial management
      knowledge and skills based on Money Smart curriculum by the Federal Deposit Insurance
      Corporation. For couples that could attend the meeting in person, the questionnaires were
      mailed to them with instructions on how to complete them and return them to the program in a
      self-addressed envelope included in the package. Couples could also choose to complete the
      follow-up survey online in which case program staff emailed to each partner the link and
      their individual passcode.

      INTERVENTION COUPLES

        1. TOGETHER WORKSHOP TOGETHER workshop is a 20-hour psycho-educational program for couples
           that supports the personal well-being, couple relationship, parenting, and financial
           literacy and management. TOGETHER was developed by Dr. Mariana Falconier (PI) and the
           late Dr. Hayhoe as part of the emerging interdisciplinary field that integrates
           relationship education with financial education (Falconier, 2015). TOGETHER adapted the
           Couples' Coping Enhancement Training (CCET) program developed by Dr. Guy Bodenmann
           (Bodenmann, 1997) and whose effectiveness in improving stress management, communication,
           and relationship satisfaction has been supported in various studies (e.g., Bodenmann &amp;
           Shantinath, 2004) to financially distressed couples by applying CCET content to
           financial issues and incorporating financial education. The workshop aims at reducing
           financial stress and improving relationship functioning by providing couples with
           knowledge and skills on stress management, communication, conflict resolution and
           management, problem-solving, and financial management. The TOGETHER workshop has 9
           modules and is designed to be delivered in groups of four to eight couples for 20 hours:
           8 weekly sessions of 2.5 hours each. Each session is co-led by two facilitators: a
           financial counselor and a couples therapist. Each session includes a warm-up activity,
           brief review of past session content and homework, presentation and practice of new
           content, summary of all contents covered in the session, and assignment of new homework.
           After each session, couples are assigned homework so that the skills learned in the
           session can be practiced between sessions. The TOGETHER curriculum has been pilot tested
           and results have been published in 2015 in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy.
           Below is a list of the introduction and the 9 modules.

           Introduction to program Module 1: Understanding Stress and Money Stress Module 2:
           Managing* Stress and Money Stress by Yourself Module 3: Communicating Stress and Money
           Stress to Your Partner Module 4: Managing Stress and Money Stress with Your Partner
           Module 5: Communicating Effectively and Learning to Talk about Money Raise awareness
           about the Module 6: Clarifying Financial Roles and Expectations Module 7: Improving
           Money Management Skills Module 8: Credit and Risk Management Module 9: Improving
           Financial Problem-Solving Skills A total of 30 workshops were offered between July 1,
           2016 and May 10, 2018. Out of the 145 couples assigned to the intervention group, 106
           couples started the workshop. The rest of the couples could not attend any of the
           available workshops due to schedule conflicts. As noted earlier, the workshop was
           offered in eight sessions (2 hours and 30 minutes each) scheduled on the same day of the
           week and at the same time. At the end of each session participants completed a 2
           minute-session evaluation and a 2-minute homework evaluation. In the last session they
           completed a 5 minute session evaluation+overall workshop evaluation within the session.
           At the first TOGETHER session, couples will completed the Pre Program Survey (nFORM) and
           the Pre-test Assessment (Qualtrics) before the session began. Completion of the Pre
           Program Survey and Pre-test Assessment took about 90 minutes. For participants both
           surveys was collectively referred to as &quot;Pre-Test Survey&quot;. Partners were instructed to
           complete these surveys in tablets provided by the group facilitators. TOGETHER session
           facilitators oversaw the completion of the Pre-Test Survey. Participants that failed to
           attend the first session of the TOGETHER workshop were mailed the Pre-Test Survey for
           their completion. After the last (eighth) TOGETHER session, couples completed on site
           the Post Program Survey (nFORM) and the Post-test Assessment (Qualtrics). Surveys took
           about 90 minutes. Participants knew these surveys as Post-Test Surveys and completed
           them in the tables. TOGETHER session facilitators oversaw the completion of the
           Post-Test survey. Participants that failed to attend the eight session of the TOGETHER
           workshop were mailed the questionnaires with instructions on how to complete them and

        2. CASE MANAGEMENT

      2. 1. Individual and Couple Development Plan (ICDP) Meeting: One week after the first
      workshop session, intervention couples partook in an ICDP meeting with the assigned case
      manager at VT, FSI, UMD, or designated locations for 90 minutes. Based on the information
      collected in the Needs Assessment during the IE meeting, the case manager created an ICDP
      with the couple that included (a) setting individual and couple goals; (b) agreeing on action
      steps and establishing a realistic timeline to meet those goals; (c) discussing possible
      barriers participants might encounter; (d) providing referrals as part of the action steps to
      meet their goals (i.e., housing, TANF, health care, child welfare, child support services,
      mental health services, and job and career enhancement services).. At the end of this meeting
      participants were reminded of all of their scheduled appointments. If the ICDP included a
      goal within the area of employment/career a first meeting would be scheduled for the partner
      in need of those services with an employment case manager to receive services at either the
      SkillSource Group, Inc. or a federally funded employment agency in Maryland. In addition, the
      participant was invited to sign a release to exchange information between the employment
      agency and our program so that information could be exchanged with the employment agency
      regarding information collected by our program (Couple's Needs Assessment and the ICDP) and
      the employment agency (employment/career services recommended and received, the participant's
      eligibility for those services, and the Employment Individual Plan). The present study
      provided funding for (a) employment services for those participants that did not meet
      eligibility criteria to receive services funded through the Workforce Innovation and
      Opportunity Act (WIOA) or other state and local funding in those agencies and (b) for
      reporting all the employment/career services that participants referred from our program were
      recommended (Individual Employment Plan) and actually received (Employment Services and
      Trainings Tracking Form) in such agencies. Since this study targeted the low-income
      population, it was expected that most participants would meet eligibility criteria to receive
      services in those agencies funded through WIOA or state or local programs and not through
      this study.

      2. 2. Progress Meetings and Exit Meeting Five weeks after the ICDP meeting, intervention
      couples met with the case manager for their first of five progress meetings (approximately
      five weeks between each progress meeting). At each meeting, the case manager (a) checked
      progress towards goals established in the ICDP, (b) updated the ICDP if necessary, (c)
      addressed barriers towards meeting ICDP goals, (d) checked safety (e.g., presence of domestic
      violence), and (e) addressed any program issues (e.g., attendance to employment trainings,
      Two of these meetings were in person and three over the phone and each of them lasted around
      30 minutes and will require the presence of both partners. However, the two in-person
      meetings were conducted over the phone as well if the couple was unable to attend the
      meetings in person. Couples had a final meeting with the case manager 6 months after the last
      TOGETHER session, which was approximately five weeks after the fifth case management progress
      meeting. At this exit meeting, the case manager (a) made with the couple a final progress
      assessment toward the goals established by the ICDP, (b) discussed with the couple their plan
      for continue working towards the ICDP goals, (c) invited the couple to complete the follow-up
      survey in the tablets, (d) provided information about the TOGETHER program's Facebook group,
      and (e) presented the couple with a termination/graduation letter. If one or both partners
      could not attend the meeting in person, the six-month follow-up survey was mailed to them If
      the couple chose to complete this survey online,

      3. INCENTIVES FOR WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE At the third progress meeting, case managers provided
      the attendance incentives for the TOGETHER workshop.

      4. BOOSTER SESSION Intervention couples were invited to an optional 3- hour booster session
      three months after completing the last session of TOGETHER workshop. These booster session
      included up to 16 couples and was be co-led by a UMD or VT marriage and family therapy intern
      and a UMD or VT extension specialist. It offered an abbreviated version of the contents
      covered in the 20-hour TOGETHER workshop.

      5. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE All the program staff that interacted with program participants received
      a three-hour training to learn to identify, assess, and response to situations of domestic
      violence. A pre-screening for domestic violence took place in the ICS stage before
      participants were enrolled in the program. Then, later, after enrollment but before
      randomization and entering participants' information into the nFORM a structured screening
      for domestic violence took place so that cases of domestic violence could be referred to
      appropriate services and participation in the program was discontinued. This structured
      screening involved an individual 10-minute meeting with each partner, during which each were
      asked questions about any incidents of physical, sexual and/or psychological violence that
      had occurred in their relationship. Each partner was asked about whether or not they felt
      threatened by their partner, and whether or not they feel safe in participating in the
      program with their partner. Additionally, each partner was asked about his/her willingness to
      commit to safety and no violence, and his/her willingness to learn strategies to de-escalate
      conflict between them in a safe way. Based on the participants' responses, a determination
      was made regarding the couples' participation in the program. If both partners provided
      responses that indicated a lower risk for domestic violence, then the decision was made that
      they could continue participating in the program with no referral for additional services to
      directly address domestic violence. However, if either partner provided responses indicating
      the presence of domestic violence in the current relationship, describing minor domestic
      violence, including pushing, shoving, infrequent domestic violence, and/or incidents which
      occurred more than one year ago and no weapons in the home, the decision was made that the
      couple may participate in the program, and they would be referred to services that directly
      address domestic violence. This decision was made if both partners also indicated a
      commitment to no violence and both felt safe participating in the program with each other.

      Request to discontinue participation in the program and referral to domestic violence
      services could also occur at any point in the participation in the TOGETHER program beyond
      the initial structured screening at the Intake and Enrollment meeting in the presence of
      domestic violence.

      6. PROGRAM TERMINATION Individuals terminated their participation in the program six months
      after the second assessment, which took place at the exit meeting (intervention couples) or
      before the financial workshop (control group). They could also drop out of the program or be
      asked not to participate in the presence of domestic violence or untreated substance abuse or
      serious psychiatric disorder.

      7. FIDELITY Fidelity to Curriculum: Facilitators received a 25 hour training in the program,
      out of which 17 hours focused on the curriculum. In addition they were required to attend a
      biweekly one-hour group supervision with the developers of the curriculum, were observed at
      least once by the developers of the curriculum, and on the third session by the local
      evaluators staff. In addition facilitators completed jointly a checklist to report on the
      extent to which they completed the scheduled activities, met all session objectives, used all
      materials as outlined in the manual, and spent the time as planned.

      Fidelity to case management procedures: A checklist was developed to assess the extent to
      which case managers were implementing the case management protocol.
