    <measure>Absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and scaling on a scale range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked), together with the percentage (%) of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

    <description>DLQI is a questionnaire which is to evaluate the impact on participant's quality of life due to psoriasis. It is composed of ten items related to symptoms, feelings, daily activities, leisure, working or studying activities, personal relationships and opinions about dermatological treatment. Each item is scored from 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The DLQI score is the sum of the 10 individual question scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The DLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30.</description>

    <description>Skindex is the best dermatological instruments to measure dermatology-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The 16-item Skindex questionnaire is divided into three domains: questions related to the participant's symptoms (1- 4), emotions (5 -11), and functioning (12-16). Each question asks the participant to quantify how much a specific aspect of their skin condition bothered them in the week prior to administration of the Skindex-16. The questions are answered on a scale from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered) with a total possible score ranging from 0 (best HRQoL) to 96 (worst HRQoL). Each item is then transformed to a linear scale from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>The WPAI questionnaire is an instrument to measure impairments in both paid work and unpaid work. The WPAI questionnaire consists of 6 questions that are used to assess: 1-employment status (yes/no), 2- work time missed due to Psoriasis (hours), 3-work time missed due to other reasons (hours), 4-actual work time (hours), 5-the impact of Psoriasis on work productivity while at work (0:10 point scale), and 6-the impact of Psoriasis on activities outside of work (0:10 point scale) for the 7 days prior to questionnaire completion. Four scores are derived from the questions: percent absenteeism (work time missed), percent presenteeism (impairment at work), percent work productivity loss (overall work impairment due to absenteeism and presenteeism), and percent activity impairment (activities performed outside of work). Higher scores indicate a higher level of impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM is a 14-item self-reported generic instrument designed to measure participant satisfaction with medication treatment. The 4 scales of the TSQM include the Effectiveness subscale, the Side Effects subscale (items 4-8), the Convenience subscale (items 9-11), and the Global Satisfaction subscale (items 12-14). The last subscale is regarded both in concept and in research as a superordinate, second-order global factor encompassing the other 3 more specific domains of medication experiences. Responses are obtained on a 5-point or a 7-point Likert scale (range, 1 extremely dissatisfied'' to 7 extremely satisfied'') for all but 1 item that has a yes-no response option. The subscale scores are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain. Regarding the Side Effects subscale, when the participant answers no'' to experiencing side effects (item 4), this subscale is scored as 100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Score Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 1 in the Absolute Patient Benefit Index (PBI) Score at Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire of 23 items on participant-relevant therapy needs and benefits. The first part of the instrument, the Participant Needs Questionnaire (PNQ), is filled in by the participant before therapy. A five- step Likert scale (0 = not important at all to 4 = very important) records the individual relevance of the different items to the participant. The second part, the Participant Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ), is filled in by the participants during or after therapy. It comprises the same items as the PNQ, but in contrast, the participants evaluate the extent to which the treatment needs have been fulfilled by therapy (scaled from 0 = treatment did not help at all to 4 = treatment helped a lot). In addition, the Likert scale contains the option does not apply to me in the PNQ and the option did not apply to me in the PBQ. This questionnaire score ranges from 0 = no benefit to 4 = maximal benefit. A PBI value of &gt;=1 is considered as relevant benefit.</description>
