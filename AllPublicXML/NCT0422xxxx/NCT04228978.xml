  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROVE Trial is a randomized clinical trial that will determine whether a weight loss
      intervention combined with walking exercise achieves greater improvement or less decline in
      six-minute walk distance at 12 month follow-up than walking exercise alone in people with PAD
      and BMI&gt;28 kg/m2. The intervention uses a Group Mediated Cognitive Behavioral framework,
      connective mobile technology, remote monitoring by a coach, and a calorie restricted Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-derived Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart
      Health (OMNIHeart) diet.

      212 participants with PAD and BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2 will be randomized to one of two groups: weight
      loss + exercise (WL+EX) vs. exercise alone (EX). Participants will be randomized at
      Northwestern, Tulane University, and University of Minnesota. Our primary outcome is change
      in six-minute walk distance at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are change in 6-minute
      walk distance at 6-month follow-up and change in exercise adherence, physical activity,
      patient-reported walking ability (measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ)
      distance score), and mobility (measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System [PROMIS] mobility questionnaire) at 12-month follow-up. Tertiary outcomes
      are perceived exertional effort (measured by the Borg scale at the end of the 6-minute walk
      at 12-month follow-up), and diet quality. Exploratory outcomes consist of change in the short
      physical performance battery (SPPB), the WIQ stair climbing and walking speed scores, and
      calf muscle biopsy measures at 12-month follow-up. Study investigators will perform calf
      muscle biopsies in 50 participants to compare changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and
      activity, capillary density, and inflammation between WL+EX vs. EX.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of PAD

          -  BMI&gt; 28 kg/m2

          -  Age 18 to 85 The diagnosis of PAD will be based on the following. First, an ankle
             brachial index (ABI) value &lt; 0.90, which is a well-accepted standard for diagnosing
             PAD. Second, people with an ABI of &gt;0.90 and &lt;1.00 who experience a 20% ankle systolic
             pressure drop after the heel-rise test will also be included. Third, potential
             participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who provide angiographic evidence of PAD or proof of
             prior lower extremity revascularization will be included, only if they are symptomatic
             or have a positive heel rise test. A positive heel rise test is defined as a 20% ankle
             systolic pressure drop after the heel rise test. The heel rise test consists of 50
             heel rises at a rate of one per second. Study investigators will use the BMI inclusion
             criterion of &gt; 28 kg/m2 because overweight and obesity are defined as a BMI of 25 to
             29 kg/m2 and &gt; 30 kg/m2, respectively, and because in our PAD cohorts, those with BMI
             &gt; 28 kg/m2 have significantly greater functional impairment and faster functional
             decline than those with BMI of 20-28 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, wheelchair confinement, or
             foot ulcer

          2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD.

          3. Failure to complete the 1-week run-in.

          4. Major surgery, coronary or leg revascularization in the past 3 months or anticipated
             in the next year.

          5. Major medical illness including lung disease requiring oxygen or life-threatening
             illness, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy less
             than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [Note:
             potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage
             cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent.

          6. Mini-Mental Status Examination score &lt; 23, dementia, psychiatric illness, substance
             abuse.

          7. BMI &gt; 45 kg/m2

          8. History of an eating disorder or any weight loss treatment in the past 6 months.
             Weight loss treatment includes weight watchers, any history of weight loss surgery,
             and using weight loss medications now or in the past six months.

          9. Gained or lost more than 15 pounds in the past six months

         10. Potential participants unwilling/unable to use a smart phone and unwilling to attend
             weekly study sessions.

         11. Excessive alcohol use, defined as &gt;14 drinks/week in men and &gt; 10 alcoholic
             drinks/week in women.

         12. Age &gt; 85 years

         13. Current ulcer on bottom of foot

         14. Current participation in supervised treadmill exercise, participation in supervised
             treadmill exercise in the past six months, or planning to participate in supervised
             treadmill exercise in the next year

         15. Increase in angina or angina at rest. Potential participants may become eligible
             following an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of an
             absence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician.

         16. Non-English speaking

         17. Visual impairment that limits walking ability

         18. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level comparable to the amount of
             exercise prescribed in the intervention

         19. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.
             [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will
             become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy
             study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention
             administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or
             gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as
             long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.]

         20. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant
