      This pilot study employed a pretest-posttest design to assess the feasibility and efficacy of
      the Raising Well at Home pilot intervention delivered by peer coaches on weight
      (caregiver/child), behaviors (eating, walking), and the home environment. The Raising Well at
      Home intervention was delivered via home visits with additional support via text or phone
      over 6 months, beginning after completion of the baseline assessment. This study was
      implemented in partnership with the parent Raising Well programs located in three states:
      Florida, Louisiana, and Missouri. The caregiver and the child's height and weight were
      measured by trained staff in the home with the same scale and stadiometer at the pre- and
      post-intervention time points. Measures were completed on a paper survey with the same
      caregiver pre and post intervention delivery.

    <description>The Raising Well at Home intervention was delivered via 3 core home visits designed to be delivered every 4-6 weeks, with additional support via text or phone over 6 months. The home visits were designed to engage the whole family, build skills, and promote changes in the home environment to support lifestyle behavior change. These essential behaviors focused on reducing sugary beverage intake, promoting appropriate portion sizes, improving fruit and vegetable intake, increasing walking and reducing screen time/sedentary activity.</description>
