  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if preoperative temperament is associated with
      postoperative pain, emergence agitation, emotional and behavioral changes, and overall parent
      satisfaction. This is a prospective observational study to assess preoperative temperament in
      pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, gather demographic data,
      intraoperative data regarding surgical and anesthetic technique, and collect immediate
      postoperative data to assess pain, emergence agitation (EA), parental satisfaction as well as
      remote postoperative data to assess emotional and behavior changes. These data will be used
      to determine if patients with a specific temperament profile are more likely to experience
      increased pain, emergence agitation, emotional changes, and behavioral disturbances
      postoperatively.

    <measure>Temperament</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative period</time_frame>
    <description>Patient temperament based on the Children's Behavior Questionnaire. This is a 36 question temperament inventory completed by the caregiver. Items are scored on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is &quot;extremely untrue&quot; and 7 is &quot;extremely true&quot;. Total scores are linked to temperament constructs of Surgency, Negative Affectivity, and Effortful Control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post operative period</time_frame>
    <description>Pain behavior to be recorded using numerical rating scale (NRS), FLACC scale or Wong Baker Faces scale as appropriate for age and developmental status. All of these scales are scored from 1-10 where higher scores indicate more pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>emergence agitation</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post operative period</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Pediatric Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED). Scored on a scale from 0-4 where total scores of 10 or greater at any time during Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) stay are classified as experiencing agitation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>post hospital behavior changes</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Post Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire. Questions are answered on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is less than before and 5 is more than before. Adverse behavioral outcomes to be defined as those patients who experienced behavioral changes at one or more standard deviations above the sample mean.</description>
