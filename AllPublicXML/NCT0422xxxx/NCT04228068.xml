  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a major health problem facing older adults. Hip fractures result in higher
      mortality, morbidity, and costs than all other osteoporotic fractures combined. When
      returning home following hip fracture surgery, patients are at high risk of adverse outcomes
      (e.g., secondary fractures, institutionalisation, and death).

      Objectives: This study aims to finalize and pilot test a new program of care including a
      user-friendly toolkit containing a home-based physiotherapy exercise and pain management
      program to help community-dwelling older adults recover after hip fractures.

      Methods: This study will be two stages: First, finalizing the program. The investigators have
      created a self-explanatory toolkit that includes an illustrated exercise program based on a
      critical analysis of previous programs for hip fracture patients. The investigators will
      organize focus groups and conduct semi-structured interviews with patients, caregivers,
      policymakers, and healthcare providers to review the program and provide feedback.

      Second, conducting a feasibility study. The investigators will pilot the program in a
      randomized trial with forty community-dwelling hip fracture patients and compare the
      intervention with conventional care.

      Expected Outcomes: While the number of hip fracture survivors is increasing, they are
      becoming frailer, and their functional recovery has not improved, making this study timely
      and relevant. With the current focus on helping older adults &quot;age in place,&quot; the proposed
      project addresses a vital health system challenge: helping older hip fracture patients access
      proper rehabilitation, so they can stay independent in their homes.

    <description>The Lower Extremity Functional Scale is a patient-reported outcome measure that consists of 20 items. psychometric properties have been tested and established for different populations including patients after hip surgeries and lower extremity conditions. Score range is 0-80 with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (before discharge), to 12 weeks weeks post discharge to home</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB uses three tests to examine lower extremity physical performance: standing balance, gait speed, and chair-rising tests, and the total score is the sum of the three tests (0-12), with higher scores reflecting better physical function.</description>

    <description>The exercise program will be for the first 12 weeks after returning home. The intervention will be provided after patients return home. Each patient will receive 7 home visits in total over the intervention period by a physiotherapist (PT) and/or a physiotherapy assistant (PTA). Participants in the intervention group will receive a copy of the Toolkit before discharge from the hospital, and the study coordinator will walk them through it and explain what should be expected during the intervention period.</description>

    <description>PT visits (two visits): The first visit will happen within a week of discharge. During this visit, the PT will assess participants, tailor the program to their needs, and coach them in carrying out the exercises at home. The last visit will be 12 weeks after the first. During this visit, the PT will reassess the participants and make adjustments to the program. The participants will be encouraged to continue exercising beyond the 12 weeks.
The PTA will visit the participants' homes with the PT and will conduct additional solo visits every other week (i.e. 7 PTA visits in total, in 1st week and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks). The PTA will facilitate and progress the exercise program as prescribed and directed by the PT and help in delivering the education component of the program.</description>
