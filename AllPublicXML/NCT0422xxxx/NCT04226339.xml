    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a treatment for advanced femoro-tibial osteoarthritis. This
      surgery is justified in case of significant discomfort and failure of medical treatment.

      The functional results of TKA are good with a recovery of 6 months - 1 year. Nevertheless,
      very few patients forget their prostheses. A United Kingdom study assessed patient
      satisfaction in a cohort of 10,000 patients more than one year after TKA: nearly 20% were not
      satisfied with their TKA.

      The knee is indeed a complex articulation that works differently in the three space plans.
      Current knee prostheses are trying to replicate this biomechanics and get as close as
      possible to the anatomy of a native knee.

      Bellemans et al. found in 250 asymptomatic patients 32% of men with a constitutional varus
      greater than 3 ° and 17% of women. Restoration of normal knee function can also be achieved
      by restoring a moderate constitutional deformity present preoperatively. The objective of the
      femorotibial alignment was dogmatically fixed at 180° (mechanical femorotibial alignment). In
      recent years, some surgical teams have attempted to reproduce the preoperative constitutional
      deformity in varus or valgus with the prosthesis. This femorotibial alignment is called
      kinematic alignment. This kinematic alignment has already been studied in several randomized
      studies and has demonstrated improved functional scores. However, these studies focused on
      specific TKA, which are posterior cruciate TKA, and the assessment was subjective through
      functional scores. In addition, these TKA were often made with patient specific
      instrumentation (PSI). Some studies have evaluated walking kinematics after TKA with
      kinematic alignment. But it was again TKA retaining the posterior cruciate ligament.

      The investigators would like to prospectively evaluate the restoration of the medially
      stabilized TKA walking kinematics (medial-stable TKA or ball in socket stability) implanted
      with a kinematic alignment compared to a mechanical alignment.
