  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical procedures are routinely performed as an alternative to continuous positive airway
      pressure treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the response to
      surgery is often variable. Instability of the respiratory control during sleep (or high loop
      gain) has been associated with poor surgical results in previous research. Acetazolamide
      (AZM), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has shown potential in reducing loop gain without
      affecting other physiological OSA traits. In this protocol the investigators will evaluate
      the clinical efficacy of AZM add-on therapy to surgical procedures in patients with OSA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-four patients with diagnosed moderate to severe OSA will be equally (1:1) randomized
      to AZM (250 mg twice daily) or placebo add-on therapy after surgery. Two surgical procedures
      will be performed throughout the study: barbed reposition pharyngoplasty (BRP) and upper
      airway stimulation (UAS) using electrical neurostimulation of the hypoglossal nerve.

      Treatment allocation will occur after a satisfactory recovery in patients undergoing BRP and
      after titration of the device settings in patients treated with UAS. Treatment outcome will
      be assessed approximately 10 weeks thereafter by in-laboratory polysomnography. Two on-site
      follow-up visits will be scheduled to assess adherence and adverse events. The maximum
      treatment duration per participant will amount to 16 weeks.

      Besides the aforementioned core clinical part, the study protocol will also include an
      optional exploratory part prior to surgery, assessing the physiological OSA traits and
      airflow features by means of polysomnography and drug-induced sleep endoscopy research
      measurements.

    <measure>Changes in daytime sleepiness measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of add-on therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire asks subjects to rate their probability of falling asleep on a scale from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people encounter in their daily lives. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number (0-24). An ESS score higher than 10 indicates the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Changes in sleep-related quality of life measured with the Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of add-on therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is an abbreviated version of the original 30-item version. The FOSQ-10 consists of 10 items that are distributed among 5 subscales: general productivity (2 items), activity level (3 items), vigilance (3 items), social outcomes (1 item), and intimacy and sexual relationships (1 item). The questionnaire has a 4-point scale. The total score is calculated as the sum of the subscale means and can range from 5 to 20. The minimal important difference ranges from 1.7 to 2.0 points.</description>

    <measure>Changes in snoring intensity measured with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks of add-on therapy</time_frame>
    <description>If patients have a bed partner, a standard 10-point VAS ranging from 0 (no snoring) to 10 (extreme snoring causing the bed partner to leave the bedroom or sleep separately) will be used to evaluate the subjective status of snoring during sleep. Heavy snoring corresponds to a snoring index of at least 7. A decrease of 3 points after treatment is considered significant. A satisfactory improvements is defined as a reduction to an index that is no longer experiences as bothersome (i.e. &lt;3).</description>
