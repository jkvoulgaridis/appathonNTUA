      Background: There is still an evident need for useful biomarkers and effective therapeutic
      approaches regarding the challenging management of sepsis. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effect of each Cytosorb hemoadsorption therapy course on blood levels of
      inflammatory biomarkers of sepsis including endocan, copeptin, interleukin-6, procalcitonin,
      C-reactive protein.

      This observational prospective study included patients, who were diagnosed with sepsis and
      treated in the reanimation ICU of Gaziantep University Hospital with Cytosorb therapy between
      June 1st, 2016 and June 30th, 2017. Sepsis was diagnosed according to The Third International
      Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).

      Exclusion criteria of the study were: (i) cardiovascular disease, (ii) multiple traumas,
      (iii) malignancies, (v) incomplete clinical data.

      Approval of the ethical committee (ethical committee approval number 2018/04-02) was
      obtained. Written informed consent was taken from each patient or their next-of-kin. Patient
      demographics including age, gender, and origin of sepsis were recorded. Arterial blood
      samples were taken from patients before and immediately after the Cytosorb therapy course.

    <description>The Cytosorb cartridge was either used alone in hemoperfusion mode or, if renal replacement therapy was clinically indicated, inserted proximally into a conventional continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) circuit. Before the start of the Cytosorb therapy, adequate anti-coagulation was confirmed when target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60±80 seconds, or an activated clotting time (ACT) of 180±210 seconds was achieved with systemic heparin. Antibiotics were administered after each Cytosorb therapy whenever possible.</description>
