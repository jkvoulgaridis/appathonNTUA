    <description>It was measured by behavior rating inventory of executive function. it consists of 75 items that are measured on a 5-point Likert scale. subscales include inhibition, shift, emotional control, self-monitoring, initiation, working memory, planning/organization, task monitoring and organization of materials. min and max scores are 0 and 150. respectively. the higher scores indicate problems in executive functions.</description>

    <description>it was measured by Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire: This 20-item scale measures sensitivity to reward and sensitivity to punishment, which is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (from &quot;totally correct&quot; to &quot;totally incorrect&quot;). the higher scores in subscales of sensitivity to punishment and Sensitivity to Reward indicate high activity in punishment and reward systems.</description>
