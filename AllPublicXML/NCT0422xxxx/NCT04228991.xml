  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) delivered over 3
      weeks to the breast and regional nodes (supraclavicular, axillary and internal mammary)
      following breast conserving surgery (BCS), or to the chest wall and regional nodes following
      mastectomy, is non-inferior to conventional fractionation delivered over 5 weeks in patients
      with node positive breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, randomized, non-inferior, phase III study comparing two radiation treatment
      modalities, conventional fractionation with hypofractionation for locoregional RT. Eligible,
      consenting patients with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of
      the breast without evidence of metastatic disease; treated with definitive surgery [BCS or
      mastectomy with nodal staging using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND)] will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either conventional locoregional RT
      (control group) or hypofractionated locoregional RT (experimental group). Stratification
      factors include: body mass index, the performance of ALND, type of surgery (BCS or
      mastectomy) and clinical centre.

      Study participants will be assessed for lymphedema, the primary outcome, by measuring arm
      volume. Arm mobility will be assessed by measuring arm movement. Study participants will be
      assessed for acute and late radiation toxicities, during and post RT. Study participants will
      be followed and assessed annually for breast cancer recurrence (BCR), new second cancers,
      quality of life (QOL) and overall survival. Cost effectiveness and cost utility will also be
      determined. The planned sample size is 588 study participants. The study will be conducted at
      clinical centres throughout Canada.
