  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well physical therapy and progressive muscle relaxation works in
      improving physical performance and mood in older patients with stage IIIA-B or IV lung cancer
      who are undergoing treatment. Improving physical performance and mood may help older patients
      maintain an independent lifestyle by helping to improve their resilience, the ability to
      bounce back to normal functioning after a stressor or intervening health event such as
      treatment or disease progression. Giving physical therapy and progressive muscle relaxation
      may work in improving symptoms and quality of life in patients with lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a novel, weekly supervised virtual health-assisted physical
      therapy plus relaxation intervention delivered to older adults with advanced thoracic
      malignancy (N=20).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate physical therapy sessions consisting of cardiovascular and resistance
      training exercises in person or online and also undergo progressive muscle relaxation
      sessions once weekly for up to 12 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 24 weeks, and then
      periodically for up to 24 months.

    <description>Recruitment rates will be defined as the proportion of screened older adults accrued relative to those approached in the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) Thoracic Oncology Clinic. Successful recruitment rates will be defined as &gt;= 50% of older adults (&gt;= 60 years) approached agree to participate.</description>

    <description>Study adherence will be defined as the completion of &gt;= 70% of the program sessions, repeated assessments, and collection of bio specimens either at the end of the study period or death, whichever occurs first.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional trajectories</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMS). GLMMs can determine whether factors affect all patient trajectories in similar ways or whether they affect individual trajectories differently. To allow for possible changes in functional status over time (e.g., a change-point analysis) the 'segmented' package in R will be used. Participants' functional status scores will be modeled using a segmented mixed model with random change points. Estimating the change point identifies the point in time that patients' functional status scores change during the 12-months post-diagnosis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Factors associated with Resiliency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using GLMMS. Resiliency will be defined as the ability to maintain or regain at least 50% of baseline functional status at any point during the 12 months after diagnosis with specific emphasis at 3 and 6-months post- the start of treatment. The association between resiliency and clinical factors will be evaluated with appropriate statistical techniques for the specific measure (e.g. Chi-square tests will compare categorical variables between participants demonstrating resiliency vs. worsening functional status; a two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will compare continuous variables).</description>
