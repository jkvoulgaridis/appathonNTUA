    <textblock>
      Precision Promise is a multi-center, seamless Phase 2/3 platform trial designed to evaluate
      multiple regimens in metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To compare each investigational arm versus standard of care (SOC) for superiority in
           overall survival in 1st and/or 2nd line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and
           determine which, if any, patients benefit from each investigational arm.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine short and long-term safety signals of each investigational arm in
           pancreatic cancer patients vs. SOC.

        -  To determine progression-free survival (PFS) for each investigational arm vs. SOC.

        -  Rates of overall response, CR, and PR; duration of overall response, CR or PR (whichever
           occurs first).

        -  Rate of clinical benefit; duration of clinical benefit.

      Precision Promise is a multi-center, seamless Phase 2/3 platform trial designed to evaluate
      multiple regimens in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The goal of the platform is to find
      effective therapies for pancreatic cancer. The platform will rapidly and efficiently test
      multiple novel drugs and combinations compared to standard of care therapy in first and
      second metastatic patients. Bayesian response-adaptive randomization will be used to assign
      patients to arms based on their performance in subtypes of the disease. The primary endpoint
      is overall survival.
