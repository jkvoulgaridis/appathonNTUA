  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the DIRECT Study is to establish a robust pipeline to identify those patients with
      high-grade B cell lymphoma most suitable for novel agent clinical trials based upon genomic
      subtype and an integrated response evaluation determined early in first-line therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be done by integrating data and samples collected from patients undergoing standard
      of care treatment for high-grade B cell lymphoma

      Data will be integrated from

        1. Clinical risk factors from the International Prognostic Index (IPI)

        2. Up-front genomic subtype based on molecular profiling of diagnostic biopsy

        3. Serial ctDNA monitoring during treatment.

        4. Radiological response imaging

    <description>Patients will take their normal standard of care treatment for their lymphoma, as per agreed with the patient's doctor.
Blood samples will be collected at Baseline, during the first 3 cycles of Treatment, at End of Treatment, at 6- and 12-months after End of Treatment and at relapse/progression if applicable.
Surplus Tissue biopsy will be collected at Baseline and at relapse/progression if applicable. In rare cases research-specific tissue biopsy may be collected if appropriate.</description>
