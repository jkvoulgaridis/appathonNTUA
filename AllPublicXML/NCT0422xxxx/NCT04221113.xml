      Functional recovery measurement : Comparing early active mobilization versus immobilization
      after extensor tendon repair in zones IV to VIII.

      Immobilization for six weeks has been the postoperative protocol for the patients with hand's
      extensor tendon repair in our institute. In this study early mobilization of the hand i.e.
      also an internationally followed way, is compared with the aforementioned immobilization
      protocol to see which turns out to be a better option in the interest of the patient.

      patients selection in both groups will be random by using close envolupe technique.

      In group A ( immobilisation) physiotherapy will start by the end of 4th week and the upper
      limit of flexion would be 45 degrees.

      In group B ( EAM) physiotherapy will start by the end of 1st week and the upper limit of
      flexion would be 30 degrees.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flexion range and extension lag at each joint i.e MCPJ, PIPJ and DIPJ will be assessed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks of follow up. By using this following formula total active motion at each joint mentioned above will be assessed.
TAM is calculated by the following formula:
TAM =([MCPJ +PIPJ +DIPJ flexion]- [MCPJ +PIPJ +DIPJ extension lag</description>

    <description>Two protocols have been described for physiotherapy of post extensor tendon injuries. one is immobilization till 3 weeks and than gradual increase in active motion of hand. The second protocol is early active motion. this would be done under senior physiotherapist.</description>
