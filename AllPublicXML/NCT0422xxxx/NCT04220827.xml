    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of paclitaxel for the treatment of
      gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel via intraperitoneal route in
      subjects with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of escalating doses of intraperitoneal paclitaxel in subjects with
      gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis.

      II. To make a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel in subjects
      with stage IV gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intraperitoneally (IP) over 1 hour once weekly during weeks 1-3
      and 5-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
