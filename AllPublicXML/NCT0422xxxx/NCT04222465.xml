        This is a Japanese, multi-center, observational study. Patients with newly diagnosed FIGO
        stage III - IV OC after 1st January, 2019 will be enrolled sequentially.

        Patients those who have undergone or are planning to undergo BRACAnalysis, which detects
        BRCA mutations, are eligible for this study. In this study, data of 200 subjects will be
        collected at approximately 20 sites in Japan. To reduce regional bias of study sites, the
        number of enrolled patients per site will be capped.
