      This study aims to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of the BTL-899 device for
      non-invasive lipolysis and fat reduction in the thigh and saddlebag area. This is a
      prospective, open-label, two-arm study; therefore the participants will be assigned to two
      study groups. Each participant will complete 4 treatment visits and 2 follow-up visits.

    <measure>Participants' Satisfaction Measured Via Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the participants' satisfaction with the therapy via Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaires. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (Quality of Life questionnaire) will be used where score &quot;3&quot; means &quot;very much improved&quot; and &quot;-3&quot; is &quot;very much worse&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the Therapy's Safety Measured Via Therapy Comfort Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome will further be measured through the occurrence of adverse events or lack thereof. On Numerical Analog Scale (0-10), where 0 represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'worst possible pain' select the level of pain experienced during the treatment.</description>
