        Inclusion Criteria:

        The included volunteer is a researcher within parasitology with focus on Trichuris
        trichiura and Trichiura suis. He planned to infect himself under medical supervision. This
        was his third self-infection with Trichuris. The only clinical criterion for his inclusion
        in the study was that he was healthy.
