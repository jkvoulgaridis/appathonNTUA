  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to recruit females, aged 16 years and over, with
      phenylketonuria (PKU) or hyperphenylalaninemia (hyperphe) following dietary management advice
      pre-conception and/or during pregnancy, who are willing to take PKU sphere as part of their
      dietarty management.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe dietary management and metabolic control in women taking
      PKU sphere pre-conceptually and/or during pregnancy. To do this the following data points
      will be captured:

        -  Blood spot phenylalanine and tyrosine levels to measure metabolic control

        -  Changes to dietary management and any adaptations arising from incorporating PKU Sphere

        -  Compliance/adherence of patients to their recommended amount of protein substitute
           prescription.

        -  Tolerance of PKU sphere with respect to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and pregnancy
           associated nausea and vomiting.

        -  Acceptability of concurrent protein substitute(s) (if applicable).

        -  Nutritional status and weight management.

        -  Routine standard of care data on the final pregnancy outcome and postpartum.
