    <textblock>
      Chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with impaired exercise capacity, quality of
      life and right ventricular function.The disease is characterized by an increase of pulmonary
      vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right heart insufficiency. In
      later stages of the disease, the right heart is not able to further increase right
      ventricular contractility (cardiac index) during exercise. Within the last decade, new
      disease-targeted medical therapies have been approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH). Sequential and upfront combinations of these agents have shown to further
      improve symptoms, 6-minute walking distance (6-MWD) and hemodynamics in PAH patients.

      Previous training studies have suggested that exercise training as add-on to medical
      treatment is highly effective improving exercise capacity, quality of life and symptoms.
      Prospective studies with a 24±12 months follow-up period suggested that exercise training may
      also improve the rate of clinical worsening events as the need for hospitalization,
      additional PH-medication, lung-transplantation and death.

      There is also first data that exercise training may have a positive impact on the right
      ventricular function.

      This randomised controlled study aims to assess whether exercise training

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study in patients with pulmonary
      hypertension, who are under stable optimized treatment for at least 2 months, is to examine
      the effect of an additional exercise and respiratory therapy on the right heart function.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the right heart function, measured by cardiac index
      during exercise invasively determined by right heart catheterization. More hemodynamic
      parameters for the determination of the right heart function as well as clinical and
      molecular parameters are relevant to record the physiological effect of the training. The
      molecular parameters are composed of laboratory parameter and inflammatory parameter as well
      as genetic analyses, measurements of epigenetic changes measured by microRNA Expressions and
      DNA-methylation and imunohistochemical measurements of the quadriceps musculature.

      The study parameters will be assessed in the patient's routine examinations. Clinical
      parameters comprise of hemodynamic assessment of pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise,
      pump function of left and right ventricle, and further echocardiographic parameters.
      Improvement of exercise capacity will be measured by the change of six-minute walking
      distance, the breathing economics, the world health organization functional class (WHO
      functional class), peak oxygen consumption and blood gas analysis. The quality of life will
      be assessedwith the SF-36 questionnaire.Data for survival analysis will be gained by
      structured phone interviews . The safety of the training is warranted by long-term, rest- and
      stress-ECG, safety laboratory, systemic blood pressure, heart frequency, oxygen saturation
      and occurrence of adverse events. In addition to the routine examinations at baseline and
      after 15 weeks, a right heart catheterization will be performed.

      Patients will be examined in the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg. Patients of the training group will
      take part in a specific, 3-week inpatient training program at the rehabilitation center
      Königstuhl Heidelberg right after the baseline examination. The training program consists of
      exercise and respiratory therapy as well as a mental gait training. Respiratory therapy will
      be performed 5 times/week for 30 minutes. Furthermore, 15-25 minutes low dosed interval
      training on a bicycle ergometer, dumbbell training of particular muscle groups with low
      weights and supervised walks on ground-level will be scheduled 5-7 times/week. Three- to five
      times a week a &quot;mental gait training&quot; is conducted to estimate the patient's individual
      physical abilities and limitations. The heart rate during exerciseand the intensity of the
      training will be closely monitored and individually adjusted. After three weeks of
      in-hospital rehabilitation the patients are asked to continue the training for twelve further
      weeks at home. All patients will be examined before the training program, at the end of the
      in-hospital phase after three weeks and after 15 weeks. Patients of the control group will
      continue with their lifestyle without individual training prescriptions. After having
      participated in the study, patients of the control group will also be offered to take part in
      the training program.

      The control examinations cover the medical history, WHO functional class, physical
      examination, ECG, echocardiography at rest and during exercise, spiroergometry, quality of
      life, blood-gas analysis, lung function, 6-minute walking distance, oxygen saturation, blood
      pressure and heart rate, laboratory tests. An optional magnet resonance imaging at the
      beginning and after three months may also be conducted. At baseline, an optional genetic
      assessment will be performed; and at the beginning, after three and 15 weeks the expression
      levels of micro RNA and methylation of the DNA will be assessed. A biopsy of the quadriceps
      musculature will optionally be carried out at baseline and after 15 weeks. Medication will
      remain stable throughout the study.
