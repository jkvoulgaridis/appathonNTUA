  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the antitumor activity of enfortumab
      vedotin as measured by confirmed objective response rate (ORR).

      This study will also assess other measures of antitumor activity; overall survival (OS); as
      well as the safety and tolerability of enfortumab vedotin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 3 periods: screening/baseline, treatment and follow-up.

      Screening/baseline period will take place up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study
      treatment.

      In the treatment period, starting at cycle 1, participants will receive enfortumab vedotin on
      days 1, 8, and 15 every 28-day cycle until one of the treatment discontinuation criteria are
      met. Disease assessment will be performed at screening/baseline and repeated every 8 weeks
      (56 days ± 7 days) from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study until the
      participant has radiologically confirmed disease progression, initiates a new subsequent
      anticancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes,
      whichever occurs first.

      Participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically-confirmed
      disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1 will enter into a post treatment follow-up period
      and continue to receive imaging scans every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) until the subject has
      radiologically confirmed disease progression, initiates a new anticancer therapy, dies,
      withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes, whichever occurs first.

      After 1 year on study treatment, the frequency of disease assessment will be reduced to every
      12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days).

      After radiologically-confirmed disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer
      therapy, whichever occurs first, participants will be contacted every 12 weeks in the
      long-term follow-up period for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to
      follow-up or study closure, whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered enfortumab vedotin, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of enfortumab vedotin whether or not considered related to the enfortumab vedotin. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the event: results in death; is life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures) or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization is not caused by an AE); or other medically important events.</description>
