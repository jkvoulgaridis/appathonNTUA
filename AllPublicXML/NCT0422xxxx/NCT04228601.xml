    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to: a) evaluate the tolerability and safety of the
      co-administration of Fluzoparib and mFOLFIRINOX followed by Fluzoparib Maintenance
      Monotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, and establish the maximum tolerated
      dose and recommended phase II dose of the combination; and b) assess the efficacy of the
      co-administration of Fluzoparib and mFOLFIRINOX followed by Fluzoparib Maintenance
      Monotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
