  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project represents a well powered study of the human response to altitude exposure
      combined with rHuEPO treatment. A total of 20 male and 20 female non-competing athletes will
      participate. The participants will be exposed to a period of hypobaric hypoxia at 2.320 m for
      four weeks and a sea-level intervention period of four weeks. The participants will be
      blinded and randomly allocated to intra venous injection with 20 IU per kg body weight of
      recombinant human erythropoietin or placebo every second day for the initial three weeks of
      each intervention. Included subjects will be runners due to the good possibility of
      recruitment and conduction of training at altitude. Samples are collected weekly for four
      weeks prior to each intervention period, during the four week intervention and four weeks
      after. This approach yields a highly valuable biobank for identification of markers sensitive
      to initiation of rHuEPO injections as well as termination of injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis for this study is that metabolomics and proteomics methods can identify
      biomarkers that are sensitive to altitude exposure and recombinant human erythropoietin
      treatment, respectively. Secondarily, the hypothesis is that the identified biomarkers can
      distinguish between altitude exposure and abuse of rHuEPO.

      We will include 20 Danish men and 20 Danish women aged 18-35 years. The inclusion criteria
      are a maximum oxygen uptake rate (VO2max) &gt; 48 ml / kg / min for men and &gt; 43 ml / kg / min
      for women. All trial participants must have &gt; 2 years of history in regular exercise
      including running (&gt; 2 times a week; &gt; 30 min per session) and capable of performing a 5 km
      run in 22 min for men and 25 min for women at sea level on a level surface in dry conditions
      and a temperature between 10 and 20 degrees C. Furthermore, the participants must not have
      experienced running related injuries within the past two years.

      The experimental protocol consists of two experimental periods, both of which must be
      performed by all participants. Both periods contain a baseline period of four weeks followed
      by four weeks training camp and four weeks follow up. The training camp in one period of
      experiments is performed at sea level while the training camp in the other period is
      performed at 2320 m above sea level. Each period is separated by a minimum of two months to
      ensure that the participants have returned to baseline values. During the two intervention
      periods, the participants will be transported by air and car to the destination of the
      respective training camp. It is expected that the participants train for 1-2 hours a day on
      average and that the time spent for the measurements described is ~ 5-7 hours a week.

      To investigate whether the described methods can identify sensitive biomarkers for the
      physiological response due to rHuEPO treatment, the participants will be treated with rHuEPO.

      The distribution of participants allows the following:

        -  28 participants receive rHuEPO at sea level, thereby identifying biomarkers sensitive
           for use of rHuEPO

        -  28 participants receive placebo under altitude exposure, whereby biomarkers sensitive to
           altitude exposure can be identified

        -  12 participants receive placebo at sea level, whereby random fluctuations of the
           identified biomarkers can be determined.

        -  12 participants receive rHuEPO under altitude exposure, whereby the identified rhuEPO
           biomarkers and altitude exposure can be tested for whether they can be used to separate
           individuals receiving rHuEPO under altitude exposure from individuals receiving placebo
           under altitude exposure.

        -  8 participants receive placebo at sea level and altitude exposure, whereby natural and
           random individual fluctuations can be determined over a longer period (&gt; 6 months).
           Since random individual fluctuations can be determined at n = 1, n = 8 will be
           sufficient to determine this.

    <description>Urine is analyzed by metabolomics and the metabolites for rHuEPO and altitude are verified using an exploratory design.
More specifically, the aim is to identify the resulting metabolites from altitude exposure and treatment with rHuEPO as these are not yet known In this WADA-supported research project, the aim is to identify high sensitivity biomarkers for altitude exposure through a metabolomics methods, as 'omics' methods have previously shown promising results in other exposure contexts. However, being the first of its kind in antidoping the resulting metabolites from rHuEPO misuse and altitude have not yet been identified. Thus, an exact description of these is not possible</description>
