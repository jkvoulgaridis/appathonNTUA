  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients were classified into two groups based on the values of MCH and RBC, patients with
      MCH ≥30 pg but &lt;35 pg and RBC ≤350×104/μL; and MCH &lt;30 pg and RBC &gt;350×104/μL. Associations
      between all-cause mortality and the distributions of MCH and RBC were assessed by
      Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression model.

    <textblock>
      The Hb levels generally provides the value of RBC and iron status because mean corpuscular
      hemoglobin MCH is derived from the Hb divided by RBC. MCH depends on the size and
      concentration of erythrocytes. Thus, the value of RBC and MCH depend on dose of ESA and iron,
      respectively. Guidelines for Renal Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease of 2015 Japanese Society
      for Dialysis Therapy recommend administration hemoglobin (Hb) levels ≥10 g/dL but &lt;12 g/dL in
      dialysis patients.Patients whose Hb levels is maintained at 10 to 12 g/dL, Hb levels is
      widely distributed when divided into RBC and MCH. Therefore, the investigators examined the
      prognosis of life in the distribution of MCH and RBC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be controlled with hemoglobin levels between ≥10 g/dL and &lt;12 g/dL and
             had undergone maintenance HD for &gt;1 year.
