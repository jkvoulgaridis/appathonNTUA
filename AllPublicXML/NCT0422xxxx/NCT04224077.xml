  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive MRI technique offering a functional approach
      that provides morphological information about the microstructures of the nerve roots. DTI is
      a widely used neuroimaging technique and is a current topic of research in the field of
      peripheral nerve imaging. The aim of this work is therefore to improve DTI sequences by
      specifically evaluating the contribution of the multiband technique in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For every healthy volunteer will be acquired:

        -  a morphological sequence

        -  a reference diffusion tensor sequence covering three lumbar stages (reference DTI),

        -  a diffusion tensor sequence acquired in multiband technique, covering three lumbar
           stages (optimized DTI),

        -  a diffusion tensor sequence acquired in a multiband technique, covering a lumbar stage,
           of higher spatial resolution (centred DTI)

    <description>Comparison of the image quality between DTI optimized and DTI of reference. The signal-to-noise ratio is a measure that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. Mathematically, the signal-to-noise ratio is the quotient of the (mean) signal intensity measured in a region of interest and the standard deviation of the signal intensity in a region outside the anatomy of the object being imaged.
The contrast-to-noise ratio is a measure of image quality based on a contrast rather than the raw signal.</description>

    <description>Comparison of fraction of anisotropy, and apparent diffusion coefficient between DTI optimized and DTI of reference.
The measurement of fraction of anisotropy, and apparent diffusion coefficient provides robust values for quantifying the degree of microstructural abnormalities of nerves.</description>
