  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this prospective, randomized, controlled trial the investigators want to investigate
      effects of a prolonged repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS) intervention on
      Achilles tendinopathy and compare it to a well established intervention. This may provide
      clinicians with a new, non-pharmacological, non-invasive, near painless approach to treat
      tendinopathy.

      Although promising results with comparable devices exist, a direct and valid conclusion on
      the overall clinical performance of the investigational device cannot be drawn. This is
      mainly due to different treatment protocols used in the literature and due to the lack of
      insight in the technical documentation of comparable devices. Further, the applied magnetic
      fields vary in their amplitude, frequency, waveform and/or stimulation durations.

      Therefore, the main goal of this clinical investigation is the collection of clinical data on
      the clinical performance of the investigational device. This clinical data will subsequently
      serve as a main source for the clinical evaluation of the medical device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tendons are collagenous tissues that link muscle to bone, and in best case, a painless
      transmission of force allows voluntary movement over a life time. Although tendons show long
      time underestimated repair and remodelling capacities, some of them (e.g. the human patellar
      or Achilles tendon) remain quite prone to injury. To make things worse, tendinous tissue
      reveals incomplete healing capacities and treatments seem to be ineffective to avoid the high
      injury recurrence rate and/or the occurrence of chronic tendon pain. Thus, both elite and
      recreational athletes, as well as the non-sporting population or workplace employees often
      suffer from symptoms like tendon swelling, localized tenderness, activity related pain and
      impaired performance, also known as tendinopathy. Such pain-induced restriction of mobility
      frequently means the end of a sporting carrier, deteriorates the quality of life and patients
      have to live with all harmful consequences of physical inactivity. One tendon most commonly
      afflicted by this debilitating musculoskeletal injury is the Achilles tendon. Although it is
      the strongest tendon in our body, the prevalence for tendinopathy can be as high as 56% among
      certain athletes.

      The repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) works through a deep operating, focused
      and painless stimulation mechanism generated by pulsed magnetic fields. This intervention is
      already successfully in use to accelerate the healing of bone fractures and to enhance the
      healing of operated rotator cuff tears. Additionally, data on in vitro tendon cells indicate
      the positive effect of rPMS on tendon tissue by stimulating cell proliferation, up-regulating
      tendon-specific gene expression and releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.
      More interestingly, intervention studies on the healing of rotator cuff tendon-to-bone
      injuries in rat models show increases in tendon stiffness and modulus and enhanced collagen
      organization, and type I collagen expression after prolonged rPMS without showing adverse
      effects in any mechanical or histological property. These results strongly support the
      hypothesis that rPMS might be effective in treating Achilles tendinopathy in humans. This
      intervention might reduce pain and functional limitations, reverse tendon degenerative
      changes and increase the impaired tendon mechanical and material properties.

    <intervention_name>Repetitive pulsed magnetic stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>OMNITRON ProMed is a rPMS (repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation) device used for deep stimulation of muscles and/or neurones (outside the brain). The energy is delivered by way of a special round treatment coil, whose cover material is tested for biocompatibility.
The OMNITRON ProMed device produces a high-energy impulse field and stimulates tissue, in particular soft tissue, muscles and neurons, by means of repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS). Short, extremely strong magnetic fields in the microsecond range are emitted non-invasively. OMNITRON ProMed works with short-term energy emission at a peak power of up to 60 million watts and a magnetic field strength of up to 100 milliTesla.
The intensity of treatment can be set between 20 and 100 %. The device automatically adjusts the magnetic field strength and the frequency of the pulses emitted depending on the intensity selected.
For comfortable transport and application the product is compact and portable.</description>

    <intervention_name>Eccentric Calf Muscle Training for Achilles Tendinopathy</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be asked to stand with their full body weight on the injured leg. From an upright body position and standing with all body weight on the forefoot and the ankle joint in plantar flexion, the calf muscle is then loaded by having the patient slowly lower the heel beneath the forefoot. The calf muscle will only be loaded eccentrically, not concentric. Instead, the non-injured leg is used to get back to the start position. The first set of this exercise is performed in an upright position, followed by a second set with the knee bent to 45°. This regimen is performed 2x per day.
The patients are told to go ahead with the exercise even if they experienced pain. However, they are told to stop if the pain becomes disabling.</description>
