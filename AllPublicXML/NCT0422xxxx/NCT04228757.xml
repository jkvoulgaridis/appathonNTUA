  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week study is a randomized, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of an
      herbal blend on menopausal symptoms and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in menopause symptoms after taking an herbal
      supplement daily for 12 weeks compared to placebo (a tablet that does not have active
      ingredients). This is a remote study, meaning all study data will be collected via the
      ClaimIt app, with the exception of a screening lab appointment and a Week 12 lab
      appointment.Participants will be asked to report on study compliance and respond to a series
      of questionnaires relating to symptoms of menopause, hot flashes, and quality of life.

The Greene Climacteric Questionnaire is a 21-item validated questionnaire that provides a measurement of global menopause symptoms, grouping questions into psychological, physical, vasomotor, and sexual domains. Participants answer on a 4-point scale. Each response is given a numerical value from 0 to 3 points respectively, and the sum total of their 21-point responses is calculated as their GCS score.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in feelings of fatigue as measured by Chalder Fatigue Scale questionnaire scores at weeks 4, 8, and 12.
The CFS is an 11-point questionnaire that provides a numerical value for overall symptoms of fatigue. Participants are asked to answer about their experience of fatigue related symptoms on a 4-point scale including &quot;Less than usual&quot;, &quot;No more than usual&quot;, &quot;More than usual&quot; and &quot;Much more than usual&quot; on the first 10 questions. On the final question the options are &quot;Better than usual&quot;, &quot;No worse than usual&quot;, &quot;Worse than usual&quot; and &quot;Much worse than usual&quot;. Each score is given a numerical score of 0-3 respectively, and a total calculated as the sum of the 11 responses.</description>
