  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of NanoPac injected directly into the prostate lesion in men
      with prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NanoPac is very small (submicron) particles of the chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, which is
      administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are
      injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less
      systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, this submicron
      particle paclitaxel will be injected directly into the prostate lesion in men with prostate
      cancer scheduled for prostatectomy on up to three different occasions. All subjects in the
      study will receive NanoPac and will be evaluated to see if NanoPac is safe, well-tolerated,
      and has an impact on prostate cancer.

    <measure>Tumor response based on histologic evaluation of biopsied prostate samples (Gleason Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 92</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate tissue samples obtained during biopsy at baseline and prostatectomy. Histologic evaluation of these samples will be used to determine the Gleason score, and the results at baseline and Day 92 will be used to evaluate the tumor response to NanoPac. The Gleason score is calculated by adding together the two grades of cancer cells that make up the largest areas of the biopsied tissue sample. The Gleason score usually ranges from 6 to 10. The lower the Gleason score, the more the cancer cells look like normal cells and are likely to grow and spread slowly; a higher Gleason score is likely to indicate a worse outcome. The Gleason score is used to help plan treatment and determine prognosis.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1 month prior to Consent and Day 85</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in PSA Density</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>PSA density (PSAD), is a calculation of the serum PSA level divided by the volume of the prostate gland. PSA density has been used as a prognostication tool in helping decide treatment approach. PSA density measured at the final study visit will be compared to screening (baseline)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PI-RADS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) assessment uses a five-point scale based on the probability that a combination of mpMRI findings on T2 weighting (T2W), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) correlates with the presence of a clinically significant cancer in the prostate gland. A PI-RADS score of 1 is considered to be most probably benign and a score of 5 is considered to be highly suspicious of prostate malignancy. PI-RADS score will be measured at screening (baseline) and at the final study visit.</description>
