    <textblock>
      The &quot;CHOICE!&quot; study, is an EX program following the recommendation of the ACSM for cancer
      survivors. The aims of the intervention are to test the safety and the feasibility of an EX
      program. Secondary endpoints include the EX health-related skill and the quality of life. The
      program considers the preferences of EX of cancer survivors, giving the possibility to choose
      the EX modality (autonomous, with personal trainer or group class).

    <description>Using the Godin's Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). GLTEQ inquires about frequency of vigorous, moderate and mild intensity EX as defined by Godin. Subsequently, each frequency is multiplied by its correspondent metabolic equivalent of the task (MET), i.e. vigorous*9; moderate*5; mild*3. A Leisure Score Index (LSI) was calculated, using the sum of vigorous and moderate components. Based on LSI patients were then classified as active (if LSI≥ 24) and insufficiently active (if LSI&lt;24) according to the American College of Sport Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines.</description>

    <description>The patients can choose between three modality of EX:
Autonomous supervised training : a personalized activity is proposed. People choosing this modality have a written material, in which all the exercise, the activity, the frequency, the duration, the intensity are specifically described and reported, to perform the training at home. A training diary and 7 meetings (face to face, or skype or other modality) are proposed for monitoring the intervention.
Personal training program: a personalized activity is proposed. Patients are followed individually in a gym contest by a qualified kinesiologist.
Group training program: the training is performed in a small group, supervised and monitored by a qualified kinesiologist. The instructor-user ratio is 1:4 - 1:8, depending on the functional conditions and the heterogeneity of the participants.</description>
