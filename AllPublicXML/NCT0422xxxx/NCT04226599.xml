  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-coated balloons delivering paclitaxel at the angioplasty site have proved their
      superiority in the treatment of coronary and peripheral arterial stenoses. Paclitaxel reduces
      neointimal hyperplasia, therefore, it represents an attractive option for AVF stenoses. This
      trial is aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Peripheral scoring drug balloon
      (Dissolve AV) or Balloon Dilatation catheter ( Armada 35) in treating AVF stenosis in chinese
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled, open-label, superiority study. A
      total of 220 subjects will be enrolled from 10 sites in China. All subjects enrolled will be
      randomly assigned to the test group (Dissolve AV group, n=110) and the control group (Armada
      35 group, n=110) with randomized allocation ratio of 1:1. Subjects in the test group and the
      control group will be treated with Peripheral scoring drug balloon or Balloon Dilatation
      catheter
