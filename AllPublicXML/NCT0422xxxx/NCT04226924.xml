  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BB-OPMD-202 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of IV trehalose for
      treatment of OPMD. The study includes a 4-week screening period, a 24-week blinded treatment
      period during which patients will receive weekly infusions of trehalose or placebo, followed
      by a 24-week open-label extension period during which all patients will receive weekly
      infusions of trehalose. Patients will undergo a safety follow-up assessment 4 weeks after
      their last treatment.

      After signing informed consent, patients will undergo two rounds of ice-cold water and nectar
      drinking tests at least 1 week apart to confirm oropharyngeal dysfunction. Patients who have
      confirmed oropharyngeal dysfunction, i.e., an ice-cold water drinking test time of 8 seconds
      or greater at both rounds, in addition to an SSQ score of &gt;235, will be enrolled. Baseline
      values for all safety and efficacy parameters will be established during the screening
      period. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to trehalose or placebo, at the time of
      enrollment. Randomization will be stratified according to the patient's score on the SSQ at
      screening (≤ 799 or ≥ 800).

      Patients randomized to trehalose will receive a 1-hour IV infusion of trehalose at a dose of
      0.75 g/kg weekly for 24 weeks. Patients randomized to placebo (normal saline) will receive a
      weight-based equal volume of placebo weekly for 24 weeks.

      After Week 24, patients may transition to an open-label extension of the study (extension
      period). During the extension period, patients will be treated with weekly infusion of
      trehalose at a dose of 0.75 g/kg for 24 weeks, followed by a 4-week safety follow-up (total
      duration of study = 56 weeks).
