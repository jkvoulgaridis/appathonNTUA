  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JS005-001 is one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      tolerability, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile of single dose of JS005
      injection in healthy volunteers.

      A total of 5 dose groups are set in the study, i.e., 15 mg, 60 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg,
      single dose will be given subcutaneously in abdomen.

      A total of 40 subjects are planned to be enrolled, 8 subjects will be enrolled in each group.
      Each dose group will be given the study drug and placebo at a ratio of 3:1. Each subject can
      only receive one single dose at one dose level.

      Sentinel method will be used for dose escalation, and one independent safety evaluation team
      (SET) will be set up. 2 subjects (one receiving study drug, the other receiving placebo) will
      be randomized preferably and followed up until 3 days after administration when the dose
      starts in each dose group, the remaining 6 subjects (5 receiving study drug, 1 receiving
      placebo) can continue to be randomized after confirmation with the sponsor, if no any
      dose-limiting event (DLE) is observed during that period. Only when all the subjects at
      present dose level complete the follow-up for at least 14 days after administration, and no
      dose-limiting event (DLE) is observed in any one subject, the next dose level can be
      initiated after confirmation with the independent safety evaluation team and the sponsor,
      otherwise they must be observed for the full term of follow-up (i.e., on Day 85). If DLE is
      observed throughout the observational period, it is confirmed that ≤2/6 subjects have DLE
      after administration of the study drug through unblinding by the independent safety
      evaluation team, the next dose level can be initiated; if &gt;2/6 subjects have DLE, the dose
      escalation will be terminated. The previous dose before that dose will be regarded as the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). When the dose for single dose is escalated to the preset
      maximum dose, and no safety endpoint is observed, it can be considered to continue to explore
      higher dose after joint decision by investigators and the sponsor.
