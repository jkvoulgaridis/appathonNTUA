    <textblock>
      A randomized and blind clinical consistency study for three commercial batches of Inactivated
      Poliomyelitis Vaccine Made From Sabin Strain (sIPV) for immunogenicity and safety evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized and blind clinical study includes three test groups with 400 infants for each
      group. Sample estimation for this study has been conducted using statistical methods.

      A total of 1,200 2-month old healthy subjects were enrolled for inoculation of vaccine from 3
      different lots with 1 month interval. All subjects received blood collection for
      immunogenicity test before and after primary immunization for evaluation of immunogenicity
      consistency, while safety observation was conducted within 30 days after each vaccination
      (30min via close safety monitoring, 0-7 days via participant diary card and 8-30 days via
      contact card for collection of adverse events) for safety evaluation of sIPV of 3 commercial
      lots.
