  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short stature is a frequent reason for referral to a pediatric endocrinology clinic. Short
      stature is especially prevalent among those with failure to thrive (whose weight is
      significantly below the average weight of his/her peers). The growth hormone is not an
      effective medical treatment of short stature when the cause of short stature is not growth
      hormone deficiency. This study will investigate the effect of 6 months of nutritional
      supplement (essential amino acids) compared to placebo in the linear growth of short children
      who have not yet reached puberty and confirmed to have normal growth hormone levels.

    <description>This is a double-blind study. Participants and the investigators will be blinded to the intervention.
Children in the treatment (intervention) arm will receive essential amino acids (EAA) twice a day.
Children 3 to 5 years of age will be asked to take either 8.5 g (1 serving) of EAA supplement or placebo at breakfast and at bedtime.
Children 6 to 11 years of age will be assigned to take either 17 g (2 servings) of EAA supplement or placebo at breakfast and at bedtime.
EAA and placebo dissolve easily in any liquid beverage and can be taken on empty versus full stomach.</description>

    <description>This is a double-blind study. Participants and the investigators will be blinded to the intervention.
Children in the placebo arm will receive placebo twice a day. EAA and placebo supplements will look and taste alike. The same flavoring ingredients (stevia blend, citric acid, malic acid, natural flavors, tartaric acid, fruit and vegetable juice for color) will be used in both products at the same amount.
Children 3 to 5 years of age will be asked to take either 8.5 g (1 serving) of EAA supplement or placebo at breakfast and at bedtime.
Children 6 to 11 years of age will be assigned to take either 17 g (2 servings) of EAA supplement or placebo at breakfast and at bedtime.
EAA and placebo dissolve easily in any liquid beverage and can be taken on empty versus full stomach.</description>

             ng/mL) to GH provocative tests such as Arginine Insulin Tolerance Test (AITT) or
             Arginine Clonidine Tolerance Test (ACTT).

             children with Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Russel-Silver syndrome, Prader-Willi
             syndrome, Pseudohypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease, malabsorptive syndromes,
             cancer survivors, etc.
