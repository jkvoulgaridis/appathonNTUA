  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the traditional therapies for restoring the ability of speech in aphasic patients is
      Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), in which everyday phrases are taught in a singing-like
      manner. The suggested mechanism for speech recovery is that because of the sharing of brain
      resources for language and music, the regions normally reserved for singing can be trained to
      help compensate the speech functions originally subserved by the damaged regions. However,
      this therapy has primarily been applied to speakers of non-tone languages, in which prosodic
      features carry a more important role than pitch features in conveying meanings. It remains
      unknown whether MIT will be equally applicable for speakers of tone languages, in which pitch
      features likely play a more important role. Another uncertainty concerns whether the efficacy
      of MIT can be extended to patients with expressive speech impairment due to dementia. This
      pilot study aims to find out the efficacy of MIT for speech-impaired dementia patients in
      different verbal tasks. The results of this study will provide preliminary empirical evidence
      to establish the utility of MIT for Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Aphasia Quotient (AQ) in Cantonese Aphasia Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>within a week after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Two subtests of the Cantonese Aphasia Battery (auditory comprehension &amp; spontaneous speech) will be executed. Higher AQ means better performance in the respective areas. The minimum of AQ in each subtest is 0, and the maximum is 20.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in latency and accuracy in picture naming task</measure>
    <time_frame>within a week after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>In the computerized picture naming task, subjects are asked to name the objects they see in 52 pictures, within 5000 ms per picture. Visual stimuli of the task are black and white line-drawings. Responses are all recorded for analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in performance of semantic fluency task</measure>
    <time_frame>within a week after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>In the computerized semantic fluency task, subjects are given 5 categories (e.g. animals) and asked to name as many members of the categories (e.g. cat, dog) as possible. For each category, they have one minute to respond. All the responses are recorded for analysis.</description>
