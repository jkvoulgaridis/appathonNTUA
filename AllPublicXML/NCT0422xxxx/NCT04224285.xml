  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deficiency is a hidden cost of our 24-7 society, with 70% of Americans admitting that
      they routinely obtain insufficient sleep, 30% of US workers report sleeping less than 6 hours
      per night, and it is estimated that 50-70 million individuals have a sleep disorder.
      Undiagnosed and untreated sleep disorders are associated with poor health outcomes for the
      individual and generate substantial costs for the employer. Diminished alertness resulting
      from sleep deficiency or undiagnosed and untreated sleep disorders contributes to
      absenteeism, presenteeism (diminished work performance at work), health care expenditure,
      occupational injuries, workplace accidents, and commute-related motor vehicle crashes; all of
      which result in substantial direct and indirect costs. The investigators have shown that
      adverse impacts on employees and employers can be mitigated through a sleep health education
      and sleep disorder screening program which have been implemented in a variety of industries.
      Further, smartphone apps are becoming popular. Dayzz has created a personalized sleep
      training app that evaluates sleep issues and offers a holistic sleep improvement solution. It
      is unique in that the sleep app uses evidence-based, big-data-based algorithms to provide
      personalized sleep training plans. The sleep solutions are tailored to the individual user
      and leverages unique motivational strategies and continuous supportive messaging. The
      investigators hypothesize that the Dayzz app, offering a personalized, scientifically based
      sleep training plan, might further promote improved health, safety and well-being. This
      clinical trial will implement the sleep health education and sleep disorders screening
      program in combination with the Dayzz app.

      Specifically, the investigators will test the hypotheses that:

      Primary Aim 1: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will report positive changes in sleep
      behavior as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Primary Aim 2: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have increased sleep duration
      and sleep quality as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 1: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have fewer unscheduled
      absences and higher performance/productivity as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 2: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have improved mood and
      alertness and increased energy as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 3: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will report fewer adverse health
      and safety outcomes as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 4: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have lower health care costs
      over a 9-month follow-up period as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

    <measure>Primary Aim 1: Sleep Behavior 1</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep behaviors (e.g., sleep on a consistent schedule, sleep in later) will be self-reported on the end-of-study survey. 100 mm visual analog scales anchored with &quot;Not at all&quot; at 0 and &quot;All the time&quot; at 100 will be used. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Aim 1: Sleep Behavior 2</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of daily eDiary in both Month 1 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep behaviors will also be tracked on the eDiary (e.g., consistent sleep schedule, as calculated with the regularity index). The Sleep Regularity Index calculates the percentage probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep vs. awake) at any two time-points 24 h apart, averaged across the study. The index is scaled so that an individual who sleeps and wakes at exactly the same times each day scores 100 (better outcome), whereas an individual who sleeps and wakes at random scores 0 (worse outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Aim 2: Sleep Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of daily eDiary in both Month 1 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep duration will be reported in the eDiary.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Aim 2: Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The participant self rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper. Minimum Score = 0 (better outcome); Maximum Score = 21 (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Secondary Aim 1: Absenteeism</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 1: Performance/Productivity - Absenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Health Work Performance Questionnaire Short Form (HPQ) will be used to assess performance/productivity via 4-week absolute absenteeism. Absenteeism is scored in terms of hours lost per month, which is to say that a high score indicates a higher amount of absenteeism. The measure of absolute absenteeism is expressed in raw hours, with a negative lower bound (if the person works more than expected) and an upper bound equal to the number of hours the respondent is expected to work.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 1: Performance/Productivity - Presenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Health Work Performance Questionnaire Short Form (HPQ) will be used to assess performance/productivity via absolute presenteeism. Presenteeism has a lower bound of 0 (total lack of performance during time on the job) and an upper bound of 100 (no lack of performance during time on the job). A higher score indicates a lower amount of lost performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 2: Mood - Monthly questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be self-reported via a 7-point Likert scale anchored at 0 with &quot;Very poor&quot; and 7 with &quot;Very good.&quot; Higher numbers indicate better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 2: Mood - eDiary</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of daily eDiary in both Month 1 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be self-reported via 100 mm visual analog scales anchored with &quot;Sad&quot; at 0 and &quot;Happy&quot; at 100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Aim 2: Alertness - Monthly questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alertness will be self-reported via a 7-point Likert scale anchored at 0 with &quot;Very poor&quot; and 7 with &quot;Very good.&quot; Higher numbers indicate better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 2: Alertness - eDiary</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of daily eDiary in both Month 1 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Alertness will be self-reported via 100 mm visual analog scales anchored with &quot;Sleepy&quot; at 0 and &quot;Alert&quot; at 100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 2: Energy - Monthly questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Energy will be self-reported via a 7-point Likert scale anchored at 0 with &quot;Very low&quot; and 7 with &quot;Very high.&quot; Higher numbers indicate better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Aim 2: Energy - eDiary</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of daily eDiary in both Month 1 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Energy will be self-reported via 100 mm visual analog scales anchored with &quot;Sluggish&quot; at 0 and &quot;Energetic&quot; at 100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
