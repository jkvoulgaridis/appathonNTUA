  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether SLNB can safely be omitted in breast cancer patients with HER2+
      or TN tumors who achieve a radiological complete response on MRI after neoadjuvant systemic
      therapy

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Axillary staging in clinically node negative (cN0) breast cancer patients with neoadjuvant
      systemic therapy (NST; i.e. chemo- and immunotherapy), is preferably performed with sentinel
      lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NST. The probability of a tumor-positive SLNB post-NST is low.
      cN0 patients with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2- positive (HER2+) or triple
      negative (TN) breast cancer who achieve radiologic complete response (rCR) of the breast on
      MRI, have the lowest probability of a tumor-positive SLNB post-NST (&lt;3%). Omitting removal of
      axillary lymph nodes in clinically node negative patients does not increase the rate of
      distant metastases nor breast cancer mortality. Performing SLNB can cause short- and
      long-term morbidity, reducing quality of life. The additional value of performing SLNB in
      patients with a very low risk of tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes should be investigated.

    <description>To show that sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy can be omitted in clinically node-negative HER2+ or TN breast cancer patients who achieve radiological complete response on MRI without compromising the 5 - year axillary recurrence rate (i.e, &lt; 6% axillary recurrences within 5 years).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast cancer specific quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To compare study participants in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy is omitted to patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy on breast cancer related quality of life, especially axillary morbidity score. This is measured with the EORTC-BR23 scale. The arm morbidity score consists of 3 items, points ranging from 1 - 4 per item. A higher score indicates more morbidity.</description>

    <description>To compare study participants in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy is omitted to patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy on level of cancer worry, using the cancer worry scale (CWS). The CWS consists of 8 items, with 1-4 points per item and a maximum score of 32 points. Higher scores indicate more frequent cancer worry.</description>

    <description>No sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed in clinically node-negative triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer patients with a radiologic complete response on MRI. Participants will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline (prior to surgery), 6 months, 1, 3 and 5 years follow-up. A control group consisting of 100 clinically node-negative patients receiving standard treatment will be used to compare QoL scores. This group consists of patients that do not wish to participate in the experimental group (i.e., no sentinel node lymph node biopsy) or patients that are not eligible.</description>
