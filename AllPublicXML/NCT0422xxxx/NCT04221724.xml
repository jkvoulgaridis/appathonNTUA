    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a physical exercise program in
      nursing homes will maintain autonomy in activities of daily living, decrease vulnerability
      and improve physical, psychological and cognitive condition. An individualized and
      progressive multi-component physical exercise program focused on function has been designed
      to achieve this objective.

      Participant will engage in an exercise program for 6 months in their nursing homes, in two
      sessions per week of 45-60 minutes

      Primary aim:

      The major aim is to ascertain whether multicomponent exercise program focused on function can
      maintain autonomy in older adults living in nursing homes.

      Secondary aims:

        -  To ascertain the influence of the evaluated exercise program on frailty, physical,
           psycho-affective and cognitive conditions in older people living in nursing homes.

        -  Analyze if the influence that the exercise program has had on dependence, frailty,
           physical, psycho-affective and cognitive condition is maintained after 6 months since
           the end of the program

        -  Examine the influence that the exercise program has on different clinical outcomes:
           falls, hospitalizations, visits to emergency service, the level of dependence, etc.

      Design: experimental, multi-center and single-group physical exercise intervention

      Intervention:

      Combined multicomponent physical exercise program that includes strength, balance and
      flexibility exercises and performed in long term care homes focused on functionality on
      activities of daily living.

      The first 3 months the exercise program aims to restore the physical condition through the
      multicomponent exercise program. Feasibility and safety of the multicomponent exercise
      program were ascertained in a previous study (Arrieta et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Larrad et al.,
      2017). This program will comprise of upper and lower body strengthening exercises, using
      external weights for 2-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions at a progressive incremental intensity of
      30-50% of 1Repetition Maximum (RM). In addition, static balance and flexibility exercise will
      be performed.

      From 3th to 6th months, the objective will be to improve autonomy in daily live activities
      through the functional exercise program. Strength exercises will be maintained with external
      weights and the intensity will be increased to 60-70% of 1-RM, 2-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions.
      Attention tasks, temporal space dissociation and dynamic balance exercises will be added to
      increase the difficulty and intensity in balance exercises. Flexibility and fine handle will
      be also performed.

      This intervention is individualized for each participant and is adjusted progressively during
      the 6 months. Weekly, two sessions of one hour are held and are supervised by
      physiotherapists or specialists in sports sciences trained specifically for the program. An
      interval of at least 48h between training sessions will be respected.

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 3rd 6th and 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomy on daily living activities will be analyzed using the Barthel index. The Barthel index is a questionnaire with 10 items that evaluates the autonomy of the participant in the activities of daily life and it will be evaluated with the reference caregiver in nursing home. The Barthel index evaluates the following items: Feeding, Bathing, Dressing, Grooming, Bowels, Bladder, Toilette use, Transfer, Walking and Stairs. This items are scored as follows: 0 points if it is totally dependent, 5 points if needs some help and 10 points if the participant is totally autonomous</description>

    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) evaluates balance, gait ability, and leg strength using a single tool. The score for each part is given in categorical modality (0-4). This set of tests serves to predict falls, weakness and mortality. The best score will be 12 points and total score less than 10 points indicates frailty and high risk of disability. 1 point of change in the total score has demonstrated to be of clinical relevance.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of a combined multicomponent exercise program (EP) carried out for 6 months that includes strength, balance, flexibility and functional exercises aimed to improve functioning on daily life activities. The EP will be divided into two parts:
The first 3 months the EP aims to restore the physical condition through the multicomponent exercise program. This program will comprise of upper and lower body strengthening exercises, using external weights for 2-3sets of 8-12repetitions at a progressive intensity of 30-50% of 1RM. In addition, static balance and flexibility exercise will be performed.
From 3th to 6th months, the objective will be to improve autonomy through the functional EP. Strength exercises intensity will be increased to 60-70% of 1-RM, 2-3sets of 8-12repetitions. Attention tasks, temporal space dissociation and dynamic balance exercises will be added to increase the intensity in balance exercises. Flexibility and fine handle will be also performed</description>
