  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical Inactivity is one of the major cause causing academic stress in students, so
      effectiveness of Light, moderate and vigorous physical activity as a baseline treatment were
      assessed through academic stress scale questionnaire, Cohen Perceived stress Scale and rapid
      assessment of physical activity (RAPA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 388 students participated in first phase of study and total 60 students with
      moderate academic stress were filtered. Among those only 37 were physically inactive from
      last one month by the assessment through RAPA (Rapid assessment of physical activity). ASS
      (Academic stress scale), Cohen Perceived stress Scale and RAPA questionnaires were used to
      collect data. Three equally distributed groups were given three different modes of physical
      activities i.e light, moderate &amp; vigorous.

    <description>Physical activity level of the patients was also observed through rapid assessment of physical activity with categories as &quot;0&quot; for No involvement and &quot;1&quot; for yes and the results showed that those who are involved in any type of physical activity have a better functional outcome.</description>

    <description>Female collegiate students were assessed by using Academic stress scale questionnaire, Cohen Perceived stress Scale and rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA) to determine physical activity level and academic stress.
