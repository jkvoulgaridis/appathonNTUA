  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective will be to compare the number of ventilator-free days within the 28 days
      following the first spontaneous breathing trial between strategies of extubation performing
      spontaneous breathing trials with T-piece trials or with Pressure-Support trials.

      To do that, the study director proposed to conduct a prospective multicenter randomized
      controlled open-label trial comparing these 2 strategies of weaning in patients at high-risk
      of extubation failure in the Intensive Care Unit.

      Patients included will be randomized before performing the first spontaneous breathing trial
      and will be assigned to one of the following two groups according to the weaning strategy:
      T-piece trial group or Pressure-Support trial group.
