      This is an international multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial including three
      sequential randomizations to assess efficacy of induction and consolidation chemotherapies
      and radiotherapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

      The first randomization (R-I) will compare the efficacy of two induction chemotherapies
      (RAPID COJEC and GPOH regimens) in a phase III setting. The primary endpoint will be the
      3-year EFS from date of randomization . The R-I randomization will be stratified on age,
      stage, MYCN status and countries.

      The second randomization (R-HDC) will compare the efficacy of single HDC with Bu-Mel versus
      tandem HDC with Thiotepa followed by Bu-Mel. The primary endpoint is 3-year EFS calculated
      from the date of the R-HDC randomization. The R-HDC randomization will be stratified on the
      age, stage, MYCN status, induction chemotherapy regimen, response to induction phase and
      countries.

      The impact of local treatment in this phase III setting will be assessed, according to the
      presence or not of a macroscopic residual disease after surgery and HDC.

      In case of macroscopic residual disease, 21.6 Gy radiotherapy to the preoperative tumor bed
      will be randomized (R-RTx) versus the same treatment plus a sequential boost of additional
      14.4 Gy to the residual tumor. The primary endpoint of R-RTx is 3-year EFS from the date of
      the R-RTx randomization. The R-RTx randomization will be stratified on age, stage, MYCN
      status, induction chemotherapy regimen, HDC regimen and countries.

      In case of no macroscopic residual disease, 21.6 Gy radiotherapy will be delivered to the
      preoperative tumor bed.

    <description>R-HDC: consolidation regimen Bu-Mel vs Thiotepa + Bu-Mel The 3-year EFS in the Bu-Mel arm (with immunotherapy) is estimated to be 55%. This study aims to show an improvement of 12% for the Thiotepa + Bu-Mel arm (3-year EFS of 67%). With a recruitment of 448 patients (224 in each arm) over a period of 3 years and a minimum follow-up of 2 years, the power to show a 12% difference is 80% (two-sided logrank test and α=5%).</description>
