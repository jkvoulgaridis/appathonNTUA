      Methodology: This is a phase II, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      study in patients with a diagnosis of anti-AchR antibody positive myasthenia gravis.

      Study Design: The clinical trial will be conducted over a 6-week treatment period.

        -  Group A: Patients currently taking pyridostigmine and experiencing
           pyridostigmine-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) within the past 7 days

        -  Group B: Patients not currently taking pyridostigmine due to GI AEs or that had their
           dose reduced due to pyridostigmine related GI AEs Group A will be enrolled in the study
           and randomized to either the control (pyridostigmine+ placebo) or the test group
           (pyridostigmine + ondansetron) and treated for 6 weeks. Following enrolment, patients
           may (if needed) titrate up their pyridostigmine dose at the investigator's discretion
           each week to the highest dose deemed appropriate, tolerable and safe by the
           Investigator.

      Group B patients not currently taking pyridostigmine due to GI AEs will initiate
      pyridostigmine at a dose determined by the investigator based on the patient's history and
      may titrate as deemed tolerable and safe by Investigator during screening; patients on a
      reduced dose due to pyridostigmine related GI AEs may titrate pyridostigmine as deemed
      tolerable and safe by the investigator during screening. If patients in Group B experience GI
      AEs that fulfil enrolment criteria, along with all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, they
      will be enrolled into the study at that dose and randomized to either the control
      (pyridostigmine+ placebo) or the test group (pyridostigmine + ondansetron) and treated for 6
      weeks. Following enrolment, patients may (if needed) titrate up their pyridostigmine dose at
      the investigator's discretion each week to the highest dose deemed appropriate, tolerable and
      safe by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any acute or chronic diseases, associated with GI distress (such as nausea, vomiting,
             diarrhea), which could interfere with the subjects' safety during the trial, expose
             them to undue risk, or interfere with the study objectives.

          2. History or presence of hepatic, or renal disease or other condition known to interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

             Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart
             failure, bradyarrhythmia's or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation.

          6. Treatment with drugs affecting peripheral cholinergic transmission within 1 month of
             study entry (with the exception of pyridostigmine).

          7. Subjects unlikely to co-operate during the study, and/or be questionably compliant in
             the opinion of the investigator.

          8. Patients currently being treated with narcotics.

          9. Patients being treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are contraindicated in
