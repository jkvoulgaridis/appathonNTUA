  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the world's population suffers from Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),
      that is a disease with an accumulation of fat in the liver. Some patients with NAFLD will
      progress in their disease to develop inflammation, scarring of the liver tissue, and
      cirrhosis that can lead to liver failure. The mechanisms of the disease and its progression
      are still not fully understood. It is therefore critical to find early markers that can
      identify the patients that will progress so that they can be treated early.

      A compound called L-carnitine, synthesised in the body from two amino acids; lysine and
      methionine, is critical for fat metabolism. Some studies have shown that it is decreased in
      liver disease patients and that L-carnitine supplementation can protect the liver function.

      This study aims to increase the understanding of the mechanisms behind NAFLD disease
      progression through its different stages. This may help diagnostic methods to be developed to
      predict the patients at risk for developing severe liver disease. Furthermore, fat metabolism
      and L-carnitine levels will be established in the different disease stages to evaluate
      whether fat metabolism could be compromised.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used for imaging of the whole liver and the heart to
      investigate metabolism and function non-invasively. Whole-body metabolism and how
      carbohydrates are taken up from diets are converted to fats in the body will be explored
      using stable isotope labelling. This study will recruit 30 participants with NAFLD; 10 each
      for low-risk NALFD, biopsy-proven NASH and compensated NASH cirrhosis. Participants will
      undergo MRI, followed by a stable isotope labelled study, where through blood- and breathe
      samples, metabolism will be investigated.

      An additional 10 healthy participants will be assessed using MR techniques to assess whether
      an injection of L-carnitine can lead to increase of L-carnitine in the liver such that it can
      be detected by MR. This is to validate a methodology prior to using it in NAFLD participants.

      STUDY 1: Functional and Metabolic Parameters in participants with NAFLD Participants will
      undertake two study visits, within a 14-day period. One of the visits will involve MR
      assessments that will take up to three hours in total. The second visit will involve a
      postprandial study day using stable isotopes. Baseline samples will be taken from
      participants, and after they have been fed a standardised test meal to assess whole-body and
      liver specific postprandial metabolism - this visit will last up to eight hours.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) and stable isotope labelling are two
      methodologies to investigate in vivo metabolism and function non-invasively. MRI gives
      information about liver structure and tissue composition, and heart function. MRS can also
      evaluate tissue energetics and composition using spectroscopy. Stable isotope-labelling
      studies allow for the measurement of whole-body fatty acid oxidation and de-novo lipogenesis
      in the pre- and post-prandial state. These two methodologies will be used in our study to
      evaluate participants with different severity of NAFLD and could help elucidate how the
      disease progresses.

      STUDY 2: MRI evaluation of L-carnitine In parallel to study 1, the physiological response to
      L-carnitine (50 mg/kg i.v.) will be investigated only in healthy participants with 1H MRS.

      These participants will only take part in one visit, during which they will undergo a
      baseline MRI scan, followed by the injection of L-carnitine. The MRI/MRS will be repeated two
      hours after the injection. AC has previously been measured in skeletal muscle using 1H MRS.
      In this study it will be measured in the septum of the heart and in the liver pre and 2 hours
      post-injection of 50 mg/kg i.v. of L-carnitine.
