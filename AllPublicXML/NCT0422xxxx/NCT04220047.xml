  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAAO) is sometimes performed during the
      cardiac surgery to reduce long-term risk of stroke.A previous study found that LAAO may be
      associated with increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation.New-onset atrial
      fibrillation (NOAF) after coronary artery bypass graft is related to an increased short-term
      and long term risk of stroke and mortality.Marshall ligament amputation may reduce the
      occurence of atrial fibrillation. However, little is known whether this approach is justified
      during the coronary artery bypass graft.Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether
      LAAO and Marshall ligament amputation during off-pump coronary artery bypass was associated
      with reduced risks of postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation and stroke.

    <description>Stroke is caused by a disruption in the flow of blood to part of the brain either because of occlusion of a blood vessel in the case of acute ischemic stroke （AIS） or the rupture of a blood vessel causing bleeding in or around the brain： intracerebral hemorrhage （ICH）or subarachnoid hemorrhage （SAH）。</description>
