  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single site, prospective, open label, observational, single arm trial in 30
      patients with type 2 diabetes with GI complaints using 1 or more oral or injectable
      anti-hyperglycemic agents to investigate if altering the microbiome though Pendulum T2D
      dietary supplementation can further enhance the efficacy of the current treatment while
      reducing the GI associated symptoms in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms exist in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
      that affect the quality of life negatively and substantially, although the underlying
      pathophysiology and relationship with glycemic control remain unclear. The current study aims
      to investigate if altering the microbiome though Pendulum T2D dietary supplementation can
      further enhance the efficacy of the current treatment while reducing the GI associated
      symptoms in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already on a stable dose of
      metformin alone and/or alongside other oral or injectable anti-hyperglycemic agents
      (sulfonylurea agents, DPPIV inhibitor,Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonist, sodium-glucose
      cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitor and/or insulin) and with present GI symptoms. The study is a
      single site, prospective, open label, observational, single arm trial in 30 patients with
      type 2 diabetes with GI complaints using 1 or more oral or injectable anti-hyperglycemic
      agent and an HbA1C between 6.5% and 9.5%. The study will be 8 weeks in duration (2 weeks
      baseline and 6 weeks product intervention), with an option to continue to 6 months for those
      willing to continue taking the dietary supplement. As the study is observational and the data
      are to be used to for the purpose of evaluating improvement in GI symptoms during the
      intervention with Pendulum T2D there is no specific method to determine sample size.

    <description>All bacteria contained in the study product formulation are commensal organisms that have been repeatedly documented to inhabit the human GI tract under normal circumstances. Pendulum's Glucose Control Formulation consists of five human commensal microbial strains including butyrate producing and mucin-degrading strains. The organisms were grown under controlled conditions consistent with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and employ no animal-derived products. All ingredients utilized during manufacturing were food grade and qualified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
The product is provided as acid-resistant capsules in bottles that are to be stored refrigerated at 4℃.</description>
