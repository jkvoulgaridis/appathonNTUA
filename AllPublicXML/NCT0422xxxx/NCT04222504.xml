  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to offer a package of evidence-based health services to women in
      three hair salons in the Umlazi township of Durban. Based on community feedback in previous
      survey and qualitative work, the package has been designed to include daily PrEP, family
      planning/contraceptives, and STI screening. Interested salon clients at intervention salons
      will elect which services to use. An additional three salons will serve as controls, offering
      no health services to clients. Surveys will be conducted in both salon groups. Attendance at
      follow-up visits for monitoring and medication refill will be encouraged using text message
      reminders, WhatsApp support groups, and lottery-based incentives for free salon services.
      Recruitment in intervention salons will conclude when 200 clients uptake PrEP. Two hundred
      participants will be recruited in control salons.
