  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a leading cause of brain injury in infants born before
      term. Severe IVH, which occurs nearly exclusively in very preterm infants (born before 32
      weeks gestation) who are already at risk of neurodevelopmental delays and cerebral palsy at
      baseline, results in a ~5 times higher risk of death or moderate-severe neurodevelopmental
      impairment, as well as short-term morbidities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
      Outcomes are worsened by the fact that the brains of these preterm infants are not fully
      developed, so the progenitor cells that would later differentiate and mature are damaged,
      resulting in hypomyelination and gray matter loss that are associated with poor
      neurodevelopmental outcomes. There is no available therapy to treat the IVH or resultant
      brain injury, other than symptomatic management for resultant post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus
      with lumbar punctures and temporary or permanent shunts, which have significant risks on
      their own.

      This is a phase I trial to determine whether fresh intranasal human milk (HM) can be safely
      delivered as stem cell therapy to preterm IVH patients within a 3-hour window from HM
      expression and to identify signals which would indicate whether intranasal HM stimulates the
      repair of damaged brain tissue. Outcomes will be compared to HM fed historical IVH controls.
      Recruitment will take place in tertiary care NICUs in Toronto, which care for the highest
      proportion of very preterm infants with IVH in Canada. These NICUs have already adopted a
      common protocolized approach to manage severe IVH and post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus with
      intensive monitoring, early symptomatic management, and detailed prospectively collected IVH
      data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Preterm infants (&lt;33 weeks gestation at birth, stratified &lt; and ≥28 weeks) with grade
        III IVH and/or grade IV IVH/intraparenchymal hemorrhage/infarction5 on head ultrasound in
        the first 10 days of life. Diagnostic criteria will be based on the Papile definitions as
        used by the study sites/Toronto Centre for Neonatal Health for PHVD management, outlined in
        the document &quot;Intraventricular Hemorrhage and Measurements of Lateral Ventricular Size from
        Head Ultrasound&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Disorders associated with neurodevelopmental delays or impairment (i.e. Trisomy 21)

          2. Moribund/critically ill infant or known lethal diagnosis with plans by medical team to
             redirect care

          3. Choanal atresia or anomalies that would not allow intranasal treatment

          4. Surgical condition (e.g. esophageal atresia) for which team feels intranasal HM is
             contraindicated

          5. Enrolled in other intervention trials in which primary target is neurodevelopmental
             outcome

          6. Parent with lactation contraindication(s) (i.e. HIV) or parent who declines lactation
             initiation

          7. Lactating parent unable to provide fresh HM: unable/unwilling to pump at study site or
             unable to have fresh HM delivered by designee at least once/day for 3 days within 3
             hours of pumping AND located (in hospital or home) &gt;30km from study sites (for courier
             services)
