      The 3 m walk-back test is used to assess neuromuscular control, proprioception, protective
      reflexes, fall risk, and balance. In a study of healthy elderly adults, a 3-m walk-back test
      showed better diagnostic accuracy compared to the most commonly used measurement methods for
      falls in the past year. Reliability is extremely important, especially for research and
      clinical applications. In order to assess the risk of falling, measurement methods need to be
      reliable and change accurately over time. 3 m walk back test was found to be reliable in
      healthy elderly individuals. However, there are no studies investigating the validity and
      reliability of this test in stroke patients.

      Balance; within the limits of the stability of the center of gravity can be controlled on the
      surface. Balance can be affected due to muscle weakness after stroke, abnormal muscle tone,
      loss of deep sensation and disturbances in vestibular mechanisms. Among all sensorimotor
      results of stroke, it is stated that the balance of postural control has the greatest effect
      on daily living activities and gait. Accurate assessment of balance in stroke patients is
      important in identifying appropriate aids for mobility, choosing an effective treatment
      program, determining safe and unsafe activities, and setting rehabilitation goals. The most
      common risk factor for falls is one of the most important risk factors for stroke. Therefore,
      reliable and accurate measurement of dynamic gait balance is an important issue in stroke
      patients.The 3 m walk-back test is used to assess neuromuscular control, proprioception,
      protective reflexes, fall risk, and balance. In a study of healthy elderly adults, a 3-m
      walk-back test showed better diagnostic accuracy compared to the most commonly used
      measurement methods for falls in the past year. Reliability is extremely important,
      especially for research and clinical applications. In order to assess the risk of falling,

    <measure>3-m backwards walk test,</measure>
    <time_frame>first day and second day</time_frame>
    <description>A distance of 3 m is measured and marked with black tape. Individuals are asked to follow the heel and black band. With the 'start' command they are asked to walk backwards quickly. When the distance of 3 m is completed, a stop is instructed. Individuals are not allowed to run during the test. They are allowed to look back if they wish. The assessor walks behind individuals throughout the test. The test is repeated 3 times, the averages are recorded</description>

    <measure>timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>first day</time_frame>
    <description>A standard chair is used for testing. First, the patient is asked to sit on the chair. The patient is then asked to stand up and walk regularly at a distance of 3 meters with a predetermined length, then return to the chair after 3 meters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 m walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>first day</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, the individual is asked to walk at his / her normal speed within a pre-measured 10-meter area and is started when the individual is at the starting line of the foot and terminated when he crosses the finish line.</description>
