  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of individualized treatment
      of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in Chinese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and to
      investigate the dose-concentration-response (DER) relationship between thiopurine metabolites
      and adverse events. The individualized administration of 6-MP was established in Chinese
      children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To inflict minimal pain on the child contributing blood samples, opportunistic sampling
      design was chosen to collect pharmacokinetic samples.

    <measure>thiopurine-induced leukopenia</measure>

    <measure>hepatotoxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
