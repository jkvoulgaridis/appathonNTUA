      The aim of this study is to compare the short-term effects of ACEi and angiotensin II
      receptor blockers on cardiac and renal protection in black type 2 diabetics patients CARE-PLP
      is a double-arm, double-blind, randomized and parallel clinical trial conducted at the
      National Obesity Center in the Yaoundé Central Hospital. A population of Type 2 diabetes
      patients, with hypertension and / or microalbuminuria and who are not taking ACEi or
      angiotensin receptors blockers, is randomize into two groups. Depending on the group, 10 mg
      Perindopril or 100 mg Losartan is add to the usual treatment for each patient. The patients
      are followed-up for a period of 08 weeks. The primary outcome is the variation of exercise
      induced urinary albumin excretion after 08 weeks of intervention.

      Given the particularity of the renin-angiotensin system in black subjects, the CARE-PLP study
      fulfills this objective with the comparison of Losartan and Perindopril after 08 weeks of
      administration in a subsaharan African population.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the short-term effects of ACEi and angiotensin II
      receptor blockers on cardiac and renal protection in black type 2 diabetics patients

      Methods: CARE-PLP is a double-arm, double-blind, randomized and parallel clinical trial
      conducted at the National Obesity Center in the Yaoundé Central Hospital. A population of
      Type 2 diabetes patients, with hypertension and / or microalbuminuria and who are not taking
      ACEi or angiotensin receptors blockers, is randomize into two groups. Depending on the group,
      10 mg Perindopril or 100 mg Losartan is add to the usual treatment for each patient. The
      patients are followed-up for a period of 08 weeks. The primary outcome is the variation of
      exercise induced urinary albumin excretion after 08 weeks of intervention.

      Progress: Recruitment for CARE-PLP was completed in february 2018 with 29 patients.

    <masking_description>The double-blind model is applied to the study. Only the adjudicator, responsible for the distribution of medication knew the different regimes. Perindopril and Losartan were packaged in boxes of identical appearance and labeled for each participant by name and number of the randomization program. The randomization and packaging of the drugs was done by an investigator who had no clinical involvement.</masking_description>
