  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will look at a drug called SEA-CD70 to find out if it is safe for patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It will study SEA-CD70 to
      find out what its side effects are and if it works for AML and MDS. A side effect is anything
      the drug does besides treating cancer.

      This study will have three groups or &quot;parts.&quot; Part A will find out how much SEA-CD70 should
      be given to patients. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-CD70
      is and if it works to treat patients with MDS. Part C will use the dose found in Part A to
      find out how safe SEA-CD70 is and if it works to treat patients with AML.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, and cohort expansion study
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and antitumor activity of SEA-CD70 in
      adults with myeloid malignancies. The study will be conducted in up to 3 parts.

      Part A is a dose escalation cohort designed to identify the MTD or recommended expansion dose
      of SEA-CD70 in subjects with relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS. Part B is an expansion
      cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS. Part C is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in subjects with relapsed/refractory AML.
