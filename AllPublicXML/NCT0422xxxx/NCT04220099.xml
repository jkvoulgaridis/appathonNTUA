  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to explore quantitative Electroencephalogram(qEEG) biomarkers
      that would predict Electroconvulsive Therapy(ECT) Response in Schizophrenia (SZD). The
      investigators will recruit 30 SZD patients who are preparing for ECT treatment and assesse
      psychotic symptoms using Positive and Negative symptom scale(PANSS) before and after
      8-sessions clinical course of ECT treatment. These patients needed ECT treatment are assessed
      by clinicians according to American Psychiatric Association(APA) guidelines. Meanwhile
      resting EEG will be recorded for 10 minutes before the first episode of ECT treatment.
      Decrease of PANSS scores will be calculated after the last session of ECT treatment to
      distinguish responder/non-responder.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and negative syndrome scale（PANSS）score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It assessed the severity of psychotic symptoms.The responder on PANSS is defined as a PANSS decrease at least 25% from the baseline at post-treatment. PANSS helps us divide cases into response and nonresponse group.</description>

    <measure>EEG functional connectivity difference between response and nonresponse group</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a predictive indicator collected before ECT treatment. After treatment, we divided 30 patients into response and nonresponse group using PANSS. Then we explore differences in pretreatment EEG functional connectivity at different frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Theta) to find a predictable biomarker for ECT treatment effect.</description>
