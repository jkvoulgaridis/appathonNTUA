  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disorder that affects approximately
      400,000 Danish citizens. About 3,000-3,500 Danes die yearly because of the disorder, and the
      costs associated with hospital admissions are estimated to be 535 million Danish kroner
      (DKK). Patients with COPD risk a worsening of their disorder, and in most cases, this will
      require hospitalization. One of the used treatments is providing oxygen to the patients via
      e.g. masks. The recommendations on oxygen treatment are currently based on a study from 2010
      where 37% of the participants in this study did not receive the intended treatment, which may
      have had massive effects on the results. It is worrying that no other studies have shown
      which oxygen treatment is safest for the patients. As such, we deem it important to study how
      best to treat the patients.

      Our study is of high clinical relevance as hospitals receive patients with worsening of COPD
      daily. We need more, better data regarding the oxygen treatment of our patients, in order to
      provide our patients with the best possible care. The purpose of our study is thus to
      determine which oxygen treatment is best for patients with acute worsening of COPD symptoms.
      We will use a prospective, randomized controlled open-label trial. We will use two
      treatments: Treatment 1 is giving oxygen to the patient to reach a peripheral oxygen
      saturation of above 94%. Treatment 2 is giving oxygen to reach a peripheral oxygen saturation
      of between 88% and 92%.

      Our primary outcome is 30-day all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes being 7-day
      all-cause mortality, need for non-invasive ventilation, intubation or intensive care
      admission, over-all length of hospital stay and respiratory acidosis.

      We believe that a lower oxygen saturation percentage may be superior as one study (Austin et
      al., 2010) showed a lower mortality rate in the group of patients that had a lower peripheral
      oxygen saturation. Additionally, the risk of respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia were lower.
      We wish to perform our study in the hospital sector as this study was performed in the
      prehospital sector and thus their results cannot be translated directly.
