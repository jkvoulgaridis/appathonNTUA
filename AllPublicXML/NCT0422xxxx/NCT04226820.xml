  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen is required for an optimal muscle function. In patients with diabetes mellitus,
      hyperglycemia can cause vascular complications. The endothelium (inter layer of the blood
      vessels) can be damaged leading to a reduced oxygen flow towards the muscle cells. Besides,
      it is possible that mitochondrial dysfunction is occuring leading to reduced extraction of
      oxygen.

      Both conditions will lead to a reduced flow of oxygen towards the muscle and this can have
      impact on the production of energy necessary for optimal functioning.

      In this study, the investigators will examine the functionality of the blood vessels (1) and
      the uptake of oxygen into the muscles (2) in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 and type
      2 (with and without vascular complications) compared to healthy persons.

      The investigators plan to recruit in total 125 participants who will be divided into 3 main
      groups: (I) diabetes mellitus type 1 (with (a) or without (b) vascular complications), (II)
      diabetes mellitus type 2 (with (a) or without (b) vascular complications), and (III) healthy
      persons. Diabetes mellitus will be defined by the guidelines of the American Diabetes
      Association (ADA).

      The examinations for this study consist of a blood pressure assessment, Flow Mediated
      Dilatation (FMD)-measurement, and a handgrip exercise test. The protocol will take
      approximately 2 hours.

      The investigator who performs the FMD-test followed a course and passed thorough evaluation.

      The blood pressure assessment will be continuously for 20 minutes to avoid large bias.

    <masking_description>There is no masking because the participant knows his diagnosis. Besides, the investigator checks the blood sugar at different times during the examinations, so also the investigator is not blinded.
