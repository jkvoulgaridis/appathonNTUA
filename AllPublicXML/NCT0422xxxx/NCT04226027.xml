  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of a novel approach to
      personalizing behavioral interventions for self-management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to
      individuals' behavioral and glycemic profiles discovered using computational learning and
      self-monitoring data. This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial with n=280
      participants recruited from the participating Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The
      participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group and the usual care (control)
      group with 1-1 allocation ratio. Half of the participants (n=140) will be randomly assigned
      to a usual care (control) group. Both groups will receive standard diabetes education at
      their respective FQHC site. In addition, the experimental group will receive instructions to
      use T2.coach for a minimum of 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main difficulties in managing diabetes is that each affected individual requires
      personally tailored combination of diet, exercise, and medication to effectively control
      their blood sugar. Rather than strictly following a doctor's prescription, individuals need
      to carefully examine their lifestyle choices and their impact on their health. Independent
      learning, experimentation and problem solving become of great importance. However, they can
      be challenging for individuals with diabetes. In this project, the investigators will refine
      and evaluate a novel intervention for diabetes self-management that uses computational
      analysis of self-monitoring data to help individuals with type 2 diabetes identify what daily
      activities, including consumption of meals, physical activity, and sleep, have impact on
      blood glucose levels, and suggest modifications to these daily activities to improve blood
      glucose levels.

      Growing evidence highlights significant differences in glycemic function and cultural,
      social, and economical circumstances of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that impact
      their self-management. Precision medicine strives to personalize medical treatment to an
      individual's genetic makeup, computationally discovered clinical phenotypes and lifestyle.
      Studies showed the benefits of tailoring not only medical treatment, but also behavioral
      interventions. Yet, currently, personalization of self-management in T2DM requires each
      individual to engage in discovery, reflection, and problem-solving—critical but cognitively
      demanding activities—or to rely on their healthcare providers. Both of these may present
      considerable barriers to individuals from medically under-served low income communities.
      Mobile health (mHealth) solutions in T2DM bring promise of reaching wider populations in need
      of self-management; however, few such solutions provide assistance with personalizing
      self-management behaviors. Ongoing efforts on personalizing behavioral interventions outside
      of T2DM focus on tailoring behavior modification techniques to individuals' psycho-social
      characteristics, such as self-efficacy ), and tailoring delivery of intervention to
      individuals' context rather than on personalizing self-management strategies.

      The ongoing focus of this research is on developing informatics interventions for diabetes
      self-management, with a specific focus on discovery with self-monitoring data and on
      problem-solving for improving glycemic control. In the proposed research the investigators
      introduce T2.coach, an mHealth intervention that uses computational analysis of
      self-monitoring data to identify behavioral patterns associated with poor glycemic control
      and formulate personalized behavioral goals for changing problematic behaviors. This study
      will evaluate T2.coach's efficacy in a two-arm RCT with stratified randomization conducted
      with Clinical Directors Network (CDN), a well-recognized primary care practice-based research
      network (PBRN) of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and Agency for Healthcare
      Research and Quality (AHRQ)-designated Center of Excellence (P30) for Practice-based Research
      and Learning.

    <description>T2.coach is a smartphone app for low-burden capture of diet and blood glucose (BG) levels and for reviewing past records, integrated with FitBit for captured of physical activity and sleep. All captured data are sent to the computational inference engine that uses machine learning methods and expert system to formulate personalized behavioral goals. Examples of behavioral goals include the following: &quot;For high carbohydrate breakfasts, reduce your carbs to be about 1 carb choice. Examples of 1 carb choice are 1 slice of whole wheat toast, 1 cup of oatmeal, or 1 apple.&quot; The T2.coach chatbot companion uses text messages to help individuals set goals that are consistent with evidence based guidelines for diabetes self-management, inferences on data captured with T2.coach, and their own preferences, as well as send individuals goal reminders and prompts for reflection on goal achievement.</description>
