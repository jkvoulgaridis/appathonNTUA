  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: it is well known that most serious complications of infective endocarditis (IE)
      appear in the so-called &quot;critical phase&quot; of the disease, which are the first days after
      diagnosis. Subsequently, the vast majority of patients who overcome this acute phase has a
      favourable evolution, and usually stay in the hospital for a long time only to complete
      antibiotic therapy.

      In stable patients with adequate response to antibiotic treatment, without signs of
      persistent infection or metastatic foci such as spondylodiscitis, it is likely that a shorter
      antibiotic regimen would be an efficient and safe alternative, as has already been confirmed
      in patients with IE on tricuspid valves caused by a microorganism considered virulent such as
      S. aureus. This attractive alternative would improve patients' quality of life, save costs,
      and decrease the risk of complications related to the adverse effects of prolonged antibiotic
      treatment.

      Objectives: to compare the incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality,
      unplanned cardiac surgery, symptomatic embolisms and relapses within 6 months after the
      inclusion between patients with IE caused by gram-positive cocci receiving a short-course of
      2 weeks of antibiotic therapy and those patients receiving conventional antibiotic therapy
      (4-6 weeks).

      Methodology: multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled open-label, phase IV clinical
      trial. Sample: patients with IE caused by gram-positive cocci, having received at least 10
      days of conventional antibiotic treatment, and at least 7 days after surgery when indicated,
      without clinical, analytical, microbiological or echocardiographic signs of persistent
      infection. Estimated sample size: 298 patients. Intervention: Control group: standard
      antibiotic therapy, according to ESC guidelines recommendations, for 4 to 6 weeks.
      Experimental group: short-course antibiotic therapy for 2 weeks. The prevalence of previously
      known risk factors for adverse events will be compared between the two groups to confirm that
      randomization have worked properly. The incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause
      mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, symptomatic embolisms and relapses within 6 months
      after the inclusion in the study will be prospectively registered and compared.

          -  Definite IE, according to modified ESC 2015 criteria, caused by gram-positive cocci
             (staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci), including native, prosthetic valve IE
             and cardiac device-related IE.
