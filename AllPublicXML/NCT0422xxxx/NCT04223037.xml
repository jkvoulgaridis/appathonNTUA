    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the immunogenicity and safety of a purified inactivated JE vaccine
      compared to a commercialized JE vaccine. In this phase III, randomized, blind trial, infants
      at 6-23 months of age were randomly assigned to three groups to receive experimental vaccine
      or control vaccine with two different vaccination schedule respectively.

    <textblock>
      The clinical study used randomized, blind method, commercialize inactivated Japanese
      encephalitis vaccine as control. In Infants at 6-23 months of age were injected with
      experimental vaccine with 0,7 days and 0,28 days vaccination schedule to evaluate
      immunogenicity and safety of the experimental vaccine and the effectiveness of different
      vaccination schedule. Participates were assigned to three groups (350 per group): group 1
      with experimental vaccine using 0,7 days vaccination schedule; group 2 with control vaccine
      using 0, 7 days vaccination schedule; group 3 with experimental vaccine using 0, 28
      vaccination schedule.

      Blood samples were collected before immunization and 30 days after immunization, and the
      neutralization antibody of Japanese encephalitis was detected by plaque reduction
      neutralization test. Medical observation was conducted 30 minutes after each injection. Body
      temperature of participates was continuously measured for 7 days, and any adverse events were
      observed and recorded from the first dose to 30 days after the whole vaccination. Serious
      adverse events were collected within 6 months after the first dose.

    <description>The main endpoint of safety observation was 30 days after 2 doses vaccination. If serious adverse reactions related to vaccines occur during the observation period, or the adverse reactions of grade 3 and above reached 10%, or three symptoms similar to grade 3 and above occur within 24 hours, the trial should be suspended and vaccine-related adverse reactions occurred. The death of the subjects will be terminated at any time. Follow up and collection of serious adverse events within 6 months after first dose immunization via close monitoring or diary card.</description>
