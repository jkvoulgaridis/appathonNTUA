  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intimate life of patients with cystic fibrosis has not been the subject of specific
      research, it is even left behind in favor of respiratory, digestive or endocrinological
      dysfunctions endangering these patients. After 16 years of practice, it is significant that
      this subject is problematic, painful but difficult to tackle; No doubt just as much on the
      side of caregivers: this question has never found its way into team exchanges, it seems to be
      evaded doubtless difficult or too intimate to welcome. These disorders arise from the effects
      of the disease on the health of the mucous epithelial tissues also located in the genital
      area. These difficulties are more closely approached by the difficulties of procreation; PMA
      allows them to get around them, nevertheless making it possible to be a parent, with the
      residual frustration of a satisfactory sex life: a deaf &quot;addition&quot;, adding to many care
      constraints.

      It is therefore in terms of sexual health and quality of sexual life that it is desirable to
      shed light on this aspect of cystic fibrosis in women.

      Bibliographic research confirms this approach: this subject is not explored, the rare
      publications concern the vulnerability of the cervix or the difficulty on both sides of
      tackling this subject.
