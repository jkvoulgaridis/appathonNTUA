      One way to help Veterans improve their diabetes control is through the use of technology to
      help provide information, motivation, and reminders necessary to support diabetes
      self-management. The study will seek input from diverse groups of Veterans living with
      diabetes to help develop DD-TXT, a new customizable, interactive texting intervention that
      allows Veterans to choose what kinds of diabetes self-management support they need, and when.
      This diabetes support will be provided to Veterans through &quot;Annie&quot;, a new VA texting system
      for self-management support. Patients will be randomized to receive DD-TXT or an
      education-only texting intervention called DSE that is based on a diabetes skills workbook in
      order to test the comparative effectiveness of DD-TXT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes is a common, complex health condition which can result in many serious and
      costly health complications if not treated and controlled properly. One in four Veterans are
      diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. Vulnerable Veterans, such as minority, low-income, or rural
      Veterans, and Veterans with comorbid mental health diagnoses, are disproportionately affected
      and are less likely to have their diabetes under control. The goal of this study, using a
      randomized comparative effectiveness design, is to test the comparative effectiveness of an
      interactive, tailored self-management texting protocol (DD-TXT), versus a traditional
      education-only intervention (DSE) in a sample of Veterans with uncontrolled diabetes.

      The investigators will recruit from Veterans age 18 years and above who are actively
      receiving care at the study sites (as determined by upcoming scheduled appointment) who have
      uncontrolled glucose (HbA1c &gt;= 8.0% for at least 50% of the most recent 6 months).
      Participants who meet these conditions and enroll in the study will be randomized to one of
      two groups. Those randomized to the intervention group will receive text messages from the
      DD-TXT protocol for 6 months, and those in the comparison group will receive text messages
      from DSE, a diabetes skills education-only texting protocol, for 6 months. The primary
      outcome will be HbA1c percent time in control. Secondary outcomes include self-reported
      adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations (SCI-R), diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes
      distress, LDL, and blood pressure control. The investigators hypothesize that DD-TXT will
      result in better proximal health outcomes and diabetes self-management behaviors vs an
      education-only protocol (DSE).

    <intervention_model_description>Once consented by project coordinators, patients will be asked to complete the baseline survey instruments. Participants will then be randomized with stratification by gender, using a separate randomization table per site. The investigators will first recruit women, with the goal of achieving 10-20% of the sample at each site. The investigators will then recruit male Veterans until the investigators obtain 200 to DD-TXT and 200 to DSE, for a total of 400 enrolled across sites.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants in this group will be signed up for an interactive, tailored self-management texting protocol (DD-TXT). The DD-TXT protocol will consist of: Core Messaging: Customizable core modules on medication management, blood sugar and blood pressure monitoring, preventive care, problem solving, appointment reminders, administrative messages; and Optional Messaging: A library of patient-selected modules (e.g. nutrition, physical activity, weight management, emotional coping, goal setting) designed to motivate and educate.</description>

DSE contains only one-way educational content consisting only of content from the VA educational workbook entitled &quot;Self-Care Skills for the Person with Diabetes&quot;, which was created in alignment with VA/DoD diabetes guidelines and is recommended for patients as part of usual care. Everyone in the DSE arm will receive the same daily text messages taken verbatim or almost verbatim from the content of the workbook but shortened to fit the 160-character limit of a text message.
