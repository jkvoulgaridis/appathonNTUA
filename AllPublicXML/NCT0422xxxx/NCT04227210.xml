  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an investigational vaccine designed to protect humans against infection
      with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The investigational vaccine (MV-012-968) is
      administered as drops in the nose. This study specifically analyzes the safety of, and the
      immune response to, the vaccine when administered to healthy non-pregnant adults between the
      ages of 18 and 40 years.

    <intervention_model_description>Each enrolled subject will be allocated to 1 of 2 study groups. Group 1 will receive one dosage of the investigational RSV vaccine, and Group 2 will receive a different dosage of the same vaccine.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Solicited adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of solicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Solicited AEs are predefined AEs that can occur after vaccine administration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unsolicited AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of unsolicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Unsolicited AEs are any untoward medical occurrences in a participant administered the investigational vaccine, regardless of causal relationship to the investigational vaccine. Unsolicited AEs can include unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with the use of the investigational vaccine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Vaccination through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of SAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. SAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, that threaten life or result in any of the following: death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medically attended adverse events (MAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Vaccination through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of MAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. MAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, with unscheduled medically attended visits, such as urgent care visits, acute primary care visits, emergency department visits, or other previously unplanned visits to a medical provider. Scheduled medical visits such as routine physicals, wellness checks, 'check-ups', and vaccinations, are not considered MAEs.</description>

    <measure>Change in serum RSV-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Post-vaccination change in serum RSV-specific nAb titers will be measured per participant.</description>

    <measure>Change in serum RSV F-specific binding antibody titers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Potential vaccine virus shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The presence and, if detected, quantity and duration of any shed vaccine virus will be measured per participant.</description>
