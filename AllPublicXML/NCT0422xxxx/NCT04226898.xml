  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if taking a synbiotic supplement versus a placebo
      will reduce symptoms of schizophrenia when used in addition to standard antipsychotic
      medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of n=68 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have residual
      psychotic symptoms which are of at least moderate severity will be randomized. Intestinal
      inflammation will be assessed through the measurement of antibodies to Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, gliadin, Candida albicans as well as high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein and
      Pentraxin-3. The duration of the trial is 14 weeks: after a 2-week placebo run in, the
      participants will be randomized to receive the synbiotic compound or identical-appearing
      placebo over the 12 weeks of the randomized phase. The synbiotic compound is a quality-tested
      product, Probio-Tec ABCG-Stick-25, manufactured by ChrHansen which contains 4 strains of
      probiotic microorganisms - Bifidobacteria BB-12, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus
      acidophilus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus - and the prebiotic, inulin, a fructan-containing
      polysaccharide which has been shown to increase the level of non-pathogenic bacteria in the
      gastrointestinal tract. All participants will also be maintained on a stable regimen of
      psychiatric medications prescribed by their treating psychiatrist.

    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Score From the Start to the End of the Double-blind Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (week 2 to week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) measures psychiatric symptomatology, especially related to psychosis. The complete PANSS contains ratings for 30 symptoms, including 7 positive symptoms, 7 negative symptoms, and 16 general psychiatric symptoms. The severity of each symptom is rated on a scale ranging from 1 (minimal) to 7 (extreme); higher scores indicate increased symptomatology. Total PANSS scores include scores from all categories and range from 30 to 210 units on a scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) score from the start of the placebo run-in to the end of the double-blind phase</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks (week 0 to week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance is measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery composite score in participants. MCCB is comprised of 10 tests: Trail Making Test Part A; Brief Assessment in Cognition in Schizophrenia Symbol Coding; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span; Letter Number Sequencing; Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Mazes; Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised; Category Fluency Animal Naming; Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test Managing Emotions; and Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs. For each test, a score is derived based on the raw item values. Each of the individual item raw scores is standardized to age and gender corrected tscores which are then summed to convert into a composite score ranging from &lt;214-&gt;486 based on the MCCB scoring manual, with a higher score reflecting better performance.</description>

    <measure>Intestinal Inflammation Markers (#1) Antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Week 8, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of intestinal inflammation will be assessed by the measurement of antibodies by immunoassays to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (All of the immunoassays will be analyzed on the same scale. This is accomplished by standardizing the optical density values obtained from the immunoassays to those of a control population without a psychiatric disorder normalized to have a mean value of 1 and a standard deviation of 1. To adjust for multiple comparisons in the analysis of the 5 markers, the false discovery correction of Benjamani-Hochberg will be used.)</description>
