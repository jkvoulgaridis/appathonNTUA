  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ERADAL-HF is a double blinded, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, three arm study,
      enrolled ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      class II/III], with iron deficiency [defined as ferritin &lt;100 ng/mL, or ferritin 100-300
      ng/mL if transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;20%] and haemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 15 g/dL. Patients were
      randomized 1:1:1 to treatment into three arms: a first group treated with intravenous iron
      supplementation, a second treated by intramuscular iron supplementation and the third one
      which have received placebo. These patients were followed-up during a period of 04 weeks.

      The aim of this study is to assess the short term effect of parenteral iron supplementation
      on exercise tolerance and oxidative stress in patients with stable chronic heart failure and
      iron deficiency

      The aim of this study is to assess the short term effect of parenteral iron supplementation
      on exercise tolerance and oxidative stress in patients with stable chronic heart failure and
      iron deficiency in a sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, it will also try to evaluate its
      effectiveness using the intramuscular route and this with a simplified administration scheme.

             beta blocker unless contraindicated or not tolerated and diuretic if indicated.

          -  Subject must be capable of completing the 6MWT

             transfusion in previous 6 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Oral iron therapy at doses &gt;100 mg/day in previous 1 week prior to randomization.
             Note: ongoing use of multivitamins containing iron &lt;75 mg/day is permitted.

          -  Body weight ≤35 kg.

          -  Exercise training programme(s) in the 3 months prior to screening or planned in the
             next 6 months.

          -  Chronic liver disease (including active hepatitis) and/or screening alanine
             transaminase or aspartate transaminase above three times the upper limit of the normal
