  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miniscrew-supported maxillary expanders provide advantages over conventional tooth-supported
      expanders. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding their activation
      protocol. The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate and compare the effects of slow
      and rapid activation rates of miniscrew-supported expanders on the skeletal changes,
      dento-alveolar changes and the pain experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transverse maxillary deficiency is one of the problems that are commonly encountered in the
      orthodontic practice. Miniscrew-supported maxillary expansion represents a promising modality
      for the treatment of transverse maxillary deficiency. However, controversies still exist
      regarding the activation protocol. One of these controversies is whether using a slow
      activation protocol would be more beneficial to the patients compared to a rapid activation
      protocol. Another question that consequently ensues is whether such activation protocol would
      result in less pain compared to the rapid activation protocol.

      The null hypothesis of the current study is that there is no difference between slow and
      rapid activation protocols of miniscrew-supported expander.
