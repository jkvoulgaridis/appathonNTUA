  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effect of myocardial microcirculation disturbance on coronary flow reserve
      fraction, compare the evaluation value of IMR, FFR and QCA on myocardial ischemia, and
      discuss the correlation among them.

    <textblock>
      In this study, 60 patients with critical lesions indicated by coronary angiography will be
      admitted. The investigators collected the basic clinical data (gender, age, body mass index,
      smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), laboratory data (creatinine,
      cholesterol, triglycerides) and measured their FFR and IMR.

    <description>FFR measurement: Pressure guid wire(radianalyzer Xpress 12711) is produced in Switzerland. After the pressure of the aorta and the pressure guide wire is balanced, Send the pressure guide wire to the distal part of the lesion(more than 20 mm away from the lesion) . Adenosine is injected into the vein,then,record the FFR index 3 times and take the average value as the final measurement index.</description>
