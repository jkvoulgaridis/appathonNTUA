  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the possible role of serum sodium concentration and its changes on bone
      markers in hospitalized, hyponatremic patients is determined. Therefore, it is investigated
      whether in hospitalized, hyponatremic patients the level of carboxy-terminal collagen
      crosslinks (CTX) is modified by changes in plasma sodium concentration, independently from
      the aetiology of hyponatremia.

      Biological material, i.e. blood samples, will be handled according to good clinical practice
      and good laboratory practice. Samples will be collected in secure containers (Sarstedt
      Monovette®) and will be centrifuged to collect serum. Serum will be stored at - 70°C in a
      thermo-controlled ultra-deep freezer.
