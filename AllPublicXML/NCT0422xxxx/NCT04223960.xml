      The drug being tested in this study is called EA1080. EA1080 is being tested to find a safe
      and well-tolerated dose in healthy Caucasian and Japanese male participants. The study
      consists of 4 parts as mentioned below:

      Part 1: Single ascending dose Formulation A:

        -  Part 1A: In healthy adult Caucasian male participants

        -  Part 1B: In healthy adult Japanese male participants

      Part 2: Bioavailability (BA) and Food Effect (FE):

        -  Part 2A: Four-way cross-over single dose (SD) in healthy adult Caucasian male
           participants for Formulation A and B

        -  Part 2B: Two-way cross-over SD in healthy adult Japanese male participants for FE for
           selected formulation chosen from Part 2A

      Part 3: SAD of the chosen formulation:

        -  Part 3A: In healthy adult Caucasian male participants for selected formulation chosen
           from Part 2A

        -  Part 3B: In healthy adult Japanese male participants for selected formulation chosen
           from Part 2A

        -  Part 3C: SD of Formulation C in healthy adult Caucasian male participants

      Part 4: Multiple ascending dose (MAD) of the chosen formulation:

        -  Part 4A: In healthy adult Caucasian male participants for selected formulation chosen
           from Part 2A

        -  Part 4B: In healthy adult Japanese male participants for selected formulation chosen
           from Part 2A
