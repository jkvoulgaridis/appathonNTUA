      A study to assess safety, tolerability and clinical effects of single and repeat dose
      intra-articular administration of UBX0101 in patients with moderate to severe painful knee
      osteoarthritis (OA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted as two parallel
      cohorts to assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of single dose (SD) and
      repeat dose (RD) intra-articular (IA) administration of UBX0101 in patients with symptomatic
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      Approximately 36 patients will be randomly assigned to either Cohort 1 (SD) or Cohort 2 (RD)
      (18 patients per treatment cohort) and further randomized in a 2:1 ratio to UBX0101 and
      placebo in each cohort.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SD and RD IA
      administration of UBX0101 over 24 weeks.

             participation in the study or that could interfere with the study objectives, conduct,
             or evaluation or prevent the patient from fully participating in all aspects of the
             study.

          -  Patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m².

          -  Patients with fibromyalgia.

          -  Systemic autoimmune disease with musculoskeletal involvement or any history of a

             acid derivatives within the last 16 weeks prior to Screening, or with extended-release
             corticosteroid (e.g., Zilretta®) within the last 20 weeks.

          -  Patients who are using a topical NSAID or topical analgesics on the target knee.

          -  Patients who have used opioid analgesics (other than tramadol), marijuana or

             knee within 8 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Patients with a history of traumatic knee injury to the target knee, including, but
             not limited to, patients with meniscal root tear, within 2 years of study entry.

             6 months.

          -  Patients who have undergone arthroscopic surgery (including microfracture and
             meniscectomy) on the target knee in the last 2 years prior to the Screening visit or
             are anticipated to have arthroscopic surgery on either knee at any time during the
             study period.

          -  Patients with a history of previous total or partial knee arthroplasty in the target
