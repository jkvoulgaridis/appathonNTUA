      A study of CTA101 UCAR-T cell injection in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-line
      hematological malignancy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed
      or refractory CD19+ B-line hematological malignancy: B-ALL and B-NHL. the selection of dose
      levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical tiral of similar foreign products. 2
      groups of patients will be enrolled, 36 in each group. Primary objective is to explore the
      safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
