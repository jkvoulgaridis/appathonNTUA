    <textblock>
      To determine whether the use of 3,3'-Dioxo-2,2'-Bisindolylidene-5,5'-Disulfonate Disodium
      0.8% Solution for injection provides a visualization advantage compared to saline when used
      as an aid in the determination of ureteral patency

      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of two doses (2.5 mL and 5.0 mL) of
      3,3'-Dioxo-2,2'-bisindolylidene-5,5'-disulfonate disodium solution for injection when used as
      an aid in the determination of ureteral patency. Study will enroll up to 116 subjects from
      approximately 10 study centers in the United States.
