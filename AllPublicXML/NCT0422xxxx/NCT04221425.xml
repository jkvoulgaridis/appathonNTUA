  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement (THR) is one of the most common interventions in orthopedic surgery.

      Rehabilitation is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of the surgery.
      Tele-rehabilitation programs after orthopedic surgery have proven their effectiveness,
      validity and cost-efficacy.

      It seems of interest to test the potential advantages of early virtual reality based
      rehabilitation programs after total hip arthroplasty compared to standard care. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the functional recovery following total hip arthroplasty and home
      telerehabilitation programs with a virtual reality based system.

    <measure>BARTHEL INDEX (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (before surgery (T0)), 4 ± 1 days after the surgery (T1), 15 ± 1 days after the surgery (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>the BI assesses the ability of an individual to care for him/herself. Its scores ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete independence</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (before surgery (T0)), 4 ± 1 days after the surgery (T1), 15 ± 1 days after the surgery (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) explores an individual's physical, psychological and social function. Its scores ranges from 18 (lowest) to 126 (highest)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 ± 1 days after the surgery (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The GPE scale asks the patient to rate, on a numerical scale from 1 to 5, where lower scores correspond to worse perceived effect, how much has the treatment received helped</description>
