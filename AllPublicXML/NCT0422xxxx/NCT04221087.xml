  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot randomized control trial to determine the efficacy of
      dexamethasone use in hospitalized children who are less than 2 years of age with
      non-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis admitted to the University of Pittsburgh
      Medical Center (UPMC) Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from February 1 to May 31, 2022. It
      is hypothesized that the use of standard airway-dose steroids (0.6mg/kg dexamethasone) will
      improve the clinical outcome of children hospitalized for non-RSV bronchiolitis, which will
      be evident by decreased length of stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh with patients admitted to
      the general pediatric service. The attending physician on the clinical service team will
      identify patients diagnosed with bronchiolitis. If the participant meets inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, a member from the study team will then meet with the participant's family
      to discuss the study and obtained informed consent. A participant may have had a rapid
      RSV/influenza testing already complete for clinical purposes. If this has been done,
      participants will be asked to obtain a secondary nasopharyngeal swab so that it may be tested
      for a full respiratory viral panel for statistical stratification. Once rapid testing is
      obtained and results are negative for both RSV and influenza, the participant will then be
      randomized to either the intervention (dexamethasone) or control (placebo) arm of the study.
      Study members will calculate a modified Tal score (MTS) at time of consent and then 12-24
      hours after medication administration. Throughout admission, participants will also receive
      standard of care for bronchiolitis, which may include regular vital sign evaluation,
      supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids or nasogastric tube feedings, and anti-pyretic
      therapy. Because this is a pilot study, the study will be underpowered, however, this study
      will provide data that will allow the investigators to estimate the sample size needed for a
      future study. The number of time points to be used for the generalized estimating equation
      can be determined ad hoc to include a reasonably balanced sample to make the comparison
      valid.

          3. Admitted to the general pediatric service at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh

          4. Ability of a parent or guardian to understand and comply with the study procedures

          5. Signed written informed consent by parent or guardian

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Preterm birth &lt; 35 weeks

          2. Presence of underlying cardiopulmonary, neuromuscular, or other complex disease

          3. Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit

          4. Co-infection with influenza infection or concomitant bacterial infection (such as
             pneumonia or AOM)

          5. History of allergy or reaction to steroids

          6. History of an underlying chronic medical condition -including chronic heart disease,
             chronic lung disease (except asthma),congenital anomalies of the airways or lung,
             cystic fibrosis, chronic renal disease including nephrotic syndrome, protein losing
             enteropathy of any cause, severe malnutrition, neurocognitive disorders, metabolic
             disorders (including phenylketonuria), or genetic disorders (note: genetic syndromes
             such as Down syndrome and Edwards Syndrome are excluded; however, children with
             genetic disorders (e.g., hemophilia) but who do not have a genetic syndrome may not
             satisfy this particular exclusion criterion; it is important that children with such
             genetic disorders do not have symptoms and/or comorbidities that would pose additional
             risk to them nor jeopardize the adequacy of study assessments.&quot;)

             virus infection, primary immunodeficiency, anatomic or functional asplenia; receipt of
             a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant at any time; receipt of

             systemic corticosteroids for more than 7 consecutive days during the past 14 days.

          8. Any other condition that in the judgment of the investigator precludes participation
             because it could affect the safety of the subject
