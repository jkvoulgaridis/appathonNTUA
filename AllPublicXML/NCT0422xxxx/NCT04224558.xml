      Unfortunately, some patients with Crohn's disease (CD) fail to respond to the best clinical
      treatments and some only experience temporary benefit. For severe Crohn's disease, there is
      an experimental treatment called &quot;high dose immunoablation&quot; followed by autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This study removes over active lymphocytes
      (immunoablation) and replaces them using blood stem cells that have been taken from the
      patient's own body. The aim of the study is to reset or reprogram the patient's immune system
      to its state prior to diagnosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of Crohn's disease has proven to be quite efficacious in the majority of
      patients with the timely use of combination therapies for remission induction
      (corticosteroids and/or biologics) and maintenance of disease control (immunosuppressives
      and/or biologics). However, a proportion of patients fail to achieve complete and long term
      disease control and often require multiple intestinal surgeries with a risk of developing
      short bowel syndrome. Lymphoablation followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to
      rescue the immune system has been proposed as an alternative strategy to induce long term
      disease control in this high-risk population. It has been demonstrated that despite the
      potential toxicity and morbidity associated with the procedure, the benefit-risk ratio is
      favorable. Hence, the investigators propose to offer HSCT to selected CD patients and to
      study mechanisms of reducing T cell autoreactivity which will hopefully lead to more focused
      therapeutic approaches in the future.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective study in therapeutic
      refractory Crohn's patients, failing conventional therapy.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and potential clinical benefit of
      lymphoablation followed by autologous HSCT rescue in therapy refractory CD. Death
      (transplant-related mortality, TRM) and severe toxicity (≥ grade 3 toxicity; NCI Toxicity
      Criteria version 4.0) within the first 6 months after HSCT will be monitored to meet this
      end-point.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To evaluate the incidence of HSCT related complications, i.e. viral reactivations (CMV,
           Adenovirus, EBV, BK virus) or fungal infections.

        2. To evaluate the impact of HSCT on quality of life and school productivity.

        3. To elucidate the underlying mechanism involved in the observed benefit of HSCT on CD.

      First, the safety will be evaluated by the amount of related adverse events. All adverse
      events will be recorded in a standardized way and their relationship to the study protocol
      will be assessed at various short and long term time points.

      Second, to determine clinical benefit, the percentage of patients in sustained disease
      remission at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 months post HSCT will be determined. Sustained disease
      remission is defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &lt; 150 without the use of
      corticosteroids. In addition, mucosal healing will be assessed during ileocolonoscopy at 6
      and 12 months following HSCT using the CD endoscopic index (SES).

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

      - Change in Crohn's disease endoscopic index after 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Change mucosal healing as determined by the simple endoscopic score for crohn's disease (SES-CD). The SES-CD assesses the size of mucosal ulcers, the ulcerated surface, the endoscopic extension and the presence of stenosis. Each are measured on a scale of 0-3 and are summed to create a total score. For total score, 0-2 indicates remission, 3-6 indicates mild endoscopic activity, 7-15 indicates moderate endoscopic activity, and &gt; 15 indicates severe endoscopic activity.</description>

    <description>Change in CDAI score (Crohn's Disease Activity Index). The CDAI measure the signs, symptoms, and history of Crohn's Disease based on the past 7 days. The index measures abdominal pain, stools per day, general wellbeing, HCT, ESR, Albumin, height, weight, abdominal exam, perirectal disease, and extra-intestinal manifestations each scaled between 0-10. The sum of these measures creates a total score between 0-100 with the higher score representative of more disease activity.</description>

It is a self-report measure with 35 closed questions encompassing six proposed domains: Bowel Symptoms (7 items), Systemic Symptoms (3 items), Social Functioning (12 items), Body Image (3 items), Treatment/Interventions (3 items), and Emotional Functioning (7 items). The IMPACT-III uses 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 for all answers. The outcome score ranges from 35 to 175, with higher scores suggesting better quality of life.</description>

    <description>the amount of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) will be determined. TRECs are excision circles of DNA excised during the process of T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement. Since these TRECs do not replicate during cell division, they can also be a measure for recent thymic emigrants.</description>

    <description>The CDR3 (complement determining region) of the TCRβ chain is the most variable region of the TCR and is generated by recombination of the variable, diversity and joining region of the DNA. The length of this region differs between different T-cell clones due to nucleotide transferases or removed nucleotides during recombination, and the variability of these lengths can be used to estimate thymic diversity. This variability can be determined by electrophoresis, after amplification of this region by PCR.</description>
