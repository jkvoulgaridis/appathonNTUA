  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, and observational real-world study aimed at investigating
      the current situation of surgical treatments and prognosis for acute epidural hematoma in
      China, and analyzing the optimization of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Acute Epidural Hematoma (AEDH) among traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients
      has been reported to be in the range of 2.7 to 4%. The mortality in patients in all age
      groups and GCS scores undergoing surgery for evacuation of EDH is approximately 10%.

      Most people with EDH are generally expected to have a good clinical outcome with the prompt
      and correct treatment. However, AEDH still represents a potentially life-threatening
      condition when a local mass effect exists due to rapidly elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)
      resulted from the rapid build-up of blood. Brain hernia and cerebral infarction might occur
      and lead to a terrible clinical outcome. In addition, there is a set of patients who
      experience clinical deterioration after an initial hematoma-evacuation craniotomy because of
      secondary brain injuries, including massive cerebral infarction (MCI), additional
      decompressive craniectomy is recommended as soon as possible.

      Although DC can reduce the morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients with a sTBI,
      the removal of the bone flap is not necessary for the majority of patients with AEDH, because
      of the relatively low incidence of MCI secondary to AEDH. Recommendations indicated an
      epidural hematoma greater than 30 ml should be surgically evacuated regardless of the
      patient's GCS score. Although craniotomy provides a complete evacuation to remove the clot of
      the hematoma, there are insufficient data to support a specific surgical treatment method.
      The choice of operative technique is influenced by the surgeon's expertise, training, and
      evaluation of a particular situation. Therefore, there is a clinical rationale for
      investigating the current status of surgical treatments and prognosis for AEDH, thereby
      providing a reliable reference for the optimization of therapy.

    <description>The primary outcome is indicated by the long-term functional outcomes, including overall mortality and the score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), &quot;Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale&quot; is the unabbreviated scale title. The minimum value of scale is score 1, and maximum value is scored 8, higher scores mean a better outcome and lower scores mean worse outcome. Specific scored as follows:
death;
persistent vegetative state;
lower severe disability;
upper severe disability; (stratum 3 and 4 were considered as severe disability, with permanent requirement for help with daily living);
lower moderate disability;
upper moderate disability; (stratum 5 and 6 were considered as mild disability, without a need for assistance in everyday life, that might, however, require special equipment for employment);
lower good recovery;
upper good recovery (stratum 7 and 8 were considered as good recovery).</description>

    <description>Unabbreviated scale title is &quot;5-level EuroQol five dimensions&quot; questionnaire. The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for describing and valuing health. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

          1. Informed consent of patients;

          2. Clear medical history of closed traumatic brain injury;

          3. within 12 hours after injury;

          4. Supratentorial acute epidural hematoma on CT scan;

          5. The admitting neurosurgeon considers that epidural hematoma needs to be evacuated with
             a surgical operation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous intracranial surgery prior to trauma;

          2. Patients with a score of 3 on the GCS, with bilateral fixed and dilated pupils,
             bleeding diathesis or defective coagulation, or an injury that was deemed to be
             unsurvivable;

          3. Patients who had injury of the oculomotor nerve. CT demonstrates associated other
             intracranial hematomas e.g. subdural, intracerebral hemorrhage, or large size
             infarction, which are the main cause(s) of operation;

          4. Severe pre-existing disability or severe co-morbidity which would lead to a poor
