  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative tour to simulation
      operating theater on reducing children's and parents' preoperative anxiety. half of the
      participant were taken in a tour to a simulation operating theater before the day of
      operation and the other half were given the standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigators examined the effectiveness of a preoperative tour to a simulation operating
      theater guided by an expert anesthesia technologist on reducing the Preoperative anxiety
      levels for children who were scheduled for elective day case procedures under general
      anesthesia, and their parents' anxiety levels through a 10-months randomized controlled trial
      at tertiary medical center in Riyadh-Saudi Arabia, and confirmed that children and parents
      who received the intervention had significantly lower preoperative anxiety levels than
      controlled children and parents.

      Given that, the results showed critical levels of preoperative anxiety among school age
      children, and that preoperative tour to simulation operating theater as a child-friendly
      maneuver is directly applicable and could be considered for children scheduled for day-case
      procedures under general anesthesia.

    <description>measured using the modified-Yale Pre-Operative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS). The m-YPAS is an observational anxiety scale used to assess anxiety levels in the preoperative period and during the induction of anesthesia. The total score of the scale ranged from 23 to 100, and the higher score means a worse outcome. The reference point to define high anxiety cases in the preoperative period is 30.</description>

    <description>Dyads of children and parents allocated to the IG were taken into a tour to a simulation operating room accompanied by an expert anesthesia technologist two weeks before the day of surgery. This simulation operating theater is a real operating room equipped with a surgical trolley, sealing surgical lights, anesthesia machine, vital signs monitor, stethoscope, surgical trays, surgical sink, and gas supply pendent. It was prepared with popular cartoon characters, child manikin, and face masks connected to the anesthesia circuit and re-breathing bag. After being assessed by anesthesia clinic doctors, children and their parents in the IG were given a chance to visit the simulation operating room, to receive orientation, education, and demonstration orientation about what they are going to experience in the operating room. Children were encouraged to apply vital signs monitoring, and to simulate providing mask anesthesia induction to a child manikin.</description>
