  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this PhD project focuses on the relationship between intestinal microbiota and
      health in the background of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Many pathologies, including the
      CKD, display a dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, which is at the same time a
      consequence of CKD and contributes to its progression and complication. In a variety of
      chronic-degenerative and infectious diseases, the &quot;fecal microbiota transplantation&quot; (FMT) is
      being tested in recent years in addition with the application of both probiotics and
      prebiotics. FMT is indeed currently successfully used in the eradication of recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infections, with success rates of 90%, thus recent evidence suggests
      that FMT could be applied in other diseases characterized by microbiota dysbiosis, such as
      CKD and diabetes, in which the FMT has never been previously tested.

      This project will allow to study:

      i) the prototypal production of the encapsulated suspension of healthy microbiota tested in a
      minimally invasive FMT procedure (by oral administration);

      ii) the efficacy of the innovative prototype for colonization and modulation of intestinal
      microbiota following FMT;

      iii) the experimental and clinical feedback of this suspension, by in vivo studies.

      This project will allow to experiment the Fecal microbiota transplantation in the CKD model
      and to set up a pharmaceutical formulation of fecal suspensions of microbiota.

      Firstly, a collection of fecal samples from healthy volunteers will be set up, with the aim
      to collect biological samples. Screening and enrollment of healthy volunteers, gathering
      personal and clinical information together with eating habits, will be performed.

      The best product design in efficacy, stability over time as well as suitable excipients and
      any other active components able to perform a synergistic action will be evaluated. After
      defining the pharmaceutical formulation, the production of the prototype will be finalized.

      In a second time in vivo studies on a model of CKD (uremic mouse with CKD induced by 5/6
      nephrectomy) will be designed and carried on. The CKD model will be used to evaluate the
      effects and the outcomes of FMT on clinical parameters such as renal function, circulating
      levels of uremic toxins, state and function of the intestinal microbiota, intestinal
      permeability and microbiota composition. This step will be necessary to establish the
      efficacy of the innovative prototype for the colonization and the modulation of intestinal
      microbiota following FMT.

    <description>A final number of 10 healthy volunteers will be selected to collect their fecal samples, according to the protocol FMT01 (ref. Cammarota G et al. Gut 2017 doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313017):
Preliminary interview - anamnestic interview to exclude people with history of disease and risk factors
Secondary interview - anamnestic interview (on the day of donation) to exclude donors with recently appeared harmful issues
Sample collection - blood and stool testing to verify the presence of potentially transmittable disease: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis A, HBV, HCV, Syphilis, HIV-1 and HIV-2, Faecal Helicobacter pylori, Faecal occult blood testing, Fecal ova and parasites Steps 1 and 2 will be analyzed by the physician in order to exclude people, after enrollment, at risk of potential harmful issues. People passing steps 1 and 2 will undergo blood and fecal laboratory screening. Positivity to one or more of the tested factor will result in volunteer exclusion.</description>
