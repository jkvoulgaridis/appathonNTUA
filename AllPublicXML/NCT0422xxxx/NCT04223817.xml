  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease with specific osteoarticular
      pattern of unknown mechanism. Ischemic phenomenon have been suggested to participate to the
      osteoarticular involvement in SSc. To date, osteoarticular pattern and hand vascular
      involvement have been few studied in magnetic resonance imaging in SSc, and most often with
      low resolution RMI.

      7 Tesla RMI allows high resolution for morphology examination, together with dynamic and
      functional vascular study and sodium articular concentration. Indeed, the aim of the study is
      to describe hand osteoarticular and vascular involvement in SSc, as well as sodium articular
      concentration. Clinico-biological association will be also assessed.
