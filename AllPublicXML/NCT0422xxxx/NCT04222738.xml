      the investigators performed a non-randomized single-arm clinical trial with a before and
      after design, carried out from December 2016 and May 2017.

      Intervention consisted of the administration of powdered ginger extracts in the form of
      capsules at a dose of 2g/day, for a period of 6 weeks. Before and after intervention, the
      following were done by the participants: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), blood
      pressure measurements, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver function tests,
      kidney function tests and full blood counts. These were followed by morphological workup
      including Electrocardiograms (ECGs), transthoracic heart ultrasounds and Ambulatory Blood
      Pressure Measurements (ABPM), also done before and after intervention.

      Clinical evaluation with fasting blood sugar control and blood pressure controls were done at
      day 21 for safety purposes.

    <description>Non-randomized single-arm clinical trial with a before and after design. The study population consisted on all type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with a target population of T2DM patients with HbA1c between 42 to 64mmol/mol (6-8%) with no change in anti-diabetic treatment during the last three months, previous the study.
The intervention consisted on the administration of Zingiber officinale Roscoe extracts, at a daily dose of 2g/day (equivalent overall daily dose of extract in simple powdered form) for a period of 6weeks. The extracts were given as capsules, either one capsule three times per day (1 capsule x 3 / day) and after meals. Each capsule contains 399mg of pure Zingiber officinale Roscoe extracts.</description>
