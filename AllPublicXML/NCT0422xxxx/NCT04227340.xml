  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is a significant and common toxicity experienced by patients who receive
      high-dose chemotherapy as a preparatory regimen for a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
      Furthermore, oral mucositis has been reported as the single most debilitating side effect
      reported by patients undergoing HCT. The incidence of HCT mucositis among adults is estimated
      to range between 76% and 89%; however, comparisons are difficult due to variability in
      patient ages, treatments and criteria for scoring oral mucositis.

      The use of intra-oral photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy in adult patients after the
      development of oral mucositis is well documented and now included in the international
      mucositis guidelines, with limited evidence in pediatrics. This study will build evidence for
      the incorporation of extra-oral PBM therapy into daily nursing care of children and
      adolescents undergoing HCT. This intervention has potential in providing evidence for
      efficacy in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis, the single most debilitating side
      effect reported by patients undergoing HCT.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate feasibility and efficacy of photobiomodulation therapy (PBM) in reducing
           oral mucositis in children and adolescents at risk for grade 3 oral mucositis undergoing
           an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To compare clinical manifestations associated with the development of oral mucositis
           between those treated with daily PBM and a matched control. Clinical factors to include:
           grade and duration or oral mucositis.

      Exploratory Objective:

        -  To evaluate efficacy of photobiomodulation therapy in autologous patients at risk for
           grade 3 oral mucositis compared to matched control.

        -  To evaluate utilization of play-based procedural preparation and treatment feasibility
           and parental satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children, adolescents and young adults admitted for an allogeneic HCT and those determined by
      the transplant team to be at risk for grade 3 oral mucositis will be eligible to receive PBM
      (34 x 660 nm 10 mW, 35 x 850 nm 30 mW; 1390 mW total power output at an irradiance of
      50mW/cm2). The PBM treatment will be administered via the THOR Model LX2M unit.

      After low light therapy consent, participants will be offered the opportunity to receive a
      play-based preparation. Those who elect to receive this child life preparation will be
      scheduled to meet with a trained certified child life specialist (CCL) prior to admission.
      The play-based preparation will incorporate age and developmentally appropriate explanations
      of the non-invasive procedure and will be adapted to each patient's psychosocial and
      cognitive developmental needs.

      Observation and treatment will begin the first day of conditioning (plus/minus 2 days). Those
      undergoing an allogeneic HCT will have treatment daily until Day +20 or engraftment (ANC ≥
      500 for two consecutive days). For those undergoing an autologous transplant, treatment will
      continue until engraftment (ANC ≥ 500 for two consecutive days) or until the patient is
      without mucositis for two consecutive days.

      The PBM will be administered extra-oral and intra-oral by trained research staff. Direct aim
      of the laser into the eye will be avoided and safety spectacles will be used with laser
      therapy. The safety spectacles will be prescribed according to age, with the adjustable Ibis
      Infant eye protection for patients less than 1 year of age and the adjustable kids laser
      safety googles for the young child. Patients, staff, and observers will wear laser safety
      glasses while PBM is in use.

      The parent may hold the device in place with assistance from the trained persons. After the
      initial LLLT treatment, a parent-reported satisfaction survey will be administered via paper
      questionnaire.

      The observation of oral mucositis will be conducted by non-study staff and conducted as
      clinical care by the nurse, advanced practice provider and/or physician. Each patient will
      have a daily oral assessment, with documentation of mucositis, grade, duration, pain
      assessment, days of nutrition support, use of narcotics, positive oral and blood cultures.
      All patients will receive the standard mouth care regimen prescribed for transplant patients.

      Each patient will be matched and compared to a previously treated patient. The comparison
      will be matched on primary disease, conditioning regimen, age and sex, with comparison of
      treatment variables of mucositis grade, duration, pain medications, days of nutritional
      support, blood and oral cultures, to day +20 or engraftment (depending upon which occurs
      first).

    <description>Efficacy will be assessed with assessment of grade 3 mucositis development from day 1 of conditioning to Day +20 of transplant or engraftment as a binary outcome (yes/no)
Daily observation: The observation of oral mucositis will be conducted by non-study staff and conducted as clinical care by the nurse, advanced practice provider and/or physician.
Assessment: Each patient or parent proxy will complete the Children's Mucositis Assessment via ipad along with documentation of mucositis grade, duration, days of nutrition support, use of narcotics, positive oral and blood cultures.
Each patient will be matched and compared to a previously treated patient. The comparison will be matched on primary disease, conditioning regimen, age and sex, with comparison of treatment variables of mucositis grade, duration, pain medications, days of nutritional support, blood and oral cultures, to day +20 or engraftment (depending upon which occurs first).</description>

    <description>Feasibility will be assessed through the number of successful treatments administered by the total number of attempted treatments, providing the percentage of successful treatment administered. Daily treatment will include 6 sites of PBM application, with application documented as receiving all 6 applications, in part treatment (at least one to five sites) or no treatment. A successful treatment is defined as the treatment is successfully administered to 4 or more sites. Reasons for partial or no treatment will be documented. Criteria for feasibility is that the percentage of successful treatments administered exceeds 75%. The collected data will be summarized for total days on protocol, days treatment is received, cumulative dose and the number of treatments received at each site.</description>

    <description>The PBM will be delivered through application of the LED Cluster Probe externally to the right external buccal, left external buccal, mid face with mouth open and submandibular and left/right cervical. Patients who develop an oral lesion, intra-oral directed therapy will be administered with the dental light probe. For patients that can tolerate, an intraoral probe will deliver light directly onto the oral mucosa, this will then replace the mid face application with mouth open. Each laser application will be timed at 60 seconds.</description>
