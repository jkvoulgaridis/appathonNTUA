      attack of NMOSD in China

      This is an open-label, dose exploration study.The investigational drug is HBM9161 injection,
      and the indication is NMOSD.

      HBM9161(HL161BKN) is a human monoclonal antibody. HBM9161 targets the neonatal Fc receptor
      (FcRn) . By blocking the FcRn IgG-Fc binding site and accelerating the degradation of IgG, it
      can significantly reduce the total IgG level in blood (including pathological IgG).The serum
      aquaporin 4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) associated with NMOSD is a pathological IgG, so the
      combination of standard of care which is intravenous methylprednisolone (ivMP) with HBM9161
      is expected to rapidly reduce AQP4-IgG levels.

      Two dose groups (340 mg and 680 mg) were planned, and each dose group plans to enroll
      approximately 6 subjects. All subjects are weekly administered the HBM9161 by subcutaneous
      injection for a period of 4 weeks, together with standard of care which is of intravenous
      methylprednisolone (ivMP) by subcutaneous for a period of 4 weeks. The study will investigate
      the safety, and tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of HBM 9161 in patients with
      attack of NMOSD in China.
