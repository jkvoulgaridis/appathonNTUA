  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of Metformin in subjects with
      C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis administered for 24 weeks. The overall objective is to
      determine if Metformin is safe in C9orf72 ALS patients and is a potentially viable
      therapeutic treatment for C9-ALS that reduces repeat-associated non-canonical start codon -
      in DNA (non-ATG) (RAN) proteins that are produced by the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The C9orf72 repeat expansion is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
      frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Metformin, a well-tolerated diabetes drug, blocks a key
      pathway for expression of toxic proteins produced from the C9orf72 repeat expansion via
      repeat associated non-canonical start codon - in RNA (non-AUG) (RAN) translation. In mouse
      model of C9-ALS/FTD, metformin treatment decreases RAN protein levels and improves disease
      features. This current study is a small-scale clinical trial to assess the safety and
      potential efficacy of metformin for the treatment of C9-ALS/FTD.

    <description>Metformin is a widely used, well-tolerated drug that has been used for decades as a first-line defense for treating type 2 diabetes. Its safety has been well established. Subjects will begin treatment with Metformin at a dosage of 500mg with an escalation of dosage by 500mg every week to a maximal dosage of 2000mg. Dosing will be twice daily.</description>
