             that laboratory values will generally be within the normal range for the laboratory,
             though minor deviations, which are not considered to be of clinical significance to
             the investigator, are acceptable

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or at admission to the study site as deemed
             appropriate by the investigator

          -  Received a known inhibitor of Cytochrome (CY) P3A4, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or P-glycoprotein
             (P-gp) activity within 14 days or a period less than 5 times the drugs' half-life;
             whichever is longer, before the first dose of the study drug is scheduled

          -  Received a known inducer of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 activity within 28 days before the first
