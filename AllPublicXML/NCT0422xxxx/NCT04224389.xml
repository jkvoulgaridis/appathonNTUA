      Compare patients' feelings in terms of swallowing ability assessed by the overall score of MD
      Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) 2 years after starting treatment between patients who
      have been treated with IMRT and those who were treated by transoral surgery for a squamous
      cell carcinoma of the early stage oropharynx.
