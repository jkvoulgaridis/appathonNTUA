  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves patients who will be discharged from Montpellier University Hospital
      (acute geriatric care unit) between January and March 2020.

      The primary objective is to assess the number of difference(s) in patient's medicines between
      the discharge from hospital (acute geriatric care unit) and one month after this discharge.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to assess the number of changes of medicines between the patient's admission and
           discharge from hospital (acute geriatric care unit);

        -  to evaluate the number of inappropriate medicines in patient's treatment at hospital
           admission (in acute geriatric care unit) and one month after the discharge from
           hospital;

        -  to evaluate the number of failures found in the transmission of information between the
           hospital and the general practitioner/pharmacy one month after the patient's discharge
           from hospital (acute geriatric care unit).
