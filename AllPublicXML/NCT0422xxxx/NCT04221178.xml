    <textblock>
      This study will test whether stopping maintenance therapy in people with multiple myeloma in
      MRD-negative remission has the same effect on disease control as continuing this therapy. The
      study will look at whether people currently on maintenance therapy can safely stop this
      treatment and continue with active surveillance instead while keeping their MRD-negative
      remission status for at least 1 year.

        This study will be conducted at MSKCC. Efforts will be made to ensure that women and
        minority groups are adequately represented in this trial. All patients will be seen by
        MSKCC myeloma physicians and associated MSKCC co-investigators, enrolled and registered at
        MSKCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with plasma cell myeloma treated with any number of prior lines of therapy,
             who at the time of study enrollment have had sustained MRD-negativity at a given
             timepoint and a subsequent time point with an interval of 3 or more years while on
             continuous maintenance therapy. MRD-negativity is defined per the International
             Myeloma Working Group Consensus Panel.

          -  MRD positivity will be defined by detection of 1 or more neoplastic plasma cells in
             10^5 nucleated cells by flow cytometry as per IMWG criteria (i.e., sensitivity of
             10-5)

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years with ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a voluntary informed
             consent form and agree to compliance with the protocol schedule; with the knowledge
             that they may withdraw consent at any time without impact on future medical care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients found to be MRD-positive at time of screening

          -  Patients with plasma cell leukemia or other disorder of plasma cell neoplasm

          -  Patient who are receiving other therapy with the intent of treating myeloma with the
             exception of bisphosphonates

          -  Patients being treated for another, potentially life-limiting malignancy with 3-year
             lead-in to study enrollment, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ
             malignancy

          -  Prior organ transplant or condition requiring immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant

          -  Patients with any other ongoing, concomitant, comorbid illness including but not
             limited to uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled
             coronary artery disease/arrhythmia, psychiatric or social disorder that would
             compromise compliance with the study schema
