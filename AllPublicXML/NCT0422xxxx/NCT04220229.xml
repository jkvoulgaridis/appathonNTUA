  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabozantinib when given with
      radiation therapy and how well it works in treating patients with sarcoma of the extremities.
      Cabozantinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Giving cabozantinib with radiation therapy may make the tumors smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of cabozantinib followed by a phase II,
      dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days until the completion of radiation therapy in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 2, patients also undergo standard of
      care radiation therapy for 5-6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for
      up to 1 year, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
