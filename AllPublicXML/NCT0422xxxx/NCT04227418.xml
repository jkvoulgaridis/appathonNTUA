  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and antipsychotics are drugs commonly prescribed in
      psychiatry, the former for dementia and the latter for acute and chronic psychotic illness.
      Both can cause cardiac arrhythmia therefore 12 lead ECG's are recommended before prescribing.
      The test is often difficult to obtain however, leading to either patients being
      inconvenienced or drugs prescribed without the test. There are two parts of this study, but
      both examine the utility of single lead ecg monitoring, one in the memory clinic and the
      other in inpatient psychiatry wards. The aim to to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      handheld ecg versus the 12 lead and 6 lead ecg, and whether the handheld ecg can be used to
      screen for ecg abnormalities that would generally lead to a caution or contra-indication for
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and anti-psychotic medication.

      Patients will either be recruited from the outpatient memory clinic or in patient psychiatry
      wards. Following informed consent baseline demographic data will be collected, and patients
      will undergo a 12 lead and 6 lead ECG as well as a rhythm strip using the handheld device.
      Data from this point will be annonymised for future analysis. The psychiatrists ECG report
      will also be recorded, and a subset of patients will undergo an echocardiogram (to see what
      proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders have structural heart disease.)

    <description>Handheld ECG machines are portable, inexpensive, hand held devices that provide a 'real-time' rhythm strip, equivalent to lead I or II on a 12 lead machine, depending on how the device is held. The rhythm strip is displayed on a computer tablet or mobile phone, and are compatible with both android and iPhone platforms. To perform the test the patient places their fingers/thigh, or alternatively the device can be placed directly on the patient's chest. The process does not require the patient to be exposed, can be done in a seated position (negating the need an examination couch) and their ease of use and portability means they could be readily used in memory clinics or community settings.</description>
