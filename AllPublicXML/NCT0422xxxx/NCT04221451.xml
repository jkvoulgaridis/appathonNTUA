      Primary Objectives:

      Primary population (adult participants with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis): To assess the
      efficacy and pharmacodynamics (PD) of daily oral dosing of venglustat when administered over
      a 104-week period

      Secondary population (participants with juvenile/adolescent late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis,
      GM1 gangliosidosis, saposin C deficiency, sialidosis type 1 or juvenile/adult
      galactosialidosis): To assess PD response (plasma and CSF GL-1 biomarker and disease specific
      biomarkers) of venglustat when administered once daily over a 104-week period

      Secondary Objectives:

      Primary population:

        -  To assess the effect of venglustat on selected performance test and scale over a
           104-week period

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of venglustat when administered orally once
           daily over a 104-week period

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of venglustat in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid
           (CSF)

      Secondary population:

        -  To assess the effect of venglustat on selected performance tests and scale over a
           104-week period

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of venglustat when administered once daily over
           a 104-week period
