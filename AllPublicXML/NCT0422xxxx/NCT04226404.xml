      This study will be a single-center, controlled, open-label, parallel study to evaluate the
      puffing patterns of healthy adult consumers of tobacco products switching from a usual brand
      (UB) Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) product to an ENDS Investigational Product
      (IP) product with 4.8% nicotine over a three-week ambulatory period. This study will be
      conducted in support of a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) ENDS submission to the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).

      Potential subjects will complete a pre-screening interview and a Screening Visit to assess
      their eligibility and, based on meeting eligibility requirements, will be enrolled into the
      study on the same day of the Screening Visit.

      Once enrolled, the subjects will be assigned to one of the seven flavor variants of ENDS
      product. Subjects will be allowed to sample flavors and determine which flavor that they
      would like to use for the length of the study. Subjects will then participate in a three-week
      ambulatory study in which they will use their assigned IP in place of their UB ENDS. Subjects
      will be directed to not use their UB ENDS products during the study.

      At the initial visit, subjects will be provided an orientation to the product, including the
      IP power unit, cartridges, the Product Use and Behavior (PUB) instrument, PUB application,
      and a provided electronic device. Based upon their UB ENDS usage, they will be given a
      sufficient amount (for three weeks of ad libitum use equaling 375% of their self-reported UB
      weekly use) of ENDS cartridges. The study will involve a one-week acclimation period followed
      by a two-week product use evaluation period. At the end of the first week of the study,
      subjects will receive a phone call from the clinic to assess IP compliance and to ensure that
      they are not using their UB ENDS. The PUB instrument will collect topography data, and
      product use data will be uploaded frequently using a web-based PUB application installed on
      the electronic device provided by the Sponsor. Throughout the study, subjects will receive
      weekly phone calls to remind them of guidelines for using their assigned IP. Subjects will be
      instructed to use the IP in place of their UB ENDS, but they will be allowed to use non-ENDS
      tobacco/nicotine-containing products according to their normal use pattern. All used
      cartridges may be disposed of by the subject.

      At the conclusion of the three-week ambulatory period, subjects will return to the clinic;
      return the IP power unit, charger, all unused cartridges, the PUB instrument (and all
      cables/charger), and the provided electronic device. Each subject will complete all End of
      Study procedures, including completing the Product Evaluation Scale (PES) questionnaire, and
      they will then be discharged from the study.

          2. Generally healthy male or female, â‰¥21 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent.

          3. Positive urine cotinine test at Screening.

          4. Cartridge-based, closed-system ENDS are the primary form of
             tobacco/nicotine-containing products used within 30 days of Screening. Subjects may be

             user of tobacco/nicotine-containing products then the subject must self report that a
             cartridge-based, closed-system ENDS is their primary product.

          5. Must have used 2 or more ENDS cartridges per week over the last 30 days. Brief periods
             of abstinence due to illness, quit attempt (prior to 30 days of Screening), or
             clinical study participation (prior to 30 days of Screening) will be allowed at the
             discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).

          6. Females must be willing to use a form of contraception acceptable to the PI from the
             time of signing the ICF until the end of the study.

          7. Must be willing to use the assigned IP and only the assigned flavor as their exclusive
             source of ENDS use for the full duration of the three-week ambulatory period. Use of
             other non-ENDS tobacco/nicotine-containing products will be permitted during the
             ambulatory period.

          8. Must have familiarity with modern electronic devices such as an IOS/Android smart
             phone or tablet computer (&quot;tablet&quot;) and be willing to be provided an electronic

             willing to keep both active for the length of the study.

          9. Must be willing to use an application on the provided electronic device, and keep the
             application active for the length of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,
             hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, hematological, neurological
             disease, or any other concurrent disease or medical condition that, in the opinion of
             the PI, makes the study participant unsuitable to participate in this clinical study.

          2. History or presence of diabetes.

          3. Systolic blood pressure of &gt; 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of &gt; 95 mmHg,

          5. Any history of cancer, except for primary cancers of skin such as localized basal
             cell/squamous cell carcinoma that has been surgically and/or cryogenically removed.

          6. Use of any medication or substance that aids in smoking cessation, including but not
             limited to any nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, patch),
             varenicline (ChantixÂ®), bupropion (WellbutrinÂ®, ZybanÂ®), or lobelia extract within (â‰¤)
