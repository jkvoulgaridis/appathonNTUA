  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this project is to compare the accuracy of transcutaneous oxygen
      monitoring and near infrared spectroscopy in assessing cutaneous oxygen levels in chronic
      wounds of patients following revascularization procedures as well as those with
      conservatively managed chronic wounds. This study will also compare the efficiency and
      practicality of both methods in guiding treatment decisions and management of these wounds.

    <description>The Kent Camera is intended for use by healthcare professionals as a non-invasive tissue oxygenation measurement system that reports an approximate value of the following in superficial tissue:
oxygen saturation (StO2),
relative oxyhemoglobin level (HbO2), and
relative deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) level
The Kent Camera displays two-dimensional color-coded images of tissue oxygenation of the scanned surface and reports multispectral tissue oxygenation measurements for selected tissue regions. The Kent Camera is indicated for use to determine oxygenation levels in superficial tissues.</description>

        This prospective study will include up to 200 adult patients who present with non-healing
        lower extremity wounds to the University of Kansas Medical Center. Patients will be grouped
        into two study arms depending on the degree of tissue ischemia (above or below 40 mmHg) and
        required treatment (conservative wound care alone or revascularization). Relevant clinical
        information will be obtained from patients' medical records including demographics,
        clinical history, intervention details, surgical records, and imaging data. Wound healing
        will be assessed at presentation, at the time of revascularization (pre and
        post-operative), and every 6 weeks thereafter by clinical assessment, Wagner
        classification, TCOM PO2 measurements and NIRS PO2 measurements. TCOM will guide treatment
        decisions and management, which is the current standard of care.
