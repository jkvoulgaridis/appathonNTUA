      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the safety profile of different investigational vaccine regimens against
           herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the investigational vaccine regimens with respect to:

        -  the frequency of herpes simplex virus (HSV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection in the
           genital area (shedding rate) following a 2 dose vaccine schedule

        -  the proportion of participants free of HSV genital recurrence at 6 months after the
           2-dose vaccine schedule

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the impact of each of the investigational vaccine regimens in terms of total
           number of days with genital lesion up to 6 months after vaccination 2 and number of
           recurrences 60 days after the second vaccination compared with the placebo group

        -  To describe the efficacy of each of the investigational vaccine regimens with respect to
           the frequency of HSV DNA detection in the genital area (shedding rate) 60 days following
           the first vaccination visit plus 60 days following the second vaccination visit compared
           with the placebo group

        -  To describe the efficacy of each of the investigational vaccine regimens with respect to
           the frequency of HSV DNA detection in the genital area (shedding rate) 60 days following
           the first vaccination visit compared with the placebo group

             screening visits

          -  HSV-2 seropositive confirmed by Western blot

          -  A history of established HSV-2 infection â‰¥ 1 year

          -  A history of at least 2 and no more than 9 reported HSV clinical recurrences in the
