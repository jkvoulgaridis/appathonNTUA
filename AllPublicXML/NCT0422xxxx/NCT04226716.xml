  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of pregnant women develop pregnancy-related low back and/or pelvic girdle
      pain (PPGP), which often does not recover spontaneously postpartum. As a result, 10% of women
      with PPGP still reports complaints a decade after delivery. The prevention and treatment of
      PPGP are thus crucial. However, the underlying mechanisms of PPGP are still poorly
      understood. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether lumbar proprioceptive
      deficits, a disturbed body perception at the lumbar spine and psychosocial factors (incl.
      pain-related fear of movement, depression, anxiety and stress) are associated with (1) a
      reduced postural control and (2) the development and/or persistence of PPGP in multiparous
      women during the first and third trimester of pregnancy, and six weeks and six months
      postpartum.
