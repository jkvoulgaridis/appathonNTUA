    <measure>Number of patients with improvement of salivation after 3 month of treatment (Real Auriculotherapy group compared to Sham Auriculotherapy group)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Show that auriculotherapy (treatment of specific points) is effective in the treatment of xerostomia compared to a &quot;sham&quot; treatment (treatment of non-specific points).
The relative variation of salivary secretion &quot;after treatment&quot; compared to &quot;before treatment&quot; will be judged on the weight of 3 compresses left 5 minutes in the mouth: 2 in front of the openings of Sténon's canal and 1 on the buccal floor (orifice of Wharton's canal).
Salivary secretion is measured by the weight in grams of the compresses left in the mouth.
This measurement is performed at inclusion and after 3 months of treatment. The measurement is made with a jeweler-type precision balance.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specific xerostomia questionnaire at inclusion and 3 months post-treatment (11 questions with 5 response levels (1 = never / 2 = very rarely / 3 = occasionally / 4 = quite often / 5 = very often) to evaluate Xerostomia symptoms).</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Global Patient Change Impression (GPCI) questionnaire at 3 months post-inclusion. This questionnaire evaluates all aspects of patients' health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status.</description>

    <description>Simple numerical scales from 0 (best score) to 10 (worst score) at inclusion and at 3 months post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire at inclusion and 3 months post-treatment. The HADS consists of 14 items, scored from 0 to 3, with seven questions relating to anxiety and seven questions relating to depression, allowing 2 scores to be obtained. The highest scores indicating more severe symptoms: &quot;normal&quot; cases (0-7 points); doubtful case (8-10 points); certain cases (11-21 points).</description>

    <measure>Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQoL five Dimension questionnaire at inclusion and 3 months post-treatment. This questionnaire is designed for the patient to judge the impact of his state of health on his quality of life according to 5 dimensions (mobility, personal autonomy, daily activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression). Each item has 3 response levels (1, 2 and 3) and the combination of the five digits will represent the patient's state of health. It is supplemented by a quality of life thermometer graduated from 0 (worst quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life).</description>
