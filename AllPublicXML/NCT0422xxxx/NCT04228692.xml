  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic endometriosis can be responsible for urinary problems as well as symptoms of
      clinical bladder hyperactivity and/or symptoms of bladder pain before or during miction that
      can persist after bladder voiding. Whereas urinary problems can predate surgery due to the
      endometrial lesions themselves, the surgery can also have functional consequences for urinary
      function, specifically when there is trauma (incisions, per-operative coagulation) to the
      inferior hypogastric nerve fibers and/or to the hypogastric plexus.

      The incidence of post-surgery urinary symptoms could be as high as 30%. The incidence of
      voiding problems and specifically of non-obstructive voiding dysfunction can be observed in
      17,5% of cases of patients 1-month post-surgery for deep colorectal endometriosis, and
      persists in 4,8% of women after 12 months.

      The gold standard for treatment of voiding problems consists of self-catheterization, as is
      the case for all non-obstructive voiding dysfunction symptoms. This procedure considerably
      impacts quality of life. The proper and complete voiding of the bladder remains essential in
      order to avoid recurring urinary tract infections and pelvic static disorder.

      In the case of persistent dysuria, the use of self-catheterization is necessary in 21% of
      patients after surgery for deep endometriosis, for an average duration of 85 days. To date,
      few studies have explored the management of post-operative urinary complications after
      surgery for deep endometriosis. Pharmaceutical alternatives (alpha-blockers,
      anticholinergics, benzodiazepines) have not proven effective and sometimes cause side
      effects. However promising alternative treatments are being developed, specifically the
      neuromodulation of the sacral root. This procedure has been shown effective in the treatment
      of non-obstructive voiding dysfunction; however, it remains an invasive treatment that has
      its load of complications and undesirable side-effects. A recent study reports favorable
      results for the use of sacral neuromodulation in the case of persistent incomplete voiding
      following surgery for deep colorectal endometriosis. Some studies have also suggested that
      percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTN) could also be a treatment alternative.
      The advantage of this procedure is that it is non-invasive and less constraining. No study
      has yet evaluated whether PTN could also be used to treat patients with persistent voiding
      dysfunction following surgery for deep endometriosis.

      Our study, conducted in the gynecologic department of Croix ROUSSE Hospital, Lyon (France),
      evaluates PTN as a new treatment option for post-operative voiding dysfunction in women who
      suffer from deep endometriosis. Our aim is to prove that the use of PTN can reduce the
      duration of self-catheterization by 50% when compared to self-catheterization only.
