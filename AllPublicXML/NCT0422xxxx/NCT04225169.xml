  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: After total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, patients often experience intense
      levels of pain, stress, and anxiety that can adversely affect postoperative recovery.
      Diaphragmatic breathing exercise (DBE) may help patients manage pain and emotional distress.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DBE on pain, anxiety, and
      depression in patients undergoing TKR.

      Methods: The study population consisted of patients who underwent TKR surgery in the
      orthopedic ward of Çankırı State Hospital between May and August 2019. The study sample
      included a total of 38 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria. Stratified randomization
      was used to assign the patients into sex-matched intervention group (n=19) and control group
      (n=19). Patients in the intervention group were also trained in the DBE procedure. Pain
      scores were evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively, while the anxiety and
      depression was applied on the postoperative day 2. Data were analyzed using descriptive
      statistics, Chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TKR is one of the most common orthopedic surgical procedures. Because TKR involves extensive
      muscle and bone repair, it is known to be one of the most painful operations. Moreover, as
      prosthetic surgery is an elective procedure, patients delay and experience anxiety about
      surgery due to their experiences with severe pain. This leads to chronic fear of pain and
      negative thought patterns. Inadequate use of analgesics and poor pain management after
      surgery can cause delayed mobilization, increased risk of venous thrombosis, insufficient
      wound healing, prolonged hospital stay, unnecessary psychological distress, and lower patient
      satisfaction. Many patients experience psychological problems such as depression, anxiety,
      discouragement, negative feelings, crying, frustration, lack of motivation, fatigue,
      moodiness, irritability, despair, and helplessness. Patients have expressed a need for social
      or psychological support. In order for patients to avoid such pain-related complications,
      they must be taught how to cope with pain.

      The severe pain, anxiety, and stress patients experience following TKR surgery may impact
      their postoperative recovery. Studies have shown that nonpharmacological interventions for
      postoperative pain reduce pain intensity and opioid use. One of these nonpharmacological
      methods is diaphragmatic breathing exercises (DBE). Also known as diaphragmatic breathing or
      deep breathing, DBE is an effective holistic mind-body training to cope with stress and
      psychosomatic conditions. DBE involves contraction of the diaphragm and expansion of the
      belly to deepen inhalation and exhalation, which consequently decreases breathing rate and
      maximizes blood gas concentrations.

      DBE plays an important role in pain signaling, autonomic activation, emotional regulation,
      acid-base equilibrium, and anti-inflammatory processes. DBE has been shown to enhance
      emotions, effectively reduce anxiety and its symptoms, and alleviate negative emotions such
      as depression, stress, and anger. There are few studies in the literature on the effect of
      DBE on patients who underwent TKR. One of these is a semi-experimental study that evaluated
      the effect of relaxation intervention (breathing exercises and guided imagery) on patients
      who underwent TKR. They authors reported that relaxation techniques were effective in
      managing patients' pain and anxiety. Another study evaluating the effect of relaxation
      techniques and back massage in patients who underwent TKR and total hip replacement (THR)
      showed that these techniques reduced patients' pain and anxiety during bedrest. Investigated
      the effect of a DBE program in patients with OA and found that DBE had no effect in
      alleviating pain or improving physical function.

      A few studies have used DBE to prevent pain and sensory tension in patients who underwent
      TKR. However, different relaxation techniques were used in addition to DBE in these studies.
      To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the efficacy of DBE alone. Given the
      rising incidence of TKR, it is imperative that we strengthen our arsenal of effective
      interventions against the pain and psychological problems associated with this procedure. The
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of DBE on pain, anxiety, and depression
      in patients who underwent TKR.

    <description>Visuel Analog Scale (VAS) This one-dimensional measure of pain intensity is a reliable and easily applicable scale that is widely accepted in the literature. VAS is used to convert nonmeasurable variables into numeric values. The 10-cm scale is labeled 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) at one end and 10 (&quot;extreme pain&quot;) at the other, with values indicated at each cm in between</description>

    <time_frame>HADS (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) was used on postoperative day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) The scale consists of 14 items, 7 of which assess signs of depression and 7 that assess signs of anxiety. Responses are evaluated on 4-point Likert-type scale scored between 0 and 3. However, responses to the even-numbered items decrease in severity and are scored from 3 to 0, while responses to the odd-numbered items are scored from 0 to 3. The sum of the odd-numbered items gives the anxiety score and the sum of the even-numbered items gives the depression score. The total score is not calculated. Minimum score 0, maximum score 42 higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The patient was taken to a quiet room and asked to lie on the bed. For the first 5 minutes, the researchers explained how the exercise is done with pictures and demonstrated it to the patient. The patient was asked to perform the exercise for 5 minutes under supervision by the researchers. If the patient performed DBE correctly, practice was discontinued. If not, the patient was asked to practice for another 5 minutes. If the patient still could not perform the exercise correctly at the end of this time, they were excluded from the sample. DBE was performed according to the Cleveland Clinic guideline as follows:</description>
