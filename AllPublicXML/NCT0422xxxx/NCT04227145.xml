      Pilot study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;SexHealth Mobile&quot; and improve access to
      highly effective contraception among women with substance use disorder (SUD) with &quot;SexHealth
      Mobile&quot; intervention. This intervention will consist of two existing services that will help
      reach women with or recovering from SUD and provide access to contraception, as well as
      counseling.

      Pilot study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;SexHealth Mobile&quot; and improve access to
      highly effective contraception among women with substance use disorder (SUD) with &quot;SexHealth
      Mobile.&quot; Our study will follow a quasi-experimental design that uses an interrupted time
      series (i.e., usual care [control] then intervention care) to compare the uptake of
      contraception before and after implementing the &quot;SexHealth Mobile&quot; intervention.

      &quot;SexHealth Mobile&quot; integrates two existing services in our community: a mobile medical unit
      (MMU) operated by Swope Health Services and &quot;SexHealth&quot; a point-of-care contraception
      counseling service that our research team developed for Children's Mercy Hospital's emergency
      department (ED) for adolescents. Using a menu of adaptive services, &quot;SexHealth Mobile&quot; will
      bring contraceptive care to women with SUD (including the subset with opioid use disorder
      [OUD]) at recovery centers in the Kansas City community.

      Our primary hypothesis is that the current use of highly effective contraception will be
      greater at 1-month post-enrollment among women recruited during the intervention period
      (i.e., &quot;SexHealth Mobile&quot;) compared to those recruited during the usual care period. The
      current use and discontinuation of contraception will also be compared at 2-weeks and
      3-months.

      Our approach consists of enrolling (n=170) eligible women are accessing health, recovery, or
      community services at a site we identified in our formative research work. We will aim to
      recruit up to 85 women during the usual care period and 85 during the intervention period. We
      will follow-up with participants at 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months after the enrollment date.

    <description>We will recruit up to 85 women with substance abuse disorder (or opioid abuse disorder) from recovery centers. Eligible women will complete a baseline survey and study staff will provide a referral for participants to seek more information on contraception and services. Study staff will record whether the participant accepted the referral. Follow-up will occur via phone call at 2-weeks, 1-month and 3-months post-enrollment to determine if they accessed contraceptive referral services if they initiated any contraceptive method, and if so: if they continued, changed, or discontinued this contraception method. We will recruit, complete baseline and usual care referral at recovery sites on a timely rotation that mirrors the intervention period (e.g., every fourth Friday morning at Site 1), in order to increase the chance of recruiting a comparable population.</description>

    <description>We will train Swope providers in contraceptive counseling before intervention. We will recruit up to 85 women with substance abuse disorder (or opioid abuse disorder) from recovery centers. Eligible women will complete a baseline survey. Study staff will provide a referral for participants to seek more information on contraception and services. Women will have direct access to contraceptive counseling and services on-site via the mobile medical unit if they choose to use it. Counseling will focus on presenting the most effective contraceptive methods first (i.e., LARC). If women participate in contraceptive counseling, study staff will record the uptake of contraceptive medication and clinic referral at the time of enrollment and conduct follow-up surveys at 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-enrollment. If the participant refuses contraceptive counseling on MMU, a referral will be given.</description>
