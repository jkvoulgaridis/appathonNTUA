  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly proliferating, neuroendocrine tumor that accounts
      for about 15% of all lung cancers. Most patients have metastases at primary diagnosis
      involving sites like bone, adrenal glands, liver and brain.

      Compared with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) SCLC has a unique natural history with a
      shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, earlier development of widespread metastases,
      and uniform initial response to chemo- or radiotherapy.

      The combination of cis- or carboplatin and etoposide is the standard of care in the
      first-line treatment of stage IV (extensive-disease) SCLC (ED-SCLC). Despite response rates
      of 50-80%, most patients relapse within six months and the median survival time is less than
      10 months. Between 14 and 23% of SCLC patients develop brain metastases.

      New cytotoxic agents as well as targeted therapies have not been able to show any improvement
      of survival in this group of patients.

      Early phase trials of PD 1/PD L1-blocking immunotherapeutic agents in patients with recurrent
      or ED SCLC have shown promising response rates and good tolerability. Immunotherapy may also
      contribute to the efficacy of systemic treatment by maintaining initial responses to
      chemotherapy. A double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial indicates that the addition of
      atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy significantly improves overall survival and
      progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone in treatment-naïve patients with
      ED-SCLC who are in good general condition (ECOG 0 or 1). However, about one in three SCLC
      patients has a poor performance status (ECOG≥2), which is associated with even shorter
      survival times of under eight months. At present, there is little information regarding the
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of adding atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy for this
      considerable fraction of patients.

      The investigators expect, that atezolizumab in addition to chemotherapy is feasible in
      patients with stage IV SCLC and reduced performance status and therefore crucial efficacy
      data can be acquired in this trial to evaluate a putative Phase III transition in this
      particular patient population.

    <time_frame>Measured from first dose of experimental IMP (or first dose of chemotherapy, whichever occurs first) through study completion, an average of one year.</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the length of time from first dose of experimental IMP (or first dose of chemotherapy, whichever occurs first) to the date of death. A subject who has not died will be censored at last known date alive.</description>

    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting from Screening up to an average of one year.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of All Treated Subjects whose best overall response (BOR) from baseline is either a CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 criteria. BOR is determined by the best response designation recorded between the base-line assessment (must precede the date of first dose of IMP) and the date of objectively documented progression. For subjects without documented progression, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination. Among All Treated Subjects the ORR (based on investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1) will be summarized by binomial response rates and their corresponding two-sided 95% exact CIs using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free suvival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting from Screening up to an average of one year.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dose of IMP to the date of the first documented tumor progression, based on investigator assessments (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities leading to treatment discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting from Screening up to an average of one year.</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities leading to treatment discontinuation will be used as an indicator for safety and tolerability of the IMP. Toxicities in these incidents will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>

    <description>QoL questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, i.e. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire with 30 questions for patients with cancer) will be analyzed according to the respective recommendations and manuals (scoring and interpretation materials) issued by the creators of the instruments.
Patients have to answer 28 questions from &quot;not at all&quot; (1) to &quot;very much&quot; (4), where lower scores mean a better outcome. The last two questions range from &quot;very poor&quot; (1) to &quot;excellent&quot; (7), where higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
