    <textblock>
      Recently, deep learning algorithm based on central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple
      potential in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal
      lesions. However, there is still a blank in recognition of all gastrointestinal diseases.
      This study aim to develop and validate a deep learning algorithm for the diagnosis of
      gastrointestinal diseases. Then, evaluate the accuracy this new artificial intelligence(AI)
      assisted recognition system in clinic practice.

    <description>After receiving standard preparation regimen, patients go through colonoscopy or gastroscopy under the AI monitoring device. The whole procedure is monitored by AI associated recognition system. Gastrointestinal diseases will be detect and diagnosis in which the AI device will automatically captured relevant images and report the site of each segment on the screen. Histology analysis is set as a golden standard. Then all the AI captured images will be reviewed by human group, which consists of three to five experienced endoscopic physicians.</description>
