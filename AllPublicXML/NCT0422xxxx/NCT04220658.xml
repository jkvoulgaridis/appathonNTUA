  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective study to evaluate correlations between epigenetic aging
      (as measured via DNA methylation) and NAD+ levels in healthy volunteers.

      This biomarker study consists of a single outpatient visit to the research unit. At this
      visit, eligibility will be assessed and biomarker samples (blood, saliva and urine) will be
      collected from subjects meeting eligibility criteria. Consenting subjects with clinically
      significant screening lab values may be excluded from the study after biomarker sample
      collection (i.e., clinical lab test results will become available after the biomarker sample
      collection). The prescribing of drugs to humans will not be part of this protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females between 25 - 80 (inclusive) years of age

          2. Able and willing to provide written consent, follow instructions to complete study
             questionnaire(s) and assessments

          3. Peripheral venous access sufficient for blood draw

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any significant chronic disease including renal, liver, endocrine,
             inflammatory, cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, neurological, psychiatric,
             neoplastic, or metabolic disease, unless well controlled (defined as stable medication
             regimen) for at least 90 days prior to screening. Clinical significance of active
             disease will be assessed by the Qualified Investigator to determine eligibility.

          2. Clinically significant, unstable or untreated medical disorders including recent
             myocardial ischemia or infarction, unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension, AIDS,
             malignancy, epilepsy, and recent cerebrovascular disease that required a change in
             management or hospitalization within the last 90 days.

          3. Subjects with or who have recently experienced a traumatic injury, infections or
             undergone major surgery at the discretion of the Qualified Investigator

          4. Donation or receipt of blood products within 90 days.

          5. Clinically significant vital sign or physical examination abnormality at the
             discretion of the Qualified Investigator.

          6. Subjects with history of pellagra or niacin deficiency

          7. Alcohol use &gt;2 standard alcoholic drinks per day within the past month

          8. History of alcoholism or drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening

             screening.

         10. Use of lipid lowering agents (including fish oil) unless the dose has been stable for
             greater than 90 days prior to screening.

         11. Use of natural health products containing nicotinamide riboside or niacin exceeding
             the RDA (16mg/day for males and 14mg/day for females) within 14 days prior to
             Screening. Potential participants will be asked to bring all supplements for
             evaluation at time of screening.

         12. History of or current diagnosis of any cancer (except for successfully treated basal
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) diagnosed less than 5 years prior to
             screening. Volunteers with cancer in full remission and more than 5 years after
             diagnosis are acceptable.

         13. Has participated in any clinical trial with an investigational medicinal product
             within the past two months prior to the first dose in the current study

         14. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results at screening

         15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion may adversely affect the
             participant's ability to complete the study or its measures or which may pose
             significant risk to the participant

         16. Consumption of non-water beverage or food within approximately 8 hours of sample
             collection
