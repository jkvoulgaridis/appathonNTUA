    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of the combination of the GITR agonist monoclonal antibody
      INCAGN01876, the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody INCMGA00012, and stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) for recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM). The investigators hypothesize that the proposed
      regimen will be safe and stimulate a robust anti-tumor immune response and result in improved
      tumor responses.

      The study has 2 arms:

      Arm A (Cohort A) is a nonsurgical arm (N=16) that will serve as the primary study cohort and
      evaluated for the primary study endpoint. Subjects in this arm receive a single priming dose
      of both INCMGA00012 and INCAGN01876 prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), then undergo
      SRS (8 Gy x 3 fractions). Following SRS, INCMGA00012 (IV every 4 weeks) and INCAGN01876 (IV
      every 2 weeks) are resumed and continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      for 2 years, whichever occurs first.

      Arm B (Cohort B) is a surgical arm (N=16) that will allow for evaluation of the effects on
      the tumor immune microenvironment of INCMGA00012, INCAGN01876, and SRS. In order to be
      enrolled on this arm, subjects must have a clinical indication for surgical resection of the
      recurrent GBM tumor. Prior to planned surgical resection, subjects receive neoadjuvant
      immunotherapy (one of two possible combinations, as outlined below). Subjects then undergo
      surgery. Postoperatively, the immunotherapy combination of INCMGA00012 (IV every 4 weeks) and
      INCAGN01876 (IV every 2 weeks) is resumed and continued until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or for 2 years, whichever occurs first. Subjects in the surgical arm
      with a focus of contrast-enhancing tumor that is amenable to SRS will be assigned to surgical
      sub-arm #1 of Cohort B (N=8). These subjects will receive neoadjuvant INCMGA00012 +
      INCAGN01876 + SRS. All other subjects enrolled on Cohort B (N=8) are treated with neoadjvuant
      INCMGA00012 + INCAGN01876 (without SRS).

             IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV&quot;; this requires
             presence of either amplification of EGFR, whole chromosome 7 gain AND whole chromosome
             10 loss, or TERT promoter mutation). Participants are eligible if the prior diagnosis
             was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma was made
             (e.g. secondary GBM).

          2. Participants must have glial tumor that is recurrent following prior first-line
             radiation therapy (prior dose must have been 40-75 Gy and may have been either photon
             or proton radiation), and must have unequivocal evidence of tumor progression by MRI
             scan

          3. Cohort A and Sub-Arm 1 of Cohort B only: Patient must have at least one measurable
             (&gt;=1cm x 1cm) contrast-enhancing tumor focus for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
             is clinically indicated, as determined by the Investigator, and must be able to
             achieve radiation target coverage without exceeding dose constraints. The
             contrast-enhancing target must not be larger than 4 cm in maximal diameter. Multifocal
             disease is allowed as long as this criterion is met

             • Sub-Arms 2 of Cohort B can have any size tumor, and the tumor does not need to be
             amenable to SRS

             methylation status must be available from any prior GBM tumor specimen; results of
             routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. mutagenically separated
             polymerase chain reaction [MSPCR] or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are
             acceptable)

          6. Patients may have had treatment for an unlimited number of prior relapses but must not
             have had prior bevacizumab or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGFR)
             inhibitors (exception: prior bevacizumab is allowed if it was administered for the
             treatment of radiation necrosis rather than progressive tumor and was stopped at least
             4 weeks prior to MRI showing demonstrating tumor progression). Prior gliadel wafers
             are only allowed if placed during the first surgery for GBM at initial diagnosis.

          7. Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy; the following
             intervals from previous treatments are required to be eligible:

                  half-lives of the investigational agent whichever is shorter

               -  3 weeks from any major surgery, including brain surgery for recurrent tumor
                  resection

          8. If patient is on systemic corticosteroids to treat brain edema and/or brain
             edema-related symptoms, the dose must be 2mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) daily or
             less for a minimum of 5 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          9. Patients must be able to swallow oral medications

         10. Age 18 or older

         11. Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 60

                  the study but exempt from the total bilirubin eligibility criterion) ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)

         15. Adequate renal function within 7 days prior to start of study treatment, defined as
             follows:

             • Serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 x institutional ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance
             (glomerular filtration rate can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) &gt;=50
             mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels &gt;1.5x institutional ULN

         16. Reproductive Status

               1. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7
                  days prior to the start of study drug.

               2. Women must agree to not breastfeed during the study or for 180 days after the
                  last dose of study treatment

                  from the time of study screening through 180 days from last dose of study drug

               4. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
                  method(s) of contraception (as defined below) starting with the first dose of
                  study drug through 180 days after the last dose of study

               5. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are
                  exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, these WOCBP must still undergo
                  pregnancy testing as described in this section.

             At a minimum, participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active and their
             partners must agree to the use of a highly effective form of contraception (as defined
             below) throughout their participation beginning with the time of consent, during the
             study treatment, and for 180 days after last dose of study treatment(s).

             HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION:

               -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills,
                  vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) by WOCBP
                  subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects
                  participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as one of the
                  acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug

               -  Nonhormonal IUDs

               -  Bilateral Tubal ligation

               -  Vasectomy

               -  Sexual Abstinence

                    -  It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete
                       abstinence is elected.

                    -  WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have
                       pregnancy tests.

                    -  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be
                       discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego
                       complete abstinence.

         17. Participant must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be able to comply with study
             procedures

             the study by providing written informed consent (or have legally authorized
             representative sign on patient's behalf if patient physically unable to sign consent
             due to neurologic deficit)

        Exclusion Criteria
