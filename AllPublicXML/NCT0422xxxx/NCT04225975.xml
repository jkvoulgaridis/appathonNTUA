  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal anoxia-ischemia causes significant neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study the
      investigators want to better understand the interactions between the nervous and the
      hemodynamic cerebral systems during the adaptation of the neonate to ectopic life just after
      birth. Birth is an at risk situation of neonatal anoxic ischemia and the lack of objective
      criteria for cerebral tissue oxygenation has consequences on neuronal activity. Ph cord
      analysis is inadequate and only indirectly reflects the state of cerebral oxygenation. Both
      neuronal and vascular systems are part of the same functional entity and the analysis of
      their interactions is likely to reveal some early malfunctions of these networks.

      In this study, the investigators want to develop a multi-scale, multimodal approach that
      allows simultaneous interrogation of both neuronal and vascular compartments during the 15
      minutes after delivery. The investigators will record, with the aid of a single sensor placed
      on the scalp of the child, the electroencephalogram and the cerebral tissue oxygenation. The
      investigators will measure interactions by means of correlation analysis between both
      signals.
