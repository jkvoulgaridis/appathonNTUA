  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, one treatment, four group, parallel group study to
      investigate the effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib in
      participants with different levels of hepatic function. Participants with mild, moderate or
      severe hepatic impairment ('Mild', 'Moderate' and 'Severe' groups), and control participants
      with normal hepatic function ('Normal' group) will each receive a single 100 mg dose of
      entrectinib after consumption of a standardized meal.

      Participants with reduced hepatic function will be assigned to a functional category based on
      assessments at the Screening visit. Each individual will be categorized according to the
      Child Pugh system for classifying hepatic impairment and also according to the National
      Cancer Institute organ dysfunction working group (NCI-ODWG) system. Recruitment will be
      staggered to allow review of pharmacokinetic and safety data from at least three participants
      in each of the Mild and Moderate groups before participants are enrolled into the Severe
      group. Recruitment of the Severe group will only proceed if there is agreement between the
      Sponsor and the Investigator that data from this group are necessary to fulfill the
      objectives of the study and that dosing is not anticipated to present an unacceptable risk to
      those individuals. The control group of participants with normal hepatic function will be
      enrolled after the full complement of participants with hepatic dysfunction has been dosed.
