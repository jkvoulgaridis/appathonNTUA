      This project explores the effects of specialized computer-based cognitive rehabilitation
      (CBCR) targeting executive functions in three groups of patients: Stroke, Cardiac Arrest and
      Parkinson's Disease. The effect of specialized CBCR is compared to an active control
      condition.

      This project explores the effects of specialized computer-based cognitive rehabilitation
      (CBCR) targeting executive functions in three groups of patients: Stroke, Cardiac Arrest and
      Parkinson's Disease. The effect of specialized CBCR is compared to an active control
      condition completing general mentally stimulating sham-training. A total of 300 patients (100
      from each patient-group) is expected to be enrolled. All patients will complete a
      neuropsychological testbattery tageting executive functions at inclusion and after the
      training period. Furthermore, all patients will answer questionnaires concerning quality of
      life and ADL-measures before and after the intervention. All patients will train with the
      intervention-programme or the sham-programme for a period of 8 weeks, 5 times a week for 60
      minutes.

These 11 games are chosen because they are believed to have a low load on executive functions.</description>
