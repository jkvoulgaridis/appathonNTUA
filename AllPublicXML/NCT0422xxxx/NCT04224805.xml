    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted to evaluate a new design of the intermediate stent that is
      used in orthognathic surgery cases requiring Le Fort I osteotomy. The new design relied on
      referencing the maxillary segment to the zygomatic buttress. The study was carried out as a
      randomized controlled clinical trial in which 16 patients were enrolled according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. In control group (n=8) conventional interocclusal splint
      was used and in study group (n=8) the proposed intermediate stent was used.

      Background: Dentofacial deformities have many negative consequences in the form and function
      of head and neck region. This includes breathing, swallowing, speech and temporomandibular
      disorders. It is estimated that in about 19% of orthodontic patients, orthognathic surgery is
      required along with the orthodontic procedure. The introduction of CAD/CAM technology in
      orthognathic surgery planning has facilitated the procedure and allowed for more predicted
      results. Aim of this study: The aim of the present study is to propose a new design of the
      intermediate stent that relates the mobilized maxilla to a fixed anatomical landmark in the
      skull which would allow for more accurate positioning of the maxilla during orthognathic
      surgery. Materials and methods: This study was conducted on sixteen patients who have been
      undergone Le Fort I osteotomy procedure. Eight of them (group A) were treated via a
      conventional stent while the other eight patients (group B) via a CAD/CAM bone-borne stent.
      Postoperative patient evaluation was performed by comparing the predicted maxillary position
      to the resultant position postoperatively. This was done via 3D reconstruction CT scans.
