    <textblock>
      This study includes both active and passive safety monitoring in large pupulations for the
      phase IV safety monitoring study of Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine Made From Sabin Strain
      (sIPV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For active safety monitoring in expanding populations, a total of 20,019 participants in
      Shanghai CDC have been enrolled in accordance with GCP for close safety monitoring for
      immediate adverse events and telephone or visiting follow-up (30 min, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)
      For passive safety monitoring in larger populations, the purpose is to observe rare adverse
      events after primary and booster immunization with sIPV by passive safety surveillance via
      AEFI monitoring system in Shanghai CDC. A total of 29,712 infants have been enrolled, and the
      adverse events of the participates have been collected via AEFI monitoring system and
      evaluated after 3-dose sIPV for primary immunization.
