  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive an MRI with a custom-built MRI coil for each participant. The
      purpose is to find out whether this custom-built MRI coil can help doctors see the different
      parts of the spine as well as or better than they can with standard CT myelograms.
