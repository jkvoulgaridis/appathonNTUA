  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PATHFINDER I Registry is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multicenter
      observational study. It is a pilot registry study towards a subsequent large pivotal phase
      registry. This pilot registry is aimed to evaluate the performance (peri-procedural) and
      clinical outcomes (intermediate and long-term) of the AURYON™ Atherectomy System, within the
      initial launch phase of the product in the market.

      US multicenter, prospective, single-arm, observational post market Registry. A pilot registry
      towards a subsequent large pivotal registry (PATHFINDER II), aimed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of Auryon™ Atherectomy System in the treatment of de novo, re-stenotic and ISR
      lesions in infra-inguinal arteries of Peripheral Artery Diseases (PAD) subjects, in a
      real-world setting within the initial launch phase of the product in the market.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patency rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-discharge (at 6-, 12-, and 24-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Patency rate, defined as &lt;50% stenosis at the treated lesion, with peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) of &lt;2.5, as assessed quantitatively by Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) performed in a lab that achieved Vascular Laboratory Accreditation, at 6, 12, and 24 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical outcome 1 - ankle brachial index (ABI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-discharge (at 6-, 12-, and 24-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ankle brachial index (ABI or TBI if needed) at 6, 12, and 24, months, compared to baseline.
Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) si an ankle/arm blood pressure ratio. Normal value ranges between 0.9-1.3. Under 0.9 index means blood has a difficult time getting to legs &amp; feet; 0.4-0.9 indicates mild-moderate PAD; 0.4 and lower indicates severe PAD. Positive difference between time-points represents a clinical improvement through time and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical outcome 2 - walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-discharge (at 6-, 12-, and 24-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ) score at 6, 12, and 24, months, compared to baseline.
WIQ is a patient fulfilled survey to grade physical ability representing PAD progress, has 3 sub-scales (walking speed, distance, climbing stairs), when the total score ranges between 0-100, higher value = better outcome. Positive difference between time-points represents a clinical improvement through time and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical outcome 3 - Rutherford clinical categories (RCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-discharge (at 6-, 12-, and 24-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Rutherford clinical category at 6, 12, and 24, months, compared to baseline.
Rutherford Classification is a doctor determined 7 stages scale (0= Asymptomatic, 6= Severe ischemic ulcers/frank gangrene) representing PAD progress, lower value = better outcome. Positive difference between time-points represents a clinical deterioration through time and vice versa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory endpoint: IVUS</measure>
    <time_frame>Peri-procedural (by the end of the index procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Intravascular ultrasound assessment pre- and post-Auryon and correlation with angiographic findings (e.g. lesion length, MLA -minimal lumen area gain, calcium severity and removal, etc.). This endpoint will be analyzed only for cases that used IVUS as a routine practice in the index procedure.</description>
