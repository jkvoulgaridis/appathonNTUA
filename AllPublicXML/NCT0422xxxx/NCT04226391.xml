  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The operating theatre (OR) in hospitals is a highly complex working environment and can
      withstand a variety of stresses and strains for the surgical team. So-called &quot;Flow Disruption
      Events&quot; (FDs) with a potential risk to patient safety occur very often.

      The aim of the planned study project is to determine the effects of flow disruption events in
      the operating theatre on patients, the OR team and the duration of the surgery. The
      investigators plan an observational study at two university hospital in Southern Germany. The
      study population includes the entire surgical team during selected surgical procedures as
      well as the patients treated. The planned sample size is 82 surgical procedures. The
      investigators intend to collect data in two surgical specialties: Urology and traumatology.

      Selected surgeries are evaluated by a trained observer and the interruptions and distractions
      in the course of the surgery are observed with a standardized tool. In addition,
      non-technical skills of the OR team are recorded: all members of the OR team will complete a
      short standardized questionnaire that measures mental workload and stress during the
      procedure. Additionally, post-operative patient outcomes are recorded.
