      Determination of GBS colonization rates in Pregnant Women insured with Maccabi Health
      Services, Doctors' Compliance Rates for Referral for Testing, test execution rates, and
      Early-onset GBS Disease (EOGBSD) Rates in Israel. Determine the relationship between
      conducting a GBS test in pregnant women and EOGBSD in Israel.

      There have been few studies in recent years, which has prompted us to undertake this study.
      Our aim was to examine the current colonization rates and attack rates in the Israeli
      population. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the need to readjust recommendations towards
      universal screening.

        Full-term pregnancies were defined as gestational age 37 weeks and above. Pregnancies were
        identified by a pregnancy code accessed by the primary physician indicating that the
        patient is pregnant, open pregnancy record in the medical record or child linked to the
        mother's id. Gestational age was defined by last menstrual period (LMP) or first obstetric
        ultrasound if LMP was unknown.We identified and excluded repeat pregnancies occurring in
        the same woman during the time period, multiple pregnancies, gestational age greater than
        42 weeks due to probability of data inaccuracy and women with missing information.
