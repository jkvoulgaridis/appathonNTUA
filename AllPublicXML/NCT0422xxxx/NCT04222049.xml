  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vibration therapy is the widely used in many neurological disorders for different type of
      problems. Recently, it is being used by researchers for the betterment of motor disorders and
      muscle movements of the cerebral palsy patients and significant results are obtained.
      Investigators are conducting this research to explore that whether this therapy can have some
      effect on the Spastic Tongue Dysarthria of the Cerebral Palsy patients.

      This study is going to be conducted in collaboration with Shahbaz Khalid Ranjha , Speech
      Language Pathologist, Family Health Hospital Islamabad who is the main person for the idea of
      the study and National University of Science &amp; Technology. This study is funded by Higher
      Education Commission of Pakistan. Recruitment and Intervention Work will be carried out in
      Family Health Hospital. Special device is being designed for transmission of Vibration waves
      in Lab of the university. The device is capable to transmit vibration waves to the patient.
      Urdu language phonological and articulation test(TAAPU) will be used for assessment as it is
      specially designed for Urdu language population which will be the main focus. Investigators
      have defined speech parameters for analysis which will be collected before application of
      intervention, after 3 months and then at the end of the study. Parents assessment will be
      collected and noted through out the intervention.

    <description>The concept is to apply vibro tactile gadget to different nerve points which when applied transmit waves to the focused parts of brain which will result in blood flow and activation of dead cells. As a result some disabled part of the body because of those dead cells can show improvement.</description>
