  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, randomized, controlled, open label phase IV superiority trial.

      After signing the informed consent form and upon the confirmation of the patient eligibility,
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm (NAC + Cisplatin) or the standard arm
      (Cisplatin).

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the protecting effect of Lysomucil® 10%
      against Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. In this case, we will evaluate its effect through the
      transtympanic administration in both ears.

    <time_frame>6 month after last injection</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the Impact of Hearing Loss in Adults (ERSA) For each question, the score of 0 means maximal difficulties, the sore of 10 means ideal situation Formulation is uniform, with no inversions: 0 always corresponds to maximal difficulty and 10 to an ideal situation, so that the lower the score the greater the impact of hearing loss on quality of life. Maximum score is 200 for respondents in work and 150 for those not in work or in retirement.</description>
