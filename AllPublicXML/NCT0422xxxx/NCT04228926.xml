    <textblock>
      The subjects of this study were patients who underwent corneal endothelial
      transplantation,who were randomly divided into 3 groups, 2 groups (0.002% and 0.004% ZKY001
      eye drops) and 1 placebo control group.

      This study is an exploratory phase II clinical study with no sample size estimation.According
      to the results of the preliminary animal experiments and phase I clinical trials, 2
      concentrations (0.002% and 0.004%ZKY001eye drops) were selected as the experimental group,
      and 1 placebo control group was selected, with 35 subjects in each group and a total of 105
      subjects.Each subject will drop the study drug into the test eye (the surgical eye is taken
      as the test eye) according to the randomly assigned drug number.

    <measure>The change of corneal epithelial defect area on Day 3 compared with that on baseline will be calculated by the grid method</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, 8:00 am±1hour</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo fluorescein staining of the cornea, slit-lamp examination and photography (8:00 ±1h) before first administration on Day1（the first day after surgery,baseline），Day3 (the third day after surgery).After slit-lamp photography was scanned by the scanner, image pro plus software was used to scale the photo to the same size as the test eye, and then the grid method was used to calculate the area of the corneal defect in the photo.
Improvement in epithelial defect area = defect area on baseline - defect area on Day3</description>
