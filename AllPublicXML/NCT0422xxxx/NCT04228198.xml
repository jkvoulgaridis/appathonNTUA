  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bladder cancer is the ninth most common type of cancer worldwide. In the past,
      Radical Cystectomy via open surgery has been considered the gold-standard treatment for
      muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, in recent years there has been a progressive
      increase in the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy surgery. The aim of the
      current project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of
      patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy surgery comparing three different
      surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri- and
      post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period of up
      to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital readmission,
      sexual performance, and continence.

      Methods: The study is an observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study to assess
      patients affected by bladder neoplasms undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion.
      The Italian Radical Cystectomy Registry is an electronic registry to prospectively collect
      the data of patients undergoing Radical Cystectomy conducted with any technique (open,
      laparoscopic, robotic-assisted). Twenty-eight urology departments across Italy will provide
      data for the study, with recruitment phase between 1st January 2017-31st June 2020).
      Information is collected from the patients at the moment of surgical intervention and during
      follow-up (3, 6, 12, and 24 months after radical cystectomy surgery). Peri-operative
      variables include surgery time, type of urinary diversion, conversion to open surgery,
      bleeding, nerves sparing and lymphadenectomy. Follow-up data collection includes histological
      information (e.g., post-op staging, grading and tumor histology), short- and long-term
      outcomes (e.g., mortality, post-op complications, hospital readmission, sexual potency,
      continence etc).

      Discussion: The current protocol aims to contribute additional data to the field concerning
      the short- and long-term outcomes of three different radical cystectomy surgical techniques
      for patients with bladder cancer, including open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted. This is a
      comparative-effectiveness trial that takes into account a complex range of factors and
      decision making by both physicians and patients that affect their choice of surgical
      technique.

      The aim of the project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes
      of patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy surgery comparing three
      different surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri-
      and post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period
      of up to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital
      readmission, sexual performance, and continence.

      Twenty-eight participating centers across Italy will provide data for the study: Urology
      Clinic, University of Bologna; Department of Urology, AOU Careggi, Florence; European
      Institute of Oncology Milan; San Raffaele Hospital, Milan; University Hospital of Verona;
      Department of Urology, Policlinico Abano; Department of Urology, Spedali Civili, Brescia;
      Department of Urology and Kidney Transplantation, University of Foggia, Foggia; Galliera
      Hospital, Genova; ASST Niguarda Metropolitan Hospital, Niguarda; Policlinico Umberto I,
      Saproma; Department of Clinical Urology, University of Perugia; Department of Clinical
      Urology, AOUP Cisanello Hospital, Pisa; Department of Clinical Urology, Palermo University,
      Palermo; Department of Clinical Urology, Alessandria Hospital, Alessandria; Department of
      Clinical Urology, ASST Mantova, Mantova; Department of Clinical Urology, ASL Abruzzo;
      Department of Clinical Urology Ca Foncello Hospital, Treviso; Department of Clinical Urology
      II, Bari University, Bari; Department of Clinical Urology, Vittorio Emanuele Hospital,
      Catania; Department of Clinical Urology, Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, Sgrotondo; Hospital
      Bassiano, Bassano; Department of Clinical Urology, Hospital San Francesco ASL 3, Nuoro;
      Department of Clinical Urology, Portogruaro; Department of Clinical Urology, Biella Hospital,
      Biella; Department of Clinical Urology Chioggia Hospital; Ausl Modena; Department of Urology
      and Kidney Transplantation, Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli Grand Metropolitan Hospital.

      The inclusion criteria are: 1) male and female consecutively recruited patients; 2) age ≥18
      years; 3) histologically confirmed diagnosis of bladder cancer eligible for radical
      cystectomy surgery at date of enrollment; 4) providing written, informed consent.

      At baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery, data will be taken directly from
      the patients at their follow-up medical visits and entered into the online database. The
      physician identifying and recruiting patients is in charge of completing the data collection
      forms during follow-up, even if the patient is subsequently treated in another center.

      Variables of interest include demographic variables (age, sex, etc), surgical factors
      (technique use, length of surgery, blood loss, type of urinary diversion, node burden,
      histological exams, surgical margins etc), mortality, morbidity (pre-, during- and
      post-surgery), oncological results, and functioning (continence and sexual performance) over
      follow-up.
