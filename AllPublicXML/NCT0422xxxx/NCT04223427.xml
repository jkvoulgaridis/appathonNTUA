  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation of the NST is effective for cardinal motor signs in patients with
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), its effects on gait disturbances, especially freezing
      of gait-FOG, and falls are variable from one patient to another, in part depending on the
      location of the NST-stimulating contact. The ability to change the shape of the current
      field, and thus the volume of activated tissue, with a directional stimulation electrode is a
      new treatment option for NSC SCP patients with Parkinson's disease. In this pilot research
      program, the main objective is to determine the impact of directional DBS on gait and balance
      issues for PD patients implanted in the STN, using previously described anatomical and
      functional data for gait disturbances to guide directional programming. Ten patients with
      Patients with severe form of Parkinson's disease eligible to deep brain stimulation of the
      subthalamic nucleus, will be included in two French sites.

    <intervention_model_description>The order of the five STN-DBS stimulation conditions will be randomized and assessments will be performed blinded from the stimulation condition. The effects of STN DBS on gait recordings will be assessed in 5 different conditions: with single ring DBS (1), and with current shaping for DBS of the gait 'hot spot' (2), of the dorsal STN (3) of the ventral STN (4) and of the DBS of narrow fiber tracts (5). The first condition will always be the single ring DBS.</intervention_model_description>
