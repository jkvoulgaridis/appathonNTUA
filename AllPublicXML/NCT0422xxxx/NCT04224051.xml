  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre population-based open-label randomized controlled trial with allocation
      concealment and blinded outcome assessment will examine if up to 2g metformin daily slows AAA
      growth in patients with small AAAs who do not have diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with no history of diabetes will be recruited from a cohort of patients with
      diagnosed AAA and a maximum aortic diameter of 30-49mm for men and 30-44mm for women.

      A total of 500 subjects with AAA will be included in the study, 250 in each study arm.
      Patients will be randomised to metformin or standard care in a 1:1 ratio.

      CT imaging and AAA US will be performed at baseline, 24 months and end of study, as well as
      if necessary according to clinical routine. Study drug will start at baseline and continue
      through completion.

      When all enrolled subjects have completed the 24-month follow-up (including imaging) an
      interim analysis will be performed to assess for efficacy and safety; if there is no trend
      towards a positive effect or signs of a harmful effect of metformin, the study will be
      stopped at this phase.

             inflammatory aneurysm, aneurysm development after aortic dissection or previous
             surgery of the infrarenal aorta.

          7. Enrollment in either another investigational drug or medical device study or another
             investigational study of an approved drug or medical device within 30 days prior to
             enrollment of the current study.

          8. If, in the opinion of the investigator, it is not in the patient's medical interest to
             participate in the study or the patient is unlikely to be able to comply with the
             study protocol.
