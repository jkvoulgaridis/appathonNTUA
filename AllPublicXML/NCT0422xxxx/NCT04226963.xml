  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to openly test the long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of
      repeated administration of IV, nasal spray and oral ketamine for treatment-resistant mood
      disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current pharmacological treatments for depression prove unsatisfactory efficacy with a
      proportion of subjects demonstrating treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The observation
      applies both to major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as bipolar I depression. There is
      growing evidence that the glutamatergic system plays a role in the pathophysiology and
      treatment of depression. Discovery of rapid, although transient antidepressant effect of
      ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in a single sub-anaesthetic
      intravenous dose in unipolar, bipolar and treatment-resistant patients provides evidence for
      a glutamatergic antidepressant. Subsequent studies confirmed this effect in repeated doses.
      Further research demonstrated that repeated ketamine infusions result in sustainable
      antidepressant effect with both, twice-weekly and thrice-weekly administration schedules.
      However, the worsening of depression may occur after infusions are completed. Given the risk
      of relapses, there is a definite need for the development of new strategies to maintain the
      beneficial effects of ketamine treatment. In the present study, the investigators aim to
      openly assess the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of repeated, individually tailored
      IV, nasal spray and oral ketamine for treatment-resistant mood disorders. The investigators
      intend to explore questions regarding optimal dose, treatment frequency and duration.

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events assessed by Clinical-Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse events will be assessed by Clinician-Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (change from baseline to each measure). Higher values represent a worse severity, but not necessarily outcome. The Clinical-Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale has 23-items based on dissociative symptoms during the assessment. Each item is scored 0 (normal) to 4 (severe symptoms) with overall score ranges from 0 (normal) to 92 (severe symptoms). Total number of assessments:18 times</description>

    <description>Incidence of adverse events will be assessed by 4-items positive symptoms subscale of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (change from baseline to each measure). Higher values represent a worse severity but not necessarily outcome. The 4-item positive symptoms subscale of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale has 4-items based on conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucination and unusual thought content. Each item is scored 0 (normal) to 6 (severe symptoms) with overall score ranges from 0 (normal) to 24 (severe symptoms). Total number of assessments:18 times</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events assessed by body temperature (oral measurements)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse events assessed by body temperature (oral measurement) in Celsius degree - change from baseline to each measure. A normal range is from 36.2 to 38.0 Celsius degrees; measurements beyond those ranges are clinically significant. The total number of measurements: 44 times</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse events assessed by blood pressure (after the participant has rested for at least 5 minutes) in mmHg - change from baseline to each measure. A normal range for systolic blood pressure is from 90 to 140 mmHg, for diastolic blood pressure is from 50 to 90 mmHg; measurements beyond those ranges are clinically significant. The total number of measurements: 44 times</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events assessed by respiration rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse events assessed by respiration rate in a breath number per minute - change from baseline to each measure. A normal range for respiration is from 12 to 16 breaths per minute; measurements beyond those ranges are clinically significant. The total number of measurements: 44 times</description>
