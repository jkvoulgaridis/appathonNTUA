  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of fibrosis plays a main role in the pathophysiology of liver diseases. The rate
      of progression in fibrogenesis varies according to the type of underlying liver disease and
      varies with the environment and host-related factors. End-stage liver diseases are
      characterized by systemic vascular resistance and decreased arterial blood pressure,
      increased heart rate and cardiac output . Disruption of regulation of neurogenic, humoral and
      vascular functions is effective in these cardiovascular changes. In end-stage liver diseases,
      glycogen storage and corruption of glyconeogenesis cause muscle protein and fat to be used
      for energy, resulting in weight loss and muscle weakness. According to the latest data of the
      Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health in Turkey in 2223 patients are waiting for liver
      transplantation. Acute and chronic liver disease and infectious complications lead to an
      increase in the number of hospitalizations and prolonged hospital stay and severely affect
      the functional status and mortality. In recent years, more attention has been paid to
      complications from chronic diseases, including malnutrition, sarcopenia, poor functional
      capacity, and frailty. There are few studies in the literature examining functional capacity
      and physical frailty in end-stage liver disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      relationship between functional capacity and frailty in end-stage liver disease.

      The decrease in functional capacity is a finding that affects quality of life in chronic
      liver diseases. In a study, 6 Minute Walk Test was associated with mortality in patients with
      cirrhosis and survival was lower in patients walking less than 250 meters. Malnutrition is a
      common complication of end-stage liver disease. It is a complex condition that causes loss of
      muscle and fat mass, loss of body weight, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, anorexia and
      fatigue, resulting in sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is generally defined as a loss of muscle mass
      and muscle strength and is directly related to adverse outcomes in these patients. In the
      evaluation of malnutrition in end-stage liver disease, evaluation of skeletal muscle (mass,
      strength, functionality) provides an objective way to determine malnutrition, since most
      intrinsic markers originate from existing liver disease (eg albumin, prealbumin, lymphopenia
      levels).

    <description>Shuttle Walk Test used to assess maximal aerobic capacity. The patient is required to walk around two cones set 9 metres apart (so the final track is 10 metres) in time to a set of auditory beeps played on a CD. Initially, the walking speed is very slow, but each minute the required walking speed progressively increases. The patient walks for as long as they can until they are either too breathless or can no longer keep up with the beeps, at which time the test ends. The number of shuttles is recorded. Each shuttle represents a distance of ten metres.</description>

    <description>End-stage liver disease patients who are being followed up at the Department of Gastroentereology of Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine will be included in the study. When the participants come to the gastroenterology department for control, they will be directed to us and the assessment will begin after written and verbal approval is obtained. The Liver Frailty Index will be used to assess the frailty of the participants. Accordingly, hand grip test, 5 repeat sit-up test and side, semi-tandem and tandem balance measurements will be made and a total frailty score will be obtained. Submaximal aerobic capacities and functional capacities will be evaluated by 6 Minute Walk Test. Then, maximal inspiratory muscle pressure and maximal expiratory muscle pressure of the participants will be measured and respiratory muscle strength will be evaluated. Finally, maximal aerobic capacity will be measured by Shuttle Walk Test.</description>

    <description>Liver Frailty Index measurements:
Grip strength: the average of three trials, measured in the subject's dominant hand using a hand dynamometer
Timed chair stands: measured as the number of seconds it takes to do five chair stands with the subject's arms folded across the chest
Balance testing: measured as the number of seconds that the subject can balance in three positions (feet placed side-to-side, semitandem, and tandem) for a maximum of 10 seconds each.</description>
