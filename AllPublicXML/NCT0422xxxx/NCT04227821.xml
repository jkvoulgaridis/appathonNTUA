  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic unstability, defined by macrocirculation and/or microcirculation dysfunction or
      alteration is common in critically ill pediatric patients. The initial treatment of
      hemodynamically unstable patient is the fluid resuscitation (fluid challenge therapy).
      However, the stabilization of hemodynamics only with fluid resuscitation can be achieved in
      less than 50% pediatric patients. In case of persistent hypotension (defined as mean arterial
      pressure below 65 mmHg, or by the formula - 55 + 1,5 x age in years), or in case of
      persistent lactate levels and base deficit elevation is the catecholamine therapy method of
      choice in case of sufficiently restored intravascular volume. In adult patients, the drug of
      choice (the first line therapy of persistent hypotension) is considered norepinephrine (based
      on evidence-based data). The norepinephrine is administered intravenously in form of
      continuous infusion, with the dose adjusted to the target level of mean arterial pressure
      (MAP). It should be preferably administered through the central venous catheter to minimize
      the complications associated with the damage of the peripheral vein wall damage in case of
      administered into the peripheral vein. Due to lack of evidence-based data (EBM) for pediatric
      population, there is still significant heterogenity of clinical practice and dobutamin,
      dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine are being used for hemodynamically unstable
      pediatric patient.

      After Ethics committee approval, pediatric patients admitted to the Departement of pediatric
      anesthesiology and intensive care with the need of vasopressor and/or inotrope therapy in the
      selected study period will be included. The primary aim of the trial is the describe the
      therapy effect on the vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), level of lactate and base
      deficit in 1,3,6,12,24,48 and every other 24th hours. The secondary aim of the trial is the
      incidence of complications: arrythmias, hypertension, defects of peripheral perfusion,
      mortality, renal failure, the PELOD-2 and pSOFA score at admission and every next 24 hours.
      The cumulative overall dose and the cumulative 24 hours dose of vasopressors/inotropes will
      be recorded.
