    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma STS is a group of malignant tumors derived from connective tissue other
      than bone and cartilage. It can occur in any part of the body at any age, and there is no
      significant gender difference.According to pathological classification, STS has 19 tissue
      types and more than 50 disease subtypes.Currently, surgical resection, radiotherapy and drug
      therapy are the main treatment methods.But about 50% of the patients with distant metastasis
      happened not the surgical removal of, quite a number of in patients with distant metastasis
      after died of disease progression 8-12 months in drug treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the
      current widely used chemotherapy regimens for ADM/IFO single-agent or joint IFO ADM is a line
      of chemotherapy, in addition, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, dorsey race, it was also used for soft
      tissue sarcomas of second-line chemotherapy scheme, however, for some special subtypes of
      sarcoma,Such as myxoid liposarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, glandular
      soft tissue sarcoma and superficial malignant fibrous histiocytoma, are not sensitive to
      chemotherapy or low sensitivity.Therefore, how to improve the survival rate of these patients
      is an urgent problem to be solved.

      Anlootinib hydrochloride is a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown good
      efficacy in solid tumors such as NSCLC, ovarian cancer, soft tissue tumors, and medullary
      thyroid cancer.Especially in the field of soft tissue sarcomas, the results of phase IIb
      clinical data were satisfactory.Therefore, Investigator plan to conduct the study of
      anrotenil hydrochloride capsule for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas with first-line
      chemotherapy failure (anthracycline)
