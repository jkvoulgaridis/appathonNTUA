  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are considered &quot;silent killers&quot; because they scarcely display
      any symptomatology, but are correlated with significant mortality and morbidity. Current
      guidelines regard aortic aneurysm disease as a coronary artery disease equivalent and suggest
      aspirin and statin use to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis, as well as beta-blocker
      (BB) therapy. No therapy, however, is effective at limiting aneurysm expansion and preventing
      rupture, even in large trials. TAA has emerged as an inflammation-mediated disorder.
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can reduce the wall shear stress and
      inflammation, both of which play vital roles in the expansion of the aneurysm.

      The study will be a randomized, double-blind trial. Patients will be randomized into one of
      two parallel arms, receiving captopril or atenolol. The doses of captopril and atenolol will
      be 25 mg daily for the first 15 days, rising to 100 mg according to clinical tolerance and BP
      estimates. The sample size will be set at 424 subjects (212 per group). The primary end-point
      will be the rate of change in the absolute diameter of the aortic root and ascending aorta on
      MRI of the aorta after 36 months of therapy with captopril vs. atenolol.

      BBs have not been precisely found to decrease aneurysm growth rates. ACEIs could lead to the
      prevention of aneurysm degeneration through their antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory
      properties.

      The results of this trial will clarify that ACEIs are superior to BB therapy in reducing the
      growth rate of TAAs, the rate of change in aortic insufficiency, the time to aortic rupture
      or dissection, the need for aortic surgery or intervention, and death.
