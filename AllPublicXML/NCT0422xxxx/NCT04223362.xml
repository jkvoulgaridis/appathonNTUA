  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major individual, social and economic
      burden worldwide. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a fundamental evidence-based intervention to
      manage COPD. However, pulmonary rehabilitation benefits tend to decline over time and
      sustaining a long-term physical activity lifestyle is challenging, leading to worse
      health-related quality of life. Personalised post-pulmonary rehabilitation programmes,
      combining different physical activities modalities with social interaction, are warranted to
      enable a shift from a disease-based to a patient-centred model and encourage a sustainable
      behavioural change. Although such programmes have the potential to sustain pulmonary
      rehabilitation benefits and promote patients' long-term adherence to physical activity, their
      availability within the community is scarce. Hence, the investigators will implement a
      personalised community-based physical activity programme (PICk UP), using the available
      resources, adapted to patient's needs/preferences. PICk UP will be a sustainable response to
      support healthy lifestyles and enhance pulmonary rehabilitation benefits of respiratory
      patients, by integrating them within the community and embracing urban facilities.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of PICk UP, a personalised
      community-based PA programme, tailored to patients' needs and preferences, on their physical
      activity levels.

      It is expected that PICk UP will empower patients to remain physically active and foster the
      maintenance of PR benefits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD-related morbidity and mortality has been increasing, making COPD already the third
      leading cause of death and a growing global health concern.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a comprehensive intervention, with known cost-effectiveness
      in managing patients with COPD. One of the PR goals is to improve physical activity (PA),
      since it has shown to reduce exacerbations and mortality.

      Nevertheless, adopting/sustaining a physically active behaviour is highly challenging and
      benefits of PR are usually lost 6 months after its completion. Therefore, PA programmes
      capable to maintain the PR effects are urgently needed Community can provide different PA
      modalities in various settings, which can be personalised to patients' needs and preferences.
      By filling the gaps between healthcare systems and patients' daily environment, these
      programmes have the potential to improve patients' HRQoL and self-efficacy, enhancing their
      ability to overcome exercise barriers and their motivation to sustain a physically active
      behaviour.

      PICk UP will offer patients different PA modalities tailored to their preferences and needs,
      thus personalising the community programmes, and aiming at sustaining a physically active
      behaviour and enhancing their HRQoL.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of PICk UP, a personalised
      community-based PA programme, tailored to patients' needs and preferences, on their PA
      levels.

      The secondary aims are to:

        1. Determine the feasibility of PICk UP.

        2. Determine the short- and mid-term effects of PICk UP on HRQoL symptoms, number of
           exacerbations, healthcare use, exercise capacity, functionality, motivation to exercise,
           peripheral muscle strength and emotional status.

        3. Determine the influence of patients' motivations and preferences in the adherence to the
           PICk UP programme and in engaging a physically active lifestyle.

      To accomplish these aims, a feasibility study and a randomised controlled trial will be
      conducted.

      Task 1 - Feasibility of PICK UP Primary healthcare providers of Aveiro and Estarreja or
      pulmonologists of the Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga will inform eligible patients about
      the study. Additional information will be provided to those interested to participate in a
      meeting with the researcher and written informed consent will be acquired. Patients with COPD
      will be eligible if they are clinically stable, as determined by their referred doctor, and
      completed a PR programme in the previous month. Patients will be excluded if they present
      signs of cognitive impairment or have significant cardiovascular, neurological or
      musculoskeletal diseases, which may limit their participation.

      The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods feasibility study, which sample size will be
      determined by the qualitative data saturation. This study will use a maximum variation
      strategy to guide recruitment.

      Data will be collected at baseline, after 3 months and after the intervention (6 months). The
      researcher will collect:

        -  Sociodemographic, anthropometric, general clinical data (e.g., number of exacerbations
           or healthcare utilisation);

        -  PA levels (steps/day): accelerometry.

        -  HRQoL: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire.

        -  Disease impact: COPD Assessment Test.

        -  Exercise tolerance: six-minute walk test.

        -  Motivations to exercise: Behavioural Regulation and Exercise Questionnaire-3.

        -  Quadriceps muscle strength: Handheld dynamometry.

        -  Fatigue: Checklist of Individual Strength-8 and the Functional assessment of chronic
           illness therapy fatigue subscale;

        -  Handgrip strength: dynamometry.

        -  Emotional status: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

        -  Occurrence of adverse events and adherence to the interventions Focus groups will be
           conducted to inform about patients' perspectives on PA and motivational triggers (e.g.,
           social contact, group activity, accessibility or support for participation).

      Participants will enrol a 6-months personalised community-based PA programme, which will
      include 2 sessions/week, with the aerobic training being the cornerstone. Patients will
      receive the PICk UP manual and a diary to register their physical activities. During the 1st
      month the physiotherapist will guide patients through 4 types of outdoors (e.g., walking,
      cycling trails) and indoors (e.g., dance, pilates) physical activities. Patients will then be
      asked to choose and commit to 1 or 2 activities, according to their preferences, which they
      shall integrate for another 5 months. During this period, the support provided by
      physiotherapist will decrease over time

        -  2nd and 3rd months: support every 2-weeks (face-to-face PA sessions alternated with
           phone-calls) to reassure safety, clarify doubts, monitor patients' evolution and enhance
           their motivation to PA;

        -  4th month: 1 face-to-face PA session;

        -  5th month: 1 phone-call;

        -  6th month: no support. The sport-related professionals will register patients'
           attendance to the programme.

      Task 2 - PICk UP randomised controlled trial A sample size calculation was computed for the
      primary outcome measure (daily steps). The investigators used the mean point of 850 steps/day
      estimated as the minimal important difference, with 80% power, 5% significance level,
      assumption of sphericity and strong correlation among repeated measures r=0.75. The minimum
      sample size estimated was 57 participants in each group. Since dropout rates are of
      approximately 20%, 137 participants are aimed to be recruited.

      Patients will be randomised into experimental group (EG) or control group (CG). The EG will
      receive the PICk UP programme described in task 1. The CG will receive a leaflet with PA
      recommendations, a PA diary and phone-call monitoring.

      Data will be collected as described in task 1, however, assessments will be conducted by a
      second researcher blinded to the intervention.
