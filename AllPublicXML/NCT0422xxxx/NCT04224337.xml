             and/or giant cells, pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell
             carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, pulmonary blastoma). If the NSCLC patients showed
             sarcomatoid carcinoma histology in re-biopsy sample (so called epithelial-mesenchymal

          9. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following
             age-specific requirements apply:

             Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments
             and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the
             post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). Women ≥50 years of age would be considered
             post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following
             cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with
             last menses &gt;1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year

             therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal
             antibodies) ≤ 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug If sufficient wash-out
             time has not occurred due to the schedule or PK properties of an agent, a longer

          7. Any concurrent chemotherapy, IP, or biologic therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent
             use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g., hormone replacement
             therapy) is acceptable.

             medication within 28 days before the first dose of durvalumab, with the exceptions of
             intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological
             doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social

             local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result),
             hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients
             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core

                  maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.

               4. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than
                  corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of
                  an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt; 10 mg
