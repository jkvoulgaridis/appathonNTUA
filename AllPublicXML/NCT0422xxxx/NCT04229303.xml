  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an integrated Phase 1, single centre, multi-part, open-label study in both healthy
      subjects (Part 1), subjects with mild stable asthma (Part 2) and subjects with mild to
      moderate stable asthma (Part 3). In all parts of the study (i.e. Parts 1, 2 and 3) every
      effort will be made to include as close as possible an equal balance between male and female
      subjects; in Part 1 and Part 2 this will be in each of the individual cohorts.

      Safety, tolerability and PK will be assessed following either single ascending (SAD) or
      multiple ascending (MAD) dosing of ZP-059; Part 1 and Part 2, respectively.

          -  Other social, psychiatric, surgical or medical conditions, or screening laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase subject risk associated with study participation or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgement of the
             Investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study.

          -  Failure to satisfy the investigator of fitness to participate for any reason.
