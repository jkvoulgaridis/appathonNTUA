  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind crossover trial of trospium and placebo in women with
      urgency urinary incontinence, with evaluation (history, physical, incontinence evaluation and
      brain MRI) at baseline, and after each course of therapy. The investigators will evaluate
      functional brain changes in relation to bladder improvement in order to improve our knowledge
      of the brain's role in the continence mechanism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) costs the US $83 billion/year, owing in large part to its
      increased prevalence with age, particularly in women: 9% of those over age 18 and 36% of
      those over age 65. UUI also impairs quality of life, social interaction, and independence;
      contributes to functional decline; and increases risk for falls, hip fractures, UTIs,
      urosepsis, anxiety, depression, and institutionalization.The cause of UUI is unknown. Its
      urgency and leakage are usually ascribed to detrusor overactivity (DO, involuntary detrusor
      contraction), suggesting that the cause is intrinsic to the bladder even though DO is not
      always confirmed on testing. Because of this assumption, most therapies target the bladder
      albeit with only moderate success: e.g., anticholinergics reduce incontinence episodes but
      their benefit and tolerability (especially for older adults) are sufficiently low that 75% of
      patients discontinue them within a year. By contrast, therapies such as biofeedback-assisted
      pelvic muscle therapy (BFB) tackle behaviors. Moreover, the use of biofeedback to retrain the
      brain shows that the central control mechanism can be targeted and improved. Thus, the
      present proposal is designed to further elucidate this mechanism, thereby paving the way for
      discovery of new and more effective ways to control UUI. These could transform current
      treatment and either complement or supplant current therapy.
