  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Multi-center, Pivotal,
      Adaptive trial designed to demonstrate that the use of Epitomee Capsule (EC), in combination
      with lifestyle modification, is superior to the placebo device in reducing body weight at
      24-weeks
