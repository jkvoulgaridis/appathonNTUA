  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Amulet LAA
      occluder compared to NOAC therapy in patients with non-valvular AF at increased risk for
      ischemic stroke and who are recommended for long-term NOAC therapy.

      The clinical investigation is a prospective, randomized, multicenter active control worldwide
      trial. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the Amulet LAA occlusion device
      (&quot;Device Group&quot;) and a commercially available NOAC medication (&quot;Control Group&quot;). The choice
      of NOAC in the Control Group will be left to study physician discretion.

             Group

          -  Able to comply with the required medication regimen post-device implant if subject is
             randomized to the Device Group or subject is a Roll-in
