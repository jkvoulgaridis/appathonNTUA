      Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of up-front atezolizumab/ bevacizumab
      (Atezo/Bev) followed by on-demand selective transarterial chemoembolization (sdTACE) and of
      initial synchronous treatment with TACE and Atezo/Bev in the treatment of unresectable HCC
      patients.
