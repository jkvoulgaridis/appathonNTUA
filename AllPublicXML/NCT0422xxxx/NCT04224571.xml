    <textblock>
      Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has a poorer outcome than newly diagnosed ALL
      patients with only about 40% overall survival after re-treatment. The study CCCG Relapsed ALL
      2017 study will adopt the UK R3 study stratification and treatment backbone with two new
      agents added. There will be a 4-week induction, followed by two consolidation courses.
      High-risk patients will receive allogeneic stem cell transplant. While intermediate and
      standard risk groups will continue maintenance treatment for another 2 years or one year. New
      agents will be added aiming at improving survival outcome.

        1. Study of adding anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) with chemotherapy: CD20 is found to be
           expressed in 40-50% of B-lineage ALL, and rituximab has been studied in adult ALL with
           superior survival (75% vs 47%,). There is little experience of using rituximab in
           pediatric ALL thus a CCCG Relapsed ALL 2017 Study will perform the study assessing the
           remission rate and MRD response of CD20+ ALL treated with rituximab. Six doses of
           rituximab and will be monitored the week 5 MRD and relapse rate as study outcome.

        2. Adding bortezomid during the consolidation:The very early or early bone marrow relapse
           has low remission rate. Previous case studies showed that Bortezomib, a proteasome
           inhibitor, may achieve remission in refractory ALL, 80% remission in B-ALL with
           combination of chemotherapy and bortezomib. Thus adding bortezomib, may improve the
           remission rate, thus bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Adding bortezomid in
           the relapsed chemotherapy protocol may increase the toxicity and even treatment related
           mortality. In this protocol, we suggested to add during the Consolidation after the
           induction therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is now having over 80% event-free survival after frontline
      chemotherapy treatment. There is still 15-20% of patients having a relapse after initial
      control. Relapsed ALL is associated with lower second remission rate and also high chance of
      further relapse. Currently there are only a few large scale studies targeting this
      challenging disease. BFM Relapsed ALL studies have been organized since 1990s and have
      identified several important prognostic factors, including timing and site of relapse and
      also immunophenotyping. COG has performed several studies on relapsed ALL (AALL02P2,
      AALL0433, ADVL04P2) but the results are rather fragmented. Recently UK group conducted a
      nationwide randomized study, ALL R3 study, testing the type of anthracycline and prognostic
      value of minimal residual disease after induction therapy.

      T-ALL relapse is having poor prognosis except for the late isolated extramedullary relapse.
      Long-term survival of T-ALL bone marrow relapse treated with chemotherapy is less than 10%,
      thus allogeneic stem cell transplant is always indicated. Whereas B-ALL has been better
      studied and the risk stratification of relapsed ALL is better defined.

      According to previous studies, patients can be stratified into Standard, Intermediate and
      High-Risk groups based on site of relapse, time of relapse from first diagnosis and
      immunophenotyping. Early bone marrow relapse at less than 18-36 months from diagnosis is
      having the worst prognosis and is classified as HR. Those with late relapse at &gt;36 months
      from diagnosis is in general having a better prognosis. Bone marrow relapse is having a
      poorer outcome as compared to isolated extramedullary relapse (IEM). Somehow combined marrow
      and extramedullary relapse appear to have a better prognosis than isolated bone marrow
      relapse. Early B-ALL marrow relapse was only having 15-30% long-term survival, and early
      B-ALL IEM around 30-50% survival.

      Late B-ALL marrow relapse has a higher second remission rate of around 95% and also better
      long term survival of 50-60%. Late B-ALL IEM is having a better prognosis of up to 70-80%
      survival. Based on the above criteria, several study groups including BFM, UK and COG also
      adopted similar strategies of stratifying patients and delivered risk-adapted treatment, with
      some minor variation among these groups.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age at relapse less than 21 years and the age at initial diagnosis of ALL of Pre-B or
             T-lineage less than 18 years.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of relapse of leukemia according to definition as below:

        Definitions of Relapse

          -  RELAPSE: Any recurrence of disease whether in marrow or extramedullary.

          -  (1) ISOLATED Bone Marrow Relapse: Patients with an M3 marrow (&gt;25% blast) at any point
             after achieving remission without involvement of the CNS and/or testicles and/or other
             extramedullary sites. Relapsed should be confirmed by morphology, flow cytometry, FISH
             and/or cytogenetics. M2 marrow should have a repeat of bone marrow in 1-2 weeks to
             confirm M3 status unless the original cytogenetic clone reappears.

             (2) CNS Relapse: Positive cytomorphology and WBC ≥ 5/μL OR clinical signs of CNS
             leukemia such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement, or hypothalamic syndrome
             that are compatible with recurrent CNS leukemia than to alternative causes (e.g.,
             viral infection with facial nerve palsy or chemotherapy toxicity). If any CSF
             evaluation shows positive cytomorphology and WBC &lt; 5/μL, a second CSF evaluation is
             recommended within 2 - 4 weeks. While identification of a leukemic clone in CSF by
             flow cytometry (TdT, CD19, CD10, etc.) or FISH for diagnostic karyotypic abnormality
             may be useful, definitive evidence of CNS involvement (i.e. WBC ≥ 5/μL OR clinical
             signs of CNS leukemia) is required for the diagnosis of a CNS relapse.

             (3) TESTICULAR Relapse: Must be documented by testicular biopsy, if not associated
             with a marrow relapse.

             (4) ISOLATED Extramedullary (IEM) relapse: CNS and/or testicular relapse and/or other
             extramedullary sites such as skin with an M1 marrow. The presence of MRD in the bone
             marrow does NOT exclude IEM.

             (5) COMBINED Relapse: M2 or M3 marrow at any time after achieving remission with
             concomitant CNS and/or testicular relapse.

        CNS Status:

        CNS 1: In cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), absence of blasts on cytospin preparation,
        regardless of the number of white blood cells (WBCs).

        CNS 2: In CSF, presence &lt; 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts, or ≥ 5/μL WBCs but
        negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:

        CNS 2a: &lt; 10/μL RBCs; &lt; 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; CNS 2b: ≥ 10/μL RBCs; &lt;
        5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; and CNS 2c: ≥ 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and
        cytospin positive for blasts but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm (see below).

        CNS3: In CSF, presence of ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts and/or clinical
        signs of CNS leukemia:

        CNS 3a: &lt; 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; CNS 3b: ≥ 10/μL RBCs, ≥
        5/μL WBCs and positive by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm (see below); CNS 3c: Clinical signs of
        CNS leukemia (such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement or hypothalamic syndrome).

        Method of Evaluating Initial Traumatic Lumbar Punctures:

        If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is
        traumatic and contains ≥ 5 WBC/μL and blasts, the following algorithm should be used to
        distinguish between CNS 2 and CNS 3 disease: CSF WBC &gt; 2X Blood WBC CSF RBC Blood RBC

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mature B ALL,

          2. Poor Karnosky score
