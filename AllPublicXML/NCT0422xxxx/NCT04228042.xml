    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of infigratinib before surgery in treating
      patients with upper tract urothelial cancer. Infigratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking the activities of a gene called FGFR needed for cell growth. Giving infigratinib
      before surgery may cause the tumor to shrink, which may make the surgical procedure easier
      and/or reduce the need for more extensive surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the tolerability of infigratinib in patients with low-grade and high-grade
      platinum ineligible upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess tolerability in those with GFR 30-49. II. Evaluate the objective response rate
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of infigratinib after 2 cycles in UTUC with
      and without FGFR3 alterations.

      III. Correlate tumor tissue FGFR3 alteration (presence/absence, alteration type, and clonal
      status) with response and occurrence/severity of adverse events (AEs) such as
      hyperphosphatemia.

      IV. Evaluate upper tract, bladder and local/distant recurrence within 12 months.

      V. Evaluate renal function pre-treatment and after two treatments. VI. Evaluate
      patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes during treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore intra-tumor heterogeneity, gene expression profiles, and changes in tumor
      microenvironment using single cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass
      cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) pre and post treatment to identify potential mechanisms
      of response and/or resistance, and correlation with the occurrence/severity of AEs.

      II. Explore urinary/upper tract washing FGFR3 alterations as potential biomarker for
      detection and response.

      III. Explore cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) for detection of FGFR3 alterations and
      as a predictor of response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive infigratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. During weeks 8-9 (at least 48 hours after last dose of infigratinib), patients
      undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months
      for up to 1 year after surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have low grade UTUC undergoing nephroureterectomy or ureterectomy, or high grade UTUC
             and not eligible for cis-platin neoadjuvant chemotherapy either due to medical
             comorbidities (e.g., cardiac dysfunction, hearing loss, glomerular filtration rate
             [GFR] &lt; 50), or based on &lt; 49% risk prediction of non-organ confined disease by
             clinical nomogram

          -  Have adequate biopsy tissue available for mutational analysis, as determined by the
             study pathologist, prior to enrollment. Any biopsy of index UTUC tissue available
             within 6 weeks of enrollment may be used

          -  Calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 mL/min

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Are able to read and/or understand the details of the study and provide written
             evidence of informed consent as approved by Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)

          -  Have recovered from AEs of previous systemic anti-cancer therapies to baseline or
             grade 1, except for alopecia

          -  Are able to swallow and retain oral medication

          -  Are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and laboratory
             tests

          -  If a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), must have a negative pregnancy test
             within 7 days of the first dose of study drug. A woman is not of childbearing
             potential if she has undergone surgical sterilization (total hysterectomy, or
             bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 weeks before taking
             study drug) or if she is post-menopausal and has had no menstrual bleeding of any kind
             including menstrual period, irregular bleeding, spotting, etc., for at least 12
             months, with an appropriate clinical profile, and there is no other cause of
             amenorrhea (e.g., hormonal therapy, prior chemotherapy). WOCBP and males whose sexual
             partners are WOCBP must agree to use barrier contraception and a second form of highly
             effective contraception (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group, 2014) while receiving
             study drug and for 3 months following their last dose of study drug. Alternatively,
             total abstinence is also considered a highly effective contraception method when this
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Sexually active males must use a condom
             during intercourse while taking drug and for 3 months after the last dose of the study
             drug and should not father a child during this period. A condom is required to be used
             also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid
