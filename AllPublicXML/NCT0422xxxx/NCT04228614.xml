    <textblock>
      By analyse the tissue/blood variant spectrum model using NGS, the present clinical trial aims
      to elucidate the genetic basis of CRC in Chinese; to establish of CRC genetic map in Chinese
      patients; to identification new genetic biomarkers, drug and pathways; and to subtyping for
      precision treatment and management for Chinese CRC patients.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC), as one of the common malignant tumors with high morbidity and
      mortality, is a major health threat in China. Surgical resection is the conventional
      treatment for early and intermediate stage CRC, chemotherapy is the main treatment for late
      stage CRC.

      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived fragmented DNA with an average size of 170bp,
      mixed with cell free DNA (cfDNA) of other sources in blood circulation. Although the
      mechanisms of its release have not been fully addressed, apoptosis and/or necrosis of tumor
      cells and serum exosome are considered as its main source, which makes it a genomic reservoir
      of different tumor clones. Also, as its half-life is up to hours, ctDNA is reflecting the
      most up-to-date status of tumor genome. Hence, it allows for noninvasive molecular
      characterization of tumors,which can be qualitative, quantitative and used for disease
      monitoring. The possibility of that ctDNA could be used to detect micrometastatic disease in
      patients received surgical resection was suggested in several studies. Using Next Generation
      Sequencing (NGS), Newman et al. have shown that the serum level of ctDNA was correlated with
      tumor progress and prognosis in NSCLC. Isaac et al. demonstrated the postoperative ctDNA
      level was associated with breast cancer progression, and it was more sensitive compared to CT
      scan for predicting the early relapse. Tie et al. examined the postoperative ctDNA level of
      1046 plasma samples from a prospective cohort of 230 patients with resected stage II CRC by
      NGS, and their results demonstrated that recurrence happened in 79% of the patients with
      positive postoperative ctDNA at median follow-up of 27 months, versus 9.8% in the negative
      postoperative ctDNA group.

      The fresh tumor tissues/biopsies of each patient will be collected during the surgical
      resection. The peripheral blood samples of each patient will be collected at the following
      time points: 1) prior to the surgical treatment; 2) prior to the chemotherapy/targeted
      therapy/immunotherapy; 3) every real efficacy evaluation, until disease progression (up to 24
      months).
