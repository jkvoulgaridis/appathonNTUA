  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weaning is an important process to gradually separate mechanically ventilated patients from
      ventilators. A good weaning strategy aims to early identify mechanically ventilated patients
      who are ready for extubation but not to prematurely extubate them. Spontaneous breathing
      trial (SBT) is a test to assess the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously when
      extubated. Several methods have been used to conduct an SBT, including T-piece breathing,
      low-level pressure support ventilation (PSV) of 5-7 cm H2O, continuous positive airway
      pressure and automatic tube compensation (ATC).

      The investigators hypothesized that an SBT with inspiratory pressure augmentation increases
      initial SBT success, reduces the length of invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) support and
      does not increase reintubation risk as compared with T-piece, which result in a higher
      proportion of patients successfully liberated from iMV in the inspiratory pressure
      augmentation group. However, inspiratory pressure augmentation significantly reduces work of
      breathing on an SBT as compared with T-piece. Patients extubated following an SBT with
      inspiratory pressure augmentation may experience increased respiratory effort after
      extubation and this may increase the use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation. An SBT
      with inspiratory pressure augmentation increases iMV free days but not MV free days as
      compared with T-piece. Longer iMV free days may be associated with a lower mortality due to
      fewer iMV related complication.

      This study is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple crossover, multicenter trial to
      compare SBTs with T-piece versus inspiratory pressure augmentation in weaning outcomes.
      Mechanically ventilated patients who meet the criteria for readiness to SBT will be included.
      The patients will use either T-piece or inspiratory pressure augmentation as SBT for weaning
      according to an ICU-based cluster randomization and crossover sequence.

    <description>The primary study endpoint is to compare the effect of SBT with T-piece versus inspiratory pressure augmentation on the proportion of patients with successful liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU among patients who have started an SBT. Successful liberation is defined as sustaining iMV free for at least five days after extubation.</description>
