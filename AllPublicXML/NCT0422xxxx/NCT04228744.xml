    <intervention_name>DBS system</intervention_name>
    <description>The DBS device utilized in the present study includes a dual-channel neurostimulator kit, lead kit, extension kit, clinician-operated wireless programmer, test stimulator, and patient controller. The lead contains four stimulating contacts. The length of each contact is 1.5 mm, and the spacing between contacts is 1.5 mm.
The participants will receive stepwise surgery. The electrodes will be implanted firstly which will be externalized for several days and then the IPG will be implanted. During externalization, the experimenters will record the local field potential and electroencephalography in resting or task-based state with conditions of sham-stimulation or active-stimulation.</description>
