      This study is an investigator initiated clinical study. A prospective, single arm unblinded,
      open label study will be carried out to determine the feasibility of recruitment, retention
      and adherence of 30 prostate cancer survivors who have been on androgen deprivation therapy
      within the last 5 years for a lifestyle modification intervention.

      INTRODUCTION:

      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been demonstrated to improve disease free and over-all
      survival in men with prostate cancer (PCa).

      ADT for PCa is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic effects such as reduced libido, hot
      flashes, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke. This reduces quality
      of life (QoL) and potentially affects mortality.

      There is paucity of data regarding comprehensive lifestyle interventions in men on ADT for
      Pca. Existing studies used non-standardized interventions or lack data on metabolic risk
      factors.

      CLIPP is designed to address these gaps by using an intervention modelled after the Diabetes
      Prevention Program (DPP) with an emphasis on low carbohydrate and a Keto Diet, a standardized
      multi-component intervention with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing diabetes risk
      factors that has been successfully adapted for multiple disease types including breast
      cancer.

      INTERVENTION:

        -  24 Weeks

        -  Health Coaching Weekly

        -  Serum &amp; Urine Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24

        -  Anthropometric Measures

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at Baseline and Week 24
