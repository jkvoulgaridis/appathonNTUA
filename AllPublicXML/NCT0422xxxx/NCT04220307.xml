    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the anti-tumor
      activity, PK and immunogenicity of AK104 in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma
      who have progressed after at least 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy (of which one of
      them must be platinum-based chemotherapy).
