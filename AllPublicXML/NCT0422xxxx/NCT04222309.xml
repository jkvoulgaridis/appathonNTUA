  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, single arm, open-label, phase I study will assess the safety of a
      laparoscopically harvested omental free flap into the resection cavity of recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.

      All participants included in the study will undergo standard surgical resection for diagnosed
      recurrent GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a
      laparoscopically harvested omental free flap. The participant's dura, bone and scalp will be
      closed as is customary. The participant will be followed for side effects within 72 hours, 7
      days, 30 days, 90 days and 180 days. Risk assessment will include seizure, stroke, infection,
      tumor progression, and death.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopically harvested omental free flaps are commonly used to fill surgical cavities
      after resection of head and neck cancers. The investigators hypothesize that a
      laparoscopically harvested omental free flap in our patients with resected recurrent GBM may
      be used as a readily available and accessible means of circumventing the blood brain barrier
      (BBB) selectively and focally. The laparoscopically harvested omental free flap with its long
      vascular pedicle length, wide rotational arc and available surface area would easily conform
      to many resected GBM cavities in our human patients with acceptable risk. The predictable and
      rich vascular anatomy of a laparoscopically harvested omental free makes it an ideal flap for
      cases of previously irradiated and/or infected wound beds. This is why it is successfully
      used in head and neck and skull base tumors. The permeability of the blood vessels of the
      laparoscopically harvested omental free flap should allow for improved delivery of
      chemotherapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular
      space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the
      tumor (BAT). &quot;Milky spots&quot; within the omentum will also provide direct deposition of immune
      cells such as dendritic, macrophages and lymphocytes into the milieu of the resected GBM.

      The investigators aim to prove that this commonly surgical technique for head and neck
      cancers is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected recurrent GBM and may
      improve progression-free survival (PFS).
