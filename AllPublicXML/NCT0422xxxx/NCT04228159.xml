  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of adults over 65 and 50% of adults above 80 years old fall at list once a year. In
      some cases, falls result in fractures, hospitalization, functional limitations, depression,
      morbidity and mortality. Strong evidence support exercise training programs for fall
      prevention, while several studies examined the effect of perturbation training on risk of
      fall. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a perturbation training
      program with unexpected perturbation using balance tutor on falls and injuries among elderly
      at risk of falling, compared to balance and strengthening exercise.

    <intervention_model_description>randomized control trial. Older adults at moderate and high risk of falling will be recruited among Clalit patients referred to one of three physical therapy clinics, or other clinics nearby, neither by physician referral due to gait abnormality or following the physiotherapist diagnosis. Potential participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria and not meeting the exclusion criteria will sign informed consent and continue with baseline assessment. Those not wishing to participate will continue with routine care. Once the baseline assessment is completed, participants will be randomized into one of two intervention groups using computer random allocation software. Participants in both groups will attend physical therapy clinics twice a week for a total of 14 sessions. Each session will last 30 minutes. General information regarding fall prevention will be delivered to all participants using Clalit brochures and electronic prescriptions</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ABC scale is a 16-item self-report measure in which patients rate their balance confidence for performing activities. Items are rated on a rating scale that ranges from 0-100; 0 represents &quot;no confidence&quot; and 10 represents &quot;complete confidence&quot;.</description>

    <description>Session1 - baseline assessment (detailed above) Session2 - 13 - each session will begin with reassessment and documentation of balance tutor parameters for each participant as were calibrated at the end of previous session.
After reassessment the training program will include:
Warm up - walking without perturbation.
Perturbation during standing position.
Perturbation during walking.
Perturbation during tandem position.
Perturbation with vestibular stimulation.
Rest according to patient needs The relative duration of each component, as well as intensity and frequency of perturbations, will be adjusted to each individual according to his ability, reassessment parameters and progression.
Session14 - full reassessment of all baseline examinations including: Mini-BESTest, ABC scale, PASE, and number of falls.</description>

    <description>Session1 - baseline assessment (detailed above).
Session2 - 13 - each session will include:
Warm up (free walking or cycling).
Static balance exercise - standing position. Exercise will be performed using different bases of support (narrow, tandem, and one leg stance), eyes open/closed, unstable surfaces, functional and cognitive dual task, and vestibular stimulation.
Dynamic balance exercise - walking position. Exercise will be performed using different bases of support (narrow, tandem, and one leg stance), eyes open/closed, unstable surfaces, functional and cognitive dual task, and vestibular stimulation.
Strengthening exercise - general strengthening, particularly for lower limb.
Cool down. Level of difficulty and duration of each component will be adjusted to each individual according to his ability and progression.
Session14 - full reassessment of all baseline examinations including: Mini-BESTest, ABC scale, PASE, and number of falls.</description>
