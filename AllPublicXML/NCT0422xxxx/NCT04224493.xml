  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized, 3-stage, biomarker
      enrichment design featuring early futility stopping and sample-size re-estimation with safety
      run-in designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tazemetostat in combination with R2 in
      subjects with R/R FL, who have completed at least 1 prior systemic chemotherapy,
      immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 is a safety run-in phase, stage 2 is an efficacy and safety phase for an assessment
      of the EZH2 Mutant Type population and overall FL population regardless of EZH2 mutation
      status, and optional stage 3 with efficacy and safety phase for subjects with EZH2 mutation.
      Stage 3 with Mutant Type population alone will be executed in case the efficacy of the
      overall population in stage 2 fails whilst the efficacy of EZH2 Mutant Type is sufficiently
      promising. Stage 2 will include 2 futility interim analyses based on ORR for the first
      futility and PFS for the second one. In addition, there is a possible sample size
      re-estimation based on PFS. This is to ensure early detection of the presence/absence of
      clinical efficacy benefit as well as ensuring adequate powering based on the trial results to
      demonstrate a meaningful efficacy difference.

        and/or uterus removed.

        15. Male subjects must have had either a successful vasectomy OR they and their female
        partner must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential OR practicing
