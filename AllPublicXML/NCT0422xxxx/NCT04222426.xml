  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exploratory single center feasibility ImaGelato study is conducted as an imaging side
      study to the Dutch GELATO trial (Assessing efficacy of carboplatin and atezolizumab in
      metastatic lobular breast cancer). Ten patients with lobular metastatic breast cancer, who
      are included in the GELATO trial at the UMCG, are eligible for the ImaGelato study.

      All patients will undergo two Zirconium-89 (89Zr)-atezolizumab positron emission tomography
      (PET) scans, one at baseline and one after two doses carboplatin induction treatment. The
      89Zr-atezolizumab PET scan will be performed 4 days after tracer injection. Procedures within
      the ImaGelato study will be completed after the two 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scans, but patients
      will continue treatment with carboplatin combined with atezolizumab in the GELATO trial.

    <measure>Change in tumor uptake between 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scan at baseline and after two carboplatin induction treatments, defined as decline or increase of standardized uptake value</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in tumor uptake between 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scan at baseline and after two carboplatin induction treatments, defined as decline or increase of standardized uptake value (SUV) of 30% or more, described as per lesion and per patient. For the two different time points we will calculate the SUV for all lesions and patients. Relative decrease or increase in SUV units between different time points will be calculated for all lesions and patients, and recorded as percentage of SUV decrease or increase.</description>

    <measure>The relation between standardized uptake value (SUV) on 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scan, to response to carboplatin-atezolizumab</measure>

    <description>Relation of 89Zr-atezolizumab tumor uptake (at baseline, after carboplatin induction, and change between the two scans) per lesion and per patient with response to carboplatin-atezolizumab per lesion and per patient. For the 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scans, uptake will be quantified with SUV units for both time points.</description>

    <measure>The relation of 89Zr-atezolizumab tumor uptake at baseline and after two courses of carboplatin, with tumor biopsy assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Relation of 89Zr-atezolizumab tumor uptake at baseline and after carboplatin induction, with tumor biopsy assessments (for example PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC)). We will investigate whether PD-L1 expression is associated with 89Zr-atezolizumab uptake. The relationship between tumor PD-L1 expression (measured in pre-treatment biopsy and induction treatment biopsy), and 89Zr-atezolizumab tumor uptake will be described.</description>

    <description>Patients receive a total amount of 10 mg unlabeled atezolizumab, this will be added to the tracer to prevent rapid clearance during imaging. A labeled dose of 37 Megabequerell (MBq) 89Zr-atezolizumab (±10%; 1 Millicurie) will then be administered. The tracer will be administered intravenously (i.v.). All patients will undergo two 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scans, one at baseline and one after two doses carboplatin induction treatment. After each tracer injection, 89Zr-atezolizumab PET scans will be performed on day 4 (96 ± 6h after tracer administration).</description>
