    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Tresiba® works in patients with
      type 2 diabetes in China. The study will be based on data already recorded in participants'
      medical records and no new tests or procedures are required as part of the study. This study
      does not affect participants' current diabetes treatment. The study will look at data
      recorded in participants' medical records for approximately the last year. After signing the
      informed consent form, no further activities will be required from the participants.

        Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 (T2D) patients, who had Tresiba® added to their previous Oral
        Anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) or were switched to Tresiba® treatment from any previous basal
        insulin based on the clinical judgement of the treating physician and were treated with
        Tresiba® for at least 20 weeks in routine clinical practice in China.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent Form (ICF) obtained before any study-related activities. Study
             related activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the study,
             including activities to determine suitability for the study.

          -  Male or female, aged at least 18 years at the time of signing the ICF.

          -  Diagnosed with T2D.

          -  Treated with any OAD(s) or basal insulin ± OAD(s), with or without prandial insulin
             for at least 20 weeks prior to treatment initiation with Tresiba®.

          -  The decision to initiate treatment with commercially available Tresiba® has been made
             by the patient/Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR) and the treating physician
             before and independently from the decision to include the patient in this study.

          -  Treated with Tresiba® (with or without OADs, with or without prandial insulin) for at
             least 20 weeks and have at least one documented medical visit with HbA1c measurement
             in the first 20 weeks (plus/minus 8 weeks) after Tresiba® initiation. The patient may
             or may not be treated with Tresiba® at the time of patient selection to this study.

          -  Minimum available data: age, weight, and sex at the time of Tresiba® initiation, HbA1c
             (most recent value within 12 weeks prior to Tresiba® initiation and a value in the
             first 20 weeks [plus/minus 8 weeks] after Tresiba® treatment), and duration and type
             of insulin treatment (for insulin treated patients).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this study. Participation is defined as having signed the
             ICF.

          -  Participation (defined as randomisation) in a diabetes clinical trial of an approved
             or non-approved investigational medicinal product within 20 weeks prior to the
             treatment initiation with Tresiba® or during the first 28 weeks of treatment with
             Tresiba®.

          -  Tresiba® not used in accordance with the local label.

          -  Patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or premix insulin in
             the 20 weeks prior to receiving Tresiba® (short-term [equal to or less than 14 days]
             treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or premix insulin in the 20
             weeks prior to receiving Tresiba® is allowed).

          -  Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation.
