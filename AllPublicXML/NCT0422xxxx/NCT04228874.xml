      Background: the effect of stent size and number on left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony
      after PCI using drug eluting stent is not clear enough Aim: to study short term effect of
      stent size and number on left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony after elective PCI to LAD
      artery.

      Patients and methods: the study included 150 adult patients with electively stented LAD
      lesion with DES. Patients were evaluated pre PCI then follow up at 1m and 3m using tissue
      synchronization image (TSI).

    <description>Coronary angiography was done for all the patients according to the Judkins technique. All images were evaluated by an experienced operator, significant coronary artery disease was defined as &gt; 70 % luminar diameter stenos. The following data was obtained:
Site of stent implantation within LAD. The first Diagonal branch serves as the boundary between the proximal and mid portion of the LAD. Thus, the portion of the artery prior to the origin of the 1st diagonal is known as the proximal LAD, while the segment just below the1st diagonal branch is the mid LAD. The distal segment of the LAD is the terminal third of the artery (Cao et al., 2017).
