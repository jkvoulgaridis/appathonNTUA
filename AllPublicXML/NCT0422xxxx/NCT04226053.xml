  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is a small-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative
      program based in New York City called Room to Grow (RtG). Room to Grow's mission is to enrich
      the lives of babies born into poverty throughout their critical first three years of
      development. The research-informed program model combines tailored, one-on-one sessions with
      an expert clinical social worker in-person every three months plus ongoing communication (via
      phone and email), provision of essential baby items, and connections to vital community
      resources. The goal of Room to Grow's innovative program is to help parents increase the
      probability that their children will enter school ready to learn and continue on to meet
      their full potential in education, work, and citizenship. The therapeutic, psychodynamic
      approach and robust three-year long relationship with families is designed to act as the
      catalyst for sustainable, long-term change in parenting methods and family system stability.
      Critically, and in contrast to other programs aimed at improving parenting and child
      development, Room to Grow believes that providing concrete material assistance enhances the
      effectiveness of counseling and referrals to low-income families by reducing economic stress
      and freeing up scarce resources.

      The goal of RtG's innovative program is to help parents increase the probability that their
      children will enter school ready to learn and continue on to meet their full potential in
      education, work, and citizenship. The therapeutic, psychodynamic approach and robust
      three-year long relationship with families is designed to act as the catalyst for
      sustainable, long-term change in parenting methods and family system stability. Critically,
      and in contrast to other programs aimed at improving parenting and child development, RtG
      believes that providing concrete material assistance enhances the effectiveness of counseling
      and referrals to low-income families by reducing economic stress and freeing up scarce
      resources. The program builds on decades of research on the importance of parenting supports
      for low-income families and their children, the significance of concrete material support and
      poverty reduction in enhancing children's health and development, and the recognition that
      the early years are an effective time to provide critical supports that influence long-term
      outcomes. Numerous programs, such as home-visiting models that provide parenting supports to
      low-income new mothers have shown promising results. After decades of correlational research
      establishing relationships between income, poverty, and children's health and development,
      there is an emerging literature providing convincing causal evidence that income matters for
      child outcomes. Both strains of this research build upon additional research that clearly
      suggests early childhood is a key period of vulnerability where interventions can make a
      lasting difference in the fortunes of low-income children and their families. The research
      will build upon this literature, by testing an intervention that combines both parenting
      supports and meaningful provision of material support - in essence, assessing whether a
      combined approach can prove potentially more powerful than the sum of its parts.

      The evaluation of RtG provides the unprecedented opportunity to test the combined value of
      parenting education with social and material supports. The project leverages an innovative
      approach that combines income supports, parenting education and connection to community
      services to promote the early health and development of young children. Both parenting and
      income support programs each aim to promote low- and moderate income families' positive
      health and development, but too often they work in isolation, potentially limiting their
      ability to reduce disparities in both parents' and children's health and development. RtG's
      innovative model provides an opportunity to test the combined effect of these services, and
      provide valuable information to practitioners and policy makers on the synergistic effects of
      these program components. The proposed research can facilitate change in the early childhood
      field by demonstrating preliminary evidence that this innovative model can achieve
      demonstrable effects on key proximal outcomes over the first year of life and provide a first
      step towards building the evidence for multi-pronged approaches to meeting the needs of
      low-income families. Findings from this study may guide the field towards more integrated
      approaches that combines material support, connection to resources, and parenting assistance
      to make real impacts in the health and development of young children. Room to Grow and its
      evaluation will provide clear contributions to the development of a culture of health and
      relevant policies in the early childhood space. This will be the first RCT that provides a
      combination of parenting and community supports with substantial and empowering provision of
      material support. Many parenting programs provide some developmentally appropriate books or
      toys, but it is incredibly rare to provide the retail equivalent of roughly $10,000 in
      support over the first three years of life. This will establish whether a model such as RtG's
      holds promise for transforming early childhood parenting programs in helping to build a
      culture of health and for reducing health disparities among children from divergent
      backgrounds. The organization and its leadership look forward to learning from the evaluation
      project in order to understand more about what's working well and what could be improved in
      the program delivery and curriculum. The team at RtG has purposefully created a culture that
      uses data to inform decision-making and looks forward to understanding the full scope of
      results from the RCT. RtG is currently developing plans for expansion over the next five
      years as part of a formal strategic planning process. The organization hopes to eventually
      serve double or more the number of families in each city where it operates, New York and
      Boston. Findings to date from internal evaluations are extremely encouraging. It is the
      researchers' hope that other foundations and government agencies (or private donors) will be
      excited to build upon support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and that the
      researchers will be able to extend the initial momentum generated by this project over time.

      The project is designed to investigate proximal outcomes. Over the long-term, the research
      team hopes to build upon these proximal outcomes and to eventually follow children through
      school-age, as well as greatly expand the number of children that are included in the RCT
      project.

    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D), is a 20-item measure that asks caregivers to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a widely used instrument for measuring the perception of general stress. This 14-item scale measures how stressful or uncontrollable participants find their lives. Respondents rate the frequency of their feelings and thoughts related to events and situations that occurred in the last month. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0-40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean Score of Parental Sense of Competence using PSOC Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC). The PSOC measures parental competence on two dimensions: Satisfaction and Efficacy. It is a 17-item Likert-scale questionnaire (on a 6 point scale ranging from strongly agree [1] to strongly disagree [6]), with nine questions under Satisfaction and seven under Efficacy. Satisfaction section examines the parents' anxiety, motivation and frustration, while the Efficacy section looks at the parents' competence, capability levels, and problem-solving abilities in their parental role. A higher score indicates a higher parenting sense of competency.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean Score of the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>The Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) is a questionnaire filled out by parents that is designed to assess the level of confusion and disorganization in the child's home environment. The statements are scored using a 4-point scoring system. The questionnaire consists of 15 statements, to each of which a parent or caregiver assigns a number between 1 and 4 that correspond to the following: 1 = Very much like your own home; 2 = Somewhat like your own home; 3 = A little bit like your own home; 4 = Not at all like your own home. Two items (6 and 10) from the CHAOS scale are included in the survey. A higher score represents characteristics of a more chaotic, disorganized, and hurried home. The higher the score, the more chaotic a home is considered to be.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Score of Cognitive Stimulation in the Home (STIMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of cognitive stimulation in the home consisting of 4 subscales: Availability of Learning Materials (ALM), Reading, Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (PIDA), and Parental Verbal Responsivity (PVR). Respondents answer &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; in subscales and subtotals are tallied. For the ALM scale score section: 0-1: enter 0, 2-4: enter 1; 5+: enter 2 (minimum score: 0, maximum score: 8). Calculation of reading scale score includes number of books; 0: enter 0; 1-9: enter 1; 10-24: enter 2; 25-49: enter 3; 50+: enter 4 and number of days reads book each week; 0-1: enter 0; 2-3: enter 1; 4+: enter 2 (minimum score: 0, maximum score: 6). PIDA scale: questions 1-15 (minimum score: 0, maximum score: 15) and PVR questions 1-7 (minimum score: 0, maximum score: 7). Calculation of total StimQ score is the grand total of each subscale combined (maximum of 36 for four subscale totals combined). A higher score reflects greater stimulation in home (favorable).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Score of Aggravation in Parenting Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>A measurement of stress experienced by parents associated with caring for children. It measures the amount of parenting stress brought on by changes in employment, income or other factors in the parent's life. Research has shown that high levels of aggravation in parenting are related to mothers' employment status and to child behavior problems. High stress and aggravation in parents are associated with poor cognitive and socioemotional development of young children. At the 10.5 month follow-up, we are using 6 of the 9 items in this scale. Response categories being (1) Strongly agree, (2) Somewhat agree, (3) Somewhat disagree, (4) Strongly disagree. This 1-4 score is reverse coded, and items are averaged to create an overall score with higher scores indicating more stress.</description>

    <measure>Number of Toys and Goods in the Home</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked if they have certain types of developmentally appropriate toys and games in the categories of symbolic play (doll, toy pots, small car), art (crayons, Play-Doh, paint), adaptive/fine motor toys (puzzle, shape sorter, pop-up toy), language (toy letters or numbers, toys that make animal sounds) and life-size toys (toy car or animal for child to ride). Respondents can answer yes/no for each (1=yes, 0=no). A higher number (0-16 items) of developmentally appropriate toys and goods in the home reflects a more favorable outcome for the child.</description>

    <measure>Worry Enough Money for Baby</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline (weeks 28-34 of pregnancy); 10.5 months after birth of child; 25 months after birth of child</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to rate (on a scale of 1-10) how worried they are about having enough money to cover their baby's expenses with 1 being &quot;Not at all worried&quot; and 10 being &quot;Very worried&quot;. A lower score indicates less concern and is therefore favorable.</description>
