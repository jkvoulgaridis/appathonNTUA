  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with successful ERCP procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedure success is assessed at the end of the procedure (within 24 hours on study day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to complete the ERCP procedure for the intended indication(s); outcome reported as &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;.
Examples include but are not limited to: biliary stent placement, pancreatic stent placement, sphincterotomy, and clearance of bile duct stones.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopist qualitative rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Endoscopists will rate their experience with the Exalt single-use duodenoscope immediately following the completion of the study procedure on study day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopist rating of the Exalt single-use duodenoscope compared to their past experience with marketed reusable duodenoscopes as it pertains to various design and performance related attributes, recorded on two Likert scales of different ranges. A qualitative evaluation of design and performance related attributes will be rated on a scale from 1 (not preferred) to 5 (comparable), and overall satisfaction will be recorded on a scale from 1 (unsatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of crossover from Exalt single-use duodenoscope to reusable duodenoscope</measure>
    <time_frame>Incidence of crossover is monitored throughout the procedure (within 24 hours on study day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>The need to use a reusable duodenoscope for any task which cannot be adequately performed with the Exalt single-use duodenoscope is considered a crossover.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Rate of adverse events (SAEs) related to the device and/or the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>SAEs are assessed through 7 days after the procedure.</time_frame>
