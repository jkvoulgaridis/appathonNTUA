  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly progressive and debilitating joint disease. Recently, it was
      demonstrated the existence of an important link between OA inflammation and progression of
      structural changes. Therapy with intra-articular injection of stromal vascular fraction (SVF)
      holds great promises and its efficacy could be further augmented with the addition of
      biological adjuvants. In the present project, we aim at demonstrating that human platelet
      lysate (HPL) increases the intrinsic beneficial properties of SVF on cartilage regeneration
      and joint environment. Moreover, we want to verify if SVF-conditioned medium (CM) obtained
      from SVF primed with HPL yields comparable or superior outcomes than whole SVF.

    <description>With this project, we expect to demonstrate that HPL increases the beneficial properties of SVF on cartilage regeneration and joint environment. We envision that HPL will increase expression of genes involved in ECM synthesis, thus enhancing cartilage regeneration. Based on previous published data, we will consider as statistical a difference between treated (SVF + HPL) and not treated samples (SVF) of two folds in expression of genes involved in ECM production (e.g. COL2A1, ACAN, SOX9). A fold increase equal to 2 is the minimum value to consider biologically relevant the influence of the treatment compared to a control group in which the gene expression is considered to be equal to 1. If our hypothesis will be confirmed, this will allow to improve the current therapy for OA with a biological adjuvant that reduces disease progression and helps cartilage regeneration.</description>
