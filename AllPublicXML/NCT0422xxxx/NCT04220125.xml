  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms, in patients with a life history of major depressive disorder (MDD), are
      very common in the general population, and are especially so in elderly adults undergoing
      surgery.Symptoms of depression at the time of surgery is associated with risk for
      postoperative complications.Attenuating depressive symptoms in patients undergoing surgery is
      thus a plausible but not adequately tested strategy for improving patient postoperative
      outcomes. Conventional treatment of depression takes weeks and, therefore, is not always a
      realistic option, particularly when surgery is urgent. Importantly, there are currently no
      guidelines for diagnosing and managing MDD in surgical patients. Given its association with
      complications including perioperative cognitive disorders such as delirium, and over longer
      periods of time with dementing disorders, the feasibility and efficacy of quick-acting
      treatments for depressive symptoms in surgical patients are direly needed. This need is
      particularly acute given the rising number of elderly patients undergoing surgery who are
      prone to depression and surgical complications.

      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients in a clinical trial where a
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) is given 1
      to 3 days before surgery in the preoperative clinic as a strategy to improve depressive
      symptoms during the perioperative period.

      Aim 2: To obtain estimates of the variability in improvements of depressive symptoms
      (increase from baseline in MADRS score ≥ 2)1 day after surgery for patients given a
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) 1 to 3 days before surgery compared
      with midazolam 0.045 mg/kg.

      Aim 3: To assess for the safety and tolerability of administration of a sub-anesthetic dose
      of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) given 1 to 3 days before surgery in the preoperative
      clinic (as an outpatient) by assessment of dysphoric symptoms or other complications
      including the need for hospitalization.

      Hypothesis:

      Aim 1: Hypothesis: Patients with preoperative depressive symptoms can be identified before
      surgery and successfully enrolled in a clinical trial comparing a sub-anesthetic dose of
      ketamine versus midazolam for improving perioperative depressive symptoms.

      Aim 2: Hypothesis: Compared with midazolam, a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine given
      preoperatively leads to an improvement in MADRS score ≥ 2 on day 1 after surgery.

      Aim 3: Hypothesis: Compared with midazolam, a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine is not
      associated with dysphoria or other complications.
