      Introduction: Stress can cause hemodynamic and metabolic changes that contribute to
      endothelial dysfunction and there is a significant association between high stress and
      cardiovascular events. Objective: To evaluate the influence of stress management on
      endothelial function in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
      Methods: Randomized, controlled, parallel, intention-to-treat clinical trial. Will be
      considered eligible patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and who have
      high stress (above average for the Brazilian population) in the Perceived Stress Scale
      (PSS-10). Patients will be evaluated on PCI admission and stress management with cognitive
      behavioral techniques will be implemented one month after hospital discharge in the
      intervention group. Group sessions will be held between 6-9 people. There will be 4 1-hour
      meetings for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be the difference in the variation of brachial
      artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) between the groups and at 3 months of baseline
      evaluation and at 6-month follow-up after the intervention and the secondary outcome will be
      the difference in the variation of the velocity of brachial artery. Pulse wave evaluated at
      the same time periods as DMF. Outcomes will be evaluated by Generalized Estimation Equations
      (GEE). Expected Results: In patients undergoing high-stress percutaneous coronary
      intervention, the use of cognitive behavioral techniques for stress management will improve
      endothelial function and vascular stiffness.

    <description>Inter group difference in flow-mediated dilation in the brachial artery in the baseline and after the treatment (about Three months after the first).
Vasodilatation of the endothelium-dependent brachial artery was evaluated by ultrasound using a 3-12 MHz linear transducer. Three images of the basal diameter (BD) of the brachial artery at the end of the diastole were acquired, as well as the mean velocity of the baseline arterial flow, with the linear transducer positioned 5 cm above the antecubital fossa. Subsequently, the sphygmomanometer was placed in the arm and inflated 50 mmHg above baseline systolic blood pressure for five minutes. After that, 3 images of the arterial diameter were acquired up to 80 seconds of the deflation of the cuff (post-occlusion diameter- PD), as well as the average of the arterial flow velocity. Flow-dependent vasodilation responses were expressed as a percentage variation from the baseline brachial diameter (PD-BD/ BD x 100).</description>

    <description>Psychoeducation:
Coronary artery disease, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, traditional risk factors and emotional stress.
Stress: physiology, triggers, triad (thinking, emotion, action).
Skills training:
Identify warning signs - signs and symptoms; Monitoring of irrational automatic thoughts generating alternative interpretations of situations or unrealistic thinking patterns (Dysfunctional Thinking Records Sheet).
Self-control for stress management:
Assertiveness training, problem solving. Thought-stopping technique, designed for dysfunctional thoughts, such as, &quot;I won't do it,&quot; &quot;It won't work.&quot;
Stress Relief / Control Techniques:
Diaphragmatic Breathing: Expansion of the abdomen rather than the chest when breathing.
Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Maximize tension and alternately relax the muscles (legs, abdomen, chest, arms and face).</description>
