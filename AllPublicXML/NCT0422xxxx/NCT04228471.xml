  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potential benefits of preserved early spontaneous breathing activity during mechanical
      ventilation are an increased aeration of dependent lung regions, less need for sedation,
      improved cardiac filling, and better matching of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and thus
      oxygenation. Two small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) reported less time on mechanical ventilation and in the intensive
      care unit (ICU) with preserved early spontaneous breathing activity during Airway Pressure
      Release Ventilation (APRV).

      Debate exists over the net effects of preserved early spontaneous breathing activity with
      regard to ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI). In fact, by taking advantage of the
      potential improvement in oxygenation and recruitment at lower inflation pressures associated
      with APRV, physicians could possibly reduce potentially harmful levels of inspired oxygen,
      tidal volume, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). However, spontaneous breathing
      during mechanical ventilation has the potential to generate less positive pleural pressures
      that may add to the alveolar stretch applied from the ventilator and contribute to the risk
      of VALI. This has led to an ongoing controversy whether an initial period of controlled
      mechanical ventilation with deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade or preserved early
      spontaneous breathing activity during mechanical ventilation is advantageous with respect to
      outcomes in ARDS patients.

      A RCT investigating the effects of early spontaneous breathing activity on mortality in
      moderate to severe ARDS has been highly recommended in the research agenda for intensive care
      medicine.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preserved spontaneous
      breathing activity during APRV in the early phase of moderate to severe ARDS.
