  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in trunk flexor endurance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Base line and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is expressed in seconds, subject will sit on the test bench and place the upper body against a support with an angle of 60 ° from the test bed. Both the knees and hips will be flexed to 90 °.The arms will be folded across the chest with the hands placed on the opposite shoulder and toes will be placed under toe straps. Subjects will be instructed to maintain the body position while the supporting wedge will be pulled back 10 cm to begin the test. The test will end when the upper body fell below the 60 ° angle.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in trunk extensor endurance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Base line and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is recorded in seconds. Subjects will laid prone with the lower body fixed to the test bed at the ankles, knees, and hips and the upper body extended in a cantelevered fashion over the edge of the test bench. The test bench surface will be approximately 25 cm above the surface of the floor. Subjects will rest their upper bodies on the floor before the exertion. At the beginning of the exertion the upper limbs will be held across the chest with the hands resting on the opposite shoulders, and the upper body will be lifted off the floor until the upper torso will be horizontal to the floor. Subjects will be instructed to maintain the horizontal position as long as possible.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sit and reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>Base line and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is expressed in cm.The subject sits without shoes and the soles of the feet flat against a sit-and reach box with the zero mark at the 26 cm. Inner edges of the soles should be 15.2 cm apart.. The subject should slowly reach forward with both hands as far as possible, holding this position approximately 2 s.</description>
