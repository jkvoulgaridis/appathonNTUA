    <textblock>
      The trial, Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance (MORDOR)
      (NCT02047981) demonstrated that biannual distribution of azithromycin to children 1-59 months
      old reduces child mortality. Targeting treatment to children 1-11 months old could reduce
      selection for resistance by limiting antibiotic distributions while maximizing the mortality
      benefit by targeting treatment to children at the highest mortality risk. Such a targeted
      intervention remains untested, however. The investigator's objective in this study is to
      determine the optimal age group to treat with biannual oral azithromycin distribution to
      reduce child mortality.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible communities in Niger will be randomized to one of three azithromycin distribution
      strategies: 1) biannual oral azithromycin to children 1-11 months old with biannual oral
      placebo to children 12-59 months old, 2) biannual oral azithromycin to children 1-59 months
      old, or 3) biannual oral placebo to children 1-59 months old.

      Mortality will be monitored through biannual census data collection, which will be used to
      adaptively allocate treatment assignments, with the allocation updated at each treatment
      period and individual communities retaining their allocation for 4 distributions.
      Antimicrobial resistance will be monitored using cluster sampling of different groups of
      children and adults in the Dosso region. Additional data will be collected on implementation
      outcomes, including costs, reach and coverage, acceptability/adoption, and
      maintenance/sustainability.

      Implementation will be phased in by region. Dosso will be enrolled in the first year, Maradi
      and Zinder in the second year, and secure areas of Tillabéri and Tahoua and in the third
      year.

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>We will utilize a matching placebo to mask study arm allocation. All children aged 1-59 months in all study communities will be offered biannual azithromycin or placebo distribution in an identical fashion. Placebo will be identical to azithromycin in appearance, smell, and packaging.
Those who are masked to study arm allocation include participants investigators, most study personnel, census personnel administering treatment and collecting mortality outcomes, and laboratory personnel processing samples for resistance outcomes. Unmasked personnel include the study biostatistician, key members of the data coordinating center as needed, and key members of Pfizer staff. Key members of the Pfizer staff must be unmasked in order to implement the study drug treatment allocation, and to review serious adverse event (SAE) reporting.</masking_description>
