  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess health and quality of life outcomes in patients treated with
      benralizumab, within a Belgian Real-World setting. To prove the clinical value of
      benralizumab in a Real-World setting, the study will document the effect of benralizumab
      within a time frame of 56 weeks after initiation of treatment.

      The aim and objective of this single arm, prospective observational study is to provide
      supporting RWE on the symptom relief of asthma patients qualified for benralizumab therapy in
      Belgium. The PRO measures consist of the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ 6) as well as
      Patient Global Impression of Change and Severity (PGI-C and PGI-S), healthcare resource
      utilization (HCRU) and treatment satisfaction (TSQM-9). In addition change in daily OCS use
      and rate of exacerbations after initiation of benralizumab in real-world setting will be
      assessed
