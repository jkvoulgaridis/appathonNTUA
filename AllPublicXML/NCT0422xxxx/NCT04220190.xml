      RAPA-501-ALS is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study of RAPA-501 autologous T cells
      in adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter Phase 1 study evaluating RAPA-501 T cells
      in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

      After a subject consents to the study, an apheresis procedure will be performed to collect
      cells to manufacture the investigational product, RAPA-501 T cells.

      This study consists of three cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 will evaluate a 6-month regimen of four
      (4) cycles of RAPA-501 T cell therapy without the pentostatin-cyclophosphamide host
      conditioning regimen (PC regimen). Cohorts 1 and 2 will evaluate two different doses: Cohort
      1 - 40 x 10^6 cells/infusion and Cohort 2 - 160 x 10^6 cells/infusion. Both cohorts will
      evaluate a 6-month regimen of four cycles of the RAPA-501 cell therapy.

      Cohort 3 will evaluate the highest safe dose of RAPA-501 cells (from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)
      in combination with the PC regimen. Cohort 3 will evaluate a 6-month regimen of 4 cycles of
      RAPA-501 cells administered after the PC regimen. The PC regimen will be 7 days in duration
      and the RAPA-501 cell therapy will take place on Day 8.

      All subjects who complete active treatment on each cohort will then complete the follow-up
      portion of the study (approximately 6-months in duration).
