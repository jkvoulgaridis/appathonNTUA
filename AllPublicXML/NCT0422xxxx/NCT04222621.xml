  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve the health of women and children under the background of Healthy China 2030, the
      investigators developed REPRESENT by establishing a pregnancy registry in Xiamen, a
      sub-provincial city of over four million residents in east China, based on the Maternal and
      Child Health Management Platform, and then linking to three other platforms, i.e. Residents
      Healthcare Management Platform, Primary Healthcare Management Platform, and Electronic
      Healthcare Records (EHR) Platform, which had been developed since 2006. The registry
      documented information and events about pregnant women from registration at their first
      trimester to postpartum, and includes the childhood follow up records. The registry not only
      enables longitudinal follow up of pregnant women and their offspring, but also expands the
      scope of database from pre-pregnancy exposures to long-term outcomes by data linkage.

      During the past 11 years (January 2008 to March 2019), the REPRESENT has accumulated data
      concerning more than 700 thousands pregnancies. The data volume is substantial with over 800
      variables being documented, and most variables are designed as structured fields. The disease
      categories and codes are standardized according to the International Classification of
      Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). The whole process of data access, data extraction, data
      processing and data analysis was conducted through an internal-only accessible server at
      Xiamen Health and Medical Big Data Center. All investigators cannot access sensitive
      information, are required to sign data confidentiality agreement and should obtain approval
      by the Xiamen Health and Medical Big Data Center and the Chinese Evidence-based Medicine
      Center.
