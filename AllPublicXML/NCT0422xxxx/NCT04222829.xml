      Pharmacopuncture is a treatment that combines 2 of the most frequented Korean medicine
      treatment methods - traditional acupuncture and herbal medicine - by injecting herbal
      medicine extract at acupoints.

      Shinbaro is a refined herbal formulation used to treat inflamed lesions and bone diseases.

      This treatment is known to be an important part of Korean medicine treatment. However, there
      has been no specific value for the effect of this treatment.

      Therefore, The investigators conducted observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of
      Megadose Shinbaro Pharmacopuncture on shoulder. From Dec 2019, The investigators will collect
      80 patients with Chronic shoulder pain on both or each shoulder with the numeric rating
      scale(NRS) over 4.

      The investigators will compare pain, dysfunction, quality of life and satisfaction of
      patients who are treated with Korean medical treatment including Megadose Shinbaro
      Pharmacopuncture and patients who are treated with Korean medical treatment not including
      Megadose Shinbaro Pharmacopuncture.

      For these two groups, The investigators will compare NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), Visual
      Analogue Scale(VAS), Range Of Motion(ROM), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index(SPADI), Patient
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D-5L).

    <description>The extent of shoulder pain and discomfort was assessed using NRS. NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10. The participant is asked to report their shoulder pain and discomfort using NRS, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale of shoulder pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At screening, baseline, 2 weeks and through study completion, an average of 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is an assessment index in which the patient records their pain on a 100mm line from 'no pain' at one end, and 'the most severe pain imaginable' at the other end. Higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>

    <measure>Shoulder mobility on the Shoulder ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks and through study completion, an average of 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder ROM was measured in six directions (Flexion, Extension, Abduction, Adduction, Right rotation, Left rotation) with goniometer.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index questionnaire of shoulder pain and disability</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SPADI is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. Higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is an index that assesses improvements in functional limitation caused by whiplash injury. Participants rate the improvement in functional limitations after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Very much improved, 4=No change, 7=Very much worse). This index was originally developed for use in Psychology, but is currently used in various other medical fields to assess improvements in pain.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol 5-Dimension</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a method of indirectly calculating the weights of certain health states for quality of life after a multidimensional investigation of health states, and is the most widely used instrument for this purpose. The EQ-5D consists of 5 questions about current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression), and each question is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 3=moderate problems, 5=severe problems). In this study, The investigators will use the Korean version of the EQ-5D-5L, which has been demonstrated to be valid.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events(AE) Physicians will monitor and record any unexpected or unintended patient reaction to integrative korean medicine at each visit. Adverse events (AEs) associated with integrative korean medicine will include, but not be limited to, AEs anticipated from previous reports of korean medicine, and will stay open to all possibilities taking into consideration other potential, unknown AEs.</description>
