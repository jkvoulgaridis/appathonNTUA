  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative and progressive movement disorder, whose
      population incidence is increasing. It is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor,
      stiffness and bradykinesia, and non-motor symptoms, highlighting the executive dysfunction
      that can be present from the early stages of the disease. These deficits increase the risk of
      falls and reduce functional independence. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (ETCC) can
      be an attractive rehabilitation option in PD because it is a non-invasive and safe method
      that can modulate cortical excitability and improve motor and non-motor symptoms. One of the
      techniques to detect neurophysiological biomarkers associated with changes in the functional
      health of the brain and the effectiveness of this type of treatment is the analysis of
      microstates from the electroencephalogram (EEG). So, the objective of the present study is to
      investigate the effects of different assemblies of multifocal ETCC on the electrical brain
      activity represented by the EEG microstates and clinical characteristics in patients with PD.

    <textblock>
      For this, a randomized, triple-blind clinical trial will be conducted with 60 people with PD,
      between 40 and 75 years old, regardless of sex, recruited from the reference centers in
      neurology and physiotherapy in João Pessoa-PB. Participants will be randomized into three
      groups: Group 1 - ETCC over M1 + CPFDL; Group 2 - ETCC on M1 + APF; Group 3 - ETCC on M1. In
      each condition an initial baseline assessment (T0) will be performed after 16 treatment
      sessions (T1) and 30 days after the end of the protocol (Follow-up Assessment - T2). The
      evaluated outcomes will be: analysis of microstates and spectral analysis of frequencies by
      EEG; dual task capability with Timed Up and Go (TUG); executive function (Stroop test and
      verbal fluency test); motor aspects of daily life (MDS UPDRS II). For all analyzes, the
      statistical software SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL, USA) for Windows, Version 20.0, will be used
      and statistical significance considered at 5% (p ≤ 0.05).

    <description>For the analysis of the EEG microstates the following temporal parameters will be considered: the average duration of each microstate; its frequency of occurrence; the fraction of the total recording time covered by each; the overall variation explained by each microstate and the probabilities of transition from one microstate to another.
The brain electrical activity will be acquired through the BrainVision actiCHamp equipment using 32 Ag / AgCl electrodes that will be fixed according to the International 10-20 System, keeping the impedance below 10kΩ in silent condition and in eyes open states. and eyes closed. The output of the amplifier data will be directed to a computer with BrainVision Pycoder software to record the obtained records and the data will be processed using the BrainVision Analyzer.</description>

    <description>Participants will perform single and double task conditions with Timed Up and Go (TUG). First, only TUG (TUGS) is performed, a single attention task in which the participant will be instructed to get up from a chair, walk at a normal and safe pace for three meters, rotate 180 degrees, come back and sit down. Then the TUG will be performed simultaneously performing the cognitive task of generating a word list starting with a specific letter, speaking out loud (TUGC), and performing the TUG with the motor task of carrying a glass of water ( TUGM).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 16 sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for 20 minutes each at 2 mA intensity, on alternate days (3 times a week). The current will be delivered via saline-embedded sponge surface electrodes using a battery-powered neurostimulator (TCT-Research, Trans Cranial Technologies, Hong Kong). A small active specific electrode (5x5 cm) will be used to prevent coverage of adjacent areas, resulting in a current density of 0.08 mA / cm². The cathode, reference electrode (5x7cm), will be positioned in the occipital region. These parameters are within the safe limits established in previous human studies.</description>
