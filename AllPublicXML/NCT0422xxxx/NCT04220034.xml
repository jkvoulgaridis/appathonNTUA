  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is rapidly expanding to the treatment of many cancer
      types. Autoimmunity and clinical autoimmune diseases represent adverse events of ICIs with
      variable severity and consequences. Clinical trials using ICIs have largely excluded patients
      with preexisting autoimmune diseases but the rate of autoimmune flares has been reported to
      be high in patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases in retrospective cohort studies.
      Moreover numerous retrospective cases and series reported ICI-related autoimmune diseases in
      patients without any previous autoimmune event.

      To date, no study has prospectively evaluated the rate of biological and clinical
      autoimmunity in patients. Moreover, guidelines concerning autoantibodies monitoring in
      patients are subject of debate.

      The aim of this prospective study is to determine development or increase level frequencies
      of different types of autoantibodies in patients receiving ICI for the first time. The rate
      of clinical autoimmunes diseases development will also be recorded and correlated with
      autoantibodies prevalence before and during ICI treatment.

      Results will help to determine the rate of biological and clinical autoimmune events induced
      by ICIs in unselected patients and will help to clarify autoimmunity screening strategy in
      this setting.
