  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect perioperative pain-related data of elderly patients in multi-centers.
      Analyzing these collected data to find the high-risk factors of postoperative pain in elderly
      patients and to establish an early-warning model of perioperative pain in elderly patients,
      so as to improve the ability of assessing the risks of postoperative pain in elderly patients
      and providing an early warning.

      This study will collect perioperative pain-related data of elderly patients in multi-centers,
      including: preoperative general data, intraoperative anesthesia and surgical data, clinical
      laboratory data, postoperative pain and intervention, postoperative complications and quality
      of life. Analyzing these collected data to find the high-risk factors of postoperative pain
      in elderly patients and to establish an early-warning model of perioperative pain in elderly
      patients, so as to improve the ability of assessing the risks of postoperative pain in
      elderly patients and providing an early warning.

    <description>Complications within 30 days after surgery will be classified using Clavien-Dindo Classification of Surgical Complications, ranging from Grade I(Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions) to Grade V(death of a patient).</description>

    <time_frame>1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and180 days postoperation</time_frame>
    <description>The trajectory of HRQoL is the vector of Utility values measured with EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire(EQ-5D)taken over 6 months(days 1, 3, 7,14, 21, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,180; Day 0 is the day of surgery). The EQ-5D measures health on five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain discomfort, and anxiety-depression), and the scores will be combined using Chinese general population weights to generate a single utility or index score. Utility values for the EQ-5D range from 1.00 to -0.391, where a score of 0 and 1 are regarded as equivalent to death and 'perfect health', respectively, and a score &lt; 0 is considered as health state that is 'worse than death'.</description>
