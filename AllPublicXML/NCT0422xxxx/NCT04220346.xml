  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circumcision is a common procedure in infants, children and young people around the world for
      cultural, religious or medical reasons. Since this is a painful procedure, it is performed
      under local anesthesia or general anesthesia. It is recommended to perform this procedure
      under local anesthesia if there is no risk. Although local anesthesia is used during the
      procedure, pain and anxiety levels of children may increase. Distraction methods are commonly
      used and effective methods to reduce pain and anxiety during painful procedures. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the effect of tablet playing during circumcision on pain and
      anxiety in school age children.

    <textblock>
      Circumcision is a common procedure in the worldwide. To our knowledge, although there have
      been several randomized controlled trials using video and game techniques, which are
      distractions to reduce pain and anxiety during painful procedures, no randomized controlled
      trials using playing the game with Tablet to reduce pain and anxiety during circumcision have
      been found. Non-pharmacological studies, such as play therapy, are needed to reduce pain and
      anxiety in school-age children undergoing circumcision under local anesthesia. The aim of
      this study is to provide evidence about the effectiveness of playing the game with Tablet
      used to reduce pain and anxiety during circumcision, and to contribute to nursing care in
      pain management.
