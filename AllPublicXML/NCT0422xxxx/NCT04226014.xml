    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is defined by the presence of at least two of the following five criteria:
      abdominal perimeter&gt; 94 cm in men, 80 cm in women, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol,
      HTA and hyperglycemia.

      The metabolic syndrome can lead to ultrasound hepatic steatosis in 20 to 40% of cases
      depending on the population studied (overweight vs obesity). What is the impact of this
      syndrome on pancreatic echogenicity?

    <textblock>
      Little is known about the pathogenesis of the fatty pancreas. Fat can replace acinar cells
      and / or pancreatic endocrine cells (1). To date, there are no biomarkers allowing the
      detection of a fatty pancreas. It appears that older age, male, obesity, alcohol consumption,
      high triglycerides, high ALT, diabetes or insulin resistance, fatty liver and metabolic
      syndrome are risk factors for a fatty pancreas (2,3,4).To the investigator's knowledge, these
      different factors have not been evaluated on the impact of pancreatic echogenecity in
      endosonography. The objective of this study is to correlate the factors making up the
      metabolic syndrome with pancreatic echogenecity.

The visibility of Wirsung in three categories: excellent, average, poor
that of the contours in 3 categories good or average or poor visualization of the splenic vein
that of the parenchyma in 3 categories: normal, brilliant, not too obstructing the visualization of the Wirsung and the splenic vein, very promising embarrassing the visualization of the Wirsung and the splenic vein

    <description>Echo-endoscopy ultrasound is an examination that presents little risk. However, any medical act, exploration, intervention even conducted under conditions of competence and safety in accordance with current data of medicine and the regulations in force, conceals a risk of complications. In particular, esophageal perforations can occur. They are often favored by underlying lesions (tumor, diverticulum, anatomical variants ...). Other complications are possible such as cardiovascular, respiratory or infectious disorders, as with any anesthesia.</description>
