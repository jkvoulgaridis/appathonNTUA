  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Parkinson Disease (PWPD) have significant problems with velocity, safety and dual
      tasking during walking that may be secondary to poor automaticity. Sensory functions,
      especially visual dependence and proprioceptive integration are critical for efficient
      walking and are often impaired. This home program compares the use of multimodal sensory
      feedback during stepping and balance exercises in PWPD to a group without the sensory
      feedback performing the same basic exercises.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease impairs motor and sensory functions. Automaticity of gait is lost
      increasing the use of higher center control of walking, leading to cognitive fatigue, slower
      movement and motor errors. People with Parkinson disease (PWPD) improve motor performance
      when external sensory cues, which bypass the faulty basal ganglia, are used during
      interventions. Enhancing proprioceptive, visual and vestibular cues that are critical for
      walking has the potential to improve gait and decrease cognitive fatigue by restoring
      automaticity.

      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled study with repeated measures to evaluate the
      effects of a home exercise program with or without the addition of multi-modal sensory
      feedback (MMSF) in real-time on automaticity of gait and balance. PWPDs are randomly assigned
      to one of 2 home exercise groups. There are two 6 week exercise sessions with a 6 week of no
      exercises inter-spaced between them. The exercises promote rapid and large movement in
      stepping activities, balance using self-perturbation through single, leg swings and standing
      on a compliant surface for sensory re-weighting. People in the experimental group perform the
      program with real-time with MMSF. Participants are to progress exercises in speed and
      distance as well as performing with eyes closed to improve proprioceptive processing and
      automaticity.
