    <textblock>
      Design of a simple blind randomized controlled trial study. The total number of subjects was
      66. In the main group (A) - 33, in the other group (B) - 33. Operation - sublay retromuscular
      using prolene mesh implant. In group A Hemoblock 15 ml in the retromuscular and 15 ml in the
      subcutaneous spaces were used. Wounds were drained by vacuum-suction drainage. Postoperative
      monitoring of early ultrasound examinations on the 3rd, 7th, 10th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st,
      25th, 28th, 30th days after drainage removal.

      In group B were used a standard intervention (sublay retromuscular).

    <description>Incisional hernia repair using mesh prolene implant in sublay retromuscular position. Dissect the posterior rectus sheets, suture them continuously, formed a retromuscular space in which the standard prolene mesh implant is installed. Perform hemostasis. Install the drainage tube into the retromuscular space.
After that, the anterior rectus sheets were sutured, hemostasis was performed, a drainage tube was installed in the subcutaneous tissue. Drainage tubes were connected to the UnoVac vacuum aspiration system (Unomedical, Denmark).</description>
