      Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nutrition Training on
      mothers' nutrition pattern, breast milk and newborn intestinal microbiota.

      Materials and methods: The study was conducted as a non-randomized controlled experimental
      study. The population of the study consisted of mothers and their babies who delivered
      vaginally, breastfeeded their babies at the end of the second postnatal day and delivered at
      the maternity ward of the Malatya Training and Research Hospital Beydağı Campus. The sample
      of the study consisted of 120 mothers, 57 of whom were experimental and 63 of them were in
      the control group. In this study, a sub-sample of 15 mothers and their infants was selected
      and microbiota of breast milk and stool samples were examined.

      In the first interview with the mothers in the experimental and control groups, Participant
      Identification Form, BTSKF were applied as a pre-test and stool samples of breast milk and
      newborn were taken. Then, the mothers in the experimental group were given nutritional
      education. In addition, motivational messages were sent to mothers' phones once a week. MTS
      in the experimental and control groups were filled with BTSKF as an intermediate test at the
      first month and post-test at the third month and stool samples of breast milk and newborn
      were collected at the mothers' own homes. During these visits, nutrition counseling was given
      to the mothers in the experimental group.

      Nutrition is very important from intrauterine life to old age for a healthy and productive
      life. However, the importance of pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding during the special
      stages in which the woman is experienced in her life process increases slightly (Ho et al.,
      2016; Erick, 2018; Tekiner and Ungan, 2014). Healthy nutrition is a key concern for the
      health of the baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding periods as well as the
      health of the mother (Taşkın, 2016; Samur, 2008). Intrauterine life is transmitted by
      placental way and in the postpartum period, breast milk is fed to the baby. Therefore, in
      order to ensure optimal growth and development of the baby, the mother needs adequate,
      regular and quality nutrition (Ho et al., 2016; Erick, 2018; Tekiner and Ungan, 2014).

    <description>Food Consumption Frequency Registration Form It is a form created by determining the type, frequency and amount of food consumed in order to determine the food consumption habits of mothers in the last 1 month. Food Consumption Frequency Registration Form is composed of four basic food groups (Milk and dairy products,Meat and group foods, Vegetable and fruit group and Grain group).
Mothers were asked to define the frequency of food consumption as daily, 5-6 times a week, 3-4 times a week, 1-2 times a week, once every 15 days and once a month. The mother of the amount of food they consume is used in everyday life, cups, spoons, were asked to specify the dimensions such as grain, followed by Turkey Ministry of Health Nutrition Guidelines (2016) was recorded by turning a portion.</description>

    <description>After the health status of the mothers in the experimental group was stabilized, approximately 20-30 minutes of nutritional education was given at the first interview before the hospital discharge. After nutrition education, motivational messages were sent to women's phones once a week. In addition, mothers were given nutritional counseling during their home visits during the 1st and 3rd months, and their questions and problems regarding nutrition were evaluated. The mother was supported where she needed it.
In nutritional education, information was given such as adequate and balanced nutrition in the postpartum period, adequate fluid intake, consumption and importance of prebiotic and probiotic foods, the importance of healthy microbiota for infant health and the amount of nutrients equivalent to one serving. In addition, the handbook which contains the educational content is given to the mothers to facilitate the recall.</description>
