  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to assess clinical outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who
      have switched from traditional multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy to continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy with the Omnipod insulin system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor glycemic control is associated with increased risk of diabetes-related complications in
      persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite advancements in insulin therapies and an increase
      in diabetes technology use, only 21% of adults with T1D are meeting their targeted glycated
      hemoglobin (A1C) levels. The Omnipod insulin system is a patch pump that consists of a
      handheld controller and disposable pod that delivers insulin. A retrospective analysis of
      medical records in the United States found that there was a significant reduction in A1C
      three months after initiating Omnipod in pediatric, adolescent and adult populations with T1D
      who switched from either MDI or traditional CSII. Currently, the real-world effectiveness of
      the Omnipod compared to MDI in adults with T1D on glycemic control, weight, and insulin dose,
      is not established.

      The Canadian Real-World Outcomes of Omnipod Initiation in People with T1D: Evidence from the
      LMC Diabetes Registry (COPPER) study is a retrospective, observational study using
      demographic and clinical data from the LMC Diabetes Registry, which consists of over 42,000
      active patients with diabetes across 3 Canadian provinces. The overall objectives of this
      study are to assess clinical outcomes in adults with T1D who switch from MDI to CSII therapy
      with Omnipod, and to compare clinical outcomes in the Omnipod cohort to a matched cohort of
      MDI users.
