  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a new treatment (repetitive transcranial
      stimulation (rTMS)) for Veterans with stimulant use disorder (SUD). Despite the large public
      health burden imposed by SUD, there is currently no FDA-approved or widely recognized
      effective somatic treatment. rTMS may be a promising treatment option for SUD. In this study,
      we will demonstrate the feasibility of applying rTMS to Veterans with SUD, examine the
      efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of SUD, and explore biomarkers that may guide patient
      selection for rTMS treatment and predict treatment response.

    <description>Before and after treatment, participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging while completing the Monetary Incentive Delay Task, a validated probe of reward processing circuit function and dysfunction. Signaling in the substantia nigra will be measured in an individual-subject, &quot;native space&quot; ROI approach as a marker of dopaminergic reward processing function, as well as in voxel-wise, whole-brain exploratory analyses. Changes in reward function and signaling will be compared between active vs. sham rTMS groups</description>

    <description>rTMS is a non-invasive procedure in which administering a transient magnetic field induces electrical currents in specific, targeted brain regions. The intervention (active and sham) will be administered in 8 sessions across 2 weeks. The brain region targeted is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</description>
