  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate possible associations between ongoing viral hepatitis (i.e.
      hepatitis A, B, C or E virus infection) and ultrasound or computed tomography-verified
      gallstone disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients seeking care at emergency room at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg,
      Sweden undergoing ultrasound or computed tomography for suspected gallstone disease, will be
      asked if they wish to participate in the study. If they agree, a serum sample will be draw
      for analysis of anti-HAV IgM, HBsAg, anti-HCV, HCV Core antigen and HEV RNA. The proportion
      of patients with vs. without ultrasound or computed tomography-verified gallstone disease
      will be evaluated regarding possible ongoing viral hepatitis (i.e. hepatitis A, B, C or E
      virus infection).
