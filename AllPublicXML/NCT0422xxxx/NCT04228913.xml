  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the postoperative pain after the endodontic treatment by using three
      different obturation techniques. ( Cold lateral condensation (CLC), thermoplasticized
      solid-core carrier method (GuttaCore) and cold free-flow compation tecnique ( GuttaFlow2))
