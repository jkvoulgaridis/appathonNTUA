  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cardiorenal Syndrome during Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with persistent
      congestion despite high dose IV diuretic therapy is associated with remarkable morbidity,
      which can include the need for renal dialysis or ultrafiltration, an increased length of
      stay, and high mortality rates. The aims and purpose of this feasibility clinical research
      trial are: 1. to evaluate the safety profiles associated with performing negative pressure
      diuresis for the treatment of hypervolemia associated with the cardiorenal syndrome during
      ADHF with persistent congestion despite high dose IV diuretic therapy via the investigational
      JuxtaFlow® System, and 2. to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational JuxtaFlow
      System in treatment of hypervolemia associated with ADHF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients ≥22 years of age

          2. Patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ADHF

          3. Persistent volume overload with venous congestion despite at least 24 hours of IV
             diuretic therapy, including either a single bolus ≥ 100 mg or continuous drip ≥ 10
             mg/hour of furosemide equivalent, where:

               1. Volume overload defined by the presence of pulmonary edema, 2+ peripheral edema,
                  or orthopnea

               2. Venous congestion defined by at least one of the following:

             i. Jugular venous pressure &gt; 10 cm on physical exam ii. Central venous pressure &gt; 10
             mmHg iii. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt; 22 mmHg c) Evidence of low natriuretic
             response to high dose diuretic therapy defined by spot urine sodium &lt; 70 mmol

          4. Ability to have the JuxtaFlow® System catheters placed at bedside

          5. Anticipated to have an inpatient hospital admission that is ≥ 72 hours

          6. Patients that are willing and able to provide informed consent for this research
             trial, or if the patient is not able to provide consent due to their clinical
             condition, a legal guardian, spouse, or next of kin to the patient with medical power
             of attorney that is willing to provide consent for the patient's participation in this
             research trial
