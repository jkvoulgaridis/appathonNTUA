             75 or younger patients with comorbidities (&lt;75):

             Frailty score takes into account age, as well as the geriatric assessments
             incorporating 3 tools: the Katz Activity of Daily Living (ADL), the Lawton
             Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL), and the Charlson Comorbidity Index
             (CCI)-see detailed tables in Appendix A.

               2. seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface
                  antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg
                  negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]
                  and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened
                  using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus
                  (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION:
                  Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs
                  positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV
                  vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.

               3. seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic
                  response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of
