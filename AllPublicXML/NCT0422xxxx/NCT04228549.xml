  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an online program to help people with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) in their extremities to better self-manage their condition. Some earlier
      testing has been done and the investigators now wish to try this system with participants who
      have this blood vessel disease as well as high blood pressure. Investigators are hoping to
      help these participants to achieve healthier lifestyles and improve their quality of life
      through education, monitoring and continuing support. A similar online desk-top version with
      over 30 participants has been tested at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The investigators
      propose to test this newer mobile system with 210 outpatient participants from Hamilton
      General Hospital. Data collected will be analyzed following the (12 months for each
      participant) study, along with data recorded during clinical visits at baseline and twelve
      months for each participant. The objective is to evaluate changes to participant health and
      determine whether the health self-management process has been successful in improving
      participant lifestyles and quality of life, when compared to usual care.
