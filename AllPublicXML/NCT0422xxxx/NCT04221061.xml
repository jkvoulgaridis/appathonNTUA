  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subject will be a candidate for this imaging study because they have agreed to
      participate in a treatment study involving TTFields (Optune device), a device that uses low
      intensity, wave like electrical fields, and a PARP inhibitor drug (niraparib). The research
      study is being conducted to test how a new radioactive imaging drug called
      18F-Fluorthanatrace (18F-FTT) can be used to image sites of recurrent brain cancer before or
      after new treatment or surgery. 18F-FTT is a drug used with an imaging test called Positron
      Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT).
