  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients diagnosed with rheumatic disease, such as systemic lupus
      erythematosus, inflammatory myositis, and vasculitis, will experience fever or infection
      during their course of therapy. The most common microbiologically documented infection is
      bacterial, virus, and fungal, which can be associated with the severity and mortality of
      disease. Current methods of diagnosis require a significant load of pathogen making early
      detection difficult. Delayed diagnosis and delayed optimal therapy of infection are
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

      This study seeks to identify whether next generation sequencing (NGS) of pathogens can
      identify patients with infection treated with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive agents.
      This would enable preemptive targeted therapy to replace prophylaxis treatment which often
      leads to some adverse events and antibiotic resistance.

      Plasma/Serum samples collected but not required for clinical care (discarded samples) will be
      collected and stored. Results of NGS will be compared between patients who develop definite
      infection immediately (within 72 hours) after sample collection, and those who remain well.
      Clinical data describing baseline information about the patient and rheumatic diseases,
      antibiotic and steroid or immunosuppressor therapy exposure, pathogen testing, immunology
      results, and infection-related events will be collected prospectively from the electronic
      medical record.

      An initial exploratory phase will examine approximately 50 participants to determine whether
      the effectiveness of predicting infections. The study may then enroll up to 200 participants
      to collection additional data for analysis.
