  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week, home-based
      exercise program in bladder cancer patients undergoing curative intent neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and RC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will seek to recruit 20 patients diagnosed with muscle invasive localized
      urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who are scheduled to receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
      prior to RC from the Queen Elizabeth Health Sciences center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
      Participants will be randomly allocated to standard of care treatment versus standard of care
      plus a multimodal, home-based program including strength and endurance exercises. Outcomes
      measured will include feasibility data, patient outcomes, and post-surgical complications.

    <measure>Health-related quality of life in patients with bladder cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life during neoadjuvant chemotherapy as measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bladder scale (FACT-Bl). The 39 item FACT-B provides subscale scores of physical (7-items), functional (7-items), emotional (6-items), and social/family (7-items) well-being as well as a bladder cancer specific sub-scale. The sum of scores on subscales evaluates a participants' quality of life with higher scores denoting higher quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue scale (FACIT-F). The FACIT-F is a 13 item scale with each item measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent less fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is a 19-item tool that assesses usual sleep habits during the past month. A global sleep quality score from 0 to 21 is generated with higher scores denoting worse sleep quality</description>
