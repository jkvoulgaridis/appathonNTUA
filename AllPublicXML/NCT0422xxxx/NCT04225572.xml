      Phase 1: The investigators will conduct a prospective study to quantify the association
      between axillary web syndrome (AWS) and metastatic disease and chronic morbidities such as
      lymphedema, shoulder dysfunction, and pain comparing women (i) with AWS and (ii) without AWS
      in two cohorts of women. (n=200) Phase 2: This is a randomized controlled trial to 1)
      quantify the effects of (i) physical therapy compared to (ii) a control group in individuals
      with AWS following breast cancer surgery related to physical activity and physical
      impairments such as lymphedema, shoulder motion, function, and pain (n=44, 22 in each group).
      Funding to progress to Phase 2 of this trial has been obtained. It is anticipated 120
      subjects participating in Phase 1 will be screened for eligibility for Phase 2 (separate
      consent and eligibility from Phase 1).

    <description>Therapeutic exercise:
ROM: Begin with passive upper extremity ROM and progress to active ROM.
Strengthening: Progressive upper extremity resistive exercises starting with light weights.
Aerobic: Select a suitable, individual aerobic exercise program (walking, yoga, etc.) Manual therapy
Soft tissue mobilization, myofascial release, and stretching of identified tight and stiff tissue.
Lymphedema treatment
Manual lymph drainage: Gentle lymphatic massage to lymph nodes and vessels by PT for 1-2 weeks. Instruct patient in self MLD to perform 1-2×/day for 10 minutes during the remaining weeks.
Compression therapy: Gradient compression bandaging for daily wear with activities and exercise for 1-2 weeks. Instruct in self compression bandaging or issue a compression garment to wear with exercise or activity, or with worsening symptoms of AWS (i.e. cording extends down arm) or lymphedema.</description>
