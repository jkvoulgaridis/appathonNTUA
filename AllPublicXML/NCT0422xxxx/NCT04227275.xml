  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 study of the safety, tolerability and feasibility of dosing
      patients harboring metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with genetically
      modified autologous T cells (CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells) engineered to express a chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) capable of recognizing the tumor antigen prostate-specific membrane
      antigen (PSMA) and activating the T cell.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single-arm study designed to identify the dose and regimen of CART-PSMA-
      TGFβRDN cells that can be safely administered intravenously following the lymphodepletion
      (LD) regimen to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
      Following Dose Escalation, a Cohort Expansion will enroll patients to further explore the
      safety and tolerability of the selected dose and schedule.

      It is anticipated that up to 50 patients will enroll in this study in both dose escalation
      and cohort expansion.
