    <textblock>
      Adherence for children living with HIV is a by-proxy phenomenon dependent on caregivers
      (parents, relatives or unrelated guardians) who may or may not be living with HIV. The
      complexity of paediatric formulations and dosing for ART regimens often poses challenges for
      caregivers, making ART administration and achievement of viral suppression quite a difficult
      task for young children. Peer support for caregivers presents a potentially feasible and
      impactful approach to improve ART adherence and facilitate achievement of viral suppression
      among children. However, there is a scarcity of robust evidence on the impact of caregiver
      support as a treatment adherence strategy for children.

      The study is a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial that includes 78 unsuppressed
      children living with HIV (0-10 years old) and their caregivers at six cluster sites in
      Nigeria. It will:

        -  Explore facilitators and barriers to ART adherence among young children to develop a
           caregiver peer mentor training curriculum and interventional programme.

        -  Test the impact of caregiver peer support, a locally adapted behavioural intervention,
           to improve adherence and promote achievement of viral suppression among children.

      The intervention will target caregivers of unsuppressed children, measuring outcomes at child
      level after 12 months of follow up. The intervention arm will receive structured
      caregiver-to-caregiver peer support while the control arm will receive routine standard of
      care with no such support. The researchers will compare viral suppression and ART drug-pickup
      rates for children living with HIV at specific time points for both arms.

      Study Purpose and Intervention: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of
      structured peer support (PS) to caregivers in achieving viral suppression among children
      living with HIV in Nigeria. The study adopts a behavioral intervention that engages &quot;expert&quot;
      caregivers (Champion Caregivers) whose CLHIV wards have achieved viral suppression, to
      provide structured peer support to other caregivers towards achieving viral suppression for
      unsuppressed CLHIV. Using a previously-tested structured PS model, Champion Caregivers will
      receive comprehensive skills-training, including counselling techniques and pediatric ART
      formulations/administration techniques, and will use standardized logbooks to document client
      interactions.

      Study Aims and Objectives Recent data from Institute of Human Virology Nigeria
      (IHVN)-supported facilities in the study setting show viral suppression averaging 42.5% among
      CLHIV &lt;10 years and 61% for those 10-19 years old. Clearly, younger children need
      prioritization for viral suppression interventions. The structured Mentor Mother PS model was
      successful in improving viral suppression among HIV-infected women in the same study setting.
      The PS intervention's structure lies in a focused curriculum, standardized schedules,
      documentation for client interactions, and performance evaluations. Prior programmatic data
      indicate that 30-40% of CLHIV have lost at least one biological parent by age 10 years.
      However, especially for double orphans or indigent/ill single parents, relatives/unrelated
      guardians (who may or may not be HIV-infected) step in as primary caregivers. Sustained
      support, education and motivation for caregivers is thus important for optimal CLHIV
      treatment outcomes. Prescription refill/drug pickup has been a useful, convenient and
      cost-containing measure of ART adherence in prior studies especially in resource-limited
      settings. Use of integrase inhibitors is at its infancy in Nigeria. Dolutegravir scale-up
      started in earnest in 2018; as such, there are no appreciable numbers of children on this
      drug in early 2019. Approximately 92% of children in the target population are on nevirapine
      or efavirenz-based regimens. The rest are receiving Lopinavir or atazanavir-based regimens.
      Drug resistance testing (DRT) is not routine and there is currently no in-country capability
      to test integrase inhibitor resistance. There is currently no available data from randomized
      trials evaluating caregiver PS interventions for CLHIV adherence and viral suppression. Given
      the above context and information, investigators propose a two-arm cluster-randomized
      Caregiver Peer Support (CaPS) trial at 6 clinics and among 78 unsuppressed CLHIV six
      months-10 years of age.

      Study Design, Methods and Research Participants:

      CaPS is a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial to be conducted at secondary healthcare
      facilities in two neighboring states: Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Nasarawa State.
      Secondary facilities are targeted because majority of children and adolescents living with
      HIV in Nigeria are managed at secondary health facilities.

      Site Eligibility Criteria:

        -  High-volume secondary facility (≥500 HIV-infected adults/children enrolled)

        -  ≥1 adherence counsellor

        -  ≥20 virally-unsuppressed CLHIV aged 6 months to 10 years In FCT and Nasarawa, there are
           15 high-volume secondary facilities receiving President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
           (PEPFAR)-supported pediatric quality improvement (QI) initiatives which do not include
           caregiver PS. Six of the 15 sites will be randomly-selected and randomly-assigned 1:1 by
           computer software to receive intervention (Champion Caregiver) PS or standard-of-care
           only (no caregiver PS).

      Sample Size Minimum sample size is 11 CLHIV per cluster x 6 clusters (3 clusters/arm, 66
      CLHIV total). This sample size has 80% power to detect a 30% increase (absolute difference)
      in viral suppression rates (40% to 70%), assuming an intra-cluster correlation of 0.03 and
      coefficient of variation (k) of 0.21. Effect size of +32% was achieved with structured PS
      among women living with HIV in the same study setting.

      After factoring in ~5% for expected mortality rate among Nigerian CLHIV 36, 5% for study
      withdrawal and 5% for formal transfer rates, the target sample size per cluster is
      approximately 13 CLHIV (minimum sample size of 11 + an extra 15%). Total target sample size
      is thus 78 (13 per cluster x 6 clusters).

      Data Analysis Plan Effect of CC support on CLHIV viral suppression will be examined using a
      multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equation to account for
      clustering. First, univariate models will be performed for association between CC
      support/intensity (secondarily for drug-pickups) and viral suppression.
      Biologically-plausible variables and those changing crude effect size by ≥ 5% will be
      sequentially added to the multivariate model. Sensitivity analysis with lower VL threshold of
      &lt;20 copies/ml is planned. Analysis will be performed with SAS software v 9.4.

      Participant Recruitment Investigators will recruit pediatric patients aged between 6 months
      and 10 years enrolled at pediatric ART clinics within the participating PEPFAR-supported
      healthcare facilities. Research assistants (RAs) will work with the focal person in the
      pediatric clinic to identify and recruit eligible patients. RAs will approach the
      parent/caregiver of the eligible participants to obtain consent for participation in the
      study. With regard to assent, the Nigerian National Health Research Ethics Committee
      recommends obtaining assent for children 12 years to under 18 years of age. Given the target
      age group for CaPS (age 6 months to 10 years), assent would not apply to this study. All
      children enrolled will be required to only have parental consent.

      Privacy and Confidentiality, Risks and Benefits, Ethics

        1. Privacy measures include having only healthcare workers first approach caregivers and
           eligible participants for recruitment. As such, only caregivers and participants who
           wish to be contacted will be contacted for recruitment. To protect participant's
           privacy, interviews will take place in a private room.

        2. Confidentiality measures include the following: Trained research assistants will meet
           with participants in a private space at the health facility to administer study
           questionnaires. Access to study data with private/contact information is restricted to
           only key study staff. Both hard copy and electronic data will be kept locked or with
           password protection in secured devices or research file cabinets. Protected health
           information (PHI) and all study data will be kept confidential following local and
           international privacy guidelines. Participants will be identified with a study ID and
           forms will be labelled with the participants' ID instead of their name. Data will be
           abstracted and stored in an electronic database which will be encrypted. De-identified
           data will be made available to other members of the team, such as the biostatistician,
           on a need to know basis. Blood samples will be obtained periodically from all
           participants for viral load measurement throughout the study. The samples will be
           collected according to an established protocol in the health facility and labeled with
           the participant ID.

        3. Risks: This study is designed to pose only minimal risk to participants. Physical risk
           is associated with the blood sample collection needed for viral load assessment. Blood
           draws carry some risk of causing, pain, bruising and infection. Additional psychological
           risk may be associated with responding to questions on the psychosocial assessment tools
           and other qualitative interviews. The questionnaires may make a participant feel
           uncomfortable, stressed or a sense of invasion of privacy. The main risk to subjects is
           a potential breach in the protection of the participant's private health information.
           Participation in the study activities may lead to increased perception of stigma among
           participants which presents a social risk.

           To reduce physical risk, all blood draws will be performed by a trained healthcare
           professional during clinic visits. Proper clinical practice (gloves, sharp disposal,
           etc.) and appropriate medical attention to address any emergency that may arise from the
           blood draws will be made available.

           Psychological risk will be mitigated by ensuring that research staff are trained to be
           sensitive to the potential for psychological harm. Participants will be informed that
           their participation is voluntary and that participants have the right to refuse to
           answer or withdraw from the study at any point.

           Social risk, including stigma, discrimination and violence, associated with
           participation in the research activities will be minimized by leveraging on safeguards
           already in place at the healthcare facilities.

        4. Benefits Probable benefits of the research for individual participants The aim of the
           intervention is to improve viral suppression and long-term clinical outcome for children
           living with HIV. Enrollment in this program will expose caregivers of CLHIV to knowledge
           and skill-building activities that may lead to improvement in health outcomes of their
           child/ward.

      Data and Safety Monitoring CaPS will develop a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) to oversee
      and ensure the safety of participants' private health information and the validity and
      integrity of study data. All study personnel will follow the DSMP guidance for managing data
      to ensure the research data are collected, verified, and entered in an appropriate manner
      that reflects completeness, integrity, and is analyzable.

    <description>Caregiver peer support from Champion caregivers (Peer mentors) to caregivers of unsuppressed children living with HIV (CLHIV) on child care and medication adherence strategies to enhance achievement of viral suppression: Champion Caregivers (Peer Mentors) will be assigned to the intervention arm and will be trained to support 10-15 caregivers for 18 months post enrollment. Champion Caregivers (CCs) be trained using an adapted Mentor-Mother Peer Support curriculum and topics will include pediatric treatment gaps, ARV formulations/dosing, adherence counseling, and virological failure/suppression. Champion caregivers will conduct monthly-to-quarterly 30 min to 1 hr clinic-aligned caregiver group training sessions and home visits at least once quarterly, targeting Child living with HIV (CLHIV) adherence, age-appropriate disclosure, and keeping clinic appointments. The intervention arm will in addition to peer support intervention, receive routine standard of care at the health facility.</description>

    <description>Unsuppressed Children living with HIV and their caregivers recruited in the control arm will receive no champion caregiver peer support intervention but will continue to receive the standard of care at their health facilities which include routine care, including age-appropriate antiretroviral therapy and clinic appointments (typically every 2-3 months). Routine, albeit brief (5-10 min) adherence counselling is provided to CLHIV/caregivers by trained healthcare workers (HCWs) at every visit. In Nigeria, routine VL is done at 6 months post-ART initiation and repeated 12 months post- initiation 20. VL is done yearly thereafter for suppressed clients. Those unsuppressed receive 3-months' enhanced adherence counselling (EAC) (15-30 min) by Healthcare workers, with intensified appointment schedules and repeat VL upon EAC completion. This rigorous intervention continues until viral suppression is achieved or ART is switched; drug resistance testing (DRT) is not routine.</description>
