  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine if prolonged use of S&amp;SEs in a whole diet approach (foods and drinks)
      improves dietary health and obesity related risk factors and increases compliance to weight
      control paradigms in the long term. A randomized, controlled, multicentre trial (RCT) will be
      conducted.

      We hypothesize, that:

        -  Prolonged use of S&amp;SEs in beverages and food matrices will result in improved body
           weight control because S&amp;SEs will increase palatability of the diet and thereby increase
           compliance to the recommendations for a healthy diet.

        -  There will be no safety concerns using S&amp;SEs in the long term.

      Families where at least one adult (both gender) and one child (both gender) are
      overweight/obese will be recruited. The majority of measurements will only be conducted in
      the adult population and some measurement will only be done in subgroups. The intervention
      will be performed in four countries: Denmark, Greece, Spain and the Netherlands.

      In total 660 participants - approximately 330 adults (18-65 years of age) and 330 children
      (6-12 years of age) - will be recruited for the study. All adult participants are first
      treated by a low energy diet (LED) for 2 months with an aim to reduce body weight (minimum 5%
      weight loss (WL)), whereas children are treated separately with a conventional weight
      maintenance (WM) diet, without a specific aim for absolute WL.

      The families are randomized into two different diet interventions for 22 months with or
      without inclusion of S&amp;SEs products (foods and drinks). For adults, this period aims at
      preventing weight re-gain and for children maintaining body mass index (BMI)-for-age. The
      participants will receive a food exchange list and will be guided by dieticians. All members
      of a family will be randomized to the same diet and the randomization will be stratified by
      age of the adult, sex and BMI.

      The adult participants are weighed at months 0, 0.5 and 1, and if needed at month 1.5,
      supervised during the WL period at months 0 and 1, and if needed at months 0.5 and 1.5, and
      throughout the WM period at months 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24. Children will follow a similar,
      but less strict time schedule (their participation is preferred but not required for all
      dietician meetings).

      The main assessment points are the clinical investigation days (CIDs) at month 0 (baseline,
      start of the WL period), 2 (end of the WL period/start of randomized intervention), 6 (6
      months from baseline), 12 (1 year from baseline) and 24 (2 years from baseline).
