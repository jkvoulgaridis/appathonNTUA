      This is an open, multicenter clinical trial of ABCD for invasive candidiasis and invasive
      aspergillosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and population pharmacokinetic characteristics
      of ABCD in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis. About 60
      patients with confirmed invasive candidiasis or confirmed/probable/possible invasive
      aspergillosis will be enrolled.

    <description>Patients with invasive candidiasis (IC) will only receive intravenous treatment with ABCD. ABCD will be administered once a day at a dose of 3-4 mg/kg.
Patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) will be treated with ABCD for 4 weeks first, followed by oral administration of voriconazole. ABCD dosing regimen will be the same as that for IC patients.</description>

    <description>IC patients will only receive intravenous treatment with ABCD, with the longest course of treatment up to 42 days. ABCD will be administered once a day at a dose of 3-4 mg/kg. Visit plan: screening period (D-4 to D-1), baseline period (D1), treatment period and follow-up period (14±3days after the end of the last dose of ABCD).
IA patients will be treated with ABCD for 4 weeks first, followed by oral administration of voriconazole. The total course of treatment should be at least 6 to 12 weeks. ABCD dosing regimen will be the same as that for IC patients. Visiting plan: screening period (D-4to D-1), baseline period (D1), treatment period and follow-up period.</description>
