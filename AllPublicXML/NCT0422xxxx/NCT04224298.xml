    <textblock>
      Based on the theory of traditional Chinese Medicine, this study collects eye features of
      white eyes through the White Eye Imaging Health Care System under visible light and
      establishes a database of eye-eye features corresponding to the disease. The computer image
      analysis and artificial intelligence technology are used to visualize the eye. The features
      were extracted and classified, and the corresponding changes in the characteristics of the
      traditional Chinese medicine and the disease were analyzed statistically to establish an
      analytical model corresponding to the disease.

      1. Collecting the white-eyed eye features of 500 patients with malignant tumors and 500
           non-tumor patients by the white-eye shadowless imaging acquisition system under visible
           light, and establishing eye-catching images of malignant tumor patients and healthy
           people of different diseases. Feature database.

        2. Based on the collected four-dimensional eye-eye diagram, using computer image analysis
           and artificial intelligence technology to extract and classify the eye-eye features of
           the white eye, and statistically analyze the correlation between the eye-eye features
           and the malignant tumor. The relationship between the characteristics of the white eye
           and the corresponding change of malignant tumor.
