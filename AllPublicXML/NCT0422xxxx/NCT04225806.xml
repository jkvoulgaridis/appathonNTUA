  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter pre-market early feasibility study (EFS) to evaluate
      subjects treated with the BlueLeaf System for the treatment of symptomatic CVI of the lower
      extremity
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to provide information on the BlueLeaf System
      for the formation of one or more autogenous vein valves constructed from the vein wall of the
      femoral and/or popliteal vein, in subjects with CVI and who meet the specified eligibility
      criteria. In particular, the safety and technical feasibility of the procedure will be
      validated in patients in the United States, including the procedural steps, operator
      technique, and subject characteristics. The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of
      the study device acutely and through 5 years.

DVT anywhere in the deep venous system of the treatment limb
Occlusive valve pocket thrombus (VPT)
Non-occlusive stenosis in the target vessel (including due to scarring, inflammation, VPT, etc.) leading to persistent worsening of symptoms attributable to venous flow obstruction, or requiring post-procedural surgical or endovascular re-intervention
Device or procedure-related venous or arterial injury in the treated limb (such as Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF's), bleeding, pseudo aneurysm) leading to worsening of symptoms that require post-procedural surgical or endovascular re-intervention or requiring transfusion of more than 2 units of blood. (Note: Peri-procedural stiches placed to assist with closure of the access site will not be characterized as a primary safety failure.)

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  Failed at least 6 months of conservative therapy at some point during the course of
             their CVI management (symptoms not adequately resolved or patient non-compliant/unable
             to tolerate)

          -  Deep system venous reflux characterized by &gt;1 second reflux time in two contiguous
             vein segments (vein segments defined as: proximal femoral, distal femoral, and
             popliteal), as assessed by duplex ultrasound (DUS) with patient in the standing
             position

          -  Presence of at least two potential target sites within a target vessel as assessed
             preliminarily by DUS, with a target site being defined as a segment within the femoral
             or popliteal vein that is:

             7mm to 11mm in luminal diameter and at least 3cm long and absent features that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would preclude formation of a monocuspid valve (at any
             orientation).

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is a good candidate for treatment with the
             BlueLeaf System based on their symptoms, quality of life, anatomy, and the likelihood
             of benefit from continued conservative therapy

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Untreated significant superficial venous incompetence which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may be the primary source of existing symptoms

          -  Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within 1 year of consent

          -  Deep venous intervention (includes stenting) in the target limb or outflow vessels
             within 6 months of consent

          -  Flow-limiting venous outflow obstruction central to the intended target sites, defined
             by a common femoral vein duplex exam found to have a continuous waveform without
             respiratory variation

          -  Contraindications to all protocol specified anticoagulation options

          -  Known and uncontrolled hypercoagulopathy (i.e. hypercoagulopathy that cannot be
             adequately managed/controlled with medication)

          -  Women on long-term oral contraceptives

          -  Non-ambulatory patients

          -  Significant peripheral arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index of &lt; 0.70 or with
             incompressible vessels

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure

          -  Patients with a history of right heart failure occurring as a consequence of, for
             example, biventricular failure, intrinsic pulmonary disease, chronic thromboembolic
             pulmonary hypertension, and other etiologies that result in elevated right-sided
             pressures.

          -  Active systemic infection

          -  Invasive surgical procedure within the last 3 months that in the Investigator's
             opinion would interfere with the study procedure or results

          -  Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine level of ≥ 2mg/dL

          -  Hemoglobin level &lt; 9.0 mg/dL

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000 or &gt; 1,000,000/mm3

          -  Total white blood cell count &lt; 3,000/mm3

          -  Subject is enrolled in another clinical study that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may c

          -  Comorbidity risks or other concerns which, in the opinion of the Investigator, either
             limits longevity or likelihood of complying with the protocol and its prescribed
             follow up (e.g. recent cancer or stroke); or precludes patient from being transitioned
             to open surgery if complication requiring surgical intervention occurs during the
             procedure (such as severe vein laceration).
