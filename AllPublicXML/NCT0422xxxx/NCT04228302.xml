  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study with EC5026, a new drug candidate intended to treat
      neuropathic pain. The purpose of the study is to provide initial safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics data of single ascending oral doses of EC5026 in healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1a single ascending dose
      study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of sequential doses of oral
      EC5026 in healthy male and female subjects. EC5026 is an inhibitor of the soluble Epoxide
      Hydrolase (sEH) enzyme developed as a first-in-class analgesic for the treatment of pain.
      This study will help refine the dosing strategy for subsequent multiple-dose studies in
      healthy subjects and for future clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain.

      sEH is an enzyme that is downstream in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway of the arachidonic
      acid (AA) cascade. The sEH enzyme is responsible of metabolizing a class of epoxy-fatty acids
      known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are potent, naturally occurring analgesics.
      EETs are produced at high concentrations in areas of tissue damage and inflammation, but are
      rapidly metabolized by the sEH enzyme into inactive compounds. Effective inhibition of sEH
      activity prolongs the ability of EETs to exert their analgesic activity.
