      Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (VHR) is usually performed by reducing the contents in the
      hernia sac from the abdominal cavity and then covering the defect from the inside with a
      mesh, i.e. Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM). This means that the hernia sac is left in situ
      anterior to the mesh. This may, however, predispose for the development of fluid in the
      hernia sac, i.e. seroma. The risk of seroma development may be reduced if a the defect is
      closed before the mesh is applied. Closing the defect may, however, cause tension and pain
      from the abdominal wall. Instead of closing the defect, the part of the peritoneum
      constituting the hernia sac may be used for closing the defect. In this case, the peritoneum
      is dissected from the edges of the hernia sac and then used as a flap that is fixated to the
      edges of the hernia sac on the opposite side. In a previous study (BriClo), we compared
      defect closure as control group with peritoneal bridging. That study showed an increased risk
      for postoperative pain if the defect was closed.

      In order to evaluate whether peritoneal bridging reduces the seroma development following
      ventral hernia repair, we are undertaking a double-blind randomized controlled trial
      comparing no closure of the defect with peritoneal bridging. The goal is to randomize 100
      patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.

      Clinical follow-up is performed three months, six months and one year after surgery. At all
      occasions, the patient is requested to fill in the Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire (VHPQ)
      and an investigation is done in order to assess the presence of seromas, recurrences or other
      local complications. Duration until return to work is registered. One year after surgery,
      computer tomography is performed in order to quantify the volume of seromas.

      Background Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (VHR) has become a well-established technique
      during the last decade. The repair is usually performed by reducing the contents in the
      hernia sac from the abdominal cavity and then covering the defect from the inside with a
      mesh, i.e. Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM). This means that the hernia sac is left in situ
      anterior to the mesh. This may, however, predispose for the development of fluid in the
      hernia sac, i.e. seroma. Even if the mesh prevents the intestines from protruding into the
      hernia sac, the patient may still be troubled by discomfort from the seroma that develops in
      the cavity of the previous hernia sac.

      The risk of seroma development may be reduced if a the defect is closed before the mesh is
      applied (IPOM-Plus). Closing the defect may, however, cause tension and pain from the
      abdominal wall. Instead of closing the defect, the part of the peritoneum constituting the
      hernia sac may be used for closing the defect. In this case, the peritoneum is dissected from
      the edges of the hernia sac and then used as a flap that is fixated to the edges of the
      hernia sac on the opposite side. This reduces the size of the pseudosac and the peritoneal
      surface, which prevents transudation to the pseudosac.

      In a previous study, we have compared closure of the hernia defect with peritoneal bridging.
      We found that closure of the defect increased the postoperative pain. In order to assess
      whether the potential benefit from preitoneal bridging in terms of reduced risk for seromas
      is present if the defect is not closed, we are undertaking a randomised controlled trial
      comparing bridging with IPOM without defect closure.

      In order to evaluate whether peritoneal bridging reduces the seroma development following
      ventral hernia repair, we are undertaking a randomized controlled trial. Our goal is to
      include 50 patients in the study.

      Method After obtaining written and oral consent from the patient, the randomisation is
      performed through a sealed envelope system. The patient is blinded to the allocation. Prior
      to the procedure, the patient is also requested to fill in the Ventral Hernia Pain
      Questionnaire (VHPQ).

      The procedure is started according to the usual routines. Adhesions covering the defect are
      dissected to visualize the defect. If the patients is randomized to defect closure, it is
      sutured with continuous PDS 2-0. In case the patient is allocated to peritoneal bridging, the
      peritoneum is dissected beginning 2-3 cm from the edge of the defect. The sac is dissected
      all the way to the opposite edge of the defect. The peritoneal flap is pulled to the opposite
      side and fixated with Optifix. If the patient is randomized to surgery without bridging, the
      defect is left without closure.

      The mesh is attached in the same, irrespective of randomization. Optifix with double-crown
      technique is used in both groups. Operation time and intraoperative complications are
      registered when the procedure is completed. From the day of the procedure until two days
      postoperatively, pain from the area of surgery is registered daily on a VAS-scale. Time to
      return to normal daily activities is registered.

      The patient is invited to clinical follow-up three months, six months and one year after
      surgery. At all occasions the patient is requested to fill in VHPQ. One year after surgery, a
      computer tomography while straining to detect protrusion of the abdominal contents in the
      defect. Any protrusion seen at the computer tomography is graded according to a previously
      validated classification. The presence of seromas detected at the computer tomography is
      described according to Morales-Conde, The computer tomography images are assessed by two
      radiologists in order to reach consensus. The presence of seroma anterior to the defect is
      evaluated in terms of size (maximal diameter), localization, shape (round, oval, triangular),
      mean density (Hounsfield unit, HU) and the volume through three-dimensional reconstructions.
