      guided by a TT expert. Children are included based on signs of readiness for TT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) was established in daycare centers. Clusters of
      participants (per daycare center) were randomly allocated to an Intervention group or a
      Control group.

      Evolution of the TT process was monitored in the daycare center until the child was
      considered to be fully toilet trained (or 'clean') during the day (this means wearing
      undergarments, conscious of the need to void and initiating toilet behavior without reminder
      of the parents with a maximum of one leakage a day [9]).

      Daycare workers evaluated the TT process of all participating children on a weekly basis.
      Parents were asked to fill in an online questionnaire when their child was completely toilet
      trained.

    <description>During the training, children wore underpants, were informed about potty training, were encouraged to drink often and were asked regularly if they felt the need to void. Tutors looked for elimination signals in the child and quickly responded by putting the child on the potty when he/she expressed the need to void or to defecate. Children were positively rewarded. Parents received a leaflet containing practical tips concerning TT and their child's successes of the past two days. They were asked to continue TT at home during the following weekend and longer if necessary. Daycare workers were asked to pay more attention on the TT during the following days and weeks to ensure the effect of the intervention.</description>
