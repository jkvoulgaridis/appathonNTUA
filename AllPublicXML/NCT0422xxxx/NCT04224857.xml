      A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled first in human study in approximately 36 male
      healthy subjects and approximately 20 male and female patients with active UC who have had an
      inadequate response to or demonstrated intolerance to 5-ASA.

      Subjects may but are not required to have been exposed to corticosteroids, or
      immunosuppressive agents. In case the subject has been exposed to any of these treatments,
      he/she must have had either an inadequate response, failed response or demonstrated
      intolerance.

      Patients may be

        1. naïve to anti-TNFα therapy or

        2. have failed or demonstrated intolerance to anti-TNF-α therapy.
