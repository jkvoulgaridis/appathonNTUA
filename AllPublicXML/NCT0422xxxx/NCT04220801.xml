  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ZM-H1505R is an investigational drug developed by Shanghai Zhimeng Biopharma Inc. for the
      treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B.

      The purpose of this study is to see how safe the study drug is and how well it is tolerated
      after dosing. The study will also test how the study drug is taken up and eliminated by the
      body. An additional part of the study is to look at how this could be changed by giving the
      study drug with food.
