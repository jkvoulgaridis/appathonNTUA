    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see how well the experimental drug
      camrelizumab(SHR-1210) works in people with oligometastatic NPC who have already had locally
      radiotherapy for their disease. All patients will receive 200 mg of camrelizumab
      intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Patients will receive the study drug for up to
      18 cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed non-keratinizing (according to World Health
             Organization (WHO) histologically type).

          -  Patients with oligometastatic NPC (defined as ≤5 metastases, ≤2 organs), without local
             recurrence of nasopharynx.

          -  Completion of radiotherapy 4-12 weeks prior to enrollment. At list one cycle of
             adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.

          -  Satisfactory performance status: Karnofsky scale (KPS) &gt; 70.

          -  Adequate marrow: leucocyte count ≥4000/μL, hemoglobin ≥90g/L and platelet count
             ≥100000/μL.

          -  Normal liver function test: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)、Aspartate Aminotransferase
             (AST) &lt;1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) concomitant with alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
             ≤2.5×ULN, and bilirubin ≤ULN.

          -  Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min.

          -  Expected lifetime over 3 months

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous history of autoimmune disease or unstable autoimmune disease.

          -  Prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in
             situ cervical cancer.

          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-Cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other
             antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways).

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a
             documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy are an exception to this rule. Subjects that require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections are not excluded from
             the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's
             syndrome are not excluded from the study.

          -  Any severe intercurrent disease, which may bring unacceptable risk or affect the
             compliance of the trial, for example, unstable cardiac disease requiring treatment,
             renal disease, chronic hepatitis, diabetes with poor control (fasting plasma glucose
             &gt;1.5×ULN), and emotional disturbance.
