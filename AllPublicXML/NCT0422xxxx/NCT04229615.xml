  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Fluzoparib alone or with Apatinib versus Placebo, as maintenance treatment, in
      patients with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Patients must have completed first-line
      platinum based regimen with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). The study
      contains a Safety Lead-in Phase in which the safety and tolerability of Fluzoparib+Apatinib
      will be assessed prior to the Phase 3 portion of the study.
