      The objective of this clinical research study is to assess plaque and gingivitis reductions
      of Connected Toothbrush compared to Non-Connected Toothbrush over a six-week clinical study.

    <textblock>
      A phase II randomized, single-center, two-cell, examiner-blind and parallel-group clinical
      study conducted in the Loma Linda, California area, to investigate the clinical efficacy of a
      connected power toothbrush as compared to a non-connected power toothbrush in reducing dental
      plaque and gingivitis as measured by the Rustogi Modification of the Navy Plaque Index and
      Löe and Silness Gingival Index over a 6-week period.
