      This research study is assessing the effect of an exercise program on cancer survivors.

      The exercise program is Haymakers for Hope 16-week exercise program

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, it is the first time investigators are examining the effect of this
      exercise program on cancer survivors physical and emotional functioning. The exercise
      programs is based on the conditioning program used by boxers.- Haymakers for Hope 16-week
      exercise program

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits.

        -  Participants will attend the 16-week program of boxing conditioning. It is expected that
           about 10 people will take part in this research study.

             -  This 16 week will include supervised exercises designed to improve strength,
                flexibility, balance and cardiopulmonary fitness.

             -  There will be 4 sessions of 1 hour each week for each of the 10 participants.

             -  The program will be conducted at gymnasiums contracted with the H4H program and
                outcomes assessments at Massachusetts General Hospital and the gymnasiums..
