      The proposed virtual training prototype will provide Making Proud Choices (MPC) facilitator
      trainees the opportunity to make decisions, build facilitator skills, practice core concepts
      and enhance self-efficacy with a virtual audience programmed to display a range of behaviors
      and emotions, simulating a true-to-life experience with immediate feedback. Seventy-two
      adults who have experience working with adolescents but not with MPC, STI, or pregnancy
      prevention education will receive MPC training. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either: 1) virtual training in the MPC module on condom use n=36), or 2) dfusion/ETR's
      traditional in-person training in the same module (n=36). Using mixed methods (survey, focus
      groups, observations), the project will evaluate the virtual training's impact on
      STI/pregnancy prevention knowledge, teaching efficacy, and teaching skills and its usability,
      feasibility, and acceptability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dfusion, in partnership with the RAND Corporation, Allen Interactions and Dr. Loretta Jemmott
      (MPC developer), proposes to develop an online avatar-based virtual training that can make
      MPC training more accessible while still being as effective as in-person. In this Phase I
      STTR, we will develop and test a prototype of the online, avatar-based virtual training for
      activities of MPC and test it with 72 adults who have experience working with adolescents
      (but not with MPC or any HIV/STI/teen pregnancy risk-reduction program). At random, 36 will
      receive traditional in-person MPC training, and 36 will receive avatar-based MPC training.
      The avatar group (n=36) will be compared to the in-person group (n=36) on their STI/pregnancy
      prevention knowledge, teaching efficacy, and teaching skills.

      The scientific premise is that avatar-based virtual training will prepare educators to
      implement the popular evidence-based MPC as effectively as traditional (and expensive)
      face-to-face trainings. The specific aims are:

        -  Aim 1: Develop a prototype for a novel, online avatar-based virtual training for select
           components of the evidence-based STI/pregnancy risk reduction program Making Proud
           Choices.

        -  Aim 2: Using mixed methods (survey, focus groups, observations), evaluate the
           avatar-based training's preliminary impact on facilitator STI/pregnancy prevention
           knowledge, teaching efficacy, and teaching skills compared to in-person training, as
           well as its usability and acceptability.

      By developing novel tools/platforms to improve the dissemination and implementation of
      evidence-based behavioral interventions to prevent STIs/teen pregnancy, this application is
      in line with the priorities of the NICHD Population Dynamics Branch, which supports
      reproductive health research on STIs and family planning. If successful, not only will
      dfusion proceed to Phase II, but the findings could inform other nascent efforts to develop
      avatar facilitator trainings that could make a range of evidence-based programs more
      accessible to community-based organizations.

    <description>Participants teach an activity that is video recorded and coded for fidelity to the Making Proud Choices curriculum. Participants are scored on completion of curriculum tasks, ability to answer sensitive questions, ability to foster a safe and inclusive environment, and engagement of students. Each of the nine sub-activities from the Making Proud Choices module were rated independently by two coders as 2=done correctly, 1=done partially correct, or 0=not done correctly.</description>

    <description>Participants in the e-based virtual training (up to 8 participants per session) will be placed at one of eight computers (with headphones), which we estimate will take less time (about 40 minutes), due to the individualized learning and 1:1 nature of the training instead of 1:15. Participants will complete the condom-line up facilitator training module that corresponds to the Making Proud Choices curriculum.</description>
