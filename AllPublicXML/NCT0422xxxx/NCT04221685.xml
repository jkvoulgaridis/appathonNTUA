      Articaine is used for pain control Like other local anesthetic drugs, articaine causes a
      temporary and completely reversible state of anesthesia (loss of sensation) during (dental)
      procedures.This local anesthesia was first synthesized by Rusching in 1969, and carried to
      the market in Germany by Hoechst AG, a life-sciences German company, under the brand name
      Ultracain ,it entered clinical practice in Germany in 1976. The name was changed in 1984, the
      year it was released in Canada. It then entered the United Kingdom in 1998, the United States
      in 2000 and Australia in 2005. At this time, articaine is available as a 4% solution
      containing 1:100, 000 or 1:200, 000 adrenaline. Articaine has been widely used in dental
      surgery.It started to use carticaine around 1977.In dentistry has been investigated widely.
      Articaine is a unique amide LA in that it contains a thiophene, instead of a benzene ring.The
      thiophene ring allows greater lipid solubility and effectiveness as a greater portion of an
      administered dose can enter neurons
