  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the paired 2-dose vaccine regimens from 3
      consecutively manufactured lots of Adenovirus serotype 26 encoding the Ebola virus Mayinga
      glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) as Dose 1 and 3 consecutively manufactured lots of Modified
      Vaccinia Ankara Bavarian Nordic vector encoding multiple filovirus proteins (MVA-BN-Filo)
      including the ebola virus mayinga glycoprotein as Dose 2, administered at a 56-day interval,
      induce an equivalent humoral immune response.
