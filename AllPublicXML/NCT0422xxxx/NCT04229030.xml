  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-eight (38) subjects will be included in the study. Subjects will be randomized in a
      ration of 1:1 to be treated with RZL-012 or placebo. Subjects will be injected with a
      different doses of RZL-012 according to their lipomas sizes. The total of 38 subjects will be
      enrolled in 3 clinical sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial in DD
      subjects having lipomas. Subjects will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, into two groups
      injected with either RZL-012 or vehicle.

      Once the study ends and codes are opened, 84 days after dosing, placebo-treated subjects will
      be offered the option of receiving treatment with RZL-012 and followed up for an additional
      84 days.

      At least 4 lipomas/nodules, preferably 6, and no more than 8, will be injected per subject,
      two of which will be medium (4-5.9 cm), large (6-7.9 cm) or extra-large (8-10 cm) in
      diameter. Dosing will be according to lipoma size, where the total injected dose will not
      exceed 240 mg per patient (48 injections at 5mg/injection).

             nominee) considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  Known sensitivity to components of the injection formulation.

          -  Prior wound, tattoo or infection in the treated area.

          -  Subjects treated chronically at least 3 months prior to study entry with systemic
             steroids or immunosuppressive drugs.
