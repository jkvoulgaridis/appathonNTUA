  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often have walking impairment due to
      insufficient oxygen supply to skeletal muscle. The investigator's pilot study in PAD patients
      has shown that endothelial function and walking distance improve with regular static muscle
      stretching. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether prescriptive muscle
      stretching improves muscle oxygenation and walking ability in PAD patients. This is a
      single-blinded study in 40 patients with stable symptomatic PAD. Patients assigned to the
      stretch group will use ankle splints (both legs) to perform static muscle stretching for 4
      weeks (ankle dorsiflexion applied 30 min/d, 5 days/wk). Patients assigned to the control
      group will also wear the ankle splints daily but without invoking any dorsiflexion, i.e.,
      without stretching. Measurements will consist of ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest and
      post-exercise, skeletal muscle oxygenation (evaluated with near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS)), and 6 minute walk test (6MWT), performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of stretching
      (or control splint placement). In addition, NIRS will be used to evaluate muscle oxygenation
      while patients are wearing the splint device in order to quantitatively prescribe the angle
      of dorsiflexion that provides optimum stretch and deoxygenation of the calf muscles without
      causing pain. Primary outcomes include increased muscle oxygenation during exercise and
      walking distance after 4 weeks of static muscle stretching. Results from this study will be
      used to support funding applications for a larger efficacy trial.

    <description>Subjects assigned to this group will be instructed on how to wear the device to produce the appropriate amount of dorsiflexion (stretch). Splint devices will be worn at the assigned angle 5 days/week, 30 minutes/day, for 4 weeks. ABI, muscle oxygenation, and walking distance will be assessed pre/post stretching. Other health surveys will be administered.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to this group will wear the splints but instructed to wear the device in a position that produces no stretch. Splint devices will be worn at the assigned angle 5 days/week, 30 minutes/day, for 4 weeks. ABI, muscle oxygenation, and walking distance will be assessed pre/post stretching.
