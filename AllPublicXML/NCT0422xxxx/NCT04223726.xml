      CADKID-study is a prospective follow-up study assessing arterial disease, quality of life,
      mortality and their predictors in patients with severe chronic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and
      mortality as well as impaired quality of life. Participants of this study all have severe
      CKD, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2. Stress
      ergometry, echocardiography, ultrasound assessment of arterial intima-media thickness,
      lateral lumbar radiograph, ECG, laboratory tests and quality of life assessment were
      performed at the baseline of the study and will be repeated during follow-up. Atrial
      fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias as well as pulse wave velocity measurements will
      be explored. Diet diaries are gathered and analysed. The aim of the study is to identify
      factors associated with cardiovascular disease, quality of life and mortality in this cohort.
