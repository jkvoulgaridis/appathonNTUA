  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are common and prevalent conditions that are frequently under treated.
      In an attempt to increase timely and accessible psychological treatment, Internet-delivered
      Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) has emerged. ICBT involves delivering therapeutic content
      to manage depression and or anxiety via structured online lessons. This is often combined
      with brief therapist guidance, for example once per week for 8 weeks via secure messaging or
      phone calls. Although outcomes of ICBT are very impressive, there is room for improvement in
      terms of completion rates and outcomes. Feedback from patients suggest that some patients
      would prefer longer term support or follow-up care.

      In this two-factorial randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to contribute to the
      literature by examining whether the efficacy of ICBT is improved by offering an extended
      period of support to clients (from 8 weeks to 12 weeks) and being offered a booster session
      at 16 weeks after treatment enrollment (yes vs no). Follow-up assessments will be conducted
      at 8, 16 and 26 weeks after treatment enrollment. Primary outcomes are reduced anxiety and
      depression. Secondary outcomes include reduced panic, social anxiety, trauma, quality of
      life, disability, work productivity, and healthcare use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past research of ICBT offered in routine care has found that patients and therapists often
      recommend &quot;personalizing&quot; the delivery of ICBT, for example, by increasing the length of time
      therapist support is available or offering booster sessions after treatment has ended. To
      date, in terms of ICBT, there has been limited research on the impact of extending support
      after treatment materials have been delivered or offering a booster session.

      In this trial, the investigators will examine if the efficacy of ICBT is improved by offering
      an extended period of support to clients (from 8 weeks to 12 weeks) or by being offered a
      booster session at 16 weeks after treatment enrollment (yes vs no). Follow-up assessments
      will be conducted at 8, 16 and 26 weeks after treatment enrollment. Primary outcomes are
      reduced anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include reduced panic, social anxiety,
      trauma, quality of life, disability, work productivity, and healthcare use. The impact of
      these factors on intervention usage (e.g., completion rates, log-ins, emails sent) and
      treatment satisfaction will also be examined.

    <description>Clients in the Extended Contact condition will be asked at the 6 week mark if they like they can extend their treatment and receive up to 12 weeks of support. They will be informed that this may be helpful if they feel they have fallen behind in reviewing of the materials, if they would like to receive support while they work on supplementary resources or if they would like extended support while they work on core lessons. If they would like additional support, participants will answer questions presented on the website about their desire for this additional support what they would like to focus on during this time. Those clients who indicate that they would like this extended support will automatically have their therapists check-in with them for up to 12 weeks. Those that do not request the additional support will end treatment as planned at the end of 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Clients in the Extended Contact condition will receive an email at the 6 week mark letting them know that they if they like they can extend their treatment and receive up to 12 weeks of support. At week 6, clients will answer questions on the website about whether they would like this additional support or not and what they would like to focus on during this time. Clients who indicate they would like this extended support will automatically have their therapists check-in with them for up to 12 weeks.
They will also be told that at 16 weeks they will have access to a booster session (online materials that go over core skills such as thought challenging, deep breathing, behavioural activation, and graded exposure). At 16 weeks, they will be sent an email reminder to log in for the booster course. The therapist will send a supportive email to the client offering to assist with any challenges the client reports in the check-in questionnaire by email or phone call over the next 2 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>All clients will receive the Wellbeing Course developed at Macquarie University, Australia. The Wellbeing Course is a transdiagnostic Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour intervention targeting symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorders. It comprises 5 online lessons targeting: 1) symptom identification and the cognitive behavioural model; 2) thought monitoring and challenging; 3) de-arousal strategies and pleasant activity scheduling; 4) graduated exposure; and 5) relapse prevention. Materials are presented in a didactic (i.e., text-based with visual images) and case-enhanced learning format (i.e., educational stories demonstrate the application of skills) and include homework activities. Lessons are released gradually in a standardized order over 8 weeks. Phone calls will only be made if there is a significant clinical issue requiring therapist attention that cannot be addressed over email (e.g., sudden increase in symptoms). Therapists will spend ~15 mins. per week/per client.</description>
