    <textblock>
      This observational prospective clinical study is to develop software tools to fuse coronary
      anatomy data obtained from CT coronary angiography with dynamic PET data to noninvasively
      measure absolute myocardial blood flow, flow reserve and relative flow reserve across
      specific coronary lesions. Results will be compared to those obtained invasively in the
      catheterization laboratory.

      measure absolute myocardial blood flow, flow reserve and relative flow reserve across
      specific coronary lesions. These results will be compared to those obtained invasively in the
      catheterization laboratory. The long-term objective of the study is to improve the care of
      cardiac patients by developing, validating and implementing clinically computer-based methods
      to noninvasively determine the physiological significance of specific coronary lesions using
      methods to fuse and quantify multi-modality cardiac imagery.

    <arm_group_label>CAD detection/risk assessment</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients with angina referred for the assessment of CAD will undergo imaging studies to develop tools to fuse coronary anatomic data obtained from CCTA with dPET data to non-invasively measure absolute MBF, MFR and RFR along vessels centerlines and across coronary lesions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Invasive Cardiac Catheterization (ICA)</intervention_name>
    <description>Invasive functional measurements will be performed to assess the functional significance of specific lesions by means of FFR and CFR, and to test the presence of microvascular disease by means of IMR in all vessels for which the procedures are feasible. In summary, a 5- to 7-F guide catheter without side holes is used to engage the coronary artery and a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guidewire introduced. The pressure sensor is positioned at the distal segment of a target vessel, and intracoronary nitroglycerine (100-200 mg) administered before each measurement. The best systolic and diastolic phase (located between 30-50%, and 60-75% of the cardiac cycle) will be selected for successive processing as it allows a relative motion free visualization of the main vessels and the myocardium.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiogram (CCTA)</intervention_name>
    <description>Fasting patients will undergo a test for coronary calcium by CT; calcium scoring analysis will be done post image data acquisition using the manufacturer's software. Nitroglycerine will be administered in all patients (sublingual administration prior to CCTA initiation). CT acquisitions will be prospectively ECG-gated (30-80% of the cardiac cycle). The acquisition begins with a scout scan to identify the borders of the heart to minimize the field of view and exposure to the patient. A bolus of 60 mL nonionic contrast agent is then injected followed by 60 mL of saline at a rate of 4 mL/s to enhance signal from coronary arteries and blood chambers. In case of irregular heart rate, beta-blockers can be provided to keep optimal heart rate ~65-70 bpm. Trans-axial images are reconstructed by means of a filtered back-projection algorithm.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Dynamic Cardiac Positron Emission Tomography (dPET)</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be asked to fast for 24 hours prior to the test. Before the resting perfusion phase, a single low-dose CT-based transmission scan is acquired for attenuation correction (AC) of all subsequent acquisitions. AC-CT images are automatically registered to the perfusion images, visually verified and manually corrected if necessary. Resting perfusion imaging started with the intravenous injection of a single bolus of 82Rb. Pharmacological stress imaging is obtained after adenosine infusion (140 μg/kg/min) through a peripheral vein, followed by a second dose of 82Rb. Image reconstruction is achieved by means of ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) iterative method. The hemodynamic responses to rest/stress tests are collected in terms of mean heart rate, mean blood systolic pressures and diastolic at rest and stress. Dynamic, gated and ungated trans-axial reconstructions are saved in DICOM format for further analysis and processing.</description>

        Patients with angina referred to an initial imaging test for the assessment of CAD will be
        screened and considered for inclusion in the study. Different hospital policies and
        guidelines determine which initial test is commonly requested: at Emory University Hospital
        patients who underwent a dPET will be considered for enrollment; at the South Korean
        centers patients who received a CTA will be screened. Depending on test results, patients
        who are referred to undergo a cardiac catheterization, will be invited to participate in
        the study.

          -  Systolic blood pressure of &lt; 90 mmHg

          -  Heart failure with NYHA class III-IV at the time of the CCTA procedure. If it is
             deemed that, the heart failure has been resolved or the patient was incorrectly
             labeled as having heart failure the radiology physician in charge will verify the
             absence of Heart Failure at the time of CCTA and perform the procedure.

          -  Recent myocardial infarction

          -  If the patient has been diagnosed with unstable angina within 24 hours prior to CCTA,
             the patient will not be consented. If the patient does not have the diagnosis of
             unstable angina and is consented, the radiology physician in charge will verify the
             absence of unstable angina at the time of CCTA.

          -  Patients enrolled and consented for the invasive measurements that at the time of
             catheterization exhibit severe vessel disease and/or obstructions that prevent the
             operator from safely conducting the measurements will be removed from the study;
             further research imaging sessions - if planned - will be canceled and patients
             indicated as &quot;screen failure&quot; in our enrollment log.
