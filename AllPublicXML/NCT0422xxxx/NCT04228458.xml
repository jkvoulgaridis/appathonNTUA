  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood arthritis is a diagnosis made by clinicians based upon their clinical examination,
      during which patients are assessed for signs of swelling, warmth and restricted movement of
      the joints using the sensation of touch. Clinicians use investigations such as blood tests
      and scans which may be costly, associated with waiting times, can cause the patient stress or
      anxiety. Patients with childhood arthritis can often present with flares of their condition
      even when on medical treatment, which may require further investigations to determine the
      nature of the problem. Studies in adult Rheumatology have demonstrated that a thermal imaging
      camera (which detects heat given off by the body) can be useful in assessing for signs of
      inflammation in arthritis. The use of this camera could provide an alternative to the tests
      describedÍ¾ it does not require any contact with the patient, is quick and easy to use, and
      does not emit any radiation. The investigators hope that this pilot study will demonstrate
      that thermal imaging can be used to complement the standardised assessments of joint
      inflammation as done routinely in clinic and may lead to further work comparing thermal
      imaging with other tests such as MRI scanning and ultra-sound.

      The investigators will recruit 20-50 children with arthritis affecting either knee or ankle
      joints. The investigators will use a highly sensitive thermal imaging camera to take pictures
      and short video recordings of each ankle and knee joint, recording skin temperature and
      colour. The investigators will compare this with the clinicians' assessment of whether the
      knee and ankle joints are inflamed or not. The investigators are interested in finding out
      whether the information recorded using the camera mirrors the assessment made by the
      clinician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Diagnosis of:

          -  Poly-articular JIA

          -  Oligo-articular JIA

          -  Psoriatic JIA

          -  Enthesitis-related JIA

        Exclusion Criteria:

        CYP below 4 years of age (pGALS is validated for school-age children and patients will be
        required to remain still during TI process)

        Ongoing active/chronic infection requiring hospitalisation or treatment with intravenous
        antibiotics within 30 days of recruitment, or oral antibiotics within 14 days of
        recruitment

        History of active tuberculosis of less than 6 months treatment or untreated latent
        tuberculosis

        Soft tissue infection, injury or fracture of the affected joint which could confound the TI
        signature

        Presence of any inflammatory skin condition (including, but not limited to Eczema and
        Psoriasis) which may be in close proximity to or overlying the joint

        Presence of any other diagnosis which could cause arthritis including systemic-JIA
        (associated systemic inflammation may affect skin temperature independently of arthritis)
        or undifferentiated-JIA (excluded to ensure homogeneity of the sample investigated)

        Non-English speaking patients and/or parent(s)/guardian(s)

        Non-consenting CYP, or parent(s)/guardian(s)
