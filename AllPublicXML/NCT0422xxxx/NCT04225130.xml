  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate
      the efficacy of the WET-S + treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU among high-risk,
      suicidal service members with PTSD or posttraumatic stress (PTS) admitted to the Carl R.
      Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) acute inpatient psychiatry unit at Fort Hood, Texas.
      Suicide risk and PTS symptom severity are the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include
      subsequent hospitalizations for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and suicide attempts.
      Investigators will conduct a needs assessment with stakeholders during the RCT to develop a
      tool kit for WET implementation in other DoD inpatient psychiatry units.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare a new formulation of WET referred to as WET-for suicide (WET-S)
      that includes crisis response planning + treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU among
      high-risk, suicidal service members with PTS admitted to the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical
      Center (CRDAMC) acute inpatient psychiatry unit at Fort Hood, Texas.

      Aim 1: Determine if WET-S reduces the presence, frequency, and severity of suicidal ideation,
      suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, and
      rehospitalization for suicidality.

      Aim 2: Determine if WET-S + TAU reduces PTS symptom severity among service members admitted
      to an acute psychiatric inpatient unit for SI and/or attempt compared with TAU.

      Aim 3: Determine if reductions in PTS symptoms mediate the association between treatment
      condition and suicide-related outcomes (suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts,
      non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, and rehospitalizations).

      Aim 4: Develop a tool kit for WET-S implementation through a needs assessment with key
      stakeholders and evaluation of contextual factors among DoD inpatient facilities to determine
      readiness for successful implementation of WET-S.

      Study investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy
      of the WET-S + treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU among high-risk, suicidal service
      members with PTSD or posttraumatic stress (PTS) admitted to the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical
      Center (CRDAMC) acute inpatient psychiatry unit at Fort Hood, Texas. Investigators will
      conduct a needs assessment with stakeholders during the RCT to develop a tool kit for WET
      implementation in other DoD inpatient psychiatry units.

      Data will be collected in Texas. Investigators conservatively anticipate enrollment of
      approximately 140 service members to achieve a final sample size of 124 (n = 62 per
      condition) after accounting for 15% attrition. CRDAMC receives approximately 4500 admissions
      each year for SI/attempt. TAU on the inpatient unit consists of crisis management and
      stabilization. Suicide risk and PTS symptom severity are the primary outcomes. Secondary
      outcomes include subsequent hospitalizations for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and suicide
      attempts.

    <description>The CAPS-5 is a structured diagnostic interview and gold standard for assessing PTSD. It provides a dichotomous PTSD diagnosis and overall symptom severity score. Scores range from 0 to 80, with greater scores signifying more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SITBI is a structured interview that assesses the presence (lifetime, past year, past month), frequency, severity, and characteristics of five types of SITB: (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide plans, (c) suicide gestures, (d) suicide attempts, and (e) non-suicidal self-injury. The SITBI assesses the frequency of each type of thought or behavior in the respondent's lifetime, past year, and past month, as well as the age of onset of each thought or behavior endorsed. The SITBI also assesses the severity of each thought or behavior endorsed on a scale from 0 (low/little) to 4 (very much/severe) scale, on average and at the worst point at each of those time frames.</description>

    <description>At baseline and each follow-up assessment, study staff will access participants' medical record to obtain information about current and past mental health treatment, current and past psychiatric diagnoses, current and past psychiatric medication, and history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. If applicable, date of admission(s) to inpatient psychiatric unit, chief complaint at the time of admission(s), details of psychiatric stay(s), and length of stay(s) will also be obtained. Changes in any of these variables from baseline to follow-up will be recorded.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Written Exposure Therapy-for Suicide (WET-S) consists of 5 treatment sessions. Each session includes a written exposure exercise. It also includes CRP. Participants assigned to WET-S will complete the CRP prior to beginning their writing in session 1. Patient use of the CRP since the previous session will be briefly reviewed at the start of each WET-S session to manage safety and problem solve fluctuations in risk during treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Written Exposure Therapy -for Suicide</intervention_name>
    <description>The first session will consist of the therapist educating the participant about common reactions to trauma and providing information regarding the rationale of WET-S as a treatment for PTSD. The participant will then be given general instructions for completing the trauma narratives, specific instructions for completing the first session, and will then complete the first (30 minutes) narrative writing session. Participants will be instructed to write about the same trauma experience during each session. The importance of delving into their deepest emotions surrounding the trauma event is emphasized. All WET-S sessions will take place in a private room and begin with the therapist reading the specific writing instructions for that session and then leaving the instructions with the participant while 30-minute writing session is completed.</description>
