      This research will study the effects of a rehabilitation program assisted by a powered lower
      extremity exoskeleton in patients after stroke. It will compare clinical and biomechanical
      features of patients at baseline and after intervention. Additionally, it will also examine
      the use of a brain-computer-interface (BCI) to command movements on the powered lower limb
      exoskeleton. The findings will be used to improve understanding human-robot interaction, to
      improve the design of the robotic devices and to improve rehabilitation services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality, morbidity and disability in adults in
      developed countries. Survivors may suffer several neurological deficits or deficiencies, such
      as hemiparesis, communication disorders, cognitive deficits and visuospatial perception
      disorders. Hemiplegia is a par loss of hemi-body voluntary motricity following a brain
      injury, usually resulting in alterations of the locomotor system with persistent disorders of
      movement and posture. Hemiplegia significantly affects gait performance. Gait recovery is an
      important objective in the rehabilitation program for stroke patients.The currently available
      treatment techniques include classical techniques of gait rehabilitation, functional
      electrical stimulation, electromechanic devices, robotic devices and brain-computer
      interfaces, among others.The evidence suggest that the combination of different
      rehabilitation strategies is more effective than conventional rehabilitation techniques
      alone. Technology-based rehabilitation methods such as robotic devices need more research to
      demonstrate their effects on gait recovery.

      This study will assess the effects of a rehabilitation program with a powered lower extremity
      exoskeleton in people with stroke. Additionally, it will also examine the use of a
      brain-computer-interface (BCI) to command movements on the powered lower limb exoskeleton.
      The findings will be used to improve understanding human-robot interaction, to improve the
      design of the robotic devices and to improve rehabilitation services.
