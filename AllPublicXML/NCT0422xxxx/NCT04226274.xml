             as medication for diabetes

          -  Follow a stable dietary regimen as documented by a 3-day dietary record obtained
             during the screening period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented history of ongoing rhabdomyolysis

          -  Evidence of acute crisis from their underlying disease

          -  Currently following or planning to start a ketogenic diet

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 1 month or within 5 half-lives,

             condition

          -  Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
             in the judgment of the Investigator in discussion with the Medical Monitor, would make
             the subject inappropriate for entry into this study
