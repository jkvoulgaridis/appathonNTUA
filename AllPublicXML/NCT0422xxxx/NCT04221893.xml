  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy works for the treatment of
      gastrointestinal cancer that are spreading to other places in the body (metastatic).
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. This trial
      is being done to determine if giving radiation therapy to patients who are being treated with
      immunotherapy and whose cancers are progressing (getting worse) can slow or stop the growth
      of their cancers. It may also help researchers determine if giving radiation therapy to one
      tumor can stimulate the immune system to attack other tumors in the body that are not
      targeted by the radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether radiation therapy can convert overall response rates from progressive
      disease to stable or responsive disease as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v.) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define overall response rate by immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (iRECIST) criteria.

      II. To determine time to progression. III. To determine overall survival. IV. To determine
      local control in radiated lesion(s). V. To characterize the effect of distant radiation on
      unirradiated target lesions.

      VI. To describe the incidence of new metastatic lesions. VII. To determine treatment safety
      by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5.0.

      VIII. To describe time to new systemic therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define radiation-induced effects on circulating immune cells. II. To describe
      remodeling of the circulating T cell repertoire by deep sequencing of variable, diversity and
      joining (VDJ) regions of T cell receptors (TCRs).

      III. To describe changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy for a total of 5 treatments over 5-9 calendar days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 day, 6 months, and then
      up to 36 months.

               -  If a woman is of child-bearing potential, a negative pregnancy test within 28
                  days prior to study enrollment is required

               -  Systemic corticosteroids used for short-term purposes (e.g. nausea,
                  anti-inflammatory indications for brain/spinal metastases or radiation-induced
