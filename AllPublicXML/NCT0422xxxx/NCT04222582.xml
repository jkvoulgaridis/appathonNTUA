  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with schizophrenia struggle with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). In
      some cases, these AVHs can be resistant to medication treatment. Previous research has found
      that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be helpful in treating symptoms in
      individuals with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression. This study will assess if
      tDCS is effective in treating AVHs in individuals with schizophrenia. tDCS is a non-invasive
      form of brain stimulation which uses a weak current to temporarily excite or inhibit
      underlying cortical regions with small electrodes placed on the scalp. tDCS has been found to
      improve mental processes, including attention and memory function. In addition to examining
      the effect of tDCS on AVHs, this study will assess the effects of tDCS on mood as well as
      brain electrical activity with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. As an additional
      component, participants will be invited to participate in neuroimaging. Using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), brain activity and structure will be examined before and after tDCS.
      tDCS will be administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days for a total of 10 sessions.
      These study findings will contribute to the understanding of the impact of tDCS on AVHs, and
      will also increase knowledge of sound and memory/cognitive processing in individuals with
      schizophrenia.

    <measure>Change in auditory hallucination severity measured by the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 2nd tDCS session on days 1, 3, and 5, and follow-up (within a week of completing tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSYRATS is a multidimensional measure of auditory hallucinations, including 11 items rated on five-point (0-4) scales (total score range 0-44). Symptoms are rated over the last week, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. The dimensions assessed are frequency, duration, location, loudness, beliefs about origin, negative content, intensity of negative content, amount of distress, intensity of distress, disruption of life and control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Voice Power Differential Scale (VPDS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks (baseline to follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Voice Power Differential Scale (VPDS) is a 7-item scale used to measure the perceived power differences between the voice and the voice hearer. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (1-5), with higher scores indicating greater power differential in favour of the voices, with total scores ranging from 7-35.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks (baseline to follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The BAVQ-R is a 35-item questionnaire assessing people's beliefs about auditory hallucinations, and their emotional and behavioural reactions to them. All responses are rated on a 4-point scale: disagree (0); unsure (1); agree slightly (2); agree strongly (3), the measure thus assesses degree of endorsement of items. The scale consists of five subscales: malevolence (score range 0-18), benevolence (0-18), omnipotence (0-18), resistance (0-27), and engagement (0-24).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Voices Acceptance and Action Scale (VAAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks (baseline to follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAAS was developed to assess acceptance-based or action-based beliefs in response to auditory verbal hallucinations, in general and specifically to command hallucinations. This 31-item scale is divided into section A (i.e., 12 item stand-alone scale for general auditory hallucinations) and section B, referring specifically to command hallucinations. The participant is asked to rate their opinion from 1 'Strongly Disagree' to 5 'Strongly Agree', with higher scores meaning higher levels of acceptance and perception of acting according to one's valued life directions. Section A scores can range from 12-60, while section B scores can range from 19-95.</description>
