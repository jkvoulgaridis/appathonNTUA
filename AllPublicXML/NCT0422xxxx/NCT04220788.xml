  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacist services such as medication review, counselling and treatment adherence clinics
      can improve clinical, health related quality of life and economic outcomes. To prove this
      hypothesis a step-wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial will be held in primary care
      centers of the public health system of Malaysia. Participants who have a high risk of
      cardiovascular risk factors currently seeking care in primary care will be recruited. Control
      group will receive usual care and the intervention arm will be seen by a pharmacist prior to
      their follow-up, with a comprehensive medication review, counselling and dietary advice
      consultations every month for three months. Participating pharmacist will be trained in
      cardiovascular prevention pharmacotherapy, interview skills, educational techniques, and
      develop personalized plan for every participant. The investigators plan to randomize up to
      2100 participants who are currently receiving care in the primary care clinics in the
      district of Petaling by modifying the current workflow in primary care, whereby the
      investigators aim to get participants who are at high risk to undergo counselling as well as
      a medication review with proper pharmaceutical care delivered to them prior to seeking their
      medical doctor to receive care.
