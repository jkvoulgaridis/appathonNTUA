  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of lung cancer varies by individual and by ethnic/racial group. In this study the
      investigators will explore how individual differences in the metabolism of a tobacco-specific
      lung carcinogen may contribute to the variable risk of lung cancer between ethnic/racial
      groups.

      In this 10 day clinical trial, Japanese Americans will smoke a cigarette containing
      deuterium-labeled 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific
      lung carcinogen. The study cigarette will be smoked for 7 days.

      This will allow for NNK metabolic profiling and determining the effect of CYP2A6 genotype on
      the level of NNK α-hydroxylation in Japanese Americans smokers using [pyridine- D4]-NNK
      containing cigarettes.

      Eligible subjects will provide a baseline 24 hour urine sample. Study cigarettes spiked with
      labeled NNK will be provided to the subjects to smoke over a 7 day period. During this time,
      24 hour urine samples will be collected over days 5, 6 and 7 on study cigarettes. Blood will
      be drawn on days 6 and 7 on study cigarettes. Samples will be analyzed for NNK metabolism.
