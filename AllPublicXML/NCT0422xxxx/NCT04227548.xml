  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct muscle stimulation (DMS) method is one of the electrodiagnostic methods used in the
      diagnosis of critical illness myopathy (CIM) and critical illness neuropathy (CIN). The ratio
      of amplitude of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) obtained by nerve stimulation (nCMAP)
      to amplitude of CMAP obtained by DMS (dmCMAP) can be used to differentiate these two
      diseases. Although not certain, if the ratio is &lt; 0.5, the diagnosis is thought to be
      consistent with CIN. The ratio &gt; 0.5 is considered to be a finding supporting CIM. The
      investigators aimed to find the reference values of the ratio from healthy individuals. A
      monopolar needle electrode was used for DMS. The dmCMAP and nCMAP were recorded with a
      concentric needle. The ratio was calculated by using amplitudes of dmCMAP and nCMAP obtained
      from deltoid and tibialis anterior muscles.

      Age, gender, height, weight, body mass index and neurological examination findings of the
      participants were recorded. Healthy participants were not included if they had;
      polyneuropathy or a disease such as diabetes mellitus that causes polyneuropathy, complaints
      such as weakness or paresthesia, a neurodegenerative disease, abnormal neurological
      examination, myopathy or hereditary polyneuropathy in family history. In addition, healthy
      participants were excluded if the conventional nerve conduction study and needle
      electromyography (EMG) findings were abnormal. Median, ulnar, posterior tibial, peroneal,
      superficial peroneal, sural nerve conduction studies were performed to all participants.
      Needle EMG and direct muscle stimulation were applied to the deltoid and tibialis anterior
      muscles of the healthy participants.

    <description>The normal limits of the ratio were the primary outcome criteria. This ratio is high in critical illness myopathy or healthy individuals, while low in ciritical illness neuropathy of broken disease occurs. Considering the study of Lefaucheur et al., at least 23 healthy individuals should be included in the study.(Lefaucheur JP, Nordine T, Rodriguez P, Brochard L (2006) Origin of ICU acquired paresis determined by direct muscle stimulation.
