  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic postoperative pain remains a major concern following thoracoscopic surgery.
      Firstly because pain constitutes a serious concern for patients after surgery, and
      secondarily because an ineffective control of pain may lead to postoperative morbidity,
      especially in lung cancer surgery.

      To date, several procedures have been described but the best modality of locoregional
      analgesia for thoracoscopic surgery has not been assessed yet. The main objective of this
      study is to evaluate efficiency of several validated approaches for preoperative locoregional
      analgesia, comparing serratus plain block versus paravertebral block versus serratus plain
      block and paravertebral block for postoperative pain following thoracoscopic surgery.

      To this end, the investigators will conduct an interventional prospective monocentric, double
      blind, compared and randomized study. Previously to thoracoscopic surgery, patients will be
      randomized in one of the three following arms: serratus plain block, paravertebral block or
      serratus plain block and paravertebral block combined.

    <description>Visual analogue scales (VAS) are 10-cm lines anchored at the ends by words that define the bounds of various pain dimensions. The patient is asked to place a vertical mark on the scale to indicate the level of intensity of his or her pain.
Numerical rating scales are similar to analogue scales except that numbers (e.g., 0 to 5) are entered along the scale.
With category scales, the patient is asked to circle the word that best describes his or her condition (e.g., for pain intensity: None, Moderate, Severe, Unbearable).</description>
