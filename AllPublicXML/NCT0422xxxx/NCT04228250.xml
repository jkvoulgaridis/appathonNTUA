    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to assess the tolerability and effectiveness of overlapping
      buprenorphine initiation and full agonist opioid discontinuation among patients on high-dose
      long-term full agonist opioid therapy who have opioid physical dependence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Adjective Rating Scale for Withdrawal score on Day 7 compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of 16 withdrawal symptoms will be recorded on a 9-point scale using the Adjective Rating Scale. Scores on the Scale can range from 16 to 144 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The difference in scores on day 7 relative to baseline will be calculated as day 7 - baseline. Therefore, differences can range from -128 to 128 with negative change scores indicating improvement over baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity on Day 7 compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in self-reported pain intensity using the PEG, calculated as day 7 - baseline. PEG scores range from 0 to 10 with lower scores indicating lower pain intensity. Therefore difference scores can range from -10 to 10, with negative change scores indicating improvement over baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Adjective Rating Scale for Withdrawal score on Day 4 compared to baseline</measure>

    <description>Severity of 16 withdrawal symptoms will be recorded on a 9-point scale using the Adjective Rating Scale. Scores on the Scale can range from 16 to 144 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The difference in scores on day 4 relative to baseline will be calculated as day 4 - baseline. Therefore, differences can range from -128 to 128 with negative change scores indicating improvement over baseline.</description>

    <description>Severity of 16 withdrawal symptoms will be recorded on a 9-point scale using the Adjective Rating Scale. Scores on the Scale can range from 16 to 144 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The difference in scores on day 14 relative to baseline will be calculated as day 14 - baseline.
