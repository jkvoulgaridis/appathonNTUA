      Background &amp; Rational:

      Antibiotics are a major underpinning of modern medicine. The global rise of antimicrobial
      resistant (AMR) organisms is a serious world health problem. With few new antimicrobial drugs
      on the horizon, it is imperative that we develop novel approaches to extend the service life
      of our existing drugs. AMR is a complex problem that is being driven by a wide range of
      factors. More than half of the antibiotics prescribed have no medical benefit, and outpatient
      visits for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a major contributor to this
      problem. Recent studies have shown that nearly half of people treated for UTIs receive the
      wrong frontline drug and in 75% of patients, the duration of therapy is inappropriate.
      Limitations in the current diagnostic technology make it impossible to identify UTI pathogens
      and measure their antibiotic sensitivities during the short out-patient clinical visits that
      are typical for most UTI patients. These circumstances result in the inappropriate use of
      stronger than necessary or inappropriate antimicrobials. The aim of this study is to develop
      and evaluate a system that can detect bacteria in urine and find the best antibiotic in under
      4 hours, thus enabling a rapid diagnosis and use of the most appropriate and cost-effective
      antimicrobial agent for the agent detected.

      Testing done in this study will be performed either on bacterial isolates stored in the
      microbiology laboratory at the Diagnostic and Scientific Center in Calgary, or on up to one
      milliliter of residual urine sample submitted to the diagnostic laboratory with a request for
      urine culture and sensitivity. All urine cultures will be performed and reported in
      accordance with standards laboratory protocols. Research testing will only be done on
      residual sample once patient samples are processed or reported on for clinical purposes.

      During the first phase of the study, metabolic biomarkers for uropathogens will be identified
      using mass spectrometry on sub-cultures of frozen isolates from the diagnostic microbiology
      laboratory. This will include at least 50 isolates each of uropathogens consisting of but not
      limited to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species,
      Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus species, and Candida species. Biomarkers that are
      present in greater than 95% of the isolates will subsequently be using the analysis of 2000
      negative, and 2000 positive urine cultures. Compounds that are subsequently identified as
      high yield will be selected for carbon 13 labeling to service standards.

      In phase II of the study, following the development of a biomarker enrichment device at the
      CMRF, a performance urinalysis of the device will be conducted using residual urine sample
      from 1000 negative and 2000 positive urine specimens as outlined above. The performance of
      the new device will be evaluated relative to standard cultures and urine liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry.

      Following the creation of a sensitive and specific assay, a prospective study will be carried
      out at the diagnostic microbiology laboratory. 3000 sample submitted for urine culture will
      be process in parallel with the new device and standard microbiology procedures. Sensitivity,
      specificity and predictive value for each analyte compared to standard culture will be
      determined in this portion of the study. Cost calculations and performance characteristics
      including turnaround time of the new assay will be compared to that in the standard
      laboratory procedure.

    <description>In phase I of the study testing residual urine samples the aim is to include at least 50 positive samples from each bacterial species known to be commonly associated with urinary tract infections. We selected 2000 positive urines to enable capturing enough of these organisms in the development process.
For phase II of the study, the same number of positive samples in order to include all common species causing urinary tract infection. The number of negative samples included is reduced to 1000.
Phase 3 - approximately one third of all urine sample submitted will be positive for a uropathogen. Sample size of 3000 we expect 1000 these to be culture positive. We expect most uropathogens occurring at a frequency of 5% or more will be included with sufficient numbers in the validation process.</description>

        The majority of urine samples collected in Calgary coming from young healthy females with
        symptoms of cystitis or pyelonephritis. However, residual sample from any patient where a
        urine culture has been ordered could be included in the study if it falls within the time
        during which residual samples are being processed.
