      Summary: Controlled, prospective, randomized and randomized clinical trial of two
      intervention groups (standard care vs. preventive recommendations the Kidney Disease:
      Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI) of patients diagnosed with sepsis and
      abdominal post-surgical septic shock with positive results in the risk determination of acute
      renal injury by NephroCheck® Test that integrates the urinary biomarkers TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7.

      Hypothesis: The implementation of a package of preventive measures proposed by the KDIGO
      guide can reduce the occurrence and severity of acute renal injury in the high-risk abdominal
      post-surgical septic patient detected by urinary biomarkers for early detection.
