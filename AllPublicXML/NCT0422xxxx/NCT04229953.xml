    <textblock>
      The placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) which includes accreta, increta, and percreta represents
      a significant obstetric challenge. PAS complicates as many as 1 per 500 pregnancies and this
      risk is increased with prior cesarean deliveries. Antenatal diagnosis of PAS allows for
      multidisciplinary planning and delivery before the onset of labor and/or vaginal bleeding.
      This approach has reduced maternal morbidity rates, including less blood loss, fewer
      transfusion requirements and, intraoperative urologic injuries as well as improve fetal
      outcome.

      Ultrasound evaluation, with grayscale and color Doppler imaging, is the recommended
      first-line modality for diagnosing PAS. Grayscale ultrasound features suggestive of placenta
      accreta include an inability to visualize the normal retroplacental clear zone, irregularity
      and attenuation of the uterine-bladder interface, retroplacental myometrial thickness,
      presence of intraplacental lacunar spaces, and bridging vessels between the placenta and
      bladder wall when using color Doppler. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to
      predict the depth of placental invasion, but it is expensive and often not immediately
      available.

      Recently, a new imaging technique utilizing three-dimensional (3D)/four-dimensional (4D)
      volume rendering ultrasound (VRU) was proposed as a promising tool for the preoperative
      diagnosis of placenta previa accerta spectrum. By using &quot;crystal vue&quot; and &quot;realistic vue&quot;
      volume rendering mode, it could detect 11 out of 12 cases (91.6%) of PAS which was
      subsequently confirmed during surgery. Accordingly, The aim of this study is to examine the
      diagnostic performance of 3D/four-dimensional (4D) volume rendering ultrasound (VRU) for
      placenta previa accerta spectrum in correlation with the clinical (operative) and
      pathological findings.

    <description>Every patient will be evaluated by grayscale 2D-ultrasound and color Doppler. Then, a Samsung WS 80A Elite US scanner with 3D/4D VRU software will be used to assess the placental invasion by applying the two modes (&quot;crystal vue&quot; and &quot;realistic vue&quot;). The image analysis will be performed after obtaining the volume dataset. Data will be compared with the intraoperative findings and histopathological confirmation if hysterectomy will be done.</description>
