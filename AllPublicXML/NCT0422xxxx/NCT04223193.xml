    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts II and III Combined Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. Part II contains 13 sub-scores for the motor experiences of daily living and Part III, 33 sub-scores based on 18 items, several with right, left or other body distribution scores for the motor examination. Each sub-score is anchored with 5 responses that are linked to the commonly accepted clinical terms: 0=normal, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. The sub-score for each is summed to calculate the total scores. The scale range for Part II+III Total Score is 0-184 (Part II maximum total score 52 + Part III maximum total score132). The higher the score the greater the severity. A negative change from baseline represents an improvement in motor function.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Responders with &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; on Participant Global Impression of Change (PGIC )</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is the participant-reported outcome. The qualitative assessment of meaningful change will be determined by the participant in response to the question, &quot;Compared to your condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your condition changed?&quot; Scores are: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; and 7=very much worse. Percentage of responders with much improved and very much improved on PGIC scale will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts I, II and III Combined Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MDS-UPDRS is a multidimensional scale that assesses the motor and non-motor impacts of PD across 4 parts. Part I, non-motor aspects of experiences of daily living, comprises 13 items, 6 of which are rated by the physician (Part IA) and 7 of which are rated by the participant (Part IB). Part II, motor aspects of experiences of daily living, comprises 13 items that are rated by the participant. Part III, motor examination, comprises 18 items that are assessed by the investigator (resulting in 33 scores by location and lateralization). Part IV, motor complications, comprises 6 item (3 items for dyskinesia and 3 items for fluctuation) and requires the physician to use historical and objective information to assess dyskinesia and motor fluctuations. Each item of all the parts will be rated on a scale from 0 to 4 on which 0 = normal, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. Change from baseline in MDS-UPDRS parts I, II and III combined score will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S scale is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of the assessment relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. Raters select one response based on the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how ill is the participant at this time?&quot; Scores are: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=among the most extremely ill participants. Change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to the baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. Raters select one response based on the following question, &quot;Compared to your patient's condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your patient changed?&quot; Scores are: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; and 7=very much worse. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ESS is a scale that is intended to measure daytime sleepiness. It assesses the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in the following common situations: sitting and reading, sitting inactive in a public place as a passenger in a car for an hour or more without stopping for a break, lying down to rest when circumstances permit, sitting and talking to someone, sitting quietly after a meal without alcohol, and in a car while stopped for a few minutes in traffic or at a light. Each situation is rated as 0=would never nod off, 1=slight chance of nodding off, 2=moderate chance of nodding off, or 3=high chance of nodding off. A score greater than or equal to (&gt; =) 10 indicates that the patient may need to get more sleep, improve sleep practices, or seek medical attention to determine why he or she is sleepy.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QUIP-RS is a global screening instrument that assesses impulse control disorders (ICDs) and related disorders (punding, hobbyism, and dopamine dysregulation syndrome) in participants with PD. The QUIP-RS has 4 primary questions that pertain to commonly reported thoughts, urges/desires, and behaviors associated with ICDs, each of which is applied to 4 ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, eating, sexual behavior) and 3 related disorders (medication use, punding, and hobbyism). The QUIP-RS uses a 5-point Likert scale (score 0-4 [0 means &quot;never&quot; and 4 means &quot;very often&quot;] for each question) to gauge the frequency of behaviors. Scores for each ICD and related disorder range from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating greater severity (frequency) of symptoms. The total QUIP-RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.</description>

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 31 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical trial participant, temporally associated with the use of trial intervention, whether or not considered related to the trial intervention. Any AE occurring following the start of treatment or occurring before treatment but increasing in severity afterward were counted as treatment-emergent AE (TEAE). Clinically significant abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Evaluations, Vital Signs, Physical and Neurological evaluations and ECGs will be reported as TEAEs.</description>
