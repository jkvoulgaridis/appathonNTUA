      The aim of the trial is to study the efficacy and safety of Cetuximab re-challenge for
      Chinese Patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After first-line treatment of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI/FOLFOXIRI plus Cetuximab failure and defined as
      RAS/BRAF wild-type by molecular detection of cycle tumor DNA, the patients will be treated
      with Cetuximab and Irinotecan as a second-line or third-line treatment.
