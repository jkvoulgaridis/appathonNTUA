      The aim of this clinical trial is to check the effects of dry needling in the Flexor
      digitorum Brevis .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fiveteen healthy subjects wil be recruited for a quasi-experimental study. Participants will
      be from 18 to 40 years old, not obese. Participants will be measured before and after
      bilateral dry neddling in Flexor digitorum Brevis. The investigators will measure
      stabilometry variables and static footprint. The footprint variables will be divided in
      bilateral rear foot, bilateral midfoot, bilateral fore foot.

      Measures. Stabilometry will be measured by displacement of the center of pressures in X and Y
      with eyes open and closed , center of pressure (COP) with eyes open and closed, COP area with
      eyes open and closed, COP antero-posterior (a-p) and medio-lateral (m-lat) directions with
      eyes open and closed, and COP speed. Two trials will be recorded for each condition and the
      order of the conditions will be randomized across subjects, eyes open and eyes closed. Foot
      plantar pressure and surface area of two static footprints will be measured during bipedal
      standing. Static plantar pressure will be evaluated by means of maximum pressure, medium
      pressure and surface area of each aspect of the foot (rearfoot, midfoot, and fore foot).

    <description>Static footprint will measure plantar presures and surface area of rear food, midfoot and fore foot. Subjects were instructed to stand barefoot on the force platform, participants were instructed to remain in a relaxed standing posture with feet shoulder-width apart and positioned at 30º away from the midline. During all the examinations, the upper limbs were placed in a relaxed position along the body. The subjects were instructed to stand as still as possible for 30 s, with their eyes open, while concentrating on a point at eye level 2-m away or with their eyes open.</description>
