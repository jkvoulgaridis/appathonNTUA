  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called
      autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) as a possible
      treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study purpose is to evaluate the safety profile
      of four IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
      24 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD. The primary endpoint of
      this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse
      event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the
      ability of HB-adMSCs to alter AD-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis
      Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
      and markers associated with amyloid deposition, Amyloid beta 40 and Amyloid beta 42. Subjects
      will also be assessed for cognitive deficits measured by changes from baseline values using
      Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of
      Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), Altoida Neuro
      Motor Index (NMI) for Digital Biomarkers, and Clinical Dementia Rating Questionnaire (CDR).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men, and women of non-childbearing potential, 50-85 years of age inclusively, with a
             diagnosis of early stage's (preclinical/mild cognitive impairment) Probable
             Alzheimer's Disease according to the 2011 NIA-AA criteria.

               -  Non-childbearing potential for women is defined as postmenopausal [last natural
                  menses greater than 24 months; in women under age 55, menopausal status will be
                  documented with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test] or undergone a
                  documented bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy.

               -  Male participants who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential
                  must agree to use condoms during the trial unless the woman is using an
                  acceptable means of birth control. Acceptable forms of birth control include
                  abstinence, birth control pills, or any double combination of intrauterine device
                  (IUD), male or female condom and diaphragm.

          2. Informed consent signed by the subject

          3. Documented Amyloid PET Scan (images and report) positive to amyloid plaques deposits
             on the brain.

          4. If the patient is under any treatment, should have been on a stable dose for at least
             30 days prior to signing the informed consent form and there is no intention to modify
             the dose over the course of the study. (NOTE: Cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI)
             (donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) may not be initiated, discontinued or
             modified after study initiation for the 12-months control period).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hospitalization or change of chronic concomitant medication within one month prior to
             screening.

          2. Clinically significant or unstable disease that may interfere with outcome
             evaluations, including but not limited to:

               -  Respiratory Insufficiency

               -  Poorly managed hypertension (systolic &gt;160 mm Hg and/or diastolic &gt;95 mm Hg) or
                  hypotension (systolic &lt;90 mm Hg and/or diastolic &lt;60 mm Hg); or

               -  Bradycardia (&lt;50 beats/min.) or tachycardia (&gt;100 beats/min.). Otherwise healthy
                  subjects with borderline bradycardia may be discussed with the medical monitor to
                  determine eligibility.

               -  Renal insufficiency, defined as eGFR &lt;40 mL/min based on the CKD-EPI (Chronic
                  Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formula,
                  https://www.mdcalc.com/ckd-epi-equations-glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr

               -  Heart disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure,
                  cardiomyopathy within 3 months before screening). If a subject has a history of
                  heart disease of questionable clinical significance, the medical monitor may be
                  contacted to discuss eligibility.

          3. Records of PET Scan negative to Amyloid plaques deposition in the brain.

          4. Suspected or known drug or alcohol abuse, i.e. more than approximately 60 g alcohol
             (approximately 1 liter of beer or 0.5 liter of wine) per day.
