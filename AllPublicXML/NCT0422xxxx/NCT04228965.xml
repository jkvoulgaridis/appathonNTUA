  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand tobacco outcomes using a well-known stop
      smoking medication, varenicline, and financial incentives with tobacco users. The
      investigators are also interested in how cannabis/marijuana and tobacco interact during a
      tobacco quit attempt. All participants will receive tobacco cessation treatment (varenicline)
      for 12 weeks. This study will recruit adult tobacco users (ages 18-40) who are motivated to
      quit smoking cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis co-use among tobacco users is exceedingly common and rates of co-use appear to be
      increasing among adults in the US, which is consistent with overall increases in cannabis use
      rates among US adults. Given the current cannabis landscape, further increases in cannabis
      use are likely and may result in continued increases in the co-use of cannabis and tobacco.

      Despite high rates of co-use, there is little consensus regarding treatment recommendations
      for this population and an understanding of the impact of co-use on successful cessation. The
      literature on the impact of co-use on tobacco cessation outcomes specifically has been mixed
      and fraught with limitations, including methodological variation, lack of biochemical
      verification to confirm cannabis use status and severity, and variations in study samples.
      Currently, no prospective studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of cannabis use
      on tobacco cessation outcomes. Further, no studies have collected cannabis use changes during
      tobacco cessation treatment to assess for concurrent reductions, abstinence, or of greater
      concern, compensatory (i.e., increased) use as a result of tobacco reduction/abstinence.

      This study is a prospective 12-week tobacco cessation trial using established methods and
      outcomes typical of tobacco cessation trials, but specifically recruiting co-users of
      cannabis. The aims of this proposed study are to; 1) examine the impact of cannabis co-use on
      tobacco cessation outcomes among co-users compared to tobacco only participants (Aim #1), 2)
      among cannabis co-users, assess changes in cannabis use during tobacco treatment (Aim #2),
      and 3) assess for a dose-dependent impact of cannabis co-use severity on tobacco cessation
      (Exploratory Aim #1).

    <description>Varenicline is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of tobacco use disorder among adults (ages 18 and over). In this study, all participants will be administered active medication for the recommended 12 week treatment period. The standard dose titration schedule will be used, which includes 0.5 mg once per day (q.d.) on Days 1-3, 0.5 mg twice per day (b.i.d.) on Days 4-7, and 1.0 mg b.i.d. starting on Day 8. Dosing of 2.0 mg per day will be maintained for the next 11 weeks, for a total of 12 weeks of active treatment for all study participants.</description>
