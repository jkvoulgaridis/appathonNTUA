  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous experience with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) candidates suggests that
      selection of these patients can be improved. Current clinical guideline approaches are mainly
      too unspecific and lead to a high non-responder rate of 30-40%, which causes a burden on
      health care systems and puts patients at risk of an unnecessary treatment who might benefit
      more from a conservative approach. Previous work indicated that using the assessment of
      mechanical dyssynchrony on echocardiography can lower the non-responder rate at least by 50%
      without compromising sensitivity for detecting amendable patients. The current prospective,
      randomized, multi-center trial was therefore designed to prove that the characterization of
      the mechanical properties of the left ventricle can improve patient selection for CRT.
      Patients will be randomized into one of two study arms: a control study arm with treatment
      recommendation based on clinical guidelines criteria, or an experimental study arm with
      treatment recommendation based on the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony. All patients will
      receive a CRT implantation. In the control study arm, bi-ventricular pacing will be turned
      on. In the experimental study arm, bi-ventricular pacing will be turned on or off, depending
      on the presence or absence of mechanical dyssynchrony, respectively. The primary endpoint
      will be non-inferiority in outcome of a treatment recommendation based on mechanical
      dyssynchrony, achieved with a lower number of CRT devices implanted, effectively leading to a
      lower number needed to treat. Outcome measures are the average relative change in
      continuously measured LVESV per arm and the percentage 'worsened' according to the Packer
      Clinical Composite Score per arm after 1 year follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The proposed inclusion criteria represent the minimum recommendations for CRT implantation
        in heart failure patients. In addition:

          1. Understand and provide written informed consent

          2. ≥18 years

          3. Stable condition for ≥ 3 months prior inclusion and Optimal Medical Treatment (OMT)

          4. If ischemic: fully re-vascularized

          5. QRS width ≥ 130ms

          6. Increased left ventricular dimensions, defined as LVEDD ≥ 55mm

          7. In patients with pacing indication, only upgrades from RV pacemakers to CRT will be
             considered and only if the RV lead is being re-used. Patients must be predominantly
             paced.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in the
        study:

          1. First degree AV-block with PQ &gt; 300ms or higher AV-block

          2. Having severe MR, or otherwise more than moderate valvular disease

          3. Suffering from unstable angina

          4. Having pulmonary hypertension, other than secondary to left heart disease

          5. Persistent atrial fibrillation or arrhythmias which do not allow to acquire 5
             consecutive regular beats during echocardiography (e.g. frequent VES, bigemini, …)

          6. Planned primary CRT implantation due to a permanent pacing indication; Pacemaker
             upgrades to CRT are allowed if existing right ventricular lead is being re-used and
             pacemaker is currently in DDD mode

          7. Having a relevant, potentially life-limiting non-cardiac disease

          8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
