  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the need of finding effective disease-modifying anti-osteoarthritis (OA) treatments is
      still unmet, with this study the investigators aim to gather further evidences of the
      therapeutic potential of Mesenchymal Stem/stromal Cell (MSC) secretome in order to pave the
      way to its future use as a cell-free biological product. In detail, the investigators predict
      to validate the promising results obtained in vitro, ex vivo on osteochondral explants, an OA
      model more representative of the physiological situation.

    <measure>Validation of the cell-free approach based on the use of ASC secretome on an ex vivo OA model by evaluation of cell viability, histological features and gene/protein expression of cartilage and bone biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical and functional characterization of untreated osteochondral explants (to set up the model) and explants treated with inflammatory cytokines (to simulate osteoarthritic pathology) by evaluation of several parameters. The multiple measurements that will concur to describe the phenotype of the specimens are the following:
cell viability by AlamarBlue (Arbitrary Fluorescence Units).
histological assessments (qualitative differences between specimens).
analysis of gene expression by RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction, relative quantification by 2-ΔΔCT method).
analysis of protein expression by Western Blot (relative quantification by densitometry) and Luminex (pg/ml).
Evaluation of the effects of ASC secretome (either complete conditioned medium or its subcomponents) on osteochondral biopsies treated with inflammatory cytokines through the biochemical and functional analyses described above.</description>
