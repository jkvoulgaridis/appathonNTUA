  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this study to learn more about the cognitive and attentional
      processes among individuals with three types of repetitive negative thinking (RNT): mental
      rituals (as seen in obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD), worries (as seen in generalized
      anxiety disorder, GAD), and ruminations (as seen in major depressive disorder, MDD).
      Specifically, the investigators are studying whether psychological treatment can help people
      with RNT who have trouble stopping unwanted thoughts and shifting their attention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine whether enhancing attention regulation skills in a
      transdiagnostic intervention for repetitive negative thinking (RNT) will significantly
      improve the target of attentional/cognitive control. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (like the flip of a coin) to receive eight 60-90 minute sessions (over 8 weeks) of either:
      Emotion Regulation Therapy-Attention Regulation (ERT-AR) or Supportive Psychotherapy (SPT).
      The investigators will use a multi-method approach to measure attentional/cognitive control:
      (a) behavioral (i.e., eye tracking fixations and reaction time), (b) electrophysiological
      (i.e., event related potentials), and (c) self-report (i.e., perceived ability to shift and
      focus attention). They also will examine early signs of treatment efficacy of ERT-AR and SPT
      and target validation (i.e., whether changes in attentional/cognitive control correlate with
      changes in RNT and associated symptoms). Participants will receive assessments of these
      target and outcome measures at baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week 4), post-treatment
      (week 8), and 3-month follow-up (week 20). Findings could help identify a cross-cutting
      target that can be engaged to optimize treatment response for individuals with elevated RNT.

    <description>Participants will receive a total of eight 60-90 minute sessions (over 8 weeks) of individual, manual-based ERT-AR. This intervention aims to build attention regulation skills (i.e., the ability to flexibly shift and sustain attention) by teaching participants exercises for Orienting their attention and Allowing the presence of negative emotions. Participants are taught to apply these skills to counteract reactive perseverative thinking when negative emotions arise as well as proactively engage with emotion-laden situations that trigger repetitive negative thinking.</description>
