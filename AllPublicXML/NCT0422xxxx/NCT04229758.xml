      Primary Objective:

      To identify the optimal interval to restart oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial
      hemorrhage that will minimize thrombotic events and major bleeding by performing a response
      adaptive randomized (RAR) clinical trial of restarting in anticoagulant-associated traumatic
      intracranial hemorrhage patients, comparing restart at 1 week to restart at 2 weeks or at 4
      weeks, with a primary composite outcome of major thrombotic events and bleeding.

      Primary Outcome: 60-day composite of thromboembolic events, defined as DVT, pulmonary emboli,
      myocardial infarctions, ischemic strokes and systemic emboli, and bleeding events defined as
      non-CNS major bleeding events (modified BARC3 or above) and worsening index tICrH or new
      intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To demonstrate a time/response relationship between time of restarting and overall secondary
      events, i.e. a dose response, that favors early restarting (at 1 week is better than 2 weeks,
      2 weeks better than 4 weeks.)

      To perform exploratory analysis of the composite with and without Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
      in the thrombotic component and analysis of weighting of the composite components with 60-day
      Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) .

      Randomized RAR time-dose-response trial Restart tICrH:

      The trial will randomize patients with anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial
      hemorrhage to restart anticoagulation at 1 week or 2 weeks or 4 weeks, using an adaptive
      randomization algorithm that increases the probability of patients being randomized to
      treatment arms with lower event rates. Entry into the trial is primarily driven pragmatically
      by clinician intent to restart a Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) after
      anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and equipoise concerning restart
      of anticoagulation at the specified time intervals.

      A. Inclusion Criteria

        1. Acute traumatic intracranial hemorrhage on anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
           or Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)

        2. Patient is higher risk for stroke or other thrombotic events as witnessed by having a
           CHA2DS2-VASc score of &gt; 4 (at least 4 of the following risk factors: age greater than
           65,( age &gt; 75 counts for two points), history of heart failure, history of diabetes,
           history of atherosclerotic vascular disease, female gender, history of hypertension)

      B. Exclusion Criteria

        1. Mechanical Valve

        2. Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)

        3. SDH &gt;8 mm maximum width or any midline shift at any time point or more than one SDH

        4. Physician plan to start/restart antiplatelet therapy during trial period

      C. Primary Outcome

      A 60-day composite outcome that includes the following clinical events:

      New or expansion of intracranial hemorrhage, other BARC3a or above major hemorrhage, Stroke,
      systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and
      cardiovascular death

      D. Statistical considerations -- Using our Bayesian response adaptive randomization design
      with potential to stop early for success or futility, we plan to enroll a maximum of 1,100
      subjects (expected 10% lost to follow up leaving 990 analyzable). The study has 87% power
      (based on expected thrombotic event rates of 0.5, 3.5 and 6.25% and bleeding rates of 1, 0.67
      and 0.33% in 1, 2 and 4 weeks respectively). This is based as well on the expectation that
      the algorithm will allocate 50% of the subjects to the treatment arm with the lowest event
      rate (i.e. 1 week) and 21% to the arm with the highest event rate (i.e. 4 weeks).

      E. Time cut-offs and intervals -- All times are local. The day of index hemorrhage is Day 0,
      even in neurosurgical intervention patients. The patient must be randomized by midnight of
      Day 6. If allocated to restart at 1 week, first dose of DOAC must be given from midnight of
      Day 6 to midnight of Day 7. The 2-week group must begin treatment from midnight Day 13 to
      midnight Day 14, and the 4-week group must begin treatment from midnight Day 27 to midnight
      Day 28. Restarting outside these windows will be considered a protocol deviation.

      F. Definition of Events (centrally assessed by Study Outcomes Adjudication Board)

        1. Bleeding Events

             1. Worsening tICrH/new ICrH -- Hematoma expansion/new ICrH lesion on imaging 2)causing
                objective change in clinical status and 3)leading to stop of anticoagulation (must
                include all three).

             2. Extracranial Major bleeding -- BARC3a or above definition.

        2. Thrombotic events

             1. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) It is defined as a clinical diagnosis of deep vein
                thrombosis or pulmonary embolus.

             2. Myocardial Infarction (MI) Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.

             3. Stroke -- New focal neurologic deficit consistent with ischemic stroke and
                confirmed by a stroke specialist or brain imaging. Brain imaging must be performed
                but need not be positive if the stroke specialist (neurology, neurosurgery or
                internal medicine) deems a clinically probable stroke.

             4. Systemic Embolism -- A clinical diagnosis of extracranial infarction associated
                with likely thromboembolism and documented by angiography or surgery in the absence
                of atherosclerotic occlusion.

             5. Cardiovascular death non bleeding -- Death resulting from an acute myocardial
                infarction, sudden cardiac death, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke,
                death due to cardiovascular procedures, and death from other cardiovascular causes.
                A patient who has both this outcome and another thrombotic outcome will only be
                counted once as this outcome.
