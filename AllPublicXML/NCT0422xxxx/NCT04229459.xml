    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, two-centered study for evaluation of the addition of
      nivolumab and cetuximab after chemoradiation as a neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Subjects must have received no prior treatment
      for esophageal cancer (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) and no prior treatment with
      checkpoint inhibitors.

      Eligible subjects will receive induction chemotherapy with cetuximab for a period of 4 weeks,
      chemoradiation with cetuximab for a period of 6 weeks, 3 cycles of immunotherapy (nivolumab +
      cetuximab) for a period of 6 weeks, and will undergo surgery at the end of the treatment.
