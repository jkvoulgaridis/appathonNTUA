  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to determine safety and tolerability as well as the MTD of a
      single-dose 2ccPA and PK data in symptomatic knee OA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease frequently associated with symptoms such as
      inflammation, stiffness, muscle weakness, joint swollen and joint pain. 2-carba-cyclic
      phosphatidic acid (2ccPA) is the derivative of natural occurring phospholipid mediator,
      cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). Previous studies suggested that 2ccPA inhibits inflammation
      and may relieve the pain caused by osteoarthritis.

      This clinical study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics as well as
      the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of a single-dose 2ccPA in symptomatic knee OA. Safety and
      efficacy data for the design and conduction of subsequent studies will also be collected.
