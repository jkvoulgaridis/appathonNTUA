    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, its survival rate
      ranks only second to lung cancer and it is a severe threat to human health.

      In Egypt, HCC constitutes a significant public health problem. Where it is responsible for
      33.63% and 13.54% of all cancers in males and females respectively. It has a poor prognosis
      after discovery, which is usually at a late stage of disease. This had been strongly linked
      to the hepatitis C virus epidemic that affected around 10-15% of the Egyptian population
      during the last 3 decades, and was reported as the highest prevalence of HCV in the world.
      However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved remain unclear. The occurrence of HCC is
      a complicated process involving multiple genes and steps. Imbalances in cellular signal
      transduction pathways, deficiencies in DNA repair regulating genes, activation of
      protooncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic modifications all
      promote the occurrence of liver cancer.

      HCC is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in 2018. The alarming incidence of HCC is
      explained by genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as by the presence of risk factors:
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, alcohol consumption, smoking,
      diabetes, dietary exposure to aflatoxins, and obesity.

      The development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with cure rates of higher than 90% has
      been a major breakthrough in the management of patients with chronic HCV infection. However,
      although viral cure decreases the overall HCC risk in HCV-infected patients, it does not
      eliminate virus-induced HCC risk, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis. Furthermore,
      convenient biomarkers to robustly predict HCC risk after viral cure and strategies for HCC
      prevention are absent. These unexpected findings pose new challenges for patient management.
      Meanwhile, recent studies in patients treated with interferone-free therapy have also
      identified several risk factors for developing HCC after achieving sustained virological
      response (SVR), namely advanced hepatic fibrosis and higher levels of alpha feto protein and
      agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein.

      Epigenetics refers to inherited altered gene expression without an alteration of the DNA
      sequence itself. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA hypomethylation or hypermethylation and
      aberrant expression of micro-RNAs have been studied and associated with HCC. Epigenetic
      changes may represent diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC.
