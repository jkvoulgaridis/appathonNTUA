  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacies of an online mindfulness-based intervention for
      emerging adults with ADHD in Malaysia. The investigators hypothesized that online
      mindfulness-based intervention may improve ADHD symptoms and executive functions of emerging
      adults with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that
      often persist to adulthood. In Malaysia, the Chinese ethnic is having the highest prevalence
      rate of hyperactivity symptoms. Nevertheless, there are only limited evidence-based treatment
      options targeting the core symptoms of ADHD, as well as executive functions in adulthood. In
      addition, conventional psychotherapeutic approaches for adults with ADHD have found to be
      highly labor-intensive. Emerging adulthood is a distinct developmental stage of 18 - 29 years
      old, with unique challenges that rarely addressed in mental health system. Recently,
      mindfulness-based intervention appears to be a promising treatment for adults living with
      ADHD but it has not been evaluated among Malaysian emerging adults with ADHD. The
      investigators proposed a two-arm randomized controlled trial, comparing an eight-week online
      mindfulness-based intervention program with an online introductory psychology program. The
      outcomes include changes of inattention symptom, changes of hyperactivity-impulsivity
      symptom, and changes of executive functions from pretest to posttest, 1-month follow-up and
      3-month follow-up. To investigators' best knowledge, this randomized controlled trial will be
      the first to test the efficacious of online mindfulness-based intervention for ADHD among
      emerging adults. It will provide evidence on the efficacious of online treatment for this
      often-overlooked population in the mental healthcare system.

    <description>The iMBI starts with psychoeducation about ADHD and defining mindfulness. Participants were then encouraged to discuss their experience of living with ADHD via a series of guided questions. Upon orientated to the program, the participants will be introduced to various topics of mindfulness and ADHD, as well as a wide range of in-session online mindfulness exercises. Offline assignments that correspond to each week's theme will be assigned to participants at the end of each session. Downloadable audio tracks for offline practices will be provided to the participants. Participants are expected to spend around 15 to 30 minutes each day to complete the weekly iMBI assignment.</description>
