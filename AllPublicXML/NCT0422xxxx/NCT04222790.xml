  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) caused by paclitaxel is a dose-limiting toxicity.
      The main symptoms of discomfort are numbness, tingling, and burning sensations in the
      glove-sock-like distribution of the limbs. At present, there are few effective methods for
      clinical treatment of TIPN, and there is no widely agreed consensus on effective treatment in
      the world. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance and practical value to carry out
      clinical research to explore drugs to relieve TIPN.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) Female patients diagnosed with early breast cancer by histology; (2) Age ≥18 years
             old and ≤75 years old, undergo radical mastectomy (including modified radical
             mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery) without neoadjuvant / adjuvant chemotherapy
             (3) It is expected that the standard chemotherapy regimen containing albumin
             paclitaxel will be used in the adjuvant / neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. The
             standard scheme includes: a. Albumin paclitaxel adopts a single-week regimen,
             125-150mg / m2 for 12 weeks; b. Albumin paclitaxel Take a 3-week regimen, 260 mg / m2,
             for a total of 4 cycles. The plan must not contain platinum and other types of purple
             shirt drugs; (4) ECOG score of the patient is ≤1; (5) Expected survival time ≥ 3
             months; (6) The function level of main organs must meet the following requirements (no
