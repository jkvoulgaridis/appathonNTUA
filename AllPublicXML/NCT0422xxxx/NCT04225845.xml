  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly individuals across the world are increasingly living alone. However, little is known
      about the effects of loneliness on economic and health outcomes. The elderly living alone
      (i.e., in a household of size 1) will be randomized into one of two treatment groups or a
      control condition. The first treatment group will receive home visits that deliver
      problem-solving therapy aimed at improving the elderly's outlook on life and demand for
      interaction. The second treatment group will receive home visits in addition to facilitated
      group activities aimed at increasing the supply of those with whom to interact. Investigators
      will track outcomes of the elderly and their family members for several years following the
      intervention.

    <measure>Difficulty in performing daily activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked over the last 30 days: how much difficulty they had in sitting for long periods, standing up from sitting down, getting up from lying down, standing for long periods, extending arms above shoulder level, washing whole body, getting dressed, getting to and using the toilet, taking care of household responsibilities, moving inside the home, walking 100 meters, walking long distances (1km), climbing a flight of stairs, stooping or kneeling, picking up things with fingers, carrying things, eating, getting where they want to go, concentrating on something for 10 minutes, learning a new task, and joining community activities. The scale is from 1-5, with 1 being no difficulty, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe, and 5 cannot do. The response for each activity will be converted to a z-score (subtract mean and divide by the standard deviation) and z-scores will be averaged to generate a composite index.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to report severity of basic and acute health conditions over the last 30 days. Two outcomes: difficulty seeing and difficulty hearing someone are measured on a scale from 1-5, with 1 being no difficulty, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe, and 5 cannot do. Three outcomes: any problems with mouth or teeth in the last 12 months, discomfort urinating, and any falls or injuries in the last 12 months will be measured on a yes or no basis. The response for each activity will be converted to a z-score (subtract mean and divide by the standard deviation) and z-scores will be averaged to generate a composite index.</description>

    <measure>Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the short-form University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (aka ULS-4). This is a 4-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Subjects rate each item as either O (&quot;I often feel this way&quot;), S (&quot;I sometimes feel this way&quot;), R (&quot;I rarely feel this way&quot;), N (&quot;I never feel this way&quot;).</description>
