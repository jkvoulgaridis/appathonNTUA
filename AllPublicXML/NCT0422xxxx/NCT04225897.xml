  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, 3-part study to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and antiviral
      effect of single and multiple dosing of RV521 in infants hospitalised due to Respiratory
      Syncytial Virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Due to the adaptive study
      design, the number of enrolled subjects may vary depending on the obtained PK and safety
      profiles.

      This is a multicentre, 3-part study to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and antiviral
      effect of single and multiple dosing of RV521 in infants hospitalised due to RSV LRTI.

      The clinical study consists of 3 parts, the third part (Part C) is optional:

        -  Part A is an open-label, multicentre, single dose study in infants hospitalised with RSV
           LRTI (Cohorts 1 &amp; 2)

        -  Part B is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre multiple dose
           study in infants hospitalised with RSV LRTI (Cohorts 3, 4 &amp; 5)

        -  Part C is a randomised 1:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multiple-dose
           study in infants hospitalised with RSV LRTI I The number of subjects enrolled in Parts A
           and B of the study will depend on the safety and PK data from the group of subjects
           enrolled in specified age cohorts and the subsequent recommendation of the Data Safety
           Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

      The DSMC may recommend a dose adjustment (either a reduction or an escalation) and/or regimen
      adjustment (Part B only) for subsequent subjects because of the observation of an unexpected
      safety/tolerability profile and/or differences between the observed and predicted exposure
      resulting from a specified dose of RV521.

    <description>sisunatovir is formulated as a dry powder blend of RV521 drug substance with mannitol as excipient. The RV521 dry powder blend will be supplied in capsules containing 10, 20, or 50 mg RV521. The Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be dispersed in a defined volume of water prior to oral administration on a mg/kg basis. Instructions for opening the capsule(s) and dispersing the contents in a fixed volume of water prior to administration will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.
The proposed dosing regimen for Part A is a single open label dose of RV521. Part B and C is RV521 or placebo administered BID, 12 hours apart, for a period of 5 consecutive days with a total of 10 doses. However, this is subject to the recommendation of the DSMC.</description>
