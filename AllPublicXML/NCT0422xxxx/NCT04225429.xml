        Patients with epithelioid sarcoma (ES) are eligible to enroll in the EAP. The patient with
        ES must have an advanced disease that is considered life threatening at the time of
        enrollment and appropriate, comparable, or satisfactory alternative treatments must have
        been tried without clinical success. Patients with conditions other than ES are not
        eligible for the tazemetostat EAP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age (at the time of consent): ≥18 years of age.

          2. They are unable to participate in tazemetostat clinical trials for their condition.

          3. Can provide signed written informed consent.

          4. Morphology and immunophenotypic panel consistent with epithelioid sarcoma (e.g., CD34,
             epithelial embrane antigen [EMA], Keratin, and INI1).

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential should:

               -  Agree to practice one highly effective method of contraception and one additional
                  effective barrier method (eg, condom or diaphragm with spermicide) at the same
                  time, from the time of providing voluntary written informed consent through 30
                  days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) after the last dose of tazemetostat,
                  and

               -  Have a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test at time
                  of screening and within 14 days prior to planned first dose of tazemetostat
                  (urine or serum test is acceptable however, positive urine tests must be
                  confirmed with serum testing), and

               -  Agree to use effective contraception from start of screening until 30 days
                  following the last dose of tazemetostat and have a male partner who uses a
                  condom, or

               -  Practice true abstinence, (when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient) or

               -  Have a male partner who is vasectomized.

          6. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential should:

               -  Be vasectomized, or

               -  Agree to use condoms from at least 7 days prior to initiating and during
                  tazemetostat treatment and for at least 30 days following the last dose of
                  tazemetostat, or

               -  Have a female partner who is NOT of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             3. Has known hypersensitivity to any of the components of tazemetostat or other
             inhibitor(s) of EZH2.

             4. Has thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anemia of Grade ≥3 (per CTCAE v5.0 criteria)
             within the past month, or any prior history of myeloid malignancies, including
             myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

             5. Is known to have any abnormalities associated with MDS (e.g. del 5q, chr 7 abn) and
             MPN (e.g. JAK2 V617F) observed in cytogenetic testing and DNA sequencing.

             6. Has a prior history of T-LBL/T-ALL. 7. For female patients of childbearing
             potential: Is pregnant or nursing. 8. For male patients: Is unwilling to adhere to
