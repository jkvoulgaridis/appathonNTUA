  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of NPC-21 when administered
      prophylactically to cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative patients receiving a first kidney
      transplant from a CMV seropositive donor.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of NPC-21 for kidney
      transplant recipients at high risk of CMV infection in the United States and Japan.
      Approximately 108 eligible patients will be randomized prior to first study drug
      administration to receive low-dose NPC 21, high-dose NPC-21, or placebo. Randomization will
      be stratified by region (United States or Japan)
