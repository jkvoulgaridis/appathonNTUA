  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease ((IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC)), is a chronic, immune-mediated disease characterized by recurrent episodes of relapse.
      The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide and poses as a burden that reduces quality of
      life and has a significant impact on health care resources.

      The advent of monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF) has revolutionized
      treatment of IBD, improving rates of remission and reducing hospitalizations and surgeries.
      Nevertheless, many patients do not adequately respond to these therapies or lose response
      over time. Thus, there is an important need for novel immunomodulating agents to improve our
      ability to achieve remission.

      Besides its traditional role in bone homeostasis, several studies have recognized the
      important role Vitamin D plays in modulating the immune response, cancer, and cardiovascular
      disease. Specifically, Vitamin D may mediate immunity by modulating autophagy in leukocytes
      and regulating the gut microbiome. Thus, Vitamin D may play an important role in IBD.
      Furthermore, evidence suggests that the effect of vitamin D may be mediated through the TNF-α
      pathway, suggesting a synergy with anti-TNF therapy.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effect of Vitamin
      D3 as an adjunct therapy for patients with active CD, UC, or IBD unspecified who are
      undergoing anti-TNF induction therapy.
