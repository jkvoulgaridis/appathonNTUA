  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In abdomen, the pancreas as a gland is involved in the digestive and endocrine system by
      secreting digestive enzymes and insulin. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common inflammatory
      condition of the pancreas with symptoms of sudden abdominal pain and high temperature which
      may develop to severe complications in some patients. The incidence of AP was roughly 33.74
      cases per 100, 000 person-years around the world but varies in different regions which
      America has the highest incidence of 58.20 cases per 100 000 person-years. There are very few
      studies published on AP in China, while Japanese national survey in 2011 estimated an
      incidence rate of 49.4 per 100,000 population and a study in Taiwan showed an annual average
      incidence of 36.9 per 100,000 persons with a slight change over ten years.

      In most cases, patient with AP will start to recover within a week, but the patient quality
      of life (QoL) is still a big concern for disease management. It quantitatively measures the
      physical, mental and social wellbeing of individuals or their life satisfaction by
      questionnaires or surveys. Although very few studies have demonstrated the effect of AP on
      patient QoL, there is accumulating evidence to show its importance. Some studies reported no
      differences in QoL between AP patients and age-matched healthy people, whereas others showed
      QoL was significantly impaired due to AP. A large population-based follow-up study is needed
      to evaluate the impact of acute pancreatitis on quality of life. In addition, as the
      population investigated in most research was European based, the QoL evaluation of patients
      after AP among the Chinese population is also essential.

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Onemonth follow-up after discharge: Quality of life of patients after acute pancreatitis will be assessed by EuroQol five-dimension three-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire, which essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). Chinese Time-Trade Off value sets will be adopted to transform the descriptive system into health value (-0.149 to 1). The higher health value indicates the better health status.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>One-month follow-up after discharge: Quality of life of patients after acute pancreatitis will be assessed by 36-Item Short-form health survey (SF-36), which is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. It consists of eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health), which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>
