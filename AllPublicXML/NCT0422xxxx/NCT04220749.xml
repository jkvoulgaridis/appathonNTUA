  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized phase II study is a formal comparison of radiotherapy versus
      trans-oral surgery as the primary treatment of HPV-negative patients with early-stage
      oropharyngeal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized phase II study. Patients will be randomized between
      current standard of care treatment (Arm 1) vs. TOS (Arm 2) in a 1:1 ratio. Additionally,
      patients will be stratified according to T stage (T1 vs. T2); N stage (N0/1 vs. N2/3)

      The randomized phase II design is required for three reasons:

        1. The randomization will provide an appropriate control group to serve as a comparator for
           the experimental arm. Historical or contemporaneous non-randomized controls would not be
           appropriate due to the multitude of biases that could be introduced by patient selection
           and other confounders.

        2. A small sample size will allow for adequate power to assess for progression-free
           survival, and also an assessment of quality of life, overall survival and toxicity.

        3. The results will allow for a decision as to whether a multi-institutional phase III
           trial is warranted, and inform the design of such a trial.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma

          -  HPV-negative tumor, as determined by: negative p16 status, real time PCR or in-situ
             hybridization. Central confirmation is not required prior to randomization.
             Equivocal/uncertain HPV status will be allowed on trial.

          -  Primary tumor site in the oropharynx (includes tonsil, soft palate, base of tongue,

             function, hepatic, and renal function, as determined by the investigator.

          -  Patient assessed by a radiation oncologist and surgeon and presented at
             multidisciplinary tumor board prior to randomization. If not feasible, case can be
             discussed with study Principal Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical comorbidities or other contraindications to radiotherapy, chemotherapy
             or surgery

          -  Prior history of head and neck cancer within 5 years
