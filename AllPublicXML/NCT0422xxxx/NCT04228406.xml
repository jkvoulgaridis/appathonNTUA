  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics,
      and preliminary efficacy GST-HG161.

      There are 7 dose cohorts, including60mg, 150mg, 300mg, 450mg, 600mg, 750mg, 900mg QD in the
      dose escalation stage and GST-HG161 will be administered orally to patients once daily for
      each dose cohort. Recommended protocal in the dose expansion stage will be determined by the
      results in the dose escalation stage .
