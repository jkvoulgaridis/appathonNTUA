  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In running 70% of the lower limb, injuries are produced in the running segment. The vast
      majority of sports-related musculoskeletal injuries in young athletes are caused by overuse.
      Previous research has shown a clear association between running-related injuries and
      kinematic patterns, showing the existence of a causal relationship between biomechanical
      alterations and injures.

      According to the evidence, that real-time visual and auditory feedback based on gait
      retraining should be considered to treat injured runners or prevent injuries. However, no
      previous studies have been carried out on whether gait retraining decreases running-related
      injuries incidence in young triathletes.

      The investigators propose a study to determine the effect of gait retraining on the decrease
      in the number of running-related injuries and improve the running efficiency in young
      triathletes.

    <description>5 gait retraining sessions of continuous feedback in real time during running sessions; using videotape feedback, a digital metronome to increase step rate, and verbal feedback to reduce the tendency to heel strike upon ground contact. Verbal feedback is offered during the 25- to 30-minute running sessions following a series of drills aimed at improving running mechanics.</description>
