  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to protecting against measles infection, measles vaccine (MV) strengthens the
      individual's ability to combat infections in general - MV has beneficial non-specific effects
      (NSE) lowering the risk of death and admissions by around 30%.

      In Guinea-Bissau 30% of children do not receive a routine MV scheduled at 9 months of age,
      putting both the individual child's health and measles eradication at risk. WHO recommends
      vaccination at health system contacts, including those for curative services. At the
      paediatric ward of the national hospital in Guinea-Bissau, there are more than 2600 yearly
      contacts with measles-unvaccinated children aged 9-59 months, but no vaccines are given. In a
      randomised controlled trial, we will assess the effect of providing MV vs placebo to 5400
      children at hospital contacts (at discharge or after an out-patient consultation) to test the
      hypothesis that MV reduces the risk of admission or death (composite outcome) by 25% over the
      subsequent 6 months.
