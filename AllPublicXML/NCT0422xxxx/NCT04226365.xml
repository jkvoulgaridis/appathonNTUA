  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial in which subjects with a post
      concussive headache meeting inclusion criterion will be assigned to one of two treatment
      groups: placebo or nortriptyline. Each group will be evaluated at week 0 and again each week
      for the next 4 weeks of treatment with a concussion survey that rates their symptoms. At the
      end of 4 weeks the study will be unblinded. It is hypothesized that the addition of
      nortriptyline to the standard headache treatments will result in more rapid decrease of
      symptom score than with placebo.
