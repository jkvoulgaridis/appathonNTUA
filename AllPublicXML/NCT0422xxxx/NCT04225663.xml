    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to explore potential methods of rehabilitating changes
      observed from repetitive head impacts. Participation in this study will involve functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging, anaerobic testing, a meditation rehabilitation
      intervention, and filling out survey information concerning subjective well-being.

      At first study visit, participants will be undergo fMRI arterial spin labeling scanning as
      well as a Wingate anaerobic exercise test on a stationary bike. Over the next two months,
      participants will participate in a breath work meditation or independent quiet study.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two study groups. The intervention group will
      receive guided meditation. The control group will do independent school work quietly. Both
      groups will receive fMRI scans and perform an anaerobic bike test.

      Participants will undergo a 30 minute MRI scan. After a preclinical screening, participants
      will participate in the Wingate anaerobic bike test. Participants will warm up for 5 minutes
      to become accustomed to the bike, completing 4-5 practice sprints. After a 1 minute rest,
      participants will perform a maximal effort test for 30 seconds. Upon completing, there will
      be a cool down and stretch period. During the warm up and test, participants will be wearing
      apical ECG leads to record heart rate activity. Over the following 2 months, they will
      participate in a meditation intervention therapy or independent study twice a week for 30
      minutes each session.

      During meditation intervention therapy, participants will lie on the floor with their backs
      and torsos elevated by a mat/soft blocks, with a foam roll underneath their knees.
      Participants will undergo guided breath work that will include a full body scan to bring
      participants to a present state. Upon completing all of the intervention sessions,
      participants will attend a follow up session of fMRI scanning and perform the Wingate test
      once again. In both the baseline and follow up tests, participants will fill out demographic
      surveys as well as subjective surveys concerning their well-being and perception of self.

The RCADS is scored either manually or by using an automated scoring procedure. Each item is assigned a numerical value from 0-3, where 0 = Never, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, and 3 = Always. The highest score possible is 18, the lowest 0. This is an overall assessment of an individual's mental health and not what is considered better or worse. Examples include separation anxiety disorder or social phobia.</description>
