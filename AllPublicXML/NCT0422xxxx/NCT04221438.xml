  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well encorafenib and binimetinib work before surgery in
      treating patients with BRAF V600-mutated stage IIIB-D melanoma that has spread to the lymph
      nodes. Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. This trial also studies how well 18F-FLT positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in predicting the response of melanoma to
      encorafenib and binimetinib. 18F-FLT is an imaging agent, sometimes called a tracer. PET and
      CT are types of imaging scans. Using 18F-FLT PET/CT together with encorafenib and binimetinib
      may provide more information on melanoma over time.

      PRIMARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant treatment with
      encorafenib and binimetinib.

      SECONDARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate (RR) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]),
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To describe correlation of pCR with RR, DFS and OS. III. To assess safety and toxicity.

      CORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate CD8 positive (+) T cell infiltration and Ki-67 status in tumor or tumor bed
      pre, during, and post neoadjuvant treatment and the change in CD8+ tumor infiltrating
      lymphocyte (TIL) with neoadjuvant treatment and correlate with clinical response.

      II. To compare local review for pathologic response with central pathology review.

      III. To assess the correlation between change in fluorothymidine F-18 (18F-FLT) PET/CT uptake
      and change in Ki-67.

      IMAGING OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake (from baseline to post-neoadjuvant therapy)
      among patients with and without pathologic complete response.

      II. To compare post-neoadjuvant 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake among patients with and without
      pathologic complete response.

      III. To estimate an optimal threshold for prediction of pathologic complete response using i)
      change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake, and ii) post-neoadjuvant 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake.

      IV. To assess the correlation between change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake and change in Ki-67.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive 18F-FLT intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/CT scan
      approximately 60 minutes later. Within 2 weeks, patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive 18F-FLT IV and undergo a second PET/CT scan approximately 60 minutes later.

      SURGICAL RESECTION: Within 2 weeks of completing therapy with encorafenib and binimetinib,
      patients undergo surgery.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Within 2-7 days after surgery, patients resume treatment with encorafenib
      PO QD and binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 11
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

             also not expect to conceive or father children from the time of registration, while on
             study, treatment, and until at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
             (for female patients) and 90 days after the last dose of study treatment (for male
             patients). All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study
             within 14 days prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. A female of childbearing
             potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have
             undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has achieved menarche
             at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3)
             has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not
             rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  Patient must not have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any component of
             binimetinib or encorafenib or their excipients

             cardiovascular disease including, but not limited to, any of the following:

               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable
                  angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty or stenting) &lt; 6
                  months prior to registration

               -  Congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart Association grade &gt;=
                  2)

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% as determined by multigated
                  acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO)

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as persistent systolic blood pressure &gt;= 150
                  mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;= 100 mmHg despite current therapy

               -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (including
                  resting bradycardia, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or uncontrolled paroxysmal
                  supraventricular tachycardia)

               -  Baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;= 480 ms

          -  Patient must not have impairment of gastrointestinal function or disease which may
             significantly alter the absorption of study drug (e.g., active ulcerative disease,
             uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection with
             decreased intestinal absorption), or recent (=&lt; 3 months) history of a partial or
             complete bowel obstruction, or other conditions that will interfere significantly with
             the absorption of oral drugs

          -  Patient must not have any known history of acute or chronic pancreatitis

          -  Patient must not have any concurrent neuromuscular disorder that is associated with
             elevated creatine kinase (CK) (e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy

          -  Patient must not have any known history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion
             (RVO) or current risk factors for RVO (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular
             hypertension, history of hyperviscosity, factor V Leiden or activated protein C
             resistance); history of retinal degenerative disease

          -  Patient must not use any medication (including herbal medications, supplements, or
             foods), or use of a prohibited medication =&lt; 1 week prior to registration

          -  Patient must not have a history of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events =&lt; 12
             weeks prior to registration. Examples include transient ischemic attacks,
             cerebrovascular accidents, hemodynamically significant (i.e. massive or sub-massive)
             deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli

               -  NOTE: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or
                  other procedures may be registered

               -  NOTE: Patients with either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not
                  result in hemodynamic instability are allowed to register as long as they are on
                  a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least 4 weeks
