    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of enhanced haematology palliative care
      services to the most symptomatic group of blood cancer patients, namely myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

      Hypothesis to be tested:

      To test whether early integration of dedicated palliative care will improve the quality of
      life, mood and caregiver burden in patients with MDS and AML.

      Design and subjects:

      This is a 24-month open-label randomized controlled trial. Subjects include patients with MDS
      and AML.

      Study instruments:

      Interventions will be carried out by a dedicated team comprising palliative care physicians,
      haematologists, palliative care nurse specialists, and social workers. Outcome measures will
      be determined using validated questionnaires and data collection tools.

      Interventions:

      In this trial, enhanced haematology palliative care integrated to conventional supportive
      care versus conventional supportive care alone will be compared.

      Main outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measures include quality of life, mood and caregiver burden. The
      secondary outcome measures include number of admissions to acute hospital and intensive care
      and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are heterogeneous
      haematological malignancies associated with guarded long-term outcomes. In AML, 5-year
      overall survivals is approximately 40% even in young patients. Relapsed or refractory state
      is seen in up to 40% of patients with AML is associated with a poor outlook especially in
      patients in-eligible for intensive treatment. MDS is rarely curable except in young patients
      eligible for allogeneic haematopoietic stem transplantation (HSCT). MDS failing initial
      treatment have median survivals of less than 6 months. Most patients with AML and MDS are
      diagnosed after the age of 65, making them physically-ineligible for intensive curative
      treatment such as HSCT. In addition to inferior survivals, most patients with relapsed or
      refractory AML and MDS have profound cytopenia resulting in increased risk of infections and
      need for frequent blood product support. Quality of life (QOL) is affected due to significant
      symptom burden, treatment side-effects and repeated admission. Furthermore, an increased
      caregiver burden could be anticipated. Patients with blood cancers, especially those with AML
      and MDS experience significant physical and psychological symptoms that are comparable to or
      exceeding that seen in patients with solid organ cancers.

      Well-designed randomized controlled trials have clearly demonstrated the benefits of
      integrating early palliative care concurrently with standard care in cancer patients. Most of
      these trials demonstrated improved QOL and mood as well as reduction in the utilization of
      healthcare services. It is now recommended that in-patients and out-patients with advances
      malignancies should receive dedicated palliative care services early during the course of the
      disease. Caregivers may also be referred for palliative services to reduce caregiver burden.

      Despite the need for specific palliative care services, growing literature suggests that
      patients with blood cancer are less likely to receive palliative care services early. We have
      also shown that most patients with AML receive palliative care late and spend most the
      end-of-life periods in acute hospitals. In addition, there is a lack of studies examining the
      impact of early dedicated multidisciplinary palliative care services on blood cancer
      patients' QOL, mood and caregiver burden.

      In this study, investigators designed an open-label randomized controlled-study comparing
      early enhanced palliative care serviced versus usual care in patients with myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

    <measure>McGill Quality of Life (MQOL) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 17-item patient-rated measure of QOL for patients receiving palliative care.This questionnaire was translated and validated in Hong Kong. The questionnaire consists of five domains: physical well-being (five items), psychological well-being (six items), existential well-being (four items), support (two items), and sexual function (one item). In addition, there is a single item to rate their perceived quality of life. The response categories are based on a numerical scale from 0-10 with verbal anchors at the end of the scale. For the final statistical analysis, all scores are transposed on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing the least and 10 indicating the most desirable situation. The mean total QOL score is the average of all the 5 domain scores, with 0 representing the worst situation. The overall validation results of the MQOL-HK were acceptable. Cronbach's α for the MQOL-HK subscale ranged from 0.68 to 0.85.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of anxiety and depression were self-rated by HADS, which has been found to perform well as a test for such symptoms in the general population, in cancer patients and in primary care patients. Subjects decide on how each item applies to them on a scale ranging from no feelings of anxiety or depression (0) to severe feelings of anxiety or depression (3), with scores ranging from 0 to 21 on each subscale. A subscale score of 8 to 10 indicates a possible case of anxiety or depression, whereas a subscale score of 11 or higher indicates a definite case of anxiety or depression. Severe depression or anxiety disorders are suspected for subjects scoring 15 or higher.24 The Cantonese-Chinese version of the HADS25 has been found to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.77), reasonable sensitivity (0.79) and specificity (0.80), as well as positive (0.77) and negative predictive values (0.82).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Zariet Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ZBI is a widely used 22-item assessment tool for measuring the caregiver's perceived burden in providing family care. The questionnaire was translated, and modified according to Hong Kong cultural standards.
The ZBI scale was developed to measure burden among family caregivers of persons with dementia; however, it has been used in other populations and was selected for this study because of the high reliability and validity of the Chinese version, indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.99 and a correlation coefficient of 0.81. The correlation between ZBI and general Health Questionnaire was 0.59 (p&lt;0.001), and the correlation between Caregiver Activity Survey was 0.057 (p&lt;0.001), suggesting high conceptual validity.
The items were scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Scores were calculated by summing up the total chosen statement which ranges from 0 to 88, that higher scores implying greater perceived caregiver burden.</description>
