  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is
      40% in men and 47% in women; and the risk can be increased to 60% when the patient's BMI
      reaches 30 kg/m2. In this population, knee replacement is the most common, effective, and
      cost-effective method in all treatments with reducing pain, improving joint function and
      quality of life. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication in the
      elderly, and its incidence can reach 25-40% in major non-cardiac surgery. As for POCD can
      prolong hospital stay, increase mortality and morbidity, and increase social and economic
      burden, it is especially important for the prevention and treatment of POCD. However, The
      mechanism of POCD is still unclear. Studies suggest that it may involve inflammation and
      oxidative stress in the central nervous system. But for the elderly, they are in a state of
      low inflammatory response. At the same time, surgery and tourniquets also can trigger or
      aggravate inflammatory response. Once the inflammatory factors released into the blood
      circulation, they can act on the central nervous system in a variety of ways. As a
      result,elderly patients are more likely to develop POCD. In addition, some studies have shown
      that pain can also increase cognitive burden. Aspirin, its pharmacodynamic effects includes
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects which may have a certain effect on the prevention of
      POCD.

      Elderly patients undergoing knee replacement are more likely to develop POCD. The aim of this
      study is to determine the incidence of short-term POCD and long-term cognitive status in the
      elderly patients who use Aspirin atleast three months before knee replacement.And then, the
      study evaluates the effect of Aspirin on the incidence of postoperative delirium. In
      addition, it also shows the risk factors for POCD such as postoperative delirium, pain, C
      reactive protein and so on in the elderly patients who undergo knee replacement.
