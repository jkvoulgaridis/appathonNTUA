  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one organ to a nonadjacent organ. It causes 90% of
      cancer deaths. No treatment specifically prevents or reduces metastasis. Researchers hope a
      new drug can help. It stops cancer cells from growing and spreading further and possibly
      shrink cancer lesions in distant organs.

      Objective:

      To find a safe dose of metarrestin and to see if this dose shrinks tumors.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 and older with pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, or a solid tumor that has not
      been cured by standard therapies. Also, children age 12-17 with a solid tumor (other than a
      muscle tumor) with no standard therapy options.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  blood tests

        -  physical exam

        -  documentation of disease confirmation or tumor biopsy

        -  electrocardiogram to evaluate the heart

        -  review of their medicines and their ability to do their normal activities

      Participants will take metarrestin by mouth until they cannot tolerate it or stop to benefit
      from it. They will keep a medicine diary.

      Participants will visit the Clinical Center. During the first month there are two brief
      hospital stays required with visits weekly or every other week thereafter. They will repeat
      some of the screening tests. They will fill out questionnaires. They will have tests of their
      cognitive function. They will have an electroencephalogram to record brain activity. They
      will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT is a
      series of X-rays of the body. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the
      body.

      Adult participants may have tumor biopsies.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will have
      follow-up phone calls or emails every 6 months for the rest of their life or until the study
      ends.

      Background:

        -  Metarrestin is a first-in-class investigational agent targeting the peri-nucleolar
           compartment (PNC), a marker of genome organization associated with metastasis.

        -  Preclinical studies have shown that metarrestin effectively suppresses metastasis and
           extends overall survival in different cancer models.

        -  Multi-species allometric scaling and good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology and
           toxicokinetic studies indicate that metarrestin administered at a calculated safe
           maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) to human subjects is predicted to afford
           intratumoral exposure levels within the therapeutic range observed preclinically.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase IA: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metarrestin.

        -  Phase IB: To determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to Evaluation
           Criteria (RECIST 1.1) in patients treated with metarrestin at the MTD.

      Eligibility:

      -Adult subjects with any advanced solid tumors (Cohort IA), or pancreatic or breast tumors
      (Cohort IB1).

      OR

        -  Pediatric subjects age 12 and older with solid tumors other than rhabdomyosarcoma and
           related skeletal muscle tumors (Cohort IB2).

        -  Patients must have progressed on prior standard chemotherapeutic therapy.

      Design:

        -  This is first-in-human Phase I trial to investigate the safety and clinical activity of
           metarrestin in subjects with metastatic solid tumors.

        -  During Phase IA MTD of metarrestin will be estimated in adult patients with solid
           tumors.

        -  During Phase IB adult patients with breast or pancreatic cancer and pediatric patients
           with solid organ cancer will be treated at dose level of estimated MTD.

        -  Patients will receive treatment in cycles consisting of 28 (+/- 3) days.

        -  Metarrestin will be administered PO until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        disease

          -  HIV, HCV, HBV positive patients on antiviral drugs are excluded due to the absence of
             previous experience with concurrent use of antiviral medications and the
             investigational drug product to be evaluated in the current study and possible for
             adverse pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interactions.

             clinical symptoms or physical findings.

          -  Clinically relevant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease) and / or
             uncontrolled medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might

          -  Patients with previous gastric bypass, patients receiving nutrition via feeding tubes
             or parenterally, or patients with malabsorptive conditions (damage to the intestine
             from infection, inflammation, trauma, or surgery, celiac disease, Crohn's disease,
             chronic pancreatitis, or cystic fibrosis resulting malabsorption). Patients with
             refractory nausea and vomiting. Note: patients with gastric banding are allowed.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because metarrestin potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with metarrestin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with study drug.
