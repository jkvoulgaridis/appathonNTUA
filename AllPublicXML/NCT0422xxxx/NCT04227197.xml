  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a national two-arm, randomized controlled trial of caregivers of
      individuals with DS to assess the efficacy of DSC2U in assuring adherence to evidence-based
      guidelines. The research plan was approved by the Partners Human Research Committee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The overwhelming majority of people with Down syndrome do not have access to
      specialty clinics, a disparity resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses and significant
      untreated co-morbidities. To meet this critical gap in needs, the investigators created &quot;Down
      Syndrome Clinic to You&quot; (DSC2U), a novel, web-based tool created for caregivers of
      individuals with Down syndrome, which generates personalized recommendations for the
      caregiver and the patient's primary care provider (PCP).

      Methods: In a national, randomized controlled trial of 230 caregivers who had children or
      dependents with Down syndrome without access to a Down syndrome specialist, 117 were
      randomized to receive DSC2U and 113 to receive usual-care. The primary outcome was adherence
      to five health evaluations indicated by national guidelines for Down syndrome: celiac screen,
      sleep study, thyroid test, audiogram, and ophthalmology evaluation.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Potential eligible participants were directed to the study website (www.dsc2u.org) for the
        eligibility screening questionnaire in English and Spanish and online consent. After
        selecting a language preference (English or Spanish), in addition to questions about the
        child's or dependent's biological sex, race and ethnicity, the eligibility screening
        questions included:

          1. Do you have a child or dependent with DS?

          2. Is your child or dependent 1 year or older?

          3. When is your child's next annual well visit (&quot;PCP visit&quot;)?

          4. Does your child or dependent currently receive care at a DS specialty clinic? (If the
             child or dependent was actively followed in a DS specialty clinic, even one out of
             state. For example, a family from Arizona who travels to Texas each year for their
             child to be seen in a DS specialty clinic would be ineligible)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  If you have a child or dependent with Down syndrome (DS)

          -  If your child or dependent is 1 year or older

          -  If your child or dependent is does not receive care at a DS specialty clinic

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If your child or dependent does receive care at a DS specialty clinic

          -  If your child or dependent is under 1 year old

          -  If your child or dependent has a PCP that is already involved in the study

        DS occurs naturally and proportionally in all races and ethnicities, so the study's
        population estimates were proportional to the racial/ethnic distribution of the U.S.
        population, as reported in the 2010 U.S. Census. To achieve commensurate representation in
        the study, the investigators applied a quota system in offering enrollment using the race
        and ethnicity of the individual with DS (not the caregiver).

        The investigators' plan was to enroll participants such that there were: no more than 144
        white individuals with DS, no fewer than 25 Hispanic or Latino/Latina individuals with DS,
        and no fewer than 20 black individuals with DS. The team also planned to enroll no more
        than 120 individuals with DS of one sex.
