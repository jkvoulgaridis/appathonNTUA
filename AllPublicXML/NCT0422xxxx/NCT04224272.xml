  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 2a, open-label, 2-part study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of ZW25 in combination with palbociclib plus
      fulvestrant. Eligible patients include those with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or
      metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, hormone receptor
      (HR)-positive breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW25 in combination
      with palbociclib plus fulvestrant and will confirm the recommended doses (RDs) of ZW25 and
      palbociclib in this combination. Part 2 of the study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
      the RD level of the combination of ZW25 with palbociclib plus fulvestrant in patients with
      HER2-positive, HR-positive advanced breast cancer.

          -  Disease that has progressed or been refractory to prior treatment with trastuzumab,
             pertuzumab, AND ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Patients in any part of the study
             who did not receive pertuzumab or T-DM1 because of lack of access (e.g., due to
             insurance coverage or because they were treated prior to regulatory agency approval of
             the agent in a relevant indication) or due to medical ineligibility for treatment with
             T-DM1 (e.g., history of severe infusion reactions to trastuzumab, &gt;/= Grade 2
             peripheral neuropathy, or platelet count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L) may be eligible for the

          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy, other anti-cancer therapy not otherwise specified,
             or hormonal cancer therapy &lt;/= 3 weeks before the first dose of ZW25

             enrollment, troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction, or clinically
             significant cardiac disease, such as ventricular arrhythmia requiring therapy,
             uncontrolled hypertension, or any history of symptomatic congestive heart failure
             (CHF)

          -  QTc Fridericia (QTcF) &gt; 450 ms

          -  Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary

          -  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection

          -  Acute or chronic uncontrolled renal disease, pancreatitis, or severe liver disease

             patients with well controlled-HIV [e.g., cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)-positive
             T-cell count &gt; 350 mm3 and undetectable viral load] are eligible.)

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to
             interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen

          -  Brain metastases: Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, symptomatic CNS
             metastases, or radiation treatment for CNS metastases within 4 weeks of start of study
             treatment. Stable, treated brain metastases are allowed (defined as patients who are
             off steroids and anticonvulsants and are neurologically stable for at least 1 month at
             the time of screening).

          -  Known leptomeningeal disease (LMD)

          -  Grade 3 or greater peripheral neuropathy
