      This study will compare total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA)
      procedures, in the context of a prospective, randomized-controlled trial to determine the
      optimal treatment in patients 65 years of age and older who have glenohumeral osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder is a disease resulting from the wearing down of cartilage
      over time. OA can be the cause of pain and dysfunction and is a growing occurrence in the
      investigator's aging population. Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) or Reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty (RSA) are common surgical procedures used to treat patients with shoulder OA.
      TSA is able to keep the &quot;natural anatomy&quot; of the shoulder and involves replacing the worn-out
      ball and socket shoulder joint with prosthetic components. TSA is performed today with high
      success rates, however, complication rates associated with TSA remain prevalent, particularly
      when the arthritis is associated with bone erosion on the glenoid (socket).

      Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) is an alternative surgical procedure commonly used and
      involves replacing and reversing the ball and the socket (i.e. opposite of TSA). RSA is
      typically performed in patients with a rotator cuff deficiency and more severe OA. Though RSA
      procedures show marked increase in clinical and functional outcomes, evidence of its
      long-term results are sparse, and as such is typically reserved for when treating an older
      patient population.

      Few research studies have compared these different surgical techniques to one another, in the
      older patient population.

      This research will provide surgeons with new information regarding the best treatment for
      patients with osteoarthritis of the shoulder. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will
      compare TSA and RSA procedures to determine which approach produces better functional
      outcomes and quality of life outcomes for patients with shoulder osteoarthritis.

      Primary Objective: Determine the difference in disease specific quality of life between
      patients diagnosed with glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) who undergo either a TSA or RSA as
      measured by the WOOS score at 24-months post-operative.

      Secondary Objectives: i) Determine the difference in disease specific quality of life between
      patients diagnosed with a glenohumeral osteoarthritis who undergo a shoulder replacement with
      RSA or TSA as measured by the Constant score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons
      Standardized Shoulder Assessment form (ASES) and the EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L score at 24
      months post-operative as well as adverse events, and health care utilization.

      ii) To determine the survivorship of the components as measured by the degree of radiographic
      lucencies and component alignment determined by a CT scan at 1- and 5-years post-surgery.

      Clinical Relevance: Shoulder osteoarthritis results in pain and dysfunction, which negatively
      impacts quality of life. As such, determination of superior treatment approach will lead to
      significant improvement in quality of life, and cost savings through avoidance of recurrence
      and/or reoperation, as well as decreased morbidity for patients in this population.

    <measure>Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS) is a disease specific evaluation, proven to be an accurate and valid assessment of function after shoulder replacement. The WOOS is a patient-reported measure, 19-question survey. Each question is measured using a visual analog scale rated from 0-100, where higher scores mean better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system. Subjective findings (pain, activities of daily living, and working in different positions) make up a total of 35 points. Objective measurements make up the remaining 65 points.The test is divided into four sub-categories: (1) pain is measured using 4 likert levels (15 points maximum), where a higher score indicates a better outcome; activities of daily living are measured using a likert scale, where a higher number indicates better outcomes (20 points maximum); mobility is measured by an assessor, and rated using a likert scale where a higher score indicates better outcomes (40 points maximum); finally, strength is measured by an assessor where 1 point is given per 0.5kg of force (maximum 25 points), a higher score indicates better outcomes. All categories are added together, and a total score out of 100 is given (higher score indicates better outcome).</description>

    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment form (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Pain is recorded on a visual analogue scale (0-10), lower scores indicate better outcomes. There are 10 activities of daily living questions, each are recorded on a 4 level likert scale (0-3), which a higher score indicates a better outcome. The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire is a brief, easy to administer generic health status questionnaire, consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of five responses (each question rated 1-5), lower scores indicate better outcome. It also includes a visual analogue scale for recording an individual's rating of their current health-related quality of life (scale 0 to 100), where a higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Ongoing, up to 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Rates of study adverse events or serious adverse events (e.g. number of reoperations) will be monitored and recorded and compared between study groups. A higher rate of adverse events indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Health care utilization will be monitored and recorded using a questionnaire. These questions will include healthcare the patient accessed, cost of care, and medications taken during treatment. From this information, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be completed, which will adhere to the best practices for conducting and reporting of health economic evaluations.</description>

    <measure>Standard CT Scans</measure>
    <time_frame>24-Months and 60-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Radiological parameters will be examined using Computed Tomography (CT). These scans will be analyzed for abnormalities in component alignment, and evidence of lucencies or loosening. Higher incidence of loosening, or noted abnormalities will be compared between groups. A higher incidence indicates worse outcomes.</description>
