      This is an open-label dosing pilot study of 15 patients aged 18-50 years of age with
      diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      The study will consist of a screening evaluation performed within the course of 2 weeks,
      followed by an active treatment period of 28 days where treatment arm 1 will take a
      supervised dose of 300mg DXM every 14 days for 28 days, treatment arm 2 will take the FDA
      approved maximum daily ingestion for cough (60mg DXM) daily for 28 days, and treatment arm 3
      will take 1 supervised dose of 300mg DXM and 60mg for the remaining 28 days. After the active
      treatment period, subjects will be followed for 65 days with safety and psychiatric
      assessments at designated timepoints.
