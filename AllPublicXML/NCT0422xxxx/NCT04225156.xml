        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand the requirements of the trial, to provide written informed
             consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health
             information), and to comply with the trial protocol procedures (including required
             trial visits).

          2. Patients enrolled in the ARGX-113-1801 trial who completed the 24-weeks trial period.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline
             before trial medication (infusion) can be administered. Women are considered of
             childbearing potential are defined as all female patients unless they are
             postmenopausal (defined by continuous amenorrhea) for at least 1 year with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) of &gt;40 IU/L or are surgically sterilized (i.e.
             women who had a hysterectomy, both ovaries surgically removed, or have a documented
             tubal ligation or any other documented permanent female sterilization procedure
             including tubal ligation). Follicle-stimulating hormone can be used to confirm
             post-menopausal status in amenorrhoeic patients not on hormonal replacement therapy.

          4. Women of childbearing potential should use a highly effective method of contraception
             (i.e. pregnancy rate of less than 1% per year) during the trial and for 90 days after
             the last administration of the IMP. They must be on a stable regimen, for at least 1
             month, of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception
             associated with inhibition of ovulation, progestogen-only hormonal contraception
             associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine
             hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, or agree
             upon continuous abstinence from heterosexual sexual contact. Sexual abstinence is only
             allowable if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) is not acceptable.

          5. Non-sterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use effective double contraception, being a condom for
             male patients and a highly effective form of contraception for the female partner of
             childbearing (same as for female patients described in inclusion criterion 4). Male
             patients practicing true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred
             and usual lifestyle of the participant) can be included. Sterilized male patients who
             have had vasectomy with documented aspermia post procedure can be included. In
             addition, male patients are not allowed to donate sperm during this period from
             signing of informed consent form, throughout the duration of the trial, and for 90
             days after the last administration of IMP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Introduction or continuation of non-permitted medications during the ARGX-113-1801
             trial (such as anti-CD20 therapy, romiplostim, fostamatinib, monoclonal antibodies or
             Fc fusion proteins).

          2. Pregnant or lactating women, and those intending to become pregnant during the trial
             or within 90 days after the last dosing.

          3. Patients with known medical history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of
             efgartigimod.

          4. Use of any other investigational drug or participation in any other investigational
             trial.
