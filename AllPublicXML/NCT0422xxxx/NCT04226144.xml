  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      it will be conducted a randomized parallel controlled trial with patients diagnosed with
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to compare two techniques to lung recruitment and cough
      augmentation, to assess their effects on pulmonary function, global functionally, swallowing
      and ability to speech in these population.

      points in the Mini-Mental Status Exam; no barium allergies; without tracheostomy or invasive
      mechanical ventilation; no diaphragmatic pacemaker and without associated respiratory
      disease.Participants are excluded if they have pregnancy; previous kidney disease or other

    <description>The lungs are inflated as fully as possible by stacking successive breaths without expiration until the patients' maximal inspiratory capacity (MIC). The participant will be instructed to sustain the air in the lung, closing the glottis. Once the lungs are maximally inflated, the compressed air volume is released under expiratory muscle force, thus generating a cough with lung and chest wall recoil. They will perform 5-8 cycles of breath stacking per session, stacking 3-5 breaths per cycle.</description>

    <description>This group will perform the breath stacking technique in addiction with EMT. It will change the one-way valve in this group to VUP (Lumiar, Sao Paulo, Brazil) one-way valve, which allows the patients blow out the air with a counter resistance during all expiratory phase. The initial expiratory pressure will be 8 cmH2O, and could be changed at each visit according to participants' tolerance (either report easy or difficult to exhale assessed by research coordinators. The participants are encouraged to blow out the most slowly that they can do it.</description>
