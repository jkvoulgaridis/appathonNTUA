  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is exploring symptom burden, health experiences and expectations of treatment and
      survival of seriously ill haemodialysis patients and their physicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sharing and communicating information with patients is an integral part of medical care, yet
      research has shown that disparities exist between physicians and patient perceptions of
      illness severity. In renal medicine, along with many other specialties, expected prognosis
      can affect treatment offered.Thus appreciating and understanding one's prognosis can
      influence patients and relatives' expectations for treatment and guide discussions regarding
      quality of life.

      Previous work has highlighted disparities in the United States between expectations of
      survival of seriously ill haemodialysis patients and their physicians. The investigators plan
      to repeat this study within the United Kingdom, to see whether similar issues occur and to
      elucidate current practice on discussions of prognosis, symptom burden and transplant
      candidacy. The investigators hope to identify where care can be improved and to enable
      patients to better make informed decisions on treatment and goals of care.
