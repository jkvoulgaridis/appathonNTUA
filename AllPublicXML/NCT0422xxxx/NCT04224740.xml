  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial evaluating activity, safety and patients reported outcomes
      of first-line pembrolizumab plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus 5-FU for patients with
      advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma.

      The primary endpoint is overall responsa rate according to RECIST v1.1 at week 24.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma is associated with dismal survival rates and a major
      impact on the quality of life. To date, unresectable or metastatic disease is managed by
      systemic therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with good performance status.
      The median PFS and OS on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy vary between 3-4 and 7-15
      months, respectively. Chemotherapy induces objective responses in only 20-30% of penile
      cancer patients with rare complete responses and systemic treatment has not changed for
      decades. Therefore, this study's rationale is to explore the efficacy and safety of
      pembrolizumab combined with standard-of-care cisplatin(or carboplatin) plus 5-fluorouracil as
      part of the first-line therapy. Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200mg IV every three
      weeks with a maximum duration of 2 years (34 cycles-counting the combination with
      chemotherapy) in case of no progressive disease or intolerance. The investigators
      hypothesized that the combination of immunotherapy with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy may
      improve the overall response rate by RECIST v1.1 in this patient population.
