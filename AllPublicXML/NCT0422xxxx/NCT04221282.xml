  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of provoked and unprovoked seizures is known to increase with advancing age.
      Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is one of the third generation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)
      that have been developed in the last ten years with a favorable safety profile. ESL is
      approved in Europe and the USA as adjunctive or monotherapy in adults with partial-onset
      seizures. Nevertheless, retrospective data in monotherapy condition in the elderly epileptic
      population are sparse. The aim of the ZEBRE study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety
      of ESL in elderly epileptic patients (&gt; 65 years). The completion of this study will provide
      crucial information on the most appropriate ESL treatment for elderly patients suffering from
      partial seizures.

      The ZEBRE (ZEBinix® Retention rate in epilepsy in Elderly patients) study is a prospective,
      multicenter, descriptive study. ESL will be prescribed according to the usual care. Posology
      and method of administration of ESL are defined by the summary of product characteristics.

    <measure>Retention rate of ESL treatment as assessed by the number of patients that are still included in the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>at the end of the study treatment, at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The retention rate is representative of the effect of ESL since ESL will be pursued only if ESL has a sufficient efficacy without adverse effect. To evaluate the effect of ESL in elderly patients with partial-onset seizures, the retention rate will be measured after 6 months of treatment with ESL.</description>

    <description>QOLIE-10 (quality of life in epilepsy) is a quality of life questionnaire for adults with epilepsy. There are 10 questions about health and daily activities. All positive responses are lower numbers and all negative responses are higher numbers.</description>

    <description>Some patients with epilepsy also have cognitive decline. QOL-AD (quality of life in Alzheimer'disease) measure quality of life in people with severe cognitive decline. A total score of 13-52, with higher scores indicating better QoL.</description>

      <textblock>
        Elderly patients ≥ 65 years that undergo at least one seizure in the last three months and
        with no history of ESL tratment or history of epilepsy status will be screened. ESL will be
        initiated by the investigator in patients with refractory partial seizures with or without
        generalized seizures or with PGTC seizures as a first line monotherapy or adjunctive
        therapy. In case of inefficacy or toxicity the dose of ESL will be gradually titrated up to
        1 600 mg or titrated down to 600 mg, respectively.
