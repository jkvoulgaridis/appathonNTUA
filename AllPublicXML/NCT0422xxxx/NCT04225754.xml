  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the population is a reality in our society, with a strong increase in the number
      of elderly patients hospitalized for heart failure in our institutions. Heart failure in
      these patients is more present than to younger patients, with preserved ejection fraction
      form (HFpEF). Aging is responsible for the onset of senile amyloid cardiomyopathy. This
      pathology is still imperfectly understood and its link with the increase in the frequency of
      HFpEF is important. In addition, specific treatments have just shown their effectiveness. It
      is therefore urgent to better identify the prognostic predictive parameters of this
      cardiomyopathy.

      The pathophysiological involvement of the coronary microcirculation responsible for a true
      microvascular coronary disease (CMVD) has been described as predictive factor in all
      cardiomyopathies. However the implementation of preventive strategies and / or therapeutic of
      the coronary microcirculation dysfunction are limited because we lack of diagnostic tests
      available and applicable to large cohorts of patients.

      Our team INSERM U1039 Radiopharmaceutiques Biocliniques in collaboration with the laboratory
      GIPSA-lab (Grenoble Images Speech Signal Automatique), laboratory specialized in the signal
      analysis, has developed a new method of analysis allowing to measure the coronary
      microcirculation dysfunction usable in SPECT thanks to the measurement of a myocardial
      perfusion heterogeneity index (IHPM) (patented technique). The 3C registry (NCT03479580) is a
      registry studying the prevalence and cardiovascular prognosis of macro and microcirculatory
      coronary artery disease using the latest coronary evaluation techniques in patient with
      cardiomyopathy. This registry deployed on interventional cardiology centers on the Alpine Arc
      is therefore also addressed to patients with senile cardiomyopathy. The data collected will
      provide a better understanding of the factors influencing the prognosis of senile
      cardiomyopathy and the prognostic contribution of the measurement of the IHPM will be
      evaluated.
