  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, open-label, non randomized Phase I study is being conducted to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics, mass balance and metabolite profiling and identification
      after a single oral dose of 100mg of [14C]-MD1003 in 6 healthy males subjects. The
      radioactivity will be followed in the blood, urine and faeces to study MD1003 metabolism.

         20. Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (other
             than 4 g of paracetamol per day), herbal remedies, vitamin B5 or dietary supplements
             containing lipoic acid in the 14 days before IMP administration. Exceptions may apply
             on a case by case basis, if considered not to interfere with the objectives of the
             study, as determined by the PI
