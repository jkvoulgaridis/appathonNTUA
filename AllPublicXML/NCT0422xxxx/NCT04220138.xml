  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With a poor red reflex, it is difficult to see the anterior capsule and continuous
      curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) margin, sometimes resulting in decentered CCC or radial
      tearing of the anterior capsule. In addition, other complications, such as rupture of the
      posterior capsule, dropping of the lens nucleus, or zonular dialysis, can occur during
      phacoemulsification because of poor visualization of the posterior capsule. These
      complications also increase the time of surgery and may affect the results of the vitrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several surgical techniques have been used to alleviate the problem of poor lens visibility.
      fixed a chandelier illuminator on the sclera, turned off the microscope light source, and
      visualized the lens by illuminating the vitreous cavity. Furino improved anterior lens
      capsule visibility by staining it with triamcinolone acetonide. Although both techniques were
      effective, both had limitations. Vitreous chamber illumination reduces the visibility of the
      cornea and iris because of the need to turn off the microscope light. Staining the anterior
      lens capsule with triamcinolone acetonide allows for better anterior chamber visualization
      but the lenticular nucleus and cortex remain difficult to see.

      This will be a prospective interventional case series, patients with cataract and poor red
      reflex will undergo phacoemulsification assisted by anterior chamber illumination to overcome
      the problem of poor red reflex.
