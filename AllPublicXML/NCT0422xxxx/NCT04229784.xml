  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoids consist of a tissue rich in blood vessels and are present in all individuals
      inside the anus. Hemorrhoidal disease (HD) is when hemorrhoids become troublesome and cause
      symptoms such as pain, bleeding, prolapse or seepage.

      The first steps in the treatment of HD involve either drugs or instrumental gestures
      (sclerosis, ligation). In the event of failure or of a disease that is significant from the
      outset, it is possible to envisage a surgical treatment.

      The use of a radiofrequency is a new technique, already used frequently by vascular surgeons
      in the treatment of varicose veins of the lower limbs. This technique has been developed for
      radiofrequency destruction of hemorrhoidal vascular tissue.

      In France, no studies have been carried out to evaluate this new technique.

      Hemorrhoids consist of a tissue rich in blood vessels and are present in all individuals
      inside the anus (internal hemorrhoids). Hemorrhoidal disease (HD) is when hemorrhoids become
      troublesome and cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding, prolapse or seepage.

      The first steps in the treatment of HD involve either drugs or instrumental gestures
      (sclerosis, ligation). In the event of failure or of a disease that is significant from the
      outset, it is possible to envisage a surgical treatment.

      The use of a radiofrequency current (Rafaelo technique) in the treatment of hemorrhoidal
      disease is a new technique, already used frequently by vascular surgeons in the treatment of
      varicose veins of the lower limbs. This technique has been developed for radiofrequency
      destruction of hemorrhoidal vascular tissue.

      Although radiofrequency destruction of hemorrhoidal vascular tissue is already used in other
      European countries such as Poland, Germany, Belgium and Great Britain, there are very few
      studies on this minimally invasive surgical technique. This is particularly the case in
      France where no studies have been carried out to evaluate this new technique.
