      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I/II study of IBI377 in combination with
      corticosteroids as first-line treatment of subjects with Grade II to IV aGVHD. In Phase I,
      the PK, safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBI377 will be assessed in 12 subjects. In Phase
      II, the efficacy and safety will be assessed in 48 subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone 1 allo-HSCT(hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) from any donor
             (related or unrelated with any degree of HLA(human leukocyte antigen) matching) and
             any donor source (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood) for a
             hematologic malignancy or disorder. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity
             conditioning regimens are eligible.

          -  Clinically suspected Grade II to IV aGVHD as per MAGIC criteria, occurring after
             allo-HSCT and any GVHD prophylaxis regimen.

          -  Evidence of myeloid engraftment. Use of growth factor supplementation is allowed.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min measured or
             calculated by Cockroft Gault equation.

          -  Participants with evidence of relapsed primary disease, or participants who have been
             treated for relapse after the allo-HSCT was performed.

          -  Any corticosteroid therapy for indications other than GVHD at doses &gt; 1 mg/kg per day
             methylprednisolone (or prednisone equivalent) within 7 days of randomization.

          -  Severe organ dysfunction unrelated to underlying GVHD, including.

          -  Cholestatic disorders or unresolved veno-occlusive disease of the liver.

          -  Clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease.

          -  Clinically significant respiratory disease that requires mechanical ventilation
             support or 50% oxygen.

          -  Currently breast feeding.

          -  Received JAK(Janus kinase) inhibitor therapy after allo-HSCT for any indication.
             Treatment with a JAK inhibitor before allo-HSCT is permitted.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent, device, or procedure within 21 days
             (or 5 half-lives, whichever is greater) of enrollment.

          -  Any medical complications or conditions that would, in the investigator's judgment,
             interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of study drug
             and attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or
             interfere with interpretation of study data.

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications,
             excipients, or similar compounds.
