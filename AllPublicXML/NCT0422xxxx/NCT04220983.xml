  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic prostate cancer can undergo MRI-guided prostate Stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) without significant adverse events, similar to what has been
      reported for patients with localized prostate cancer. We hypothesize that prostate SBRT will
      be well-tolerated in metastatic prostate cancer patients, with quality of life outcomes
      similar to what has been reported in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.

      The MRidian ViewRay offers delivery of prostate SBRT with real-time MR guidance, which
      provides superior soft-tissue differentiation with excellent visualization of the prostate.
      This ViewRay platform offers the ideal setting for this study, that aims at precisely
      delivering prostate SBRT with a simultaneous integrated boost (when indicated) to visible
      nodules.

      In this study, we hope to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using 36.25 Gy in 5
      fractions, plus a simultaneous integrated boost (when indicated), in patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer.

    <description>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) short form questionnaire. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. Scores range from 0 to 100, lower scores indicate worse outcomes and higher EPIC scores represent better outcomes. QOL assessments will occur at baseline, 3-6 months, and at 9-12 months.</description>

    <description>The American Urological Association (AUA) has created this symptom index for understanding the severity of enlarged prostate symptoms. Scores ranging from 0-7 are considered to be mild symptoms, 8-19 are moderate and 20 - 35 are severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>Prostate SBRT has become a standard of care for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Radiation is delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles in 5 treatment sessions (fractions). Doses ranging from 35-45 Gy in 5 fractions have demonstrated good outcomes with acceptable toxicity when planning is delivered appropriately.</description>
