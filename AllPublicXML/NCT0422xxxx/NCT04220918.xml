  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some but not all children will refuse to take medicine because of its taste, which can lead
      to substantial worsening of disease, antibiotic resistance, increased health care costs, and
      even death. The investigators are systematically assessing individual variation in the taste
      of liquid clindamycin among genotyped pediatric patients in the emergency room, to determine
      whether (1) genetic variation underlies differences in taste ratings of the antibiotic; (2)
      initial taste responses, genetics, or both predict likelihood of side effects and medication
      non-adherence.

      Taste plays an integral role in whether a child accepts a medicine. Some children will like
      the taste of a given medicine and complete the full course of treatment, whereas others will
      strongly reject its taste, suffer taste-modulated side effects, or both. This study will
      systematically measure initial palatability and reactions to the first dose of an antibiotic
      (clindamycin, liquid formulation) by pediatric patients who receive a diagnosis of skin and
      soft tissue infection (SSTI) in the emergency department (ED) and who are receiving
      clindamycin as part of their standard of care treatment. Saliva will be collected from all
      patients for GWAS. Taste response, tolerance of the medication, adherence and clinical
      outcomes will be assessed. Subjects will be followed to determine if they complete the 5-day
      medication regimen (adherence) and/or experience side effects (tolerability). Because
      medication-specific side effects have patient-specific variability, the investigators will
      determine whether the child's initial taste responses, genes, or both predict subsequent side
      effects and medication adherence.
