  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax malaria is difficult to manage because even after taking medicine that kills
      the infection in the blood, it can continue to hide quietly in the liver, later re-emerging
      into the blood and causing another episode of malaria illness (relapse). This clinical trial
      aims to enroll patient with P. vivax infections and try to detect signals in blood, urine
      and/or saliva coming from the silent liver stages to help identify who could benefit from
      treatment with primaquine. It also will explore if certain factors of patients negatively
      impact primaquine efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax, the most widely distributed human malaria, has resisted control largely due
      to a relapsing hypnozoite liver stage that is clinically silent until emergence and
      replication in the blood weeks to months later. Curative treatment with primaquine is often
      not achieved due to potential toxicity in those with G6PD deficiency, poor adherence to the
      two-week course, and ineffective metabolism of primaquine in those with polymorphisms in
      cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6). Identifying those who harbor hypnozoites will allow
      for judicious use of primaquine in returning travelers/active duty personnel as well as
      targeted administration to those living in endemic areas to interrupt parasite transmission
      in the community. The trial will be conducted in patients presenting with uncomplicated P.
      vivax malaria at clinical trial sites run by Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical
      Sciences (AFRIMS) in Southeast Asia. It is designed to capture vivax patients who still
      harbor the dormant liver stage hypnozoites after treatment with a short acting oral blood
      schizonticide, and subsequently relapse during the follow-up period while staying in in
      study-provided housing to reduce risk of reinfection and surveilled daily for parasites or
      clinical signs of relapse. Longitudinal blood and urine sampling will be done to allow for
      retrospective analysis to identify biomarkers of hypnozoite infection and subsequent relapse
      using a systems biology approach. A smaller arm will be enrolled and will receive the
      short-activing schizonticide with primaquine radical cure at time of admission and followed
      similarly for relapse. All subjects will be followed for a total of 6 months in order to
      assess effectiveness of primaquine radical cure for P. vivax infections.

    <intervention_model_description>The clinical study is a two arm, randomized, open-label treatment study of Thai adults with acute infection with P. vivax. All subjects will be treated with a short acting oral antimalarial, artesunate, to eradicate P. vivax malaria from the bloodstream. Radical cure with primaquine (15 mg/ day for 14 days) to eliminate the relapsing hypnozoite of P. vivax will be given at different times, depending on this study arm. Ten healthy controls will also be enrolled for 1 day to provide baseline samples.</intervention_model_description>
