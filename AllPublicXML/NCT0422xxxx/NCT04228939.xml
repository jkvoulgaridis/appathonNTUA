  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inpatient treatment for patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) is recommended in extreme or
      severe cases after failure of outpatient treatment and is highly effective. However, a number
      of patients show symptom increase and relapse after discharge. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of a guided smartphone-based aftercare intervention following inpatient
      treatment of patients with AN to support symptom stabilization or continued improvement.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe, often chronic and life-threatening disorder. Relapse after
      treatment is common with relapse rates ranging between 9 and 52% and being highest within the
      first year following treatment particularly as early as 3 months posttreatment. Even if
      weight restoration is achieved, it is quite difficult for patients to sustain improvements
      after treatment, so aftercare and relapse prevention are essential research topics. There is
      a recent review on internet- and mobile-based aftercare and relapse prevention in mental
      disorders that concludes that there is some evidence that such interventions are feasible
      instruments for maintaining treatment gains for some mental disorders, including eating
      disorders (EDs). However, the authors claim for further high quality, large-scale trials that
      are needed to expand research fields. So, the aim of this study is to prove the efficacy of a
      guided smartphone-based aftercare intervention for inpatients with AN. Our primary hypothesis
      is that at the end of aftercare intervention (T1), the intervention group shows a
      significantly lower eating disorder symptomatology than the control group.

      Eligible patients with AN who are discharged from inpatient treatment are randomized either
      to receive a 4-month smartphone-based aftercare intervention with therapist feedback as an
      add-on element to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments include structured
      interviews as well as online questionnaires and are taken at baseline (discharge, T0), end of
      the aftercare intervention (T1) as well as 6-month follow-up (T2).

    <description>Patients randomized to IG receive a therapist-guided smartphone-based aftercare intervention for a period of 16 weeks. The patients are invited to download for free the German version of &quot;Recovery Record&quot; at the App Store (iPhone) or the Google Play Store (android) to their smartphone and to link with the aftercare therapist. After discharge, patients are asked to monitor their meals at least three times per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), that is, to produce a minimum of three logs per day over the subsequent 16 weeks. Furthermore, patients are instructed to monitor their thoughts and feelings as well as their (disordered) behaviors. The aftercare therapist also sets the patients clinical post-discharge goals and makes coping skill suggestions. Individual therapist feedback is provided in-app twice per week during the first four weeks, once per week in weeks 4-8, every other week in weeks 8-12 and once in week 16.</description>
