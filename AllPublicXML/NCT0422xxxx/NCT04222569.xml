      Assessment and comparison of three spontaneous breathing trials in five specific profiles of
      intensive care unit and perioperative patients. A physiological cross over study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is the most used organ replacement therapy in intensive care unit
      (ICU). After resolution of acute illness, separating the ventilator from the patient may be
      specially challenging. Before extubation, it is recommended to perform a spontaneous
      breathing trial (SBT) to evaluate the ability to sustain breathing with minimal or no
      support.

      The way to carry out this step of the weaning process present important variation across
      regions of the world. Two techniques are preferentially used : the T-piece trial (oxygen
      supply without positive pressure) and low pressure support ventilation (PSV) from 6 to 10
      cmH2O according to the airway humidification device.

      The best strategy for successful weaning remains unknow, especially about specific subgroups
      of respiratory and neurological diseases.

      Our aim is to assess which spontaneous breathing trial would best reproduce post-extubation
      inspiratory effort. We compare T-piece trial, PSV 7 cmH2O without positive end expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) and PSV 0 cmH2O without PEEP. Five specific profiles are evaluated : chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe brain injury, blunt thoracic trauma, post
      abdominal surgery and miscellaneous.

      The hypothesis is that T-piece trial and PSV 0 CPAP 0 trial are the best for mimic
      inspiratory effort after extubation. However, we could highlight various results according to
      different subgroups of ICU patients. The final aim is to determine a personalized wean trial
      for each.

    <intervention_model_description>Each patient, serving as their own control, realize three SBT for 15 minutes: T-piece, PSV 7 cmH2O without PEEP and PSV 0 cmH2O without PEEP. The order is randomized. The randomization is stratified on pathology. For avoid a carry-over effect, a wash-out period of baseline ventilation for 10 minutes will be respected between trials. The humidification device is a heated humidifier, linked to the ventilator. Data are recorded before (guarantee of real return to baseline) and after each SBT.
Then, extubation is decided by clinician in charge, in accordance with guidelines. A 30 min of resting period is respected before. Data are recorded before and 20 minutes after extubation.</intervention_model_description>
