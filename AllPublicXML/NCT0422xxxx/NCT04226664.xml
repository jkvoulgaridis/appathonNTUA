      Pilot multicentre, open-label, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 60 patients
      to demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) into an RCT of bariatric surgery versus medical weight management (MWM).

      STUDY OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of an
      RCT of bariatric surgery compared to MWM in patients with morbid obesity and high-risk CVD.
      If we can demonstrate that this trial is feasible, the next step would be to conduct a
      large-scale RCT to evaluate the efficacy of bariatric surgery for the reduction of
      cardiovascular complications in this patient population.

      STUDY AIMS:

        1. To demonstrate that enrolment of high-risk CVD patients into a bariatric surgery RCT is
           feasible.

        2. To show that it is feasible to perform bariatric surgery in &gt;80% of patients in the
           intervention arm within 30 days of randomization.

        3. To obtain preliminary information on the perioperative risks of bariatric surgery in
           patients with high-risk CVD.

      STUDY HYPOTHESES Study enrollment will be feasible at a rate of at least 1.25 patients per
      centre per month. Timely delivery of the intervention is possible, with &gt;80% of patients
      undergoing bariatric surgery within 30 days of randomization. The rate of crossover between
      the control and intervention arms will be low at &lt;2.5% per year. 30-day mortality rates in
      the intervention group will be comparable to that of an age and gender matched cohort without
      CVD who had bariatric surgery at the 2 study sites during the study period.

      DESIGN The present study is a multicentre, open-label, parallel-arm feasibility RCT with
      blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE design) of bariatric surgery compared to MWM in patients
      with morbid obesity and high-risk CVD.

      Individuals who meet study eligibility criteria will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to
      bariatric surgery (intervention arm) or MWM (control arm). Bariatric surgery will consist of
      laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, performed at the discretion of
      the surgeon and according to local standards.

    <description>Excess weight loss is a standard outcome measure in obesity research. It is calculated as the percentage of excess body weight lost after surgery. Excess body weight (kg) is calculated as current weight (kg) minus ideal body weight (kg) for a given height. Ideal body weight (kg) is taken from standardized tables.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 is a measure of health-related quality-of-life. It includes eight health domains: physical functioning (10 items), bodily pain (2 items), role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), role limitations due to personal or emotional problems (4 items), emotional well-being (5 items), social functioning (2 items), energy/fatigue (4 items), and general health perceptions (5 items). Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score defining a more favorable health state.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for measuring health status, which includes a descriptive system asking about 5 health dimensions as well as an evaluation of overall health status with a visual analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels from which respondents choose one response: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The visual analogue scale asks individuals to mark their health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. Zero corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and 100 corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bariatric surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>Although there may be slight variation by centre, Gastric Bypass generally involves creation of a 30-50 cc stomach pouch, which is anastamosed with a Roux limb of jejunum 75-100 cm in length and a biliary limb of 20-30 cm in length. The operation creates a small gastric pouch, with nutrients bypassing the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Sleeve Gastrectomy involves decreasing the size of the stomach to approximately 15% of its original size by resecting a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature.</description>
