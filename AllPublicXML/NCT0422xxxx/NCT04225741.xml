      BACKGROUND: Breast cancer worries are important determinants in relation to behavior favoring
      breast cancer screening.

      OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of theory-based training to promote breast cancer
      screening among women with high and low levels of breast cancer worries.

      DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled trial, conducted in two family health centers.

      METHODS: In total, 285 women were recruited. Women with low levels of breast cancer worries
      were included in the first intervention group (112 women) and the first control group (112
      women), while women with high levels of breast cancer worries were included in the second
      intervention group (37 women) and the second control group (43 women). Theory-based training
      to promote breast cancer screening was given to intervention groups. The women's willingness
      to undergo breast cancer screening and breast cancer worry scores were evaluated at 1, 3 and
      6 months.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the most common cause of cancer death
      among gynecological cancers. One in every four women with cancer in the world has breast
      cancer. The International Cancer Agency reported that there were around 2,088,849 new cases
      and 626,679 deaths due to breast cancer worldwide in 2018. The incidence of breast cancer is
      higher in developed countries than in developing countries, but the numbers of deaths due to
      breast cancer are lower in developed countries than in developing countries.

      It is known that breast self-examination, clinical breast examination and mammography play an
      important role in making an early diagnosis of breast cancer. The uptake rate for mammography
      performed on a regular basis is low because this is an expensive method, considering that not
      all individuals have health insurance and public funding is inadequate, especially in
      developing countries. Hence, breast self-examination (which has no cost) and clinical breast
      examination (which only has low cost) remain important diagnostic methods. Moreover, during
      clinical breast examination, healthcare professionals have the opportunity to advise on
      breast cancer, risk factors, prevention methods and screening methods.

    <description>Breast Cancer Worry Scale: Lerman et al. developed this three-item scale to measure breast cancer worry levels and their effect on daily activities and mood. Lerman subsequently modified the scale, such that it was extended from breast cancer to general cancer and its number of questions was increased to six. Lerman's six-item cancer worry scale was then modified by Timur Taşhan et al. to measure breast cancer worries alone, and a Turkish validity and reliability study on the BCWS was conducted. Thus, overall, the lowest score that can be obtained is 0, and the highest is 24. A total score of less than 12 denotes a low level of worry regarding cancer, and a total score ≥ 12 indicates a high level of worry.</description>
