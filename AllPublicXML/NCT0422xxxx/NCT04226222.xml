  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Triple Negative&quot; breast cancers are a heterogeneous group characterized by the absence of
      hormone receptors to estrogen, progesterone and the absence of expression or amplification of
      the HER-2 gene. This type of cancer is associated with an adverse clinical profile with a
      high risk of early metastatic relapse. Accurate identification of prognostic factors, as well
      as predictors of therapeutic response, and the contribution of targeted therapies are avenues
      for improving the management and survival of patients with these cancers. Such an approach
      requires optimal biological characterization, allowing us to understand the complexity of
      this group of tumors, and requires multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical trials
      involving anatomopathology, oncology and morpho-functional imaging.

      The investigator's goal is to characterize by innovative methods (anatomo-pathological in
      particular Of Immunohistochemistry, and morpho-functional imaging (TEP-TDM FDG)
      semi-quantitative and texture) in a population of Triple Negative Breast Cancer scans better
      knowledge of this entity that can lead to the development of relevant therapeutic strategies
      and especially more adapted in the context of precision and personalized medicine.

      120 consecutive patients with &quot;Triple Negative&quot; breast cancers operatable from the outset
      will be included in the study

        -  To assess the prognostic value of the texture parameters of PET-TDM FDG on event-free
           survival at 2 years.

        -  To assess the prognostic value of standard parameters (clinical, standard histology,
           conventional imaging), semi-quantitative PET-TDM FDG and innovative
           Immuno-histochemistry parameters for 2-year event-free survival .

        -  To assess correlations between continuous PET-TDM FDG texture parameters and
           Immuno-histochemistry.

        -  To assess the multivariate prognostic value of standard parameters, PET-TDM FDG imaging
           parameters and Immuno-histochemistry defined as relevant to 2-year event-free survival .

        -  Construction of an optimal prognostic nomogram combining independent parameters to
           isolate different prognostic subgroups.
