      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of game-based training and aerobic
      exercise training on game addiction level, functional performance and exercise capacity in
      individuals with internet play disorder. In addition, the investigators think that facilitate
      the transition to exercise by using game-based training in order to gain exercise habit and
      reduce sedentary behaviours in individuals with internet gaming disorder.
