  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to perform a first-in-humans trial of a fully integrated,
      automated, closed-loop blood glucose control system designed for inpatient use. The GlucoSTAT
      was designed for use by patients with diabetes while they are in the hospital, and others who
      may develop high blood sugar as a result of their medical problems.

      Our envisioned end product is an in-patient automated closed-loop control system for PG
      regulation in the ICU as well as on the general hospital wards. In order to qualify the
      system for the broad spectrum of challenges it will face in the inpatient setting, we intend
      to test the ability of the new integrated configuration GlucoSTAT of the system to control PG
      in subjects with extremes of insulin sensitivity. Our first goal of this study is to test the
      safety and efficacy of the control system in insulin sensitive subjects with type 1 diabetes.
      The second goal of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the control system in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes and substantial insulin resistance (TDD &gt; 0.75 u/kg/day, with
      up to 3 subjects with a TDD &gt; 2 u/kg/day).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Type 1 diabetes:

          1. Age 18 years or older with clinical type 1 diabetes for at least one year.

          2. Diabetes currently managed using an insulin infusion pump and rapid- or
             very-rapid-acting insulins including insulin aspart (NovoLog or Fiasp), insulin lispro
             (Humalog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra).

          3. Total daily dose (TDD) of insulin that is ≤ 1 U/kg

          4. Prescription medication regimen stable for at least 1 month.

          5. Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.

        Type 2 diabetes:

          1. Age 18 years or older with clinical type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year.

          2. Diabetes currently managed using NPH as the basal insulin, which may be supplemented
             with regular or rapid-acting insulin and/or other anti-diabetic drugs.

          3. Total daily dose (TDD) of insulin that is &gt; 0.75 u/kg
