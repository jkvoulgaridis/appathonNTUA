  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Known risk factors inducing squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck are tabacco and
      alcohol intake. However, the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) related oropharyngeal
      carcinomas is increasing. It is known that HPV+ and HPV- tumors have a different reaction to
      (chemo)radiotherapy. The exact mechanisms underlying these differences is not yet known but
      might be caused by changes in vascularity. Therefore the vasculature is imaged with the help
      of a study specific Gallium-68-DOTA-(RGD)2 PET/CT scan and a CT perfusion scan.

    <textblock>
      The incidence of Human Papilloma Virus positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal Head and Neck Squamous
      Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is rising and it has become evident that this type of cancer
      represents a subgroup of HNSCC that is characterized by a more favourable prognosis, mediated
      by a distinct tumour microenvironment, compared to patients with HPV negative (HPV-) tumours.
      However, the exact mechanisms underlying this improved treatment outcome and the potential
      role of the tumour microenvironment are not fully understood yet. Imaging of αvβ3 integrin
      expression will obtain more insight in the differences in tumour microenvironment between
      HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal HNSCC. CT perfusion provides additional characterisation of this
      tumour microenvironment. Therefore, these techniques may have the potential to predict
      response to treatment and might possibly steer treatment decisions in future clinical trials.
