  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the daily pain level scores for patients taking
      opioids alone for pain relief, compared with those treated by multimodal analgesia with three
      medications: pregabalin, naproxen, and acetaminophen, with the ability to switch over to
      opioid medications if needed. In addition to pain level scores, this study will compare
      opioid use (length of time and doses taken), quality of life, admissions to hospital, feeding
      tube requirements, weight loss, and treatment interruptions between these two analgesic
      regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients undergoing radiotherapy alone or chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy together for their head and neck cancer experience mucositis, which is severe
      pain in the mouth and throat caused by radiation treatment. Patients often enter a cycle of
      pain, difficulty swallowing, malnourishment, and reduced quality of life. This may translate
      into decreased oral intake requiring a feeding tube, and radiation or chemotherapy treatment
      breaks, which reduce the chance of tumour control and cure.

      Currently, opioid therapy is the cornerstone of head and neck cancer pain management.
      Although effective for pain relief, opioids can have side effects.

      As an alternative to opioid treatments, &quot;multimodal analgesia&quot; is a treatment using
      medications from different classes with different mechanisms of action. Examples of analgesic
      medications used for multimodal analgesia include medications similar to acetaminophen or
      ibuprofen, and others.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare pain level scores of patients taking opioids
      versus patients taking multimodal analgesia.
