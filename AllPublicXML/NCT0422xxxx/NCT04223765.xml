    <textblock>
      This study will combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective
      treatment. The treatment tested in this study uses modified T-cells called Autologous T
      Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor (ATLCAR) cells targeted against the kappa light chain
      antibody on cancer cells. For this study, the anti-kappa light chain antibody has been
      changed so instead of floating free in the blood, a part of it is now joined to the T cells.
      Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells.
      When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way, it is called a chimeric receptor. The
      kappa light chain chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells are called ATLCAR.κ.28
      cells. These cells may be able to destroy lymphoma cancer cells. They do not, however, last
      very long in the body so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.

      Previous studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells to increase their ability
      to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical
      structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e.,
      eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an
      antibody called an anti-kappa light chain. This anti-kappa light chain antibody usually
      floats around in the blood. The antibody can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma
      cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called kappa light chains.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the ATLCAR.κ.28 cells is safe and
      tolerable and learn more about the side effects and how effective these cells are in fighting
      lymphoma. Initially, the study doctors will test different doses of the ATLCAR.κ.28, to see
      which dose is safer for use in lymphoma patients. Once a safe dose is identified, the study
      team will administer this dose to more patients, to learn about how these cells affect
      lymphoma cancer cells and identify other side effects they might have on the body.

      This is the first time ATLCAR.κ.28 cells are given to patients with lymphoma. The Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA), has not approved giving ATLCAR.κ.28 as treatment for lymphoma.
      This is the first step in determining whether giving ATLCAR.κ.28 to others with lymphoma in
      the future will help them.

      This study is a single center, open-label phase 1 clinical trial designed to determine the
      safety of escalating doses of autologous activated T lymphocytes (ATLs) expressing the
      chimeric antigen receptor specific for the kappa-light chain of human immunoglobulins (CAR.κ)
      in subjects with relapsed/refractory kappa-positive (κ+) mantle cell and indolent non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas (NHL). During dose finding, up to 12 subjects will receive a single infusion of ATL
      product expressing the CAR.κ encoding the CD28 co-stimulatory endodomain (CAR.κ.28). The
      starting dose will be 5.0 × 105 cells/kg. Up to 3 dose levels of CAR.κ.28 cells will be
      tested with at least 3 subjects enrolled in each dose cohort before dose escalation is
      considered based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Prior to receiving the
      cell product, subjects will undergo lymphodepletion with fludarabine and bendamustine or
      cyclophophamide. Dose escalation will be guided by the modified 3+3 design. Any dose level
      may be expanded to 4-9 subjects to obtain more data at that dose or to include subjects for
      which insufficient cells are manufactured to enroll on their assigned higher dose level. If
      due to the expansion the estimated DLT rate at a dose is ≥0.33, the study would not escalate
      to the next highest dose level and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) would be exceeded. If
      needed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the RP2D to further assess safety
      and efficacy of CAR.κ.28 cells. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of progression free
      survival (PFS), response rate (RR), duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS). The
      persistence of CAR.κ.28 cells in the peripheral blood will be assessed as an exploratory
      objective. The final RP2D including expansion data will be the dose with the DLT rate closest
      to 0.2.

      The adoptive transfer of T cells targeting the kappa light chain (CAR.κ) is a promising
      treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory κ + NHL and has shown encouraging preclinical
      activity [37]. The CD8α stalk incorporated into CD28 signaling domain within the CAR, may
      improve the persistence of the CAR.κ T cells. Therefore, subjects in this study are being
      infused with this newly modified version of CAR.κ.28 so that persistence and efficacy will be
      improved compared to the older version of the CAR.κ molecule.

      We hypothesize that CAR.κ.28 will be well tolerated in subjects with relapsed/refractory
      indolent and aggressive lymphomas positive for the kappa light chain and will show efficacy.
      We also anticipate that CAR.κ.28 will show fast expansion in the peripheral blood in the
      first 2 - 3 weeks, but also longer term persistence than the previous version of CAR.κ.28.

      In this phase 1 single center study, peripheral blood will be collected for production of
      CAR.κ.28 cells prior to conditioning chemotherapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory κ+
      indolent lymphoma including follicular lymphoma grade 1-3b, splenic marginal zone lymphoma,
      extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, nodal marginal zone
      lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. During the approximately 1-2 months necessary for CAR-T
      cell production, subjects may undergo standard of care treatment (&quot;bridging therapy&quot;) per
      physician's discretion. Subjects must sign consent forms before cells are procured and again
      prior to undergoing lymphodepleting chemotherapy and cellular treatment. At 2-14 days
      (preferably 2-4 days) after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine, we will infuse
      the CAR.κ.28 cell product. Subjects in this study will receive CAR.κ.28 cell product in one
      of the three planned dose escalation cohorts. Dose levels of CAR.κ.28 cells administered will
      range between 5.0 × 105 cells/kg and 2 × 106 cells/kg. These doses have been evaluated in
      previous phase 1 studies of CAR-T cell lymphocytes [37-39] including a phase 1 trial
      targeting the kappa light chain on malignant B cells in which the construct included the CD28
      co-stimulatory endodomain [37]. An expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects at the RP2D
      to further assess safety and efficacy of CAR.κ.28 cells. In all subjects, we will measure the
      persistence of CAR.κ.28 cells in the peripheral blood at different time points by measuring
      the level of the transgene and by phenotypic analyses.

      OUTLINE

      Cell Procurement Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained
      from subjects for cell procurement. In subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count in the
      peripheral blood, a leukapheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The
      parameters for apheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes.

      Lymphodepleting Regimen Subjects will receive a &quot;pre-conditioning&quot; cytoreductive regimen of
      bendamustine 70 mg/m2/day administered IV followed by fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered
      IV over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines.
      Prophylaxis (e.g., hydration, antiemetics, etc.) needed prior to fludarabine and bendamustine
      chemotherapy will be provided per institutional guidelines. At the discretion of the clinical
      investigator, subjects with a known history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered
      for lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day administered IV followed by an IV
      dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be
      administered per institutional guidelines.

      Cell Administration The cellular product consisting of CAR.κ.28 cells will be administered by
      a licensed healthcare provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5
      - 10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line. The volume of infusion will
      depend upon the concentration of the cells when frozen and the size of the subject. The
      expected volume will be 1-50cc.

      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will
      receive CAR.κ.28 cells within 2 - 14 days, but preferably within 2-4 days, after completing
      the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen.

      During dose finding, a single dose of CAR.κ.28 will be given after lymphodepletion. The cell
      dose levels that will be evaluated are outlined below.

      Expansion Cohort, CAR.κ.28 will be given after lymphodepletion. Subjects will receive the
      RP2D.

      Duration of Therapy

      Therapy in LCCC1811-ATL involves a single cell infusion of ATLCAR cells. Treatment with at
      least one infusion will be administered unless:

        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or

        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Duration of Follow-up Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for RCR evaluation or
      until death, whichever occurs first. In addition to this follow-up, subjects removed from
      study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or
      stabilization of the adverse event.

      Subjects who experience unequivocal disease progression and start alternate therapy after
      receiving a cell infusion still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.

                    -  Platelets &gt;75 × 109/L (independent of transfusion within 7 days of
                       lymphodepletion)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5× ULN (subjects with Gilbert's syndrome may be enrolled
                  despite a total bilirubin level &gt;1.5 mg/dL if their conjugated bilirubin is &lt;1.5×
                  ULN)

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 5× ULN

               -  Pulse oximetry of &gt; 90% on room air

               -  Creatinine &lt;1.5x ULN or Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;60 mL/min per Cockcroft and
                  Gault (see Appendix F),

          4. If subjects display any clinical signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction after
             receiving bridging chemotherapy, they will undergo repeat ECG and ECHO to reassess
             their cardiac function and status

          5. In female subjects of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within
             72 hours prior to lymphodepletion or documentation that the subject is post-menopausal
             or has been surgically sterilized. Post-menopausal status must be confirmed with
             documentation of absence of menses for &gt; 1 year.

          6. Subjects must have autologous transduced activated T-cells that meet the Certificate
             of Analysis (CofA) acceptance criteria.

          7. Has not received any investigational agents or received any tumor vaccines within the
             previous six weeks prior to lymphodepletion.

          8. Has not received chemotherapy or immunotherapy within the previous 3 weeks prior to
             lymphodepletion.

          9. Subjects may not be receiving strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine,
             ciprofloxacin) up through 72 hours after the last dose of bendamustine, as these may
             increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine, and decrease plasma concentrations of
             its metabolites. See http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ for an updated list of
             strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (additionally, see Appendix H).

         10. Subject is not taking a prohibited or contraindicated medication listed in Section
             5.12 and Appendix H prior to lymphodepletion. Contraindicated medications should be
             discontinued at least two weeks prior to the scheduled lymphodepletion or by at least
             5 half-lives of the contraindicated medication, whichever is shorter.

         11. No evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.

        Eligibility criteria to be met prior to cell infusion after lymphodepletion:

          1. No evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.

          2. Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:

               1. Total bilirubin ≤2 × ULN, unless attributed to Gilbert's syndrome

               2. AST &lt; 5 × ULN

               3. ALT &lt; 5 × ULN

               4. Creatinine ≤ 1.53 × ULN or or Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;60 mL/min per
                  Cockcroft and Gault (see Appendix F)

          3. Subject has no clinical indication of rapidly progressing disease in the opinion of
             the clinical investigator.

          4. Subject is a good candidate for treatment with CAR.κ.28 cell product per the clinical
             investigator's discretion.
