  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effect of early exoskeletal-assisted
      walking (EAW) training (combined into regular acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR)) on
      improving functional recovery and reducing pain and inflammation. Powered exoskeletons are a
      technology that offer standing and walking for certain persons with spinal cord injury (SCI)
      who meet the using indication of the device and have been used in the chronic SCI population
      with positive benefits in ability to move, daily function (such as bathing and dressing),
      body composition (such as lean and fat tissue mass), and quality of life (QOL). Despite the
      potential for EAW to promote functional recovery and reduce secondary medical complications
      (such as urinary tract infections and pain), no reports exist on the use of exoskeletons in
      AIR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injury (SCI) can have an abrupt loss of upright mobility, function
      and physical activity. Inflammation and pain are reported to be increased, with negative
      impacts on quality of life. Powered exoskeletons are a technology that offer standing and
      walking for eligible persons with SCI and have predominantly been used in the chronic SCI
      population with positive benefits in mobility, function, body composition, and quality of
      life (QOL). Despite the potential for exoskeletal-assisted walking (EAW) to promote
      functional recovery and mitigate secondary medical complications, no reports exist on the use
      of exoskeletons in acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR). The goal of this study is to test
      the effect of early EAW training (incorporated into regular AIR) on accelerating functional
      recovery and reducing pain and inflammation. A total of 30 people with non-progressive SCI
      (≥18 years; &lt;6 months after SCI), who are clinically eligible for gait training during AIR,
      will be randomly assigned into one of two groups (15 participants/group, stratified evenly
      for traumatic and non-traumatic SCI). The intervention group will receive gait training with
      an Ekso powered exoskeleton, incorporated into usual 3-hour AIR (AIR with EAW group). The
      control group will have usual 3-hour AIR, but without using an exoskeleton (AIR only group).
      Motor function, functional activities, pain and inflammation will be assessed after
      enrollment in the study and before discharge from AIR. The intervention group is expected to
      have significantly better outcomes compared with the control group. The impact of successful
      completion of this study would increase knowledge of the effect of using EAW during
      acute/subacute AIR. The expected outcome of this study is that exoskeletal-assisted walking
      during AIR will have significantly greater effects on mitigating some of the secondary
      consequences of paralysis from SCI during the early phases of recovery and rehabilitation.

    <intervention_model_description>A two-group, single blinded (raters are not part of intervention) and randomized clinical trial (RCT) with stratification for traumatic or non-traumatic injury will be performed. A total of 30 people with non-progressive SCI, who are over 18 years and eligible for locomotor training as part of acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) will be randomized. We expect to recruit, consent, and screen 40 people to accommodate a 25% drop-out rate due to unpredictability during inpatient stay for a target sample of 30 participants to complete the protocol. Eligible participants will be randomized into either the intervention group or the control group. Each group will have 15 participants stratified for 7 having traumatic and 8 having non-traumatic etiologies</intervention_model_description>
