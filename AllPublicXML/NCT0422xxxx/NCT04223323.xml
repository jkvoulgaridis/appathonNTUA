      The proposed work will investigate the effect of almond consumption as a snack on human
      gastrointestinal microbiota and on metabolic health.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel arm design with two
      treatment conditions. There will be a phone screening, in person pre-intervention testing, a
      one-week baseline period devoid of all nuts and seeds followed by a 12-week intervention
      period, and a post-testing appointment. Participants will be randomized to consume almonds or
      isocaloric snack for 12 weeks. Participants will provide stool samples during baseline
      testing and during the 12th week of the intervention.
