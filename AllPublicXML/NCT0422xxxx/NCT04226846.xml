  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, prospective, within-subject comparison of the Bios device
      readings versus venous blood sample glucose readings, glucose readings from a Dexcom CGM and
      an SMBG device in subjects previously diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the glucose measurements collected by the Bios device to glucose values measured with a blood glucose lab analyzer (e.g., YSI), glucose values obtained with a self-monitoring blood glucose device (SMBG) and readings from the Dexcom System in subjects previously diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</description>

          2. Subject has had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus either Type I or Type II;

          3. For insulin-using subjects only: subject will not inject insulin or wear an insulin
             pump insertion set within a 10 cm distance of any Bios device;

          4. Subject able to wear multiple CGM devices simultaneously;

          5. Subject is either a patient diagnosed with Type I diabetes mellitus currently wearing
             a Dexcom CGM device or a patient diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus who will
             agree to use a Dexcom CGM device during participation in the study. There are no
             restrictions on the model of the Dexcom CGM device.

          7. Subject has a smart device that complies with the requirements listed in Attachment 1
             of this protocol and is willing to download and run the GraphWear Patient application
             on their device;

          8. Subject is able to read and understand the Informed Consent Form and has voluntarily
             provided written informed consent;

          9. In the Principal Investigator's opinion, subject is able to be compliant with

             the study protocol;

          2. Subject has any of the following:

               -  a skin condition that precludes wearing of the device;

               -  a known allergy that precludes wearing of the device;

               -  tattoos or other skin alterations that may interfere with device placement and/or
                  operation;

          3. History of substance abuse within 6 months of study start;

          4. Use of any illicit drugs during the duration of the study period;
