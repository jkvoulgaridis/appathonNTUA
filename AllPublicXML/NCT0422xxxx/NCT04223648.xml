      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of mobilizing
      programmed cell death (PD-1)+ T cells to the peripheral blood after a single treatment with
      tremelimumab/durvalumab in patients with treatment naïve metastatic melanoma.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of administering a
      regimen of PD-1+ selected tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)/(Interleukin) IL-2, using a
      cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories and assess for
      clinical activities in subjects with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have
      progressed after receiving first-line therapy with 1 cycle of tremelimumab/durvalumab
      followed by 3 cycles of ipilimumab/nivolumab followed by nivolumab monotherapy as maintenance
      treatment.

      Exploratory objective are to:

        1. assess the number of PD-1+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment before and after a
           single treatment with tremelimumab/durvalumab.

        2. conduct a preliminary assessment of the TCR clonotypes present in PD1+ cluster of
           differentiation 8 (CD8)+ cells (4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1) versus PD1-CD8+ T-cells early
           in the expansion cultures and compare to clonotypes late in the final product and in
           peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) 1 and 2 months post infusion.

        3. assess neoantigens present in resected tumor and correlate T cell specificity for
           neoantigens from TIL and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations stratified
           by PD-1 expression in these cell populations.
