  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disease age related caused by neurofibrillary
      tangles misfolding and Beta-amyloid protein accumulation. In the last decade several findings
      showed the role of biophenols present in diary intake such as extra virgin olive oil as
      potential antagonist of neurodegeneration. Two population studies (The Seven Countries Study
      and Three-City-Study) and four clinical trials (PREDIMED, PREDIMED - NAVARRA, ACTRIN and
      ISRCTN) have already suggested that mediterranean diet or other diets supplemented with extra
      virgin olive oil could improve cerebral performance.

    <textblock>
      24 MCI or Alzheimer's Disease patients will be recruited and randomised; 12 of them will
      receive extra virgin olive oil &quot;coratina&quot; (EVOO-C); 12 of them will receive biophenol low
      dose olive oil (ROO). Each patient will consume a total amount of 10 mg olive oil in a year
      (12 months). Clinical assessement will be based on:

        -  neurological examination (T0, T6, T12);

        -  cardiological examination (T0, T12): a supra-aortic vessels and brachial artery
           ecocolordoppler will be performed;

        -  ophthalmological evaluation (T0, T12): a optic coherence tomography will be performed;

        -  neuropsychological assessment (T0, T12);

        -  nutritional assessement(T0, T3, T6, T9, T12).

      Each subject will perform:

        -  brain MRI (T0, T12);

        -  Beta Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (T0, T12) A lumbar puncture will be ruled as
           well (T0) and markers of neurodegeneration (Beta-amyloid 1 - 42, total tau protein,
           fosfo-tau, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurofilament (NFL) will be
           quantified); Renal, hepatic and nutritional status will be assessed 3 times in 12 months
           (T0, T6, T12).
