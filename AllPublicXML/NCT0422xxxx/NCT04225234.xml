    <textblock>
      The proposed study &quot;Sustaining the Reach of a Scalable Weight Loss Intervention through
      Financial Incentives: an Exploratory Randomized Trial&quot; seeks to assess how the use of
      different incentive strategies may reduce the initial attrition gap when implementing weight
      management in a primary care clinic predominantly serving African American patients through
      an innovative research-practice partnership involving primary care, research expertise, and a
      small business. The sample will include approximately 200 persons ages 19+ from Nebraska
      Medicine or the greater Omaha community. The inclusion criteria are (1) age 19+ years; (2)
      are obese (BMI &gt;=30) or overweight (BMI &gt;=25 yet smaller than 30); (3) have internet access.

      Following the completion of an automated informed consent embedded within the program
      registration using a kiosk placed at the Fontenelle Clinic, we plan to conduct a 4-arm,
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will randomly assign overweight/obese
      patients at the Nebraska Medicine Fontenelle clinic to one of four financial incentive
      conditions respectively tied to: weight loss, weigh-ins, weigh-ins and weight-loss, and
      incentive choice, following the completion of an automated informed consent embedded within
      the program registration and initial weigh-in. Participants will be followed for 3 and 6
      months to assess program reach, sustaining the reach after initial weigh-in, and weight loss
      outcomes based on records on participant enrollment and subsequent weigh-ins automatically
      collected through a kiosk placed at the Fontenelle clinic.

    <description>Depending on their level of participation or weight loss outcomes, participants will have the opportunity to receive between $60-$120 (over 12 months), on average, regardless of program assignment.
Regardless of which incentive program that participants are randomized to, they will receive the incentaHEALTH weight loss program intervention. incentaHEALTH is an technology-supported multi-component coaching intervention for weight loss includes a website, objective weight assessment using HIPAA-compliant kiosks, daily social cognitive theory-based email and text message support, and online access to health coaches. The intervention encourages increased intake of fruit, vegetables, lean protein, and complex carbohydrates while monitoring portion sizes.</description>
