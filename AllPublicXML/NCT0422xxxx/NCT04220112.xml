  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the purposed research is to extend prior work (STUDY00003758: Real-time fMRI
      Neurofeedback to Alter Limbic Disturbances in Anorexia Nervosa) on real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI)
      neurofeedback (focused on amygdala down-regulation) as an innovative neurocircuitry-targeted
      intervention for anorexia nervosa (AN). This project will include randomization to rt-fMRI or
      a sham controlled group to answer the following important unresolved question: Does a
      patient-led procedure aimed at altering brain activity impact limbic circuit function and key
      eating disorder and psychiatric symptoms in AN above the effect of a matched, but
      non-targeted sham condition?

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1: Establish that rt-fMRI neurofeedback of limbic activity can correct neural
      disturbances in AN. Hypothesis 1: Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback
      group will show reduced amygdala activation to aversive images, which will increase with
      repeated training. This effect will generalize to non-neurofeedback test runs. Hypothesis 2:
      Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback group will exhibit enhanced task and
      resting amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity, which will increase with repeated
      training. Enhanced amygdala-PFC connectivity will be associated with less amygdala reactivity
      to aversive images during the emotion regulation task.

      Aim 2: Identify the impact of rt-fMRI neurofeedback targeting limbic functioning on symptoms
      of AN. Hypothesis 1: Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback group will
      exhibit improvements in self-reported emotion regulation and eating disorder symptoms over
      the study visits. Hypothesis 2: Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback group
      will engage in less restrictive eating (i.e., will consume more calories) at a post-training
      test meal. Hypothesis 3: Across groups, decreased aversive amygdala reactivity and enhanced
      amygdala-PFC connectivity will predict reduced emotion dysregulation and eating disorder
      symptoms, and less restriction.

    <description>CHEDS is a 35-item self-report measure designed to assess eating disorder symptom changes over a short-term (i.e. weekly) time span. Items are presented using a Likert response format in which symptoms are rated from 0 (never) to 4 (always) during the past week. Total score is a sum of the 35 item scores.</description>
