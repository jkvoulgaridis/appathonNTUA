  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good glycemic control in individuals with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), has been proven to reduce
      the risk of diabetes-related complications. Despite technological advances such as the use of
      insulin delivery devices and continuous glucose monitoring, the average glycemic control in
      T1D is poor. Though dietary management plays a major role in the overall management of T1D,
      and it is often classified as the most challenging aspect of treatment, the 2019 Standards of
      Medical Care in Diabetes for children and adolescents do not clearly address dietary
      management. As carbohydrate is the macronutrient with the greatest impact on blood glucose,
      it is reasonable to suggest that carbohydrate reduction will minimize postprandial glucose
      excursions and improve diabetes control. For this reason, low carbohydrate diets (LCD) have
      gained popularity, and observational studies report positive glycemic outcomes. However, to
      date, scientific evidence from randomized trials on the impact of LCD in children with T1D is
      lacking. Thus, the over-arching goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and
      safety of a low carbohydrate diet in children with T1D, and as an exploratory aim, we will
      evaluate the efficacy of LCD on glycemic control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study 40 subjects ages 5-11 with T1D to evaluate the feasibility of
      LCD. Participants will be asked to attend a total of 5 visits (4 in person and 1 phone visit)
      during the 6 month-duration of the study. Participants will be randomized to an intervention
      group with a LCD (50% of carbohydrate recommended daily allowance) vs. the standard diet.

      During the screening visit, participants will be assessed by a dietitian to categorize their
      existing dietary regimen before randomization to either the LCD or the standard diet. In
      addition, participant's insulin regimen (either pump settings or multiple dose insulin
      injection therapy) will be reviewed for insulin dose adjustments as needed over a 2
      week-period.

    <description>Using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and home glucose meter, investigators will calculate the number of hypoglycemic events (glucose values &lt;70 mg/dL but ≥ 54 mg/dL and those &lt;54 mg/dL), number of severe hypoglycemia and time spent in hypoglycemia (values &lt;70 mg/dL but ≥ 54 mg/dL and &lt;54 mg/dL).</description>

Secondary endpoints will include time of the day spent in range (values between 70-140 mg/dl and between 70 and 180mg/dl), in hypoglycemia (values &lt;70 mgl/dl but ≥ 54 mg/dl and &lt;54 mg/dl) and in hyperglycemia (values &gt;180mg/dl and &gt;250 mg/dl).</description>
