  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twelve adults with ALS will participate in a study involving four 3-week cycles of
      progressive respiratory muscle training (RMT). The investigators will measure maximum
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) weekly. The investigators
      will obtain the majority of measurements of MIP and MEP during web-based telehealth visits.
      Participants will be stratified into 2 groups based on baseline inspiratory muscle strength
      as determined by maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP): six participants with minimal to no
      respiratory weakness (i.e., MIP ≥ 70% predicted) and six participants with mild to moderate
      inspiratory weakness (i.e., MIP 40-70% predicted).

    <textblock>
      Twelve adults will participate in a single- subject A1-B-A2 study involving 4 visits to Duke
      over 24 weeks. The 6 week delayed start period (A1) will establish baseline status prior to
      initiation of RMT (B) and the follow-up period (A2) will determine detraining effects over 6
      weeks of RMT withdrawal. Participants will complete four 3-week cycles of progressive RMT
      during the B phase. The investigators will measure MIP and MEP weekly. To reduce participant
      burden and enhance our ability to obtain repeated measures, the investigators will obtain 21
      of 25 measurements of MIP and MEP during web-based telehealth visits.

      Participants will complete a full assessment during the first study visit (M1) and receive
      training/instruction for obtaining MIP and MEP measurements at home with a portable,
      battery-powered digital pressure gauge manometer (MicroRPM Pressure Meter; Micro Direct).
      They will return to Duke for the pretest visit (M7), at which time a full assessment will be
      completed and RMT will commence. During the B phase, participants will complete 12-weeks of
      moderate intensity RMT, divided into four 3-week cycles, and participate in weekly web-based
      RMT therapy visits (M8-M18). Post-test assessment (M19) will occur immediately following
      completion of the 12-week RMT regimen. The investigators will measure MIP and MEP during RMT
      withdrawal via web-based telehealth visits (M20-24). Following the fourth and final on-site
      full assessment visit (M25), participants will return all equipment and will be offered the
      opportunity to initiate a clinical RMT regimen and receive follow-up care by Speech Pathology
      during future ALS Clinic visits.

      Participants will be stratified into 2 groups based on baseline inspiratory muscle strength
      as determined by maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP): six participants with minimal to no
      respiratory weakness (i.e., MIP ≥ 70% predicted) and six participants with mild to moderate
      inspiratory weakness (i.e., MIP 40-70% predicted).

      The primary outcomes are MIP and MEP. Secondary outcomes include peak cough flow (PCF) and
      sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP). Exploratory outcomes include the Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS), Eating Assessment Tool - 10 Item (EAT-10),
      36-Item Short Form Survey (SF36), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF
      (WHOQOL-BREF), and Communicative Effectiveness Survey-Revised (CES-R). Clinical spirometry
      data will be extracted from the participant's electronic medical record if available from a
      coinciding ALS Clinic visit that occurs +/- 5 days from the assessment visit.

    <description>Safe, well-tolerated moderate intensity Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT) is defined as:
RPE between 4-5 and &lt;6
Pain rating &lt;4 on a standard 0-10 scale 0 = rest, 1 = very easy, 2 = easy, 3 = moderate, 4 = somewhat hard, 5 = hard, 6 = harder, 7 = very hard, 8/9 = extremely hard, 10 = maximal
Accuracy &gt;90% for the last 10 of 25 repetitions in a set
Behavioral observations indicate repetitions are well tolerated.</description>

    <measure>Magnitude of Change in Maximum Expiratory Pressure from Pre-test to Post-test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Magnitude of change for our primary outcome measures will be determined using Cohen's measure of effect size (d) as defined by the first equation for single-subject d provided by Busk and Serlin (1992). Simply stated, d is obtained by subtracting the mean of the first assessment from the mean of the second assessment, divided by the standard deviation of the first assessment. Effect size calculations will be determined to compare results from pre-test (M7) to post-test (M18). The investigators will use conservative interpretation guidelines for effect size calculations in which d &lt; 0.6 is negligible, d ≥ 0.6 modest, d ≥ 1.0 large, and d ≥ 2.0 very large.</description>

    <description>Magnitude of change for our primary outcome measures will be determined using Cohen's measure of effect size (d) as defined by the first equation for single-subject d provided by Busk and Serlin (1992). Simply stated, d is obtained by subtracting the mean of the first assessment from the mean of the second assessment, divided by the standard deviation of the first assessment. Effect size calculations will be determined to compare results from (M0-M5) to withdrawal (M19-M24). The investigators will use conservative interpretation guidelines for effect size calculations in which d &lt; 0.6 is negligible, d ≥ 0.6 modest, d ≥ 1.0 large, and d ≥ 2.0 very large.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks, 18 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effective peak cough flow in healthy subjects exceeds values of 360 to 400 L/min. PCF is measured at baseline, visit 7, visit 18 and visit 24. The overall change from baseline to visit 24 will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sniff Nasal Inspiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks, 18 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) consists in the measurement of pressure through an occluded nostril during sniffs performed through the contralateral nostril. SNIP is measured through a plug occluding one nostril during sniffs through the contralateral nostril. A plateau in pressure is reached after 5-10 sniffs in most individuals 1. For SNIP measurement, 10 sniffs are usually performed. The SNIP is measured at baseline, visit 7, visit 18 and visit 24. The overall change from baseline to visit 24 will be measured.</description>
