  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking unequivocally improves the course of Crohn's disease (EC), and therefore, it
      should be one of the main therapeutic targets in the treatment of this disease. The goal of
      the study was to know the effectiveness of motivational intervention 5 R for smoking
      cessation in patients with Crohn's disease performed by telephone by nursing, in relation to
      those who did not receive such intervention.

      For this purpose, a controlled, randomized, parallel and open clinical trial was designed.
      The subjects were patients with Crohn's disease that were actively smoking EC. They were all
      &gt;18 years old and they had internet access and e-mail. Those who were already in a process of
      smoking cessation were excluded from the study. Experimental intervention consisted of a
      motivational intervention for smoking cessation through telephone every 3 months for one
      year.

    <description>The motivational brief intervention is known by the acronym 5 R and lasts about 5-10 minutes. It is an approach based on the principles of motivational interviewing and develops the intervention in five short steps:
Relevance. Help patients identify why personal reasons may be relevant to quitting smoking.
Risks. Help identify what negative consequences tobacco use has.
Rewards. Help identify potential benefits of quitting smoking.
Resistors. Help patients identify barriers to smoking cessation, which can often include fear of withdrawal symptoms, failure, wainweight, face social situations, etc.
Repeat. Repeat the intervention at 3 months if you do not advance at the stage of change.</description>
