  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are being randomized to a yogic breathing or
      control condition. Participants randomized to the yogic breathing group will be asked to
      complete a 2-minute yogic breathing video 5 to 7 days per week at home for 4 weeks and
      control group participants will be asked to maintain their current activities. Participants
      in this group will be given access to the yogic breathing video at the end of the 4-week
      control period. IBS symptoms and autonomic and vascular function will be assessed at baseline
      and at the end of week 4 in both groups.
