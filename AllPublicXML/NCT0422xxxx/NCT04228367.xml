      This study is a post-market follow-up study. The data collected from this study will serve
      the purpose of confirming the safety and performance of the JuggerStitch Device used for
      meniscal repair according to the product labelling (Instruction For Use).

      This study is a post-market follow-up study to fulfil the post-market surveillance
      obligations according to Medical Device Directive and MEDDEV 2.12/2 and the Medical Devices
      Regulation (MDR 2017/745). The data collected from this study will serve the purpose of
      confirming the safety and performance of the JuggerStitch Device used for meniscal repair
      according to the product labelling (IFU).

      The objectives of the study are to calculate the overall clinical success rate and the
      performance, and confirm the safety of the JuggerStitch Meniscal Repair Device. The primary
      endpoint of this study is defined by the absence of reoperation due to meniscal tear. This
      will be measured against the success criteria of the absence of reoperation in 90.2% of the
      cases at one year.

    <measure>Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operatively, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used to evaluate the outcomes of meniscus surgery. It consists of items that measure: pain, instability, locking, swelling, limp, stair climbing, squatting, and need for support. Lowest and highest scores are 0 and 100 (better), respectively.</description>

    <measure>Tegner Activity Level Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operatively, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner Activity Level Scale aims to provide a standardized method of grading work and sporting activities and complements Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. The Scale is based on 10 levels with Level 10 being &quot;Competitive Sports&quot; and Level 0 being &quot;Sick Leave&quot;.</description>
