  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) suicide rates remain high, requiring new approaches. VHA
      patients tend to have high medical and behavioral health care needs that cause disruption in
      their lives and heighten their risk of suicide. This study will adapt and pilot test an
      intervention that expands the focus of care for VHA patients with high risk for suicide to
      building a life of self-respect, meaning, and connectedness in one's local community. The
      pilot intervention will involve receiving support and mentorship from a fellow Veteran living
      with the same challenges who has been trained in helping others manage their disabilities
      while achieving specific life goals (i.e., a 'Peer Specialist'). Results from this study will
      demonstrate the preliminary effectiveness of supplementing the VHA's current clinical
      approaches to suicide prevention with support provided by a trained Peer Specialist that
      offers empathy, hope, and practical advice that stemming from 'lived experience' of
      disability and recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have assembled a team of clinical psychologists and researchers to use
      Intervention Mapping (IM) to adapt and test PREVAIL (a non VA, peer specialist based suicide
      prevention program) as a Peer Specialist (PS)-delivered intervention to reduce suicide
      ideation in VA patients who are at high risk of suicide. Building on the investigators' work
      with PSs, suicide research, and participatory methods, the investigators will begin the IM
      process with a needs assessment that includes interviews with PSs, VHA patients, providers,
      and directors (n=12) to assess attitudes and perceptions of current clinical practices for
      high risk Veterans, PSs, and areas of possible improvement in suicide prevention. This
      information will be shared with a steering committee to begin adapting PREVAIL to patients
      with high suicide risk in VHA. Following best practices for pilot investigations and
      intervention adaptation, the investigators will recruit 12 VHA patients with unipolar or
      bipolar depression flagged for high suicide risk to participate in a &quot;pre-pilot&quot; and provide
      feedback on how the adapted intervention may be revised. After making any necessary
      modifications to the intervention, the investigators will recruit a second group of 12 high
      risk Veterans for a &quot;formal pilot&quot; to further evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      recruitment, retention, and assessment procedures for a large randomized trial. Outcome
      variables will include health care visits for suicide-related reasons and self-reported
      suicidal ideation/acts as well as several outcomes that are rehabilitative in nature, such as
      self-rated community integration; sense of hope, meaning, and purpose; and self-esteem and
      social support. The investigators aim to: Aim 1: Use Intervention Mapping to identify which
      components of PREVAIL require adaptation to reduce suicidal ideation in high risk VHA
      patients and to identify implementation strategies in the VHA system; Aim 2: Pilot test the
      feasibility and acceptability of the adapted PREVAIL, rehabilitative measures, and
      suicide-related outcomes for use in a rigorous prospective study.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will last 3-months, a time frame that overlaps with the typical duration of a VA suicide high risk flag. Meetings will be 30-45 minutes and occur primarily in the community, home, or by telephone. Session content will be rooted in Peer Specialists (PSs) offering nonjudgmental empathic support, active listening, and constructive disclosure and role modeling. A primary focus will be helping patients with flags to identify and strengthen connections with informal supports and participation in activities in their community that will enable them to feel more worthwhile as individuals and hopeful about their future.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will target Veterans with suicide flags because they are at greatest
             risk for suicide and therefore most in need of intervention

          -  Eligibility will be limited to Veterans diagnosed with unipolar or bipolar depression
             as this diagnostic group is the most prevalent in suicidal samples and is supported by
             prior meta-analyses on peer-provided interventions

          -  The investigators will ensure decision-making capacity using the Blessed Orientation,
             Memory, Concentration Test and a brief quiz about the study

          -  This quiz will involve an iterative process of querying the participants'
             understanding of consent information with a 10-item true/false test and providing
             feedback until an acceptable level of understanding is achieved (must get 100% correct
             after 3 tries to enroll)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  cognitive impairment as indicated by a Blessed score of &gt;10

          -  unable to provide voluntary, written informed consent for any reason

               -  e.g., incompetency

          -  determination by the patient's psychiatrist not to be appropriate for participation
             due to unstable psychosis, cognitive disorder, or severe personality disorder

          -  residing more than 50 miles away
