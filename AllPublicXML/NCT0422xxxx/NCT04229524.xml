  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-institution, randomize controlled trial is to be held to evaluate the correlation
      between blood supply in the gastic conduit and the incidence of anastomotic fistula during
      radical operation for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by fluorescence angiography.

    <description>Anastomotic fistula is defined as an anastomotic fistula or any anastomotic dehiscence or leakage of saliva from a neck wound, confirmed by gastroscopy or upper gastrointestinal angiography, or purulent discharge from the chest or mediastinal drainage catheter. In addition, in this study, occult fistula was not included in the anastomotic fistula group when invasive treatment was not required.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Enrolled patients will undergo thoracoscopy combined with a three-incision esophageal carcinoma radical mastectomy and two-field (chest-abdomen) lymph node dissection.Quantitative assessment of blood supply in the gastic conduit was performed using fluoroscopy before esophagogastric anastomosis.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>control group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The same surgical method as the experimental group.The only difference is that the position of the gastic conduit anastomosis is determined based on the experience of the doctor.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Fluorescence angiography</intervention_name>
    <description>After the tube and stomach were made during surgery, the predetermined anastomosis position was marked with sutures in advance according to the doctor's experience, and then 0.04ml / kg indocyanine green injection was injected into the central vein. Next, dynamic observation and recording of the tube-gastric anastomosis area in 136 seconds using a fluorescent imaging system with a fixed focal length till the fluorescence reaching range and intensity. If the average value of the fluorescence value of the anastomosis position is greater than 30, then the anastomosis position may be according to the original plan or moved to the proximal part. If the average fluorescence value of the predetermined anastomosis position is less than 30, the anastomosis must move to proximal part ensure anastomosis with fluorescence value at least&gt; 30.</description>
