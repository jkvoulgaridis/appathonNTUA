      Hemiplegic cerebral palsy in the most common type of cerebral palsy that has permanent motor
      disorders and associated with life-long disability. the aim of study to assess the efficacy
      of mirror therapy on balance in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Seventy child with
      hemiplegic cerebral were enrolled in this study and were assessed for eligibility. Their aged
      ranged from eight to twelve years. The children were assigned randomly into two equal groups.
      Group (a) control group received traditional physical therapy program. And group (b) study
      group received the same traditional physical therapy program in addition to mirror therapy
      three times / weak for three successful months. Biodex balance system was used to assess
      balance pre and post treatment. All children were assisted before and after three months of
      intervention.
