  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the preoperative period, 60-80% of the patients had anxiety symptoms. This rate increases
      even more during pregnancy. There are a number of studies examining the role of anxiety
      symptoms on fetal outcome, but the mechanisms that explain the effects of maternal stress are
      not fully understood.

      The most extensively studied cytokines in neuropsychiatric disorders are TNF-α and IL-6 due
      to their effects on the central nervous system. TNF-α levels have been reported to be
      elevated in anxiety disorders. In our study, the investigators aimed to determine the
      relationship between preoperative anxiety levels and fetal cord blood TNF-α and IL-6 cytokine
      levels in pregnant women.

      This prospective observational study is planned to involve 30 volunteer patients between
      18-40 years of age who will undergo elective caesarean section surgery. People with known
      psychiatric illness and medication use, illiterate, who do not have mental competence to
      understand survey questions and very urgent patients will not be included in the study.

      Preoperative anxiety levels will be determined by the STAI-Continuity scale at the time of
      admission to the anesthesia outpatient clinic and by the STAI-State scale 1 hour before
      surgery.The scales will be scored as normal, mild, moderate and severe anxiety. Psychiatric
      consultation will be requested for patients with severe anxiety. At the end of the cesarean
      section, the concentration of TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines in the blood remaining from routine
      blood gas taken from the umbilical cord will be determined to obtain information about the
      state of fetal well-being.
