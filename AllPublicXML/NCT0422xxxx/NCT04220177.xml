      This is a Prospective, Open-label, Multicenter, and Non-randomized Clinical Study. The main
      purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of a medical device system,
      SETA LATECBA Stent Graft, intended for the treatment of EVAR of pararenal AAA (patients with
      complex anatomy, not eligible for other surgical procedure).Other objective is to evaluate
      the technical performance of the device SETA LATECBA Stent Graft.

      This is a Prospective, Open-label, Multicenter, and Non-randomized Clinical Study to
      determine the Safety and Efficacy of the SETA LATECBA Stent Graft for endovascular repair
      therapy (EVAR) in Subjects with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)..The main purpose of this
      study is to establish the efficacy and safety of a medical device system, SETA LATECBA Stent
      Graft, intended for the treatment of Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) of pararenal AAA
      (patients with complex anatomy, not eligible for other surgical procedure).

      Secondary objective(s): The secondary objective is to evaluate the technical performance of
      the device SETA. LATECBA Stent Graft which includes: access to the implantation site,
      visualization, deployment of the stent- graft, sizing compatibility, withdrawal of the
      delivery system, and compatibility with ancillary equipment.

    <description>Type I endoleaks is diagnosed when there is a gap between the stent graft and the vessel wall. Usually is a result of the failure of the stent graft to achieve a circumferential seal of the aneurism. It produces systemic pressurization of the aneurysm sac and increases the risk of sac rupture.</description>

    <description>SETA LATECBA Stent Grafts, are tube shaped implantable devices, delivered by balloon catheter system which are intended to the treatment of infrarenal AAA by sealing the affected areas, avoiding the bleeding or perfusion inside the aneurysm and restoring the normal hemodynamics in the affected vessels. The product family is composed by a set of endovascular stent grafts, that can be used alone or in combination, according to the treatment strategy, extension and complexity of the AAA. One aortic bifurcated stent graft, ABK SETA LATECBA model, is the aortic trunk and two straight iliac stent grafts, RIK SETA LATECBA model, are the connections to both iliac arteries.</description>

    <description>ABK model is a bifurcated polyester graft partially corrugated which is sutured at the proximal end (renal) to a balloon expandable 316 L stainless steel stent. The proximal half part of the stent is uncovered by polyester graft providing the anchoring to the healthy aorta wall when the device is implanted, as well as the perfusion of the renal arteries. The remaining half part is covered by polyester graft providing sealing of the aneurysm when it is expanded upon on the graft fabric and aneurysm neck. The distal end of each branch has the anchorage site for sealing after the connection with the iliac extensions RIK. The diameter of the anchorage site varies with the different ABK codes. The end of one branch is cone-shaped after the anchoring diameter with the purpose of promoting insertion of iliac extension RIK. The connection to iliac arteries is achieved by completing the aortic trunk ABK with 2 iliac extensions RIK.</description>
