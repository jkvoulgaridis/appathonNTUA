        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men, or women of non-childbearing potential aged 18-69 years (inclusive)

          -  Participants with chronic stable plaque psoriasis

          -  The target lesion(s) should be on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms/soles);
             psoriatic lesions on the knees or elbows are not to be used as target lesions.

          -  Willing and able to follow all trial procedures and complete the whole trial

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and in this
             protocol

          -  Willing to refrain from using any topical treatments on the target areas, other than
             those mandated by the protocol or for protocol procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other skin disease or infection that is considered by the investigator to be relevant
             to the outcome of the trial

          -  Participants with acute psoriasis guttata, psoriasis punctata, psoriasis
             erythrodermatica or pustular psoriasis

          -  Any topical antipsoriatics on plaques potentially to be treated in this trial
             (including corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, immunomodulators, retinoids,
             dithranol and tar) in the 4 weeks before first treatment and/or during the trial
             (pretreatment with salicylic acid is permitted on selected plaques; treatment on the
             face, ears and scalp is also permitted as lesions are not involved in the trial)

          -  Systemic treatment with antipsoriatics, e.g., corticosteroids, cytostatics, retinoids,
             dimethylfumarate or apremilast in the three months before first treatment and during
             the trial

          -  Systemic treatment with biological treatments: ustekinumab or secukinumab within six
             months or adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept within three months before first
             treatment and during the trial. Any other previously used biologics for treatment of
             psoriasis should have been washed out for five half lives before first treatment.

          -  Ultraviolet A (UVA) or B-therapy within four weeks and psoralen and ultraviolet A
             (PUVA)-therapy within eight weeks before first treatment and during the trial
             treatment with concomitant medication that may affect and provoke or aggravate
             psoriasis, e.g., antimalarial drugs, lithium, beta-blockers, or
             angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors unless on a stable dose for 3 months
             before trial medication initiation

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years prior to dosing, except adequately treated
             non-invasive skin cancer (basal or squamous cell carcinoma

          -  Positive urine drug or breath alcohol test results during screening or at Day 1, or
             history of drug abuse within a year prior to the screening visit

          -  Excess alcohol consumption within 6 months prior to the trial defined as an average
             weekly intake of &gt; 14 units for males and females. One unit is equivalent to 8 grams
             of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 milliliters [mL]) of beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of wine, or
             1 (25 mL) measure of spirits

          -  Blood pressure (BP) &gt;160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic or &gt;95 mmHg diastolic
             at screening

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last six months for biological
             agents, or four weeks for small molecules prior to first treatment in this clinical
             trial
