  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a prospective cohort study. It addresses an important challenge in
      the prevention of colorectal cancer: how to safely and effectively remove large polyps.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over recent years, a number of studies have been published that have highlighted factors
      associated with improved efficacy and safety of large polyp resection. Almost all of these
      studies originate from one large Australian cohort. It is unclear, whether the results are
      generalizable to other populations. It is important to understand if these findings can be
      duplicated, to further build on the gained knowledge. At the same time the technology of
      endoscopic resection is evolving.

      Established in 2012, the Large Polyp Study group aims to prospectively examine outcomes
      related to endoscopic large polyp removal. Enrollment of an ongoing randomized trial of 920
      patients has just been completed and a second trial is planned. The primary aim of both
      trials is to understand whether a specific intervention will reduce the risk of adverse
      events. The added observational study will complement the trials in different ways: It will
      enroll patients who might not have been eligible for the trials and allow the application of
      other resection techniques. The observational study will therefore better represent the
      average patient who undergoes resection of a large polyp. Furthermore, it will add sample
      size to examine secondary outcomes with greater power.

      This is a continuation of NCT01936948 (Safety of Endoscopic Resection of Large Colorectal
      Polyps: A Randomized Trial) as a observational cohort.

      The continuation was approved by the institutional IRB as part of the initial RCT. At this
      point the investigators document the observational arm as its own study in this registry.
