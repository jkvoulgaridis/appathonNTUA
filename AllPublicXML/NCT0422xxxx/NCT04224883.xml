  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intestine is the most vulnerable target organ in septic patients and is the first to be
      damaged organ in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS).Therefore, improving intestinal
      motility and mucosal barrier function is critical to the treatment of sepsis. Many studies
      have shown that, early enteral nutrition(EN) in patients with sepsis helps prevent and treat
      intestinal dysfunction, reducing ICU mortality and length of stay in ICU. However, there is
      little research on feeding methods. In this study the investigators will compare the outcomes
      of different feeding methods: continuously-pumped in 24 hours, continuouslypumped in 16 hours
      and intermittently-pumped through the stomach tube. The aim of this study is to investigate
      the effects of different feeding methods on intestinal function in septic patients.

    <description>Daily amount of feeding were continuously pumped for 24 hours. Enteral nutrition preparations pumping scheme: the initial pumping speed is 50ml/h, and gastric residual volumes(GRV) is checked every 4 hours. If it can be tolerated, the velocity of the pumping can be increased by half of the original speed.If it is not tolerable, the speed of the pumping is reduced by half on the original speed. GRV&lt;200mL were considered markers of good tolerance.Feeding intolerance was defined as GRV&gt;200 mL.</description>
