  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate whether
      the potent and selective RET inhibitor, pralsetinib, improves outcome when compared to a
      platinum chemotherapy-based regimen chosen by the Investigator from a list of standard of
      care treatments, as measured primarily by progression free survival (PFS), for patients with
      RET fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC who have not previously received systemic anticancer
      therapy for metastatic disease. Patients who have centrally confirmed progressive disease on
      the control arm have the option to crossover to pralsetinib.

          -  Patient is an appropriate candidate for and agrees to receive 1 of the Investigator
             choice platinum-based chemotherapy regimens if randomized to Arm B.

          -  Patient's tumor has any additional known primary driver alterations other than RET,
             such as targetable mutations of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, MET, and BRAF. Investigators should
             discuss enrollment with Sponsor designee regarding co-mutations.

          -  Patient previously received treatment with a selective RET inhibitor.

          -  Patient received radiotherapy or radiosurgery to any site within 14 days before
             randomization or more than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung in the 6 months before
             randomization.

          -  Patient has a presence of Grade 2 or worse interstitial lung disease or interstitial
             pneumonitis, including radiation pneumonitis within 28 days before randomization.

          -  Patient has CNS metastases or a primary CNS tumor that is associated with progressive
             neurological symptoms or requires increasing doses of corticosteroids to control the
             CNS disease. If a patient requires corticosteroids for management of CNS disease, the
             dose must have been stable for the 2 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1.
