      In this study investigators will examine the effects of inspiratory muscle training and
      balance training in patients with Parkinson's Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the most common type of Parkinsonism and mainly due to
      degeneration of basal ganglions and substantia nigra occurs. Balance disorders are one of the
      common problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. These balance disorders; loss of
      postural reflexes, insufficiency in postural adjustments, rigidity in the trunk and
      extremities, and many disorders such as akinesia. Because of balance disorders in patients
      with PD, increase in addiction to daily life activities, causes physical disability. In the
      case of PD pulmonary problems may be the leading cause of mortality and mortality.
      Respiratory symptoms in these patients cause problems in weakness, swallowing, coughing,
      voice and speech functions. When the investigators look at the current literature, the effect
      of balance and respiration on Parkinson's patients is found to be seperately but their effect
      on each other is not sufficiently emphasized. For this reason, the researchers' aim to
      investigate balance and postural control in patients with Parkinson's disease and to increase
      the strength of respiratory muscles and to improve balance and postural control.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inspiratory Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is the most widely used measure of respiratory muscle strength in patients with suspected respiratory muscle weakness. It is determined by measuring upper airway pressure (mouth for outpatients and trachea for intubated or tracheostomized patients) during a maximal voluntary inspiratory effort. The measured pressure is a composite of the pressure generated by the inspiratory muscles and the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs and chest wall.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Function- Forced Vital Capasity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the total amount of air exhaled during the FEV test. FVC can also help doctors assess the progression of lung disease and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Function- Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume (FEV) measures how much air a person can exhale during a forced breath. Forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity are lung function tests that are measured during spirometry. Forced expiratory volume is the most important measurement of lung function. It is used to:
Diagnose obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A person who has asthma or COPD has a lower FEV1 result than a healthy person.
See how well medicines used to improve breathing are working. Check if lung disease is getting worse. Decreases in the FEV1 value may mean the lung disease is getting worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Function- Peak Expiratory Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The peak expiratory flow (PEF), also called peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), is a person's maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter, a small, hand-held device used to monitor a person's ability to breathe out air.</description>

    <measure>Parkinson's Status- Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS scale refers to Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and it is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's disease in patients. The UPDRS scale includes series of ratings for typical Parkinson's symptoms that cover all of the movement hindrances of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS scale consists of the following five segments: 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) ADL, 3) Motor sections, 4) Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale, and 5) Schwab and England ADL scale. Each answer to the scale is evaluated by a medical professional that specializes in Parkinson's disease during patient interviews.</description>

    <measure>Mobility Status- Rivermead mobility index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Rivermead Mobility Index assesses functional mobility in gait, balance and transfers. The Rivermead Mobility Index is appropriate for a range of disabilities that include anything from being bedridden to being able to run 15 items:
14-self-reported items
1 direct observation item Items progress in difficulty Items are coded as either 0 or 1, depending on whether the patient can complete the task according to specific instructions Items receive a score of 0 for a &quot;No&quot; response and 1 for a &quot;Yes&quot; response Total scores are determined by summing the points for all items A maximum of 15 points is possible; higher scores indicate better mobility performance A score of &quot;0&quot; indicates an inability to perform any of the activities on the measure</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Parameter-Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Nottingham Health Profile is intended for primary health care, to provide a brief indication of a patient's perceived emotional, social and physical health problems. Breakdown of questionaire
(1) Part I: 38 questions in 6 subareas, with each question assigned a weighted value; the sum of all weighted values in a given subarea adds up to 100
energy level (EL): 3
pain (P): 8
emotional reaction (ER): 9

    <measure>Activities of Daily Living-Barthel</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baselines to final evaluation at 8th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge.Time taken and physical assistance required to perform each item are used in determining the assigned value of each item. The Barthel Index measures the degree of assistance required by an individual on 10 items of mobility and self care ADL.</description>
