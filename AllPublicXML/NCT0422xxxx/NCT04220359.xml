  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide myriad of physiological parameters in patients admitted in an
      internal medicine department, and which are defined as being in an increased risk of clinical
      deterioration within the first 72-hours after admission. The investigators will also conduct
      a retrospective comparison between physiological changes in patients who did deteriorate to
      those who did not. This will form the basis for the development of an algorithm for early
      prediction and warning of physiological and clinical deterioration during the first 72-hours
      of admission.

        Male and female patients 18 years and older admitted to the internal medicine department
        and are at high-risk for clinical deterioration during the first 72-hours after admission.
        The investigators anticipate it will include patients with acute and chronic
        cardio-respiratory disease, systemic infections, etc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 years old and above admitted to the internal medicine department

          -  On admission, the primary investigator assess their risk to deteriorate during the
             first 72 hours after admission as reasonably high

          -  The patient is assigned to a &quot;monitoring bed&quot; within the department

          -  The patient has signed an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lack of informed consent

          -  It is known in advance that the patient cannot take part in the study for a 72-hours
             period (e.g. a patient that will be taken to surgery within the next 24 hours)

          -  Technical inability to attach the Biobeat patch (BB-613PW) to the patients chest
