        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for a tucatinib clinical trial

          -  Disease recurrence within 3 months of last capecitabine for metastatic disease

          -  History of allergic reactions to trastuzumab, capecitabine, or compounds chemically or
             biologically similar to tucatinib, except for Grade 1 or 2 infusion related reactions
             to trastuzumab that were successfully managed, or known allergy to one of the
             excipients in the protocol drugs

          -  Have received treatment with any systemic anti-cancer therapy (excluding hormonal
             therapy), non-CNS radiation, or experimental agent ≤ 3 weeks of first dose of protocol
             treatment or are currently participating in an interventional clinical trial. Have
             received hormonal therapies &lt;1 week of the first dose of protocol treatment.

          -  Have any toxicity related to prior cancer therapies that has not resolved to ≤ Grade

          -  Have used strong CYP2C8 inhibitor within 5 half-lives of the inhibitor, or have used a
             CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inducer within 5 day prior to start of tucatinib treatment.

          -  Have known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency

          -  Ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at
             a total daily dose of &gt; 2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent). However, patients on a
             chronic stable dose of ≤ 2 mg total daily of dexamethasone (or equivalent) may be
             eligible with discussion and approval by the medical monitor

          -  Any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy, including (but not
             limited to) a lesion in an anatomic site where increase in size or possible
             treatment-related edema may pose risk to patient (e.g. brain stem lesions).

          -  Known or suspected LMD as documented by the treating physician

          -  Have poorly controlled (&gt; 1/week) generalized or complex partial seizures, or manifest
