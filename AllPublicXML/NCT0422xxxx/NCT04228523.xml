      Dopaminergic drug can have adverse effects leading to potential serious consequences.
      Therapeutic patient education must promote the understanding of drugs to improve its
      management. This study tries to evaluate the effect of therapeutic education workshop on
      Parkinson disease's drug (drug workshop) on the evolution of drug's representations in
      patients with Parkinson's disease compared to a control group.

      Dopaminergic drug can have adverse effects leading to potential serious consequences.
      Therapeutic patient education must promote the understanding of drugs to improve its
      management.

      The therapeutic educational program ETPARK includes individual's consults or workshop. The
      team frequently offer to patients to participate in workshop on Parkinson disease's drug.

      This study tries to evaluate the effect of therapeutic education workshop on Parkinson
      disease's drug (drug workshop) on the evolution of drug's representations in patients with
      Parkinson's disease compared to a control group (speaking group) at 1 and 3 months.

    <description>Workshop on Parkinson disease drug has several educative sequences (lasting 4hours).
A first round table is organized to know the needs and issues related to drug management of patients.
The 1st educative sequence consists in knowing the different class of dopaminergic drugs and their action.
The 2nd educative sequence leads patients to understand their prescription and be aware of the needs to take pills regularly.
The 3rd educative sequence consists in learning and identifying potentials adverse effects and finds effective strategies to prevent them.
At the end, one patient explains its tips and tricks about its drug management</description>
