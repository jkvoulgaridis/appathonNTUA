  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is an effective rhythm control method that
      shows superior rhythm outcome than antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment in drug-resistant AF.
      However, AF catheter ablation still has a substantial recurrence rate.

      The current AAD use guidelines for AF management focus on the safety of drug use. However, if
      the AAD efficacy evaluation system using computer modeling reflecting the individual anatomy,
      electrophysiology, and histological characteristics of patients is practical, it will help to
      select a more effective AAD type or dose.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective randomized clinical study on the
      efficacy and safety of computer modeling for optimal AAD selection in patients with recurrent
      AF after catheter ablation. The investigator will evaluate the efficacy of AAD simulations by
      comparing virtual AAD effect guided therapy and empirical AAD use in patients with recurrent
      AF after AF catheterization.

      The investigator will test the virtual AAD effects in the computer simulations integrated by
      cardiac images and 3D electrophysiological maps obtained during de novo AF ablation. The
      investigator will compare the effects of the most potent AAD selected by virtual AAD
      simulation with those of empirical AAD.

      A. Study design

        1. Prospective randomization (Virtual AAD TEST group vs. Empirical AAD group )

        2. Target number of subjects: 300 (150 per group)

        3. Rhythm FU : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 2 month, and
           thereafter every 6 months; ECG if the patient has any symptom)

        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines

        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,
           cardioversion frequency, major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.

      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up

        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management

        2. Follow-up at 2 weeks, 2 months, and thereafter every 6-month after medication.

        3. Rhythm control at 2 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter after
           medication

        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.

      C. Follow-up All the patients will be followed-up at 2 weeks, 2, 6 months, and thereafter
      every 6 months. If the patient shows any symptom within the clinical study period, patient
      will visit the outpatient clinic. ECG will be performed at every outpatient visits, and
      24-hour Holter or event recording will be performed 2months and every 6 months for 2 years,
      and every year after 2 years (2012 Heart Rhythm Society/EHRA/European Cardiac Arrhythmia
      Society Expert Consensus Statement guidelines). If atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia
      lasting more than 30 seconds is observed in 12-lead ECG or Holter, it will be evaluated as
      recurrence. Recurrence within 3 months after the procedure will be classified as early
      recurrence, and that after 3 months will be classified as clinical recurrence.
