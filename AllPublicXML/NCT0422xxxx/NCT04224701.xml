      This is a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      HIV-1 envelope protein BG505 SOSIP.GT1.1 gp140 trimer Vaccine, Adjuvanted, in up to 48
      healthy HIV-uninfected adult volunteers. BG505 SOSIP.GT1.1 is a soluable, cleavage-competent,
      trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp140 formulated in 0.55mL at 2mg/mL in 20 mM Tris, 100
      mM naCL, pH 7.5 and will be administered IM.
