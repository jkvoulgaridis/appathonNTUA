    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of WIN-1001X for its therapeutic
      confirmatory study by comparing and evaluating the efficacy and safety of each dose group by
      conducting a therapeutic exploratory study on three dose groups of WIN-1001X 400 mg, 800 mg,
      and 1200 mg, and placebo group in patients with early Parkinson's disease.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in the change of MDS UPDRS
      Part Ⅲ between WIN-1001X 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg as the test drugs compared to placebo as
      the control drug after administering them for 12 weeks.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of
      the 3 dose groups of WIN-1001X compared to placebo group by assessing the changes in MDS
      UPDRS Part Ⅲ after administering the investigational products for 4 and 8 weeks, the changes
      in MDS UPDRS Part Ⅰ, Part Ⅱ, Part Ⅰ+Part Ⅱ+Part Ⅲ, and Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale after
      administering for 4, 8, and 12 weeks, the changes in K-NMSS (Non-Motor Symptoms Scale),
      K-MoCA (Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment), K-PDQ-39 (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire)
      score.

    <description>The Hoehn and Yahr scale is a commonly used system for describing how the symptoms of Parkinson's disease progress. The Hoehn and Yahr scale includes stages 1 through 5, with addition of stages 1.5 and 2.5 to help describe the intermediate course of the disease. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms of Parkinson's disease progress.</description>

    <time_frame>After administration of the investigational product for 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Korean version of Novel Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for Parkinson's Disease is 30-item scale containing nine dimensions: cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems, attention/memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual function and miscellany. Each symptoms are scored with severity (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate) and frequency (1=rarely, 2=often, 3=frequent, 4=very frequent). The final scores are calculated as severity score x frequency score. The higher the score, the severe the symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>After administration of the investigational product for 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening assessment for detecting cognitive impairment. It is a 30-point test consisting of attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The total possible score is 30 points and a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the summary index and total scores of the K-PDQ-39</measure>
    <time_frame>After administration of the investigational product for 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-report questionnaire, which assesses Parkinson's disease-specific health related quality over the last month. Assessment is carried out across the 8 quality of life dimensions; activities of daily living, attention &amp; working memory, cognition, communication, depression, functional mobility, quality of life, social relationships and social support. All items are scored from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Dimension score is then calculated by sum of scores of each item in the dimension divided by the maximum possible socre of all the items in the dimension, multiplied by 100. Lower dimension score reflects better quality of life.</description>

Once the patients who have voluntarily singed an informed consent form are enrolled in this study, their eligibilities for the study are assessed and those who have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria are randomized to the test group 1 (400mg), 2 (800mg), and 3 (1200mg), or the control group (placebo group) in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. The randomized patients are administered 3 tablets of the investigational product twice a day for 12 weeks and the safety follow-up should be carried out for 2 weeks after administration of the investigational product is terminated.</description>
