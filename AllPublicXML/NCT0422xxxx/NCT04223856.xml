  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see how well two drugs (enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab)
      work together alone or with platinum chemotherapy to treat patients with urothelial cancer.
      The study will compare these drugs to other drugs that are usually used to treat this cancer
      (standard of care). The patients in this study will have cancer that has spread from their
      urinary system to other parts of their body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the combination of enfortumab vedotin +
      pembrolizumab, with or without platinum-containing chemotherapy, versus standard of care
      gemcitabine + platinum-containing chemotherapy, in subjects with previously untreated locally
      advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      Enfortumab vedotin may be administered for an unlimited number of cycles until a protocol
      defined reason for study discontinuation occurs. Pembrolizumab may be administered for a
      maximum of 35 cycles or a protocol-defined reason for study discontinuation occurs, whichever
      is first. Cisplatin, carboplatin, and/or gemcitabine may be administered for a maximum of 6
      cycles or a protocol-defined reason for study discontinuation occurs, whichever is first.

    <measure>Change from baseline in patient reported outcome assessment measured by the EuroQOL Five Dimensions Questionnaire 5L (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific 30-item questionnaire. Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot; A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change.</description>
