  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve the comparison of three groups with severe-profound hearing loss.
      Patients with a Cochlear Implant only, patients with a cochlear implant and Hearing Aid, and
      finally patients with two hearing aids.

      This will enable a comparison of standard fitting protocols against the new rationale using
      the same devices. Devices used for patients in all 3 groups are now available in standard of
      care, and can be kept afterwards should the patients wish.

      The study will involve three groups of 20 patients per group. This first is experienced adult
      bimodal users of the AB system who have usable contralateral residual hearing. A clinical
      baseline and three research conditions will be evaluated.

      The Naida CI Link HA (Link) will be fitted, tested and then optimised using a special bimodal
      fitting formula. Subjects will be allowed three months to acclimatize and will then be
      retested. The second research condition will evaluate the fully integrated bimodal system,
      where the microphone signals from CI and HA are shared and a bilateral beamformer is formed.
      A third intervention will involve modifying the CI settings to minimize the mis-match between
      frequencies delivered via the CI.

      A second group with no aidable hearing on their non-implanted ear will also be studied. A
      contralateral routing of signal (CROS) device will send sounds on the non-implanted side.
      Tests will be made with and without CROS, as well as with directional microphone settings.

      Finally as a control group, bilateral HA users will be tested with the similar HA fitting as
      used for the bimodal group.

      This will enable a comparison of standard fitting protocols against the new rationale using
      the same devices.

    <description>Comparing performance of conventional hearing aid fitting to Phonak's Bimodal Fitting formula using the Phonak Naida Link hearing aid. All patients are tested in a bimodal (hearing aid plus cochlear implant) setup. Initial tests are completed with the Advanced Bionics Naida Q70 or Q90 sound processor and the patient's own hearing aid. In this arm, a patient's own hearing aid is replaced with the Phonak Naida Link hearing aid to test if there is a benefit.</description>

All patients are tested initially with their own hearing aids to obtain a baseline measurement.
