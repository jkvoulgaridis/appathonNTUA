  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will see if application of TENS for a period of 30 minutes in addition to
      ibuprofen reduces the pain of emergency department patients with back pain compared with
      ibuprofen and a sham TENS unit.

      Adult patients presenting to the emergency department with moderate to severe back pain of
      relatively short duration without neurological deficits will be eligible for inclusion in the
      study. After signing informed consent the patients will rate their pain severity and receive
      a 400 mg dose of ibuprofen and then randomly be assigned to either TENS or sham TENS for 30
      minutes. At the end of the study period patients will again be asked to rate their pain
      severity and indicate whether their pain got better or worse. We will also ask them to try
      and guess which treatment they received and whether they require any medications for their
      pain.

    <description>A TENS device consists of an electric pulse generator and pads that are attached to the skin on around the area of maximal pain. We will use the conventional mode, which provides nerve stimulation with a pulse width of 60 microseconds and a pulse rate of 60 pulses per second. The channel intensity will be gradually increased until the intensity is noticeable but not painful.</description>

    <description>In the SHAM TENS group the TENS pads will be attached to the pulse generator and the patients skin around the painful area. The investigator will turn the knobs on but the batteries will be removed from the device.</description>
