  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study to assess for safety,
      tolerability and nutritional impact of oral serum bovine immunoglobulin (SBI) on pediatric
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as assessed by an increase in serum albumin
      and other nutritional markers including vitamin D level, pre-albumin, transferrin and iron
      saturation; and improvement in weight and body mass index. SBI is an animal derived protein
      isolate from the serum of cows containing &gt;50% IgG. It has been used for patients suffering
      from irritable bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus enteropathy and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea for symptomatic relief of diarrhea with good results and
      minimal side effects. However its role in pediatric IBD has not yet been investigated. The
      investigators hypothesize that the study product will have a positive nutritional impact
      along with symptom improvement for pediatric patients with IBD. The volunteers for our study
      will have established Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and will be treated with a daily
      powder (SBI or placebo) added to their breakfast food (egg, yogurt, or peanut butter are
      best) for total of 60 days followed by 30 day monitoring period after completion of
      treatment. The volunteers will be followed by clinic visits and labs on day 0, day 15, day 60
      and day 90. There is the potential for the treatment to alter disease activity, a secondary
      outcome, as assessed by measurement of serum markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP), fecal
      calprotectin (validated marker of intestinal inflammation), and clinical indices like short
      pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (shPDCAI) or pediatric ulcerative colitis activity
      index (PUCAI). Stool samples will be collected on day 0 and day 60 for 16S RNA sequencing to
      assess for changes in microbiota of the participants while on the study product/placebo. We
      plan to enroll 43 patients in the study to allow for data analysis of atleast 30 patients.
      The study will take place over 1 year and will be conducted at University of Texas-Children's
      Memorial Hermann Hospital, where we follow &gt; 125 children with inflammatory bowel disease.

The code key will be stored in a divisional research University of Texas, Houston-secure website. The participants will then be randomized to receive either SBI or placebo (in form of hydrolyzed collagen) to be taken once daily for a total of 60 days. The medical products will be supplied to the participants in a blinded manner by the principal investigator and study co-ordinator.</masking_description>
