      A multicenter, open-label, single-arm, extension study with regard to the safety and efficacy
      of empagliflozin in patients with refractory diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and efficacy of oral administration of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg
      once daily for 28 weeks (52 weeks of the EMPIRE-01 study) in subjects who participated in the
      EMPIRE-01 study, which was conducted on refractory diabetes mellitus patients with insulin
      resistance (insulin resistance syndrome, lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus) in a multicenter,
      open-label, single-arm, extension study.
