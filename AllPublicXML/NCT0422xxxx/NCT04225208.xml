  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label, healthy volunteers, ADME study with single oral administration
      of [14C]-AZD4205.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I study to evaluate the excretion of AZD4205 radioactive dose, the metabolic profile,
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability following a single oral administration of
      [14C]-AZD4205 in healthy male volunteers. The purpose of this study is to investigate ADME
      properties of AZD4205 by analyzing blood, urine and feces collected during the study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Healthy male subjects aged 18 to 65, who must be willing to use reliable methods of
             contraception, even if their partners are postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using
             an effective hormonal method of contraception or intrauterine coil.

          -  2. In addition, subjects must agree to continue to take similar contraceptive
             precautions until 6 months after administration of AZD4205 and avoid procreative sex
             as well as sperm donation for 6 months after administration of AZD4205.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Any clinically relevant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs,
             hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or ECG at screening or baseline in the
             opinion of the investigator.

          -  2. Subjects who may have been exposed to radiation for therapeutic or diagnostic
             reasons at levels above background (e.g,, through X-ray examination other than dental
             X-rays or plain X-rays of thorax or bony skeleton) of &gt; 5 mSv in last year, &gt; 10 mSv
             over last 5 years or a cumulative total of &gt; 1 mSv per year of life.
