  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized and receive either the probioic or placebo
      supplement to consume daily for 28-days. Three check-in visits will occur every 7 days of
      study participation. Participants will be expected to complete a daily study diary
      documenting their investigational product use/adverse events and a daily bowel habits diary
      documenting each bowel movement. Blood samples, stool samples, and questionnaires will be
      completed for study outcome analysis.
