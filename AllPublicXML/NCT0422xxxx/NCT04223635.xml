  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of pexidartinib will be investigated in participants
      with impaired hepatic function and compared with healthy control participants with normal
      hepatic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pexidartinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor, currently approved in the
      US for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT)
      associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement
      with surgery.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      pexidartinib after a single oral dose of 200 mg in participants with moderate hepatic
      impairment (HI) as defined by National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group
      (NCI-ODWG) criteria compared to the healthy controls participants with normal hepatic
      function.

          -  Documented history of chronic liver disease diagnosed by ultrasonography, computed
             tomography scan, liver biopsy, or magnetic resonance imaging or history of chronic (&gt;6
             months) hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection.

          -  Clinical stability in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Female participants (both, healthy and HI participants) who are of non-childbearing
             potential must be:

               -  Surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation or removal of both ovaries
                  and/or uterus at least 6 months prior to dosing, or EssureÂ® with
                  hysterosalpingogram [documentation to confirm tubal occlusion 12 weeks after
                  procedure]).

               -  Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 12
                  consecutive months prior to dosing, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) or estradiol testing.

          -  Female participants (both, healthy and HI subjects) who are of childbearing potential
             must agree to barrier method of contraceptive therapy or refrain from sexual
             intercourse to prevent pregnancy until 1 month post dose. If the participant is on
             oral contraceptive, the participant needs to use the barrier method in addition to
             oral contraceptive. Female participants must refrain from breastfeeding for at least 2
             weeks post dose.

          -  Male participants (both, healthy and HI subjects) must surgically sterile or agree to
             use double barrier methods of contraception from Check-in until 1 month after the dose
             of pexidartinib. Also, male participants must not donate sperm from Check-in until 1
             month after pexidartinib administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG, or laboratory values at

             absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs (with the exception of
             appendectomy, hernia repair, and/or cholecystectomy)

          -  Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any drug (except penicillin)

          -  A positive drugs of abuse screen (unless the drug is medically prescribed by a
             licensed health care provider) or alcohol breath test at Screening or at Check-in on
             Day -2 or a participant who will not agree to smoke â‰¤10 cigarettes or equivalent per
             day from Screening up to Enrollment, and is unable to be restricted to â‰¤5 cigarettes
             per day and for 6 hours post dose during their period of residence in the clinical
             unit

          -  Concomitant use of medications known to affect the elimination of serum creatinine
             (eg, trimethoprim or cimetidine) and inhibitors of renal tubular secretion (eg,

             clinically significant and/or a QT interval corrected for heart rate using
             Fridericia's formula (QTcF) â‰¥450 milliseconds (ms) and â‰¥470 ms for healthy male and
             female participants, respectively, and &gt;500 ms for participants with HI at Screening

          -  Consumption of alcohol-within 72 hours prior to Check-in and caffeine-containing
             beverages within 48 hours prior to Check-in and during confinement

          -  Consumption of more than 28 units of alcohol per week for males or 14 units of alcohol
             per week for females, where 1 unit of alcohol equals one-half pint of beer, 4 ounces
             (oz) of wine, or 1 oz of spirits, or significant history of alcoholism or
             drug/chemical abuse within the last 2 years

          -  Positive serology for HBsAg and anti-HCV (healthy participants), HAV immunoglobulin M,
             or anti-HIV Type 1 and Type 2 (all participants)
