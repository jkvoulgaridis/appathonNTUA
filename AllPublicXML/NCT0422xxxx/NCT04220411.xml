      This is a Phase I/IIa Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study to Determine the Safety,
      Tolerability, and Efficacy of AR100DP1 in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/IIa study will be composed of a Phase I study, which includes 14 days of
      treatment with AR100DP1 followed by 2 weeks of follow-up period to find the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of AR100DP1 and a following single-arm Phase IIa study with 28 days of treatment
      followed by 2 weeks of follow-up period to evaluate the efficacy of AR100DP1 with the
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) in treating atopic dermatitis on target lesion. The target
      lesion is defined as ≤ 5% BSA (up to ~ 750 cm2) of AD patients. Eligible subjects will have
      target lesion area selected by the investigator and recorded for AR100DP1 topical
      administration before dosing. AR100DP1 should be topically administered on target lesions
      twice daily for 14 days in Phase I study whereas for 28 days in Phase IIa study.

             (e.g. concomitant illness) such as cardiovascular (e.g. New York Heart Association
             grade III or IV), hepatic (e.g. Child-Pugh Class C), psychiatric condition (e.g.
             alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, or laboratory abnormality
             that in the investigators' opinion could interfere with the results of the trial or
             adversely affect the safety of the subject

         14. Female subject who is lactating or has positive urine pregnancy test at screening
