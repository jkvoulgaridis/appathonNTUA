  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) are effective
      therapies for advanced lung cancer patients bearing EGFR-activating mutations, but are not
      curative due to the invariable apparition of resistances. The investigator team have
      identified a new phenotype related to drug tolerance after EGFR-TKI treatment that shares
      several characteristics of a known process of Therapy-Induced Senescence (TIS), which could
      be a major event of drug tolerance in patients. Using cutting-edge technologies,
      patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and circulating tumor cells (CTC), the investigator team
      will perform an exhaustive characterization of the phenotypic and molecular changes
      associated with this drug-tolerant state in patients. Their results should lead to new
      therapeutic approaches to eliminate the reservoir of drug-tolerant cells and to prevent
      emergence of resistance mutations responsible for the relapse of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LUNG-RESIST is a translational, monocentric and prospective research study on 40 patients
      whose objective is to characterize Drug Tolerant Cell (DTC) type cells in patients with a
      NSCLC carrying an EGFR mutation and to discover and monitor potentials biomarkers involved in
      this mechanism of resistance to osimertinib. The study will be offered to patients, and for
      whom the therapeutic decision was decided collegially during multidisciplinary molecular
      meetings (molecular Tumor Board). Following informed consent, patients will be registered in
      a single cohort. In this study, treatment with osimertinib is not studied and will be
      delivered according to current recommendations

    <description>Each participant will be followed-up regularly as part of the usual practice for imaging and medical consultations. During their visits, from inclusion (T0) to the end of study participation (T progression), each patient will have a blood sampling specifically for the research to analyze tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells: T0, T1month, T3 months, Tn months, T DNA C+, T progression.
This research does not include any other act or intervention specifically required for its purposes.</description>
