  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world lacks a gold standard treatment for treating dentin hypersensitivity. Fluoride
      varnish is most commonly used as a treatment but it causes temporary discoloration of tooth
      structure and may cause irritation or burning of gums when it comes in contact with gums.
      Seventh generation bonding agents are less technique sensitive and are easy to use. The
      present study aims to find out the better seventh generation bonding agent as a treatment
      option for sensitivity.

      A total of 105 patients with dentin hypersensitivity are randomized into three groups.
      Scaling and root debridement are performed for all the groups. This study compares two
      seventh generation bonding agents and taking fluoride varnish as control group.

    <textblock>
      Dentin hypersensitivity is a painful condition resulting from external stimulation of exposed
      vital dentin. Dentin gets exposed to the oral environment by multiple factors like gingival
      recession, erosion, attrition, abrasion, fractures, caries, and many more. The intra-tubular
      fluid movement of exposed tubules is believed to be the mechanism of hypersensitivity. Dentin
      bonding agents acts by occluding patent tubules, thus reducing hypersensitivity. Seventh
      generation combines etchant, primer and bonding agent into one solution and makes it easy to
      use.

      After diagnosis of dentin hypersensitivity, the patients signed a consent form stating their
      voluntary participation in the research. The discomfort internal scale score and Schiff cold
      air sensitivity scale scores are recorded at baseline, immediately after the intervention,
      after 01 week and after 01 month. Discomfort internal scale score are recorded for every
      participant using dental explorer in the mesial and distal direction on the exposed surface
      of the affected teeth for tactile stimulation. For schiff cold air sensitivity scale scores
      an air syringe system was used to check the evaporative response on the affected teeth of the
      participants and the scores are recorded.

      All the patients received scaling and root debridement as a standard protocol treatment.
      Dentin bonding agents and fluoride varnish are applied to the participants. All the
      participants are instructed to fast for two hours after the treatment. All the records are
      made on subjective response of patients.
