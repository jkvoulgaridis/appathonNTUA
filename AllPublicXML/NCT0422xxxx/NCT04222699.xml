  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the microbiome of the nose, throat and three skin sites in
      a population without current exposure to the healthcare environment: 80 community dwelling
      adults. We will characterize the microbial communities in these body sites (nose, throat,
      perirectal and three skin sites) over time using culture-independent techniques. The
      investigators will then &quot;decolonize&quot; the subjects. Subjects will receive intranasal mupirocin
      and topical chlorhexidine. The investigators will then compare the microbial communities at
      baseline and after decolonization within individuals. Our overall hypothesis is that the
      microbial composition of these sites and the response to decolonization is influenced by the
      healthcare environment and that decolonization leads to re-colonization with an increasing
      proportion of Gram-negative bacilli.

Mupirocin calcium ointment, 2%: Mupirocin nasal ointment is used to treat or prevent infections in the nose due to certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This medicine works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth.
Topical Chlorhexidine, 4%: Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic that fights bacteria.
Topical chlorhexidine is used to clean the skin to prevent infection that may be caused by surgery, injection, or skin injury.</description>
