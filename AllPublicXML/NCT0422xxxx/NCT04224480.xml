  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises a main study of pembro-treated HCC patients and a sub-study of untreated
      HCC patients. In the main study, patients will be treated with pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment approximately 4 weeks prior scheduled surgery. Adjuvant treatment with
      pembrolizumab with commence at approximately 4 weeks post-surgery for up to 12 months.
      Subjects will be followed up for a further 12 months after end of treatment for recurrence
      and survival.

      The sub-study is a tumour sample collection study which will provide pre-treatment immune
      microenvironment data from up to 15 pairs of HCC/adjuvant liver tissue samples. Translational
      analyses performed for liver tissue samples in the sub-study will be harmonized with the
      analyses on liver tissue samples collected in the main study.
