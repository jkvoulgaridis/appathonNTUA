  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a follow up to the HP-CD-CL-2002 clinical study. It evaluates the long-term
      safety in patients with Parkinson's disease after implantation of an investigational drug
      delivery system (DDS) with or without infusions of CDNF. All patients will have at least the
      port explanted.

    <textblock>
      A patients participation in the study will last for up to 4 years and will include up to nine
      visits:

        -  Screening (1 visit, same as HP-CD-CL-2003 End-of-Study visit)

        -  Pre-surgery / explantation surgery / post-surgery (3 visits)

        -  Safety (4 visits)

        -  DAT-PET (Dopamine Transporter - Positron Emission Tomography) examination (1 visit)

        -  End-of-study visit (1 visit)

      Study examinations and assessments:

        -  Physical examination: pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature, body weight and height,
           body mass index (BMI), neurological exam

        -  ECG (electrocardiography) and blood and urine tests

        -  Pregnancy tests for women of childbearing age

        -  Completion of a patient diary to record mobility and time asleep

        -  Parkinson's Kinetigraph (PKGTM) Data Logger: a watch-type movement recording device

        -  Questionnaires, rating scales and forms: quality of life, mood, memory, impulse control,
           mental health.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

        -  Positron emission tomography scans (PET)

        -  Skin condition over any remaining implanted subcutaneous portion of the device.

        -  Skin healing after port / device removal.
