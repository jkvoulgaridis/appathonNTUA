  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians routinely investigate/test human movement but if/how this is effect by auditory
      disturbances is unclear. This study sets out to investigate the impact of auditory
      disturbances on human movement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>During a single test session (approximately 2hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Range of movement will be assessed by measuring displacement of the body part being moved (i.e. moving the head, back, arm or leg from a neutral position to end of range in flexion, extension, rotation, addiction or abduction)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Experienced pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During a single test session (approximately 2hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Any potential pain during the functional tasks will be monitored using a 0-11 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst imaginable pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Experienced difficultness of performing movement</measure>
    <time_frame>During a single test session (approximately 2hours)</time_frame>
    <description>a 6-point Likert scale going from 0 = 'no problems',
1 = minimally difficult; 2 = somewhat difficult; 3 = fairly difficult; 4 = very difficult; 5 = unable to perform</description>
