  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT study aims to examine the effects of a self-regulation programme on the self-care
      behaviour and quality of life of patients with heart failure. The following hypothesis was
      tested: Heart failure patients who receive the self-regulation program will report
      significant improvements in self-care behaviours after four weeks of the self-regulation
      programme. In contrast, patients in the control group showed no significant differences.

      Eight two patients with heart failure were randomly assigned into the intervention (n = 41)
      or control group (n = 41). The intervention group participated in a 4-week self-regulation
      programme, including 20 to 30 minutes of individual self-regulation education and 15 to 20
      minutes of telephone follow-up twice per week for four weeks. The control group received only
      routine outpatient care. Self-care behaviour was measured by the Self-Care of Heart Failure
      Index at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after patients were enrolled. Quality of life was
      measure with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire

    <description>Changes from baseline Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (version 6.2) with three subscales: self-care maintenance, self-care management, and self-care confidence, at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Each subscale score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better self-care behaviour.</description>
