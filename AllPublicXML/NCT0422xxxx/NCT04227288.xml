  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Enstilar Foam
      (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) for the treatment of nail psoriasis.

      Eligible subjects will be provided twice daily. Enstilar Foam (calcipotriene and
      betamethasone dipropionate). Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin layer on the nail
      plate, around the nail plate and under the nail plate. The patient will be instructed to
      apply one application at night immediately before bed and not wash their hands before
      morning. All subjects who completed the 6-month treatment will be followed for 1 month after
      discontinuation.
