  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy compared to placebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy in
      participants with locally advanced cervical cancer.

      The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior
      to placebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy with respect to progression-free survival and
      overall survival.

      Once the study objectives have been met or the study has ended, participants will be
      discontinued from this study and will be enrolled in an extension study to continue
      protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 38 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, or by histopathologic confirmation of disease progression, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD.</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, or by histopathologic confirmation of disease progression, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to approximately 46 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Global scores are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 score will be presented.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better quality of life. The change from baseline in physical function (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5) score will be presented.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CX24 is a questionnaire that rates the symptoms common to women with cervical cancer and evaluates the impact of disease and/or treatments. The 24 items use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) and are classified into 3 multi-item scales, 11 items with symptom experience, 3 items with body image, and 4 items with sexual/ vaginal functioning. The other items of the questionnaire are lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, menopausal symptom, sexual worry, sexual activity, and sexual enjoyment.
