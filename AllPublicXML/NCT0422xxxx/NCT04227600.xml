    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient aged 18 years or older in Part 1 or any age in Part 2, at the time of
             informed consent

          -  A patient from whom written informed consent can be obtained. If the patient is aged
             under 18 years (20 years in case of Japan) at the time of assent or willingness to
             participate in the study cannot be confirmed due to MPS I‐related intellectual
             disability, informed permission from the patient's legally acceptable representative
             (e.g. his/her parents or guardians) need to be obtained instead of his/her consent.
             Even in this case, written informed consent or assent should be obtained from the
             patient, wherever possible

          -  A patient diagnosed with MPS I based on any one of the following criteria:

          -  Activity of IDUA enzyme below 10% of lower reference level in leucocytes or cultured
             skin fibroblasts, AND increased age‐related urinary levels of GAGs (before enzyme
             replacement therapy)

          -  Activity of IDUA enzyme below 10% of lower reference level in leucocytes or cultured
             skin fibroblasts, AND presence of one pathogenic mutation in each of the alleles of
             the IDUA gene

          -  Increased age‐related urinary levels of GAGs (before enzyme replacement therapy), AND
             presence of one pathogenic mutation in each of the alleles of the IDUA gene

          -  A patient diagnosed as having no or mild MPS I‐related intellectual disability (able
             to report their own subjective symptoms) by the principal investigator or
             subinvestigator (Part 1 only)

          -  A patient who has received laronidase continuously for at least 12 weeks and has
             received laronidase on a stable dosage for 2 weeks immediately before the initial
             administration of JR‐171, except for a laronidase naïve patient or a patient who has
             previously been treated by HSCT)

          -  Female patient or male patient whose co-partners are of child-bearing potential agree
             to use a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient who received gene therapy treatment

          -  A patient who, in the opinion of the principal investigator or subinvestigator, cannot
             undergo lumbar puncture, including those who have a difficulty in taking a position
             for lumbar puncture due to joint contracture and those who are likely to develop
             dyspnea during lumbar puncture

          -  A patient who is pregnant or lactating

          -  A patient who has developed serious drug allergy or hypersensitivity that, in the
             opinion of the principal investigator or subinvestigator, is inappropriate for
             participation in the study

          -  A patient who has received another investigational product within 12 months before
             enrollment in the study

          -  A patient who, in the opinion of the principal investigator or subinvestigator, is
             ineligible to participate in the study out of consideration for the participant
             safety.
