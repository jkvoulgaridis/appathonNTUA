  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify genes and proteins responsible for nerve and muscle
      disorders by studying genetic material from individuals with neuromuscular disease, as well
      as their family members. We are interested in recruiting many types of neuromuscular disease
      including; Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and
      limb-girdle muscle dystrophy (LGMD). There are still many patients diagnosed with muscular
      dystrophy but have no causative gene implicated in their disease. Using molecular genetics to
      unravel the biochemical basis of these neuromuscular disorders should lead to more accurate
      diagnosis of these disorders and should lead to potential therapies.

      We are looking to discover new disease genes responsible for the neuromuscular diseases found
      in our participants and their families. Our research lab has a long history of identifying
      novel genes responsible for various forms of neuromuscular disease including; DMD gene, the
      many of the sarcoglycans, obscurin, and filamin. Each discovery has resulted in advances in
      our ability to develop diagnostic tests which benefit patients and their families by
      providing accurate diagnosis, presymptomatic and/or prenatal testing. Genotype-phenotype
      correlation studies have increased our understanding of the natural history of these rare
      disorders benefiting patients through better prognostic determinations by clinicians.
      Biochemical and pathological analysis of muscle biopsies in patients with known and unknown
      types of neuromuscular disease has led to new insights into disease pathophysiology, which we
      hope will aid in finding new treatments.

        The samples used in this study will be derived from individuals at risk for, or suffering
        from, neuromuscular disease, generally resulting in clinical weakness of one or more muscle
        groups.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. having a clinical and/or pathological diagnosis of a muscular dystrophy

          2. being the first degree relative of someone with such a diagnosis

          3. having had a muscle biopsy if diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease

          4. willingness to provide a skin biopsy for research only

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. not having such a diagnosis and not being related to such an individual

          2. not wishing to participate

          3. being incapable of giving consent and not having a legal guardian willing or able to
             do so
