  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition associated with a low level of parathyroid hormone
      (PTH) in the blood. Hypoparathyroidism can be genetic and show up in childhood, or it can
      occur later in life. If it occurs later, it is usually due to damage or removal of the
      parathyroid glands during neck surgery. PTH helps control the amount of calcium in blood,
      kidneys, and bones. Low levels of calcium in the blood can cause a person to feel sick. It
      can cause cramping or tingling in the hands, feet, or other parts of the body. A very low
      blood calcium can cause fainting or seizures.

      The standard treatment for hypoparathyroidism is a form of vitamin D (calcitriol) and calcium
      supplements. Keeping normal blood levels of calcium can be difficult. Sometimes there is too
      much calcium in the urine even if the calcium levels in the blood are low. High calcium in
      the kidneys and urine can cause problems such as calcium deposits in the kidney
      (nephrocalcinosis) or kidney stones. High levels of calcium in the kidney may keep the kidney
      from functioning normally. Treatment with PTH will replace the hormone you are missing. Your
      disease may be better controlled on PTH than on calcium and calcitriol.

      Researchers at the NIH have conducted prior studies to establish synthetic human parathyroid
      hormone 1-34 (HPTH) as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Other studies have shown that PTH
      may improve calcium levels in blood and urine. The primary purpose of this research study is
      to evaluate the effects of synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 (HPTH) replacement
      therapy on bone in adults and teenagers with hypoparathyroidism.

      The study takes 5 (Omega) years to complete and requires 12 inpatient visits to the National
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. The first visit will help the study
      team decide whether you are eligible. This visit will last 2 to 3 days. After taking calcium
      and calcitriol for 1 - 7 months you will return to the NIH Clinical Center for the baseline
      visit. The baseline visit is the visit that you will start your PTH; you will also undergo a
      bone biopsy during the visit. The baseline visit may last 7 to 10 days. You will then take
      PTH twice a day for 5 years. You will be asked to return to the NIH clinical center every 6
      months for 10 follow-up visits. During one of the follow-up visits, you will have a second
      bone biopsy taken from the other hip. That second biopsy will be done after 1 year, 2 years,
      or 4 years of taking PTH; the researchers will assign the timing of the second biopsy
      randomly. You will be asked to go to your local laboratory for blood and urine tests between
      each follow up visit. At first the blood tests will occur at least once a week. Later, you
      will need to go to your local laboratory for blood tests at least once a month and urine
      tests once every 3 months. The local laboratory visits and follow-up visits at the NIH
      Clinical Center will help the study team determine whether the HPTH treatment is controlling
      your hypoparathyroidism.

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the skeletal effects of hormone
      replacement therapy with HPTH in hypoparathyroidism.

      Study Population

      This study will enroll up to 69 subjects with physician-diagnosed hypoparathyroidism.&lt;TAB&gt;

      Design

      This study will treat hypoparathyroid individuals with synthetic human PTH 1-34 (HPTH) for up
      to 5 years, periodically assessing skeletal changes through biochemical markers and
      iliac-crest bone biopsies, which will allow for ultrastructural, cellular, and molecular
      analyses.

      With respect to HPTH treatment, this study is a single group, within-subjects, repeated
      measures treatment trial. With respect to all bone biopsy analyses, the design is a parallel
      group design with each subject allocated to one of the 3 biopsy follow-up times: 1, 2 or 4
      years after initiation of HPTH therapy. Post-baseline biopsy timing will be randomly assigned
      (1:1.2:1.4, respectively) to each subject, stratified by gender and by menopausal status,
      when relevant. Changes from baseline (time 0) to 1, 2 and 4-years will be compared. Subjects
      who were on conventional therapy in the former version of the protocol will also be
      randomized into the new study design. In contrast to new subjects, whose biopsy is performed
      at the end of the conventional care run-in period, the pre-conventional care biopsy will be
      used as the baseline for the those subjects entering the new design after having been on
      conventional care in the older protocol. Because it is not known with certainty what effects
      duration of time on conventional therapy will have on biopsy results, randomization will also
      be stratified on status of prior study participation. The subjects who were on HPTH therapy
      at the time of the protocol redesign are followed as a separate group under this protocol.

    <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, so the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Cn.BV/TV is one of 8 primary endpoints measured from the bone biopsy. The changes in Cn.BV/TV outcome between two time-points are being reported. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Cn.ES/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measure demonstrates the percentage of the cancellous bone surface that contains unmineralized bone (osteoid). The region of interest is the predefined area of total bone that is being measured. The changes in Cn.ES/BS between two time-points are being reported.</description>

    <description>Mental Health (MH) Domain scores are derived from the SF36 Health Survey taken by the participant. The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire assessing 4 physical domains: physical function, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health, and 4 mental domains: vitality, emotional role limitations, social function and mental health. From the 36 questions asked, a scoring tool derives SF36 domain scores for each of the eight domains. These domain scores are scaled to range from 0 to 100 with a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Lower scores indicate more disability; and, higher scores indicate less disability. The MH domain assesses the extent to which the participant is, among other things, feeling full of pep, is happy, is feeling calm and peaceful, is very nervous, or is feeling worn out and tired.</description>

    <description>The 8 primary bone biopsy measures were to be adjusted HPTH dose by fitting the primary bone biopsy model with both linear and quadratic dose covariates added to the model. However, the study was terminated early resulting in only 5, 5, and 2 participants having their biopsies at 1, 2, and 4 years respectively. To add additional linear and quadratic dose covariates to the statistical model with an already small sample sizes would highly risk over-parameterizing the model.

    <description>As a sensitivity analysis, the 8 primary bone biopsy measures were to be adjusted for female menopausal status, by fitting the primary bone biopsy model with a menopausal status covariate added to the model. However, the study was terminated early resulting in only 5, 5, and 2 participants having their biopsies at 1, 2, and 4 years respectively. Furthermore, 3 males would need to be removed from the model leaving 4, 3, 2 participants with bone biopsies with an additional degree of freedom consumed for the menopausal status covariate. Thus, the planned mixed models analysis was not performed since with such small samples sizes random fluctuations in the data could give misleading erroneous results.</description>

        <title>Change in Bone Biopsy Cancellous Bone Volume (Cn.BV/TV)</title>
        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, so the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Cn.BV/TV is one of 8 primary endpoints measured from the bone biopsy. The changes in Cn.BV/TV outcome between two time-points are being reported. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes.</description>

        <population>The Bone Biopsy Analysis Population was used for the primary bone biopsy biomarkers. The Bone Biopsy Population consisted of all participants in Cohorts 2 and 3 who completed both their baseline and randomized 1, 2, or 4 year bone biopsies.</population>

            <description>Cohort 2 consists of participants previously treated with conventional care (CC) throughout the original protocol. Cohort 3 consisted of all new participants. Efficacy outcomes were only analyzed for Cohorts 2 and 3. (Cohort 1 consisted of previously enrolled participants who were on HPTH therapy on the original protocol and continued on HPTH on the new study as a separate group. These participants were not randomized to a bone biopsy year, nor did they have additional biopsies performed. Cohort 1 participants were followed for safety outcomes only. )</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, so the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ct.Po.N is a bone biopsy measure that assess the amount of holes in the cortical bone within a predetermined area of cortical bone. The changes in Cn.BV/TV outcome between two time-points are being reported. Cortical bone with a higher number of holes may be at greater risk of fracture. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <title>Change in Cancellous Mineralizing Surface (Bone Surface Based)(Cn.MS/BS)</title>
        <description>Following their baseline bone biopsy, 5, 5, and 2 participants were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at years 1, 2, and 4 after the start of HPTH therapy, respectively. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced in size due to withdrawal and the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Cn.MS/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measure demonstrates the percentage of the cancellous bone surface that is actively forming bone. The region of interest is the predefined area of total bone that is being measured. The changes in Cn.MS/BS between two time-points are being reported.</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ec.MS/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measure demonstrates the percentage of the endocortical bone surface that is actively forming bone. The region of interest is the predefined area of total bone that is being measured. The changes in Ec.MS/BS between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ic.MS/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measure demonstrates the percentage of the intracortical bone surface that is actively forming bone. The region of interest is the predefined area of total bone that is being measured. The changes in Ic.MS/BS between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Tb.N is measured from the bone biopsy. Tb.N is the measure of the average number of trabeculae per unit length. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes. The changes in Tb.N between two time-points are being reported.</description>

        <description>Participants (Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ct.Th, measured from the bone biopsy, is the average thickness of the inner and outer cortices. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes. The changes in Ct.Th between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Following their baseline bone biopsy, 5, 5, and 2 participants were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at years 1, 2, and 4 after the start of HPTH therapy, respectively. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced in size due to withdrawal and the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group.

        <title>Change in Cancellous Bone Mineral Apposition Rate (Cn.MAR)</title>
        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Cn.MAR is measured from the bone biopsy. This measures the rate mineral is being laid down per day in a predefined region of the cancellous bone. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes. The changes in Cn.MAR between two time-points are being reported.</description>

        <title>Change in Cancellous Eroded Surface / Bone Surface (Cn.ES/BS)</title>
        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Cn.ES/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measure demonstrates the percentage of the cancellous bone surface that contains unmineralized bone (osteoid). The region of interest is the predefined area of total bone that is being measured. The changes in Cn.ES/BS between two time-points are being reported.</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ec.O.Th is measured from the bone biopsy. This measures the thickness of the unmineralized bone (osteoid) on the inner side of the cortex(endocortical). The changes in Cn.AjAR between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ec.OS/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measures the rate mineral is being laid down per day on the inner cortical (endocortical) surface in a predefined region of cortical bone. The changes in Ec.OS/BS between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ec.AjAR is measured from the bone biopsy. Ec.AjAR represents the endocortical mineral apposition rate (Ec.MAR) averaged over the entire osteoid surface. This is another histomorphometric way to evaluate the rate at which bone is laid down on the inner cortical surface per day. The changes in Ec.AjAR between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ic.MAR is measured from the bone biopsy. This measures the rate mineral is being laid down per day within the middle of the cortex (intracortical) surface in a predefined region of cortical bone. The changes in Ic.MAR between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. Ic.ES/BS is measured from the bone biopsy. This measure demonstrates the percentage of bone surface within the middle of the cortex that is resorbed (eroded). The region of interest is the predefined area of total bone that is being measured. The changes in Ic.ES/BS between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. The Cortex 1 Spectral Calcium Mean is a measure of mean bone calcium content of the bone cortex 1 based on the mineralization density distribution (BMDD) from the back-scattered electron imaging scan of the bone biopsies. The changes in Ic.MAR between two time-points are being reported.

        <title>Change in Cortex 1 Spectral Calcium Width From the Back-Scattered Electron Imaging of Bone-Biopsies</title>
        <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. The Cortex 1 Spectral Calcium Low is a measure of the area of low bone cortex 1 mineralization based on the mineralization density distribution (BMDD) from the back-scattered electron imaging scan of the bone biopsies. The changes in Ic.MAR between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

          <title>Change in Cortex 1 Spectral Calcium High From the Back-Scattered Electron Imaging of Bone-Biopsies</title>
          <description>Participants (in Cohorts 2 and 3) were randomized to receive their second bone biopsy at year 1, 2, or 4 after the start of HPTH therapy. For Cohort 2, the baseline bone biopsy was completed at the start of CC on the original protocol. For Cohort 3, the baseline biopsy was completed immediately prior to the first HPTH dose. Because the sample sizes for the 1-, 2- and 4-year biopsies are reduced due to the early termination of the study, the 2-, and 4-year biopsies were collapsed into one biopsy year group. The Cortex 1 Spectral Calcium High is a measure of the area of high bone cortex 1 mineralization based on the mineralization density distribution (BMDD) from the back-scattered electron imaging scan of the bone biopsies. The changes in Ic.MAR between two time-points are being reported. The n's in the outcome measure table refer to the number of complete records (non-missing baseline and post-baseline measures).</description>

        <description>Severity is measured using four separate items of the FSI questionnaire that assesses how the participant felt on their most, least, and average fatigue days in the past week as well as current fatigue. Participants score their level of fatigue for each item on an 11-point scale (0=not at all fatigued, 10=as fatigued as I could be). An average is taken of sum of these 4 scores. The average severity score can range from 0 to 10. A higher average severity score indicates that the participant is experiencing more severe fatigue.</description>

The average severity score can range from 0 to 10. A higher average severity score indicates that the participant is experiencing more severe fatigue.</description>

        <title>SF36 Bodily Pain Domain</title>
        <description>The Bodily Pain (BP) domain scores are derived from the SF36 Health Survey taken by the participant. The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire assessing 4 physical domains: physical function, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health, and 4 mental domains: vitality, emotional role limitations, social function and mental health. From the 36 questions asked, a scoring tool derives SF36 domain scores for each of the eight domains. These domain scores are scaled to range from 0 to 100 with a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Lower scores indicate more disability; and, higher scores indicate less disability.

          <title>SF36 Bodily Pain Domain</title>
          <description>The Bodily Pain (BP) domain scores are derived from the SF36 Health Survey taken by the participant. The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire assessing 4 physical domains: physical function, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health, and 4 mental domains: vitality, emotional role limitations, social function and mental health. From the 36 questions asked, a scoring tool derives SF36 domain scores for each of the eight domains. These domain scores are scaled to range from 0 to 100 with a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Lower scores indicate more disability; and, higher scores indicate less disability. The BP domain scores indicate to what extent a participant's bodily pain hinders their performance of daily activities.</description>

The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire assessing 4 physical domains: physical function, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health, and 4 mental domains: vitality, emotional role limitations, social function and mental health. From the 36 questions asked, a scoring tool derives SF36 domain scores for each of the eight domains. These domain scores are scaled to range from 0 to 100 with a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Lower scores indicate more disability; and, higher scores indicate less disability. The RE Domain score assesses the extent to which the emotional condition of the participant, e.g. feeling depressed or anxious, limits his/her daily functioning and ability to perform roles, such as in cutting down on the amount of time spent on work or other activities and accomplishing less than he/she would like to.</description>

        <title>SF36 Mental Health Domain</title>
        <description>Mental Health (MH) Domain scores are derived from the SF36 Health Survey taken by the participant. The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire assessing 4 physical domains: physical function, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health, and 4 mental domains: vitality, emotional role limitations, social function and mental health. From the 36 questions asked, a scoring tool derives SF36 domain scores for each of the eight domains. These domain scores are scaled to range from 0 to 100 with a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Lower scores indicate more disability; and, higher scores indicate less disability. The MH domain assesses the extent to which the participant is, among other things, feeling full of pep, is happy, is feeling calm and peaceful, is very nervous, or is feeling worn out and tired.</description>

        <title>SF36 Social Function Domain</title>
        <description>Social Function (SF) Domain scores are derived from the SF36 Health Survey taken by the participant. The SF-36 is a validated questionnaire assessing 4 physical components: physical function, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health, and 4 mental components: vitality, emotional role limitations, social function and mental health. From the 36 questions asked, a scoring tool is used to calculate each of the eight domain scores. The scoring tool transforms the score into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. SF36 domain scores are scaled to have a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The SF Domain assesses the level of a participant's social activities and interaction with significant others such as family members, friends, neighbours and other social relations. Lower scores indicate more disability; higher scores indicate less disability with respect to social function.</description>

To add additional linear and quadratic dose covariates to the statistical model with an already small sample sizes would highly risk over-parameterizing the model.

However, the study was terminated early resulting in only 5, 5, and 2 participants having their biopsies at 1, 2, and 4 years respectively. Furthermore, 3 males would need to be removed from the model leaving 4, 3, 2 participants with bone biopsies with an additional degree of freedom consumed for the menopausal status covariate. Thus, the planned mixed models analysis was not performed since with such small samples sizes random fluctuations in the data could give misleading erroneous results.</description>

Due to varying lengths of time on each participant was on HPTH, these BMD assessment times were collapsed for purposes of analysis to: baseline, 6-month on HPTH therapy, last visit on HPTH therapy, and the post-HPTH follow-up visit The 1/3 Radius BMD is one of 6 bone regions measurements of bone mineralization density assessed by DXA. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Z-score of AP Spine Bone Mineralization Density (BMD) Assessed by DXA</title>
        <description>The DXA BMD were assessed every 6 months over 5 years, and at a follow-up visit post-HPTH therapy. Due to varying lengths of time on each participant was on HPTH, these BMD assessment times were collapsed for purposes of analysis to: baseline, 6-month on HPTH therapy, last visit on HPTH therapy, and the post-HPTH follow-up visit. The AP Spine BMD is one of 6 bone regions measurements of bone mineralization density assessed by DXA. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Z-score of Total Hip Bone Mineralization Density (BMD) Assessed by DXA</title>
        <description>The DXA BMD measures were assessed every 6 months over 5 years, and at a follow-up visit post-HPTH therapy. Due to varying lengths of time on each participant was on HPTH, these BMD assessment times were collapsed for purposes of analysis to: baseline, 6-month on HPTH therapy, last visit on HPTH therapy, and the post-HPTH follow-up visit. The Total Hip BMD is one of 6 bone regions measurements of bone mineralization density assessed by DXA. The unit of measure is a z-score. Z-scores are normed to standard populations to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The normal range for a z-score is from -2 to 2. Values above or below this normal range are considered worse outcomes.</description>
