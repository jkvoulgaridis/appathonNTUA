      or in combination with immunotherapies in patients with advanced melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glembatumumab vedotin consists of an antibody attached to a drug, monomethyl auristatin E
      (MMAE), that can kill cancer cells. The fully human antibody is designed to deliver the drug
      to cancer cells by attaching to a protein called glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB) that is expressed
      on the cancer cell. The MMAE is then released inside of the cell, where it interferes with
      cell growth and can lead to cell death of the targeted cell, as well as neighboring cells.
      Varlilumab is a fully human antibody that binds to CD27. This antibody allows the body's
      immune system to work against cancer cells. Nivolumab is a fully human antibody and
      pembrolizumab is a humanized antibody. Both bind to PD-1. CDX-301 is a fully human protein
      that helps boost production of certain white blood cells. This protein allows the body's
      immune system to work against tumor cells.

      Eligible patients who enroll in the study will receive treatment with one of the following:
      glembatumumab vedotin, glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab, glembatumumab vedotin and
      CDX-301 or glembatumumab vedotin and either nivolumab OR pembrolizumab.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is
      responding to treatment and for any side effects that may occur.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 to 9 weeks following treatment initiation until disease progression.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved best overall response of complete or partial response. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST version 1.1), Complete Response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions, Partial Response (PR), &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no progression in non-target lesions and no new lesions. ORR was the primary outcome for Cohorts 1-3 and a secondary outcome for Cohort 4.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events of the Combination of Glembatumumab Vedotin and CDX-301 (in Cohort 4).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months following the screening visit</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients experiencing one or more adverse events.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start date of partial or complete response (whichever is achieved first) to first date that recurrent of progressive disease is objectively documented, assessed up to 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is the number of months from the time criteria are first met for either CR or PR, until the first date that PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated every 6 to 9 weeks following treatment initiation until progression.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or progression in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of Activity to gpNMB Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months following the screening visit</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate if the anti-cancer activity of glembatumumab vedotin as monotherapy or in combination with immunotherapies in advanced melanoma is dependent upon the degree of gpNMB expression in tumor tissue.</description>

          -  Unresectable, histologically-confirmed advanced (Stage III or Stage IV) melanoma

          -  Disease progression during or after the last anticancer therapy received. For Cohort
             3, progression must have occurred during the PD-1 targeted CPI (checkpoint inhibitor)
             treatment and the investigator has deemed it appropriate to continue treatment with
             the PD-1 targeted CPI beyond confirmed disease progression

          -  No more than one prior chemotherapy-containing regimen for advanced disease.

          -  Prior treatments received must include at least one CPI inhibitor (e.g., anti-CTLA-4,
             PD-1-, PD-L1-targeted immunotherapy) and for patients with a BRAF mutation at least
             one BRAF- or MEK-targeted therapy, unless patients are not candidates for, or refused,
             these therapies. For cohort 3, prior treatment received must include a PD-1 targeted
             CPI administered during the most recent disease progression and for patients with BRAF
             mutation at least one BRAF- or MEK-targeted therapy when appropriate

          -  The study site will submit paraffin-embedded tumor tissue obtained from the patient
             for gpNMB analysis. Patients may require a biopsy if recent tumor tissue is not
             available. Patients in cohort 2 and 3 must submit a recently obtained biopsy of the
             skin fold for gpNMB analysis. Patients in Cohort 4 will submit a tumor tissue sample
             while on study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 to 1

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               4. Chemotherapy within 21 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

               5. Investigational therapy within 2 weeks (or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is
                  longer)

          -  Patients with ocular melanoma

          -  Neuropathy that is moderate (Grade 2) or worse.
