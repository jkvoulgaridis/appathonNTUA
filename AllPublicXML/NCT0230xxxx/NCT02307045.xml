  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The integrity of endothelial glucocalyx plays a vital role in vascular permeability and
      inflammation. Smoking cessation is related with improved vascular function and is a key
      component of secondary cardiovascular prevention. Pharmacotherapy is a standard component of
      evidence based smoking cessation treatment. This study was designed to determine the effects
      medically-aided smoking cessation on glucocalyx thickness and arterial elasticity smoking
      cessation programs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine smokers without cardiovascular disease treated with
      transdermal nicotine patches and/or varenicline at before, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after
      treatment during validated smoking cessation program. The investigators will measure changes
      between baseline and 4,12,24, and 48 weeks after treatment of :

        1. exhaled carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) and self-reported number of cigarretes/day

        2. carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVc m/sec-Complior SP ALAM) and augmentation index
           (AI %-Arteriograph,TensioMed)

        3. perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (ranged from 5-25
           micrometers) using Sideview Darkfield imaging (Microscan, Glycocheck). The PBR in
           microvessels is the cell-poor layer which results from the phase separation between the
           flowing red blood cells (RBC) and plasma. The PBR includes the most luminal part of
           glycocalyx that does allow cell penetration. Increased PBR is considered an accurate
           index of reduced endothelial glucocalyx thickness because of a for deeper penetration of
           the RBC in the glucocalyx

        4. oxidative stress, thrombosis and inflammatory biomarkers in blood samples.

      Non smokers of similar age and sex will serve as controls.
