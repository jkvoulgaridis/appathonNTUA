      The investigators plan to develop and adapt a community-partnered intervention using
      community health promoters (&quot;Stroke Promoters&quot;) to deliver messaging regarding stroke symptom
      awareness and the need for calling 911 after stroke onset. The study investigators will
      implement this intervention in south side Chicago communities and measure the impact on
      symptom onset to hospital arrival times and EMS utilization using an interrupted time-series
      analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CEERIAS community-partnered research project has the following specific aims:

        1. To examine personal, community, and cultural barriers to calling 911 after stroke onset
           and adapt a culturally-tailored intervention for delivery in multi-ethnic communities
           (African American, Hispanic, non-Hispanic White) surrounding a hospital on the south
           side of Chicago;

        2. To implement a culturally-adapted stroke awareness and action program and monitor its
           penetration and adoption using the RE-AIM (Reach, Evaluate, Adoption, Implementation,
           Maintenance) framework in multi-ethnic communities on the south side of Chicago; and

        3. To assess change in early hospital arrival and EMS use at a intervention hospital before
           and after the community intervention.

      For aim 1, the investigators will explore and identify facilitators and barriers to calling
      911 for stroke through focus groups conducted and involving key stakeholders including
      children and adults, stroke survivors, neighborhood alderman/legislators, spiritual and
      community leaders, school teachers, and stroke advocacy group members. The CEERIAS team will
      test and culturally refine our core community-partnered pilot intervention for
      implementation.

      For aim 2, the investigators will identify and train Stroke Promoters from collaborating
      community organizations on the adapted intervention techniques and messages, provide
      materials for public dissemination, and evaluate and monitor adoption and implementation in
      the surrounding communities.

      For aim 3, the investigators will perform an interrupted time-series analysis of EMS use and
      early hospital arrival among stroke patients before and after our intervention in south side
      Chicago communities. The research team will also compare time trends in EMS use and early
      hospital arrival for stroke with concurrent control PSCs on the north side of Chicago and
      PSCs in St. Louis.

      If the intervention is successful, the effect will be an increase in EMS use for stroke which
      will translate into earlier treatment for stroke and reduced death and disability. The
      CEERIAS results will be generalizable to other urban communities in the US and should be
      salient to other health emergencies such as heart attack and cardiac arrest.

    <measure>Early Arrival After Stroke Onset</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years; January 2013 to December 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Early hospital arrival was defined as the proportion of stroke patients arriving within three hours from symptom onset to intervention hospital. When symptom onset time was unknown or missing, last well-known time was used as symptom onset time. When both symptom onset time and last well-known time were unknown or missing, that admission was treated as late arrival.</description>

    <measure>Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Utilization for Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years; January 2013 to December 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Emergency medical services (EMS) utilization (%) was defined as the proportion of stroke patients arriving to the emergency department by EMS, as opposed to private transport/taxi/other from home/scene. Admissions with Chicago Fire Department (CFD) record confirmed EMS arrival were considered as EMS arrival. All others were considered as non-EMS arrival. The effect size is measures a change in slope: percent of participants per month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knowledge and Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specified outcomes were 1) knowledge and attitudes and 2) self-efficacy. The standardized test for assessing knowledge and behavioral intent will be the Stroke Action Test, a validated assessment tool to assess emergency responses to various stroke and non-stroke scenarios. STAT has excellent reliability and takes, on average, 5 minutes to complete. Scores range from 0-100% and are the average correct responses for each of 28 items in the STAT questionnaire. For self-efficacy, we will use the Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree) on the following questions based on a previous study: &quot;1. I would not be able to tell if someone is having a stroke; and 2. If I saw someone having a stroke, I would not know what to do.&quot; Scores range from 2-8 units on the scale. For STAT, higher values indicate better outcome while for self-efficacy, lower values indicate better outcome.</description>

    <description>A culturally-adapted stroke awareness and action program will be delivered by trained Stroke Promoters in the targeted neighborhoods in the south side of Chicago. Community Stroke Promoters will be trained on 1) the benefits of early recognition and EMS utilization for stroke (i.e. stroke centers, tPA), 2) culturally-adapted solutions to current barriers (i.e. misperceptions about vulnerability, severity, mistrust, costs), and 3) cues to aid in stroke recognition and immediate action. The intervention will take place at community settings throughout a 1-year period.</description>

          <title>Early Arrival After Stroke Onset</title>
          <description>Early hospital arrival was defined as the proportion of stroke patients arriving within three hours from symptom onset to intervention hospital. When symptom onset time was unknown or missing, last well-known time was used as symptom onset time. When both symptom onset time and last well-known time were unknown or missing, that admission was treated as late arrival.</description>
          <population>The intervention hospital is located on the south side of Chicago, within the target community intervention area. Age range of patients was 19 to 103; a majority of the patients were African-Americans, approximately half were 66 years or older and female.</population>

            <other_analysis_desc>Using SAS PROC TIMESERIES, individual admission data were aggregated into monthly time series data to calculate a monthly early arrival rate. In this procedure, we also generated seasonally adjusted time series data to take into account a seasonal pattern. Using the seasonally adjusted time series data, we conducted linear regression analysis for time series data in PROC AUTOREG. The statistical hypothesis of the regression model was that there are a level change and a slope change after the intervention. In the regression model, we included a time variable to account for a natural trend prior to the intervention introduction (or in absence of the intervention). We assumed that the patient population was stable during the five-year period and no other factors than the intervention affected the outcome; no other potential confounding factors were not considered. A backward elimination was used to correct for autocorrelation. Maximum likelihood method was used to estimate parameters.</other_analysis_desc>

        <description>Specified outcomes were 1) knowledge and attitudes and 2) self-efficacy. The standardized test for assessing knowledge and behavioral intent will be the Stroke Action Test, a validated assessment tool to assess emergency responses to various stroke and non-stroke scenarios. STAT has excellent reliability and takes, on average, 5 minutes to complete. Scores range from 0-100% and are the average correct responses for each of 28 items in the STAT questionnaire. For self-efficacy, we will use the Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree) on the following questions based on a previous study: &quot;1. I would not be able to tell if someone is having a stroke; and 2. If I saw someone having a stroke, I would not know what to do.&quot; Scores range from 2-8 units on the scale. For STAT, higher values indicate better outcome while for self-efficacy, lower values indicate better outcome.</description>

          <description>Neighborhoods in the south side of Chicago surrounding 2 primary stroke center hospitals will be targeted for a community-partnered stroke awareness and action educational campaign. To assess the effectiveness of this intervention, the investigators will monitor early hospital arrival and EMS use for stroke over a 60-month period at the 2 primary stroke center hospitals using an interrupted time-series analysis.
Community-based Stroke Awareness Program: A culturally-adapted stroke awareness and action program will be delivered by trained Stroke Promoters in the targeted neighborhoods in the south side of Chicago. They will be trained on 1) benefits of early recognition and EMS utilization for stroke (ie stroke centers, tPA) 2) culturally-adapted solutions to current barriers (ie misperceptions about vulnerability, severity, mistrust, costs) and 3) cues to aid in stroke recognition and immediate action. The intervention will take place at community settings throughout a 1-year period.</description>
