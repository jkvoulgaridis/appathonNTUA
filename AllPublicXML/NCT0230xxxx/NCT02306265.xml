    <textblock>
      The aim of this recruitment plan (ADAPT-SCR) is to collect image and other data on both
      digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and full-field digital mammography (FFDM) from
      asymptomatic women undergoing screening mammography.

    <textblock>
      ADAPT program consists of 2 recruitment plans (ADAPT-SCR and ADAPT-BX) followed by an
      off-line read of the images and data collected (ADAPT-BIE). This study involves the
      comparison of two devices that can identify abnormalities in routine breast screening and
      diagnostic mammography. Mammography is usually done with full-field digital mammography
      (FFDM), which takes flat, two-dimensional X-ray images of the breast. Doctors use the
      two-dimensional images to look for cancers and other abnormal tissue. The purpose of this
      study is to learn more about the accuracy of full-field digital mammography devices and a new
      mammography device called digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT is similar to full-field
      digital mammography, but can also move around the breast to get X-ray images from different
      angles, which provides a three-dimensional view that doctors can use to look for cancers and
      abnormal tissue. Subjects will undergo routine imaging with FFDM and will also have a DBT
      performed. They will continue with their standard of care treatment as would occur outside of
      the study. Based on the results of the FFDM and DBT, the subject's status will be followed-up
      with routing imaging at approximately 1 year (10-16 months). If the doctor recommends biopsy
      based on the FFDM or DBT, information about the biopsy and cancer determination results will
      be collected. Being in this study does not require subjects to have a biopsy that was not
      recommended by the doctor for normal medical care.

             mammogram within the past 30 days;

          -  Mammography completed on a General Electric (GE) GE FFDM system (with craniocaudal
             (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views) at the site or another clinical facility;
