  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study an experimental drug called pembrolizumab or
      MK-3475 for use in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for patients with
      resectable (surgical removal) or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. In general,
      pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery is sometimes treated with chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy, called neoadjuvant treatment, to shrink the tumor so that surgery
      might be possible. However, this is not always effective at shrinking the tumor enough to
      allow it to be removed with surgery. Recent discoveries suggest that the investigators own
      immune system might have a role in controlling the growth of tumors. Drugs such as
      pembrolizumab can stimulate the immune system against cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether pembrolizumab can be used safely during neoadjuvant treatment and can
      improve the body's immune response against pancreatic cancer.

      Pembrolizumab has been approved for treatment of patients with melanoma but has not been
      proven to be safe or helpful in patients with pancreatic cancer and is not approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose.
