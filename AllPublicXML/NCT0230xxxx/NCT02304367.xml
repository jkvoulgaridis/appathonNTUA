      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of KRN23 treatment on:

        -  Increasing serum phosphorus levels in adults with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia

        -  Improvement in TIO/ENS-associated osteomalacia as determined by osteoid thickness
           (O.Th), osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS), osteoid volume/bone volume (OV/BV) and
           mineralization lag time (MLt).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a clinical diagnosis of TIO/ENS based on evidence of excessive FGF23 that is not
             amenable to cure by surgical excision of the offending tumor/lesion (documented by
             investigator)

          2. Be â¥18 years of age

          3. Have a fasting serum phosphorus level &lt;2.5 mg/dL

          4. Have an iFGF23 level â¥ 100 pg/mL by Kainos assay

          5. Have a ratio of renal tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular
             filtration rate (TmP/GFR) &lt;2.5 mg/dL

          6. Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â¥60 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault
             formula). Subjects with eGFR â¥30 but &lt;60 mL/min will be considered eligible as long as
             in the opinion of the investigator the decline in renal function is not related to
             nephrocalcinosis.

          7. Have a corrected serum calcium level &lt;10.8 mg/dL

          8. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             Screening and Baseline and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the
             study. Females considered not to be of childbearing potential include those who have
             not experienced menarche, are post-menopausal (defined as having no menses for at
             least 12 months without an alternative medical cause) or are permanently sterile due
             to total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.

          9. Participants of childâbearing potential or fertile males with partners of
             child-bearing potential who are sexually active must consent to use a highly effective
             method of contraception as determined by the site Investigator from the period
             following the signing of the informed consent through the final Safety Follow-up TC.

         10. Be willing to provide access to prior medical records to determine eligibility
             including imaging, biochemical, and diagnostic, medical, and surgical history data

         11. Provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained, and
             prior to any research-related procedures

         12. Be willing and able to complete all aspects of the study, adhere to the study visit
             schedule and comply with the assessments (in the opinion of the investigator)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a prior diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and/or

             immunodeficiency

          3. Are pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or are planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study

          4. Have participated in an investigational drug or device trial within 30 days prior to
             Screening or are currently enrolled in another study of an investigational product or
             device

          5. Have used a therapeutic monoclonal antibody, including KRN23, within 90 days prior to
             Screening or have a history of allergic or anaphylactic reactions to any mAb

          6. Have or a have a history of any hypersensitivity to KRN23 excipients that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

          7. Have used a pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite or its analog (e.g., calcitriol,
             doxercalciferol, and paricalcitol), phosphate, or aluminum hydroxide antacids (e.g.,
             MaaloxÂ® and MylantaÂ®) within 2 weeks prior to Screening or during the study

          8. Have used medication to suppress PTH (e.g., SensiparÂ®, cinacalcet, calcimimetics)
             within 2 months prior to Screening

          9. Have a history of malignancy within 5 years of study entry with the exception of
             PMT-MCT (Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors of the mixed connective tissue type) tumors
             or non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell skin cancer

         10. Have donated blood or blood products within 60 days prior to Screening

         11. Have a history of allergic reaction to or have shown adverse reactions to a
             tetracycline (e.g., tetracycline HCl and demeclocycline), benzodiazepines, fentanyl or
             lidocaine

         12. Have any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, could
             present a concern for either subject safety or difficulty with data interpretation
