      The administration of SIR-Spheres microspheres (yttrium-90 resin microspheres) is a form of
      selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for the treatment of patients with primary and
      secondary liver tumours. The primary objective is to observe the real-life clinical
      application of radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres and the impact of the treatment in clinical
      practice. Secondary objectives are to observe safety and effectiveness of SIR-Spheres
      treatment in terms of adverse events, Overall Survival (OS), Progression-free survival (PFS),
      technical considerations, liver PFS and Quality of Life (QoL) + subgroup analyses

      Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also called radioembolisation (RE), with
      SIR-Spheres microspheres is an endovascular procedure, included within the interventional
      oncologic technologies to treat primary and secondary liver tumours. Using a microcatheter, a
      precise dose of resin microspheres is released in the hepatic artery, where they are carried
      into the arterioles and selectively lodge in the tumour microvasculature. The microspheres
      are loaded with the radioactive yttrium-90, a high-energy beta-emitting isotope with a
      half-life of 64.1 hours. Following administration, 94% of the radiation is delivered in 11
      days. Previous reports on the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 resin microspheres for the
      treatment of primary and secondary liver tumours are very promising. In order to further
      improve the understanding of this therapy in its true clinical setting, the Cardiovascular
      and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) initiated the CIRSE Registry for
      SIR-Spheres Therapy (CIRT), a phase 4 observational study that aims to collect robust data on
      the real-life clinical practice of radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres microspheres. Further,
      using the quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 with its hepatocellular carcinoma module
      (developed and verified by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer
      (EORTC)), CIRT aims to collect data on the quality of life of patients treated with
      SIR-Spheres microspheres.

    <description>All Patients treated with Radioembolisation with yttrium-90 loaded SIR-Spheres microspheres are asked to be enrolled. In no way will participation in the registry influence the way in which the patient is treated or will it influence the quality of the treatment.
In order to measure the palliative aspect of RE with SIR-Spheres microspheres, CIRT will incorporate a quality-of-life questionnaire. CIRT will be using EORTC's QLQ-C30 with the Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Module to measure changes in the quality of life of the patient.</description>

CIRT will be using EORTC's QLQ-C30 with HCC Module to measure changes in the quality of life of the patient. The quality-of-life questionnaire will be offered to the patient before the treatment, shortly after the treatment (as soon as possible) and at every follow-up. Filling out the quality-of-life questionnaire is entirely voluntary for the patient.</description>
