  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a commonly prescribed drug, metformin, can
      enhance the benefits seen during resistance exercise such as increased muscle mass and
      strength.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle mass and strength are critical determinants not only of a person's quality of life and
      functional independence, but also metabolic health, as muscle is the organ primarily
      responsible for insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The elderly suffer obligatory losses of
      muscle mass and strength, exacerbated by illness and physical inactivity. Progressive
      resistance exercise training (PRT) is the most effective intervention identified to improve
      muscular strength, and combat the muscle atrophy of aging (sarcopenia); however, overall the
      muscle response to PRT is blunted in the elderly and variability of response increased, with
      some individuals actually losing muscle mass. The Bamman and Peterson labs have independently
      been studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the &quot;non-responder&quot; phenotype,
      with the goal of identifying novel intervention strategies to promote mass and strength gains
      to improve function. We hypothesize that the abundance of anti-inflammatory, alternatively
      activated M2 macrophages in muscle predicts response to PRT in the elderly; those with the
      highest number of M2 macrophages and lowest inflammatory gene expression prior to the start
      of training gained the most mass. Further, we determined that metformin treatment increased
      M2 macrophage abundance, and decreased inflammatory cytokine gene expression. These
      provocative findings have led us to our central hypothesis that adjuvant metformin may
      improve the responses to PRT in the elderly by altering the muscle tissue inflammatory
      environment, thereby enhancing mechanisms that drive PRT-induced myofiber hypertrophy.

    <description>The ability of metformin to improve the hypertrophic response to resistance training will be determined. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be used to quantify myofiber cross-sectional area. The percent change in type 2 myofiber size between week 16 and week 0 was used.</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ability of metformin to improve the hypertrophic response at the whole muscle level will be quantified by computed tomography. Percent change in normal density muscle area will be calculated as the difference between week 16 and week 0.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if metformin treatment augments strength gains in conjunction with progressive resistance training by one repetition maximum assessments. Maximum (1RM) leg extension muscle strength was assessed at week 4 (to account for neurological adaptations during the initial stages of the resistance program) and week 16. The percent change from week 4 to week 16 is reported.</description>

Questions related to physical function are scored 0-100. Physical function score = the average score of physical function questions. A z-score is calculated from the physical function score. The physical function norm based score is calculated from the physical function z-score.
Scores above 50 would represent above average physical function where scores below 50 represent below average function.</description>

          <description>Mental Component Norm Based Score Median and inter-quartile ranges of the mental health norm based score are reported as there is not a reported maximum.
Questions related to mental health are scored 0-100. Mental Health score = the average score of mental health questions. A z-score is calculated from the mental health score. The mental component norm based score is calculated from the mental health z-score.
Scores above 50 would represent above average mental health where scores below 50 represent below average mental health.</description>
