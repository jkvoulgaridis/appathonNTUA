      Evaluation of the efficacy, safety and biologic effects of neo-adjuvant treatment with
      vemurafenib + cobimetinib + atezolizumab in patients with limited metastasis of melanoma in
      stage IIIC/IV melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hardly resectable/unresectable limited metastasis in malignant melanoma stages
      IIIC/IV (AJCC 2010) carrying the BRAF V600 mutation, in order to achieve operability are
      enrolled in the NEO-VC-study. The main aim of this study is to achieve operability in a
      higher percentage of patients by neoadjuvant treatment through shrinkage of the tumors.
      Patients with operable stage IV disease show an impressive survival benefit with long term (5
      y.) survival rates around 30 %. Only a percentage of up to 20 % can presently be treated by
      complete metastasectomy. This percentage may be enlarged by pre-treatment with an efficacious
      antitumor drug.

                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (IUD), and copper IUDs.

               3. Hormonal contraceptive methods must be supplemented by a barrier method. The
                  reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration
                  of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.
