  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a superiority research to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of early use of
      oxycodone control release tablet for radiation mucositis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a prospective, randomizing, case-controlled, multi-center clinical
      trial. 174 firstly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who need radical radiation
      therapy will be randomly divided into either early intervention or common intervention group.
      oxycodone control release tablets will be used to control the pain caused by radiation oral
      mucositis when the pain level is mild or moderate, respectively. The primary outcome
      measurement is nutrition status. Quality of life (QOL), the clinical outcomes, and the
      adverse effects are also to be observed.
