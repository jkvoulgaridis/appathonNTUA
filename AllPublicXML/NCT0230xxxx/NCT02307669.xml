  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that aligning digital data on PEF and adherence with the
      patient's own clinical course achieves better asthma control and identifies risks for future
      loss of control, compared to current best practice. The study has an adherence optimisation
      phase, week 1-12 followed by a medication management phase, week 12 to week 32.

      The investigators will compare two asthma education interventions, standard Guideline
      recommended practice and feedback from the individual's own INCA device, which assesses
      inhaler adherence and relates adherence with changes in PEF and symptom scores over time.

      The study has two co-primary endpoints, one will be a comparison of the adherence to therapy
      and the other will be a comparison of the appropriateness of medication prescriptions between
      the two study groups.

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that aligning adherence, inhaler technique and digitally
      recorded PEF to inform patients and as the basis of prescribing decisions achieves better
      inhaler adherence and technique and also allows physicians to make appropriate prescribing
      decisions, compared to current best practice.

      The investigators will compare two asthma education interventions, standard BTS/SIGN
      Guideline recommended practice and feedback from the individual's own INCA device, which
      assesses inhaler adherence and relates adherence with changes in PEF and symptom scores over
      time.

      This education phase is followed by a medication optimisation phase (weeks 12-32) in which
      there are 3 cycles of medication optimisation guided by a digital script. The script either
      adjusts the medications following the GINA recommendation or uses the GINA recommendation but
      is supplemented with data on adherence and PEF that are recorded to digital, time-stamped,
      recording devices.

      The aim of the study is to improve and maintain adherence to preventer therapy, so that
      medication and other costs as well as the quality of life, exacerbation rates are optimal.

    <description>Normal Care group This management is based on the inhaler training recommendations of the BTS/SIGN group (http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/Portals/0/Guidelines/AsthmaGuidelines/sign101%20Jan%202012.pdf) and medication management of the GINA management strategy.
The core features of the &quot;usual care&quot; group are:
The patient's inhaler technique will be checked using a checklist, at each visit. If there are errors these will be corrected using teach-to-goal principals.
Adherence will be discussed and barriers to adherence addressed, using motivational interview techniques.
Written action plans for managing asthma, based on changes in PEF and symptoms will be given.
In follow up, medication changes in response to the above will be directed by these, as suggested by GINA management guidelines using a standardised digital script.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The patient's treatment goal is established and used as the focus of the conversation.
Data from the INCA device including (1) time of use, (2) handling proficiency and (3) inhalation flow rates are discussed, with three graphs as shown in the appendix and derived as discussed. These are aimed to enhance the value of the inhaler.
Data from the electronic PEF and AQLQ are correlated with digitally recorded adherence so that these can be used to account for improvements or declines in these measures.
In follow up, medication changes in response to the above (adherence, PEF, ACT and exacerbations) are made using a standardised digital script.</description>

    <intervention_name>INCA feedback</intervention_name>
    <description>The study team have developed a device which is attached to inhalers that makes an audio recording of the inhaler being used. Analysis of this audio data provides objective evidence of the time of inhaler use, technique of use and the peak inspiratory flow the patient makes each time they use their inhaler. Our preliminary experiences with the information obtained from this device indicate that adherence is poor in patients with severe asthma due to any one the following issues poor time of use, errors in handling and low peak inspiratory flow rates.</description>
