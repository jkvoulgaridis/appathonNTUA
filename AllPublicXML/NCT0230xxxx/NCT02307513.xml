  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's disease, is a rare disorder that causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout the
      body. The signs and symptoms of Behçet's disease may include mouth sores, eye inflammation,
      skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores that vary from person to person and may come and
      go on their own. The exact cause of Behçet's is unknown, but it may be an autoimmune
      disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy
      cells.

      This study will evaluate if apremilast is better than placebo (inactive substance in the same
      form as the drug) for the treatment of oral ulcers in subjects with active Behçet's disease.
      Other manifestations of the disease will also be assessed, such as, pain and tenderness in
      joints, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, and skin disease. This study also will test how
      well the body tolerates apremilast. In addition, the second purpose of the study is to assess
      the safety of apremilast in patients with Behçet's disease.

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. About 204 subjects will
      participate. The placebo-controlled period will be 12 weeks long and patients will receive
      apremilast or placebo. After the 12-week placebo-controlled period, all subjects will receive
      apremilast for 52-week. All participants will have their final study visit 4 weeks after
      stopping apremilast treatment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Oral Ulcer Pain as Measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain of oral ulcers was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). A 100-mm VAS pain scale for oral ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a validated electronic, hand-held device. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was recorded. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Number of Oral Ulcers (Counts) From Baseline Through Week 12 (AUC Week 0-12)</title>
        <description>The area under curve (AUC^85) compared the placebo group and the apremilast 30 mg PO BID group using a two-tailed parametric ANCOVA test at the 0.05 level. The ANCOVA included AUC^85 as the response variable; treatment, sex and region as factors and the number of oral ulcers at baseline as a covariate. The multiple imputation (MI) method was used to impute the missing oral ulcer counts on study visits from Day 1 through Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Oral Ulcer Pain as Measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Pain of oral ulcers was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). A 100-mm VAS pain scale for oral ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a validated electronic, hand-held device. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was recorded. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) consists of 3 component scores: the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index (BDCAI) score, the Patient's Perception of Disease Activity, and the Clinician's Overall Perception of Disease Activity. The BDCAI consists of 12 questions regarding disease manifestations over the previous 4 weeks, including oral and genital disease activity, as well as other manifestations of BD involving the skin, joints, GI tract, eyes, nervous system, and vascular system. The BDCAI score is the sum score of 12 items and ranges from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates higher level of disease activity (worsening), and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Behçet's Disease Quality of Life (BD Qol) Scores at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Behçet's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire was developed to measure the influence of BD on a particpant's life. It consists of 30 self-completed itemized questions that measure disease-related restrictions on the participant's activities and the participant's emotional response to these restrictions. The total score is the sum of all 30 items (each yes scores 1 and each no scores 0), with 0 representing no influence of Behçet's disease on a participant's quality of life and 30 representing the most severe influence. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The scoring system for the Static Physician's Global Assessments was used as follows:
Score 0 = clear in severity and described as clear skin Score 1 = mild in severity and described as presence if 1 to 10 lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) at any anatomical site.
Score 2 = Moderate; presence of 11 to 20 lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) any anatomical site Score 3 = Severe; presence of &gt;20 lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) any anatomical site</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population was defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of IP; Participants had BD skin lesions at baseline. LOCF imputation was used for missing values at Week 12.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Genital Ulcer Pain as Measured by VAS Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Pain of genital ulcers was measured using the visual analog scale. A 100-mm VAS pain scale for genital ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a validated, electronic hand-held device. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was measured by ruler and recorded. When responding to a VAS item, participants specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During the Placebo- Controlled Period</title>
        <description>A TEAE is an adverse event (AE) with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of investigational product and no later than 28 days after the last dose of IP. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. A serious AE is any AE that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constitutes an important medical event. For both AEs and SAEs the investigator assessed the severity of the event according to the grading scale: Mild: asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort and local or noninvasive intervention is indicated or Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, symptoms requiring medical/surgical intervention.</description>

For both AEs and SAEs the investigator assessed the severity of the event according to the grading scale: Mild: asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort and local or noninvasive intervention is indicated or Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, symptoms requiring medical/surgical intervention.</description>
          <population>AAT Population; Apremilast Participants as Treated (AAT) were those who received at least 1 dose of apremilast at any time during the study. Participants were included in the treatment group corresponding to the apremilast dosing regimen they actually received, irrespective of the treatment group to which they were randomized or re-randomized.</population>
