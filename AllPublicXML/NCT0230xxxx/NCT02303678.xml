    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      phase II dose of D2C7-IT (D2C7 Immunotoxin) when delivered intratumorally by
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and
      IV malignant glioma patients, and/or to determine what dose will be considered in a Phase II
      trial. Patients with recurrent WHO grade III and IV malignant glioma who meet eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled into the study. Immediately following the stereotactically-guided
      tumor biopsy conducted as standard of care, up to three additional core biopsies will be
      obtained for molecular genetic testing. After these biopsies are obtained, subjects will have
      up to 2 catheters inserted. If the biopsy indicates a proven diagnosis of recurrent malignant
      glioma (diagnosis results are typically received within 24-48 hours following biopsy), the
      investigators will proceed with the D2C7-IT infusion. If no tumor is identified, the
      catheters will be removed. A continuous intratumoral infusion of D2C7-IT will be administered
      over 72 hours while in the hospital.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT, when
      delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) following confirmatory
      diagnostic biopsy in recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV malignant
      glioma patients, and/or to determine what dose will be considered in a phase II trial. The
      patient will remain in the hospital during the entire infusion. At the completion of the
      infusion, the catheters will be removed within 6 hours and a CT scan will be obtained after
      the catheters are pulled. The patient will be observed in hospital for a minimum of another 6
      hours.

      A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used to determine the MTD of
      D2C7-IT where the first stage involves dose escalation in successive patients until an
      initial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Cohorts of 2 patients will be accrued to
      this study within both stages of the trial. The first patient of each cohort will be observed
      through the completion of the D2C7-IT infusion, before additional patients in that cohort are
      treated. Once the optimal dose level of D2C7-IT is determined (dose escalation completed), a
      total of 27 recurrent patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients will be treated at
      that dose level as a dose expansion cohort.

      Following D2C7-IT infusion, subjects will be evaluated in clinic at 2 weeks for adverse
      events and followed at 4 and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48 weeks.

             based on imaging studies;

          -  Prior histopathology consistent with a supratentorial WHO grade III or IV malignant
             glioma;

          -  Following biopsy, prior to administration of D2C7-IT, the presence of recurrent tumor
             must be confirmed by histopathological analysis;

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the
                  study; however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter
                  placement, platelet count ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo
                  biopsy and catheter insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet
                  transfusion;

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dL prior to biopsy;

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000 cells/mm3 prior to biopsy;

               -  Liver Function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN prior to biopsy (Exception: Patient
                  has known Gilbert's Syndrome or patient has suspected Gilbert's Syndrome, for
                  which additional lab testing of direct and/or indirect bilirubin supports this
                  diagnosis. In these instances, a total bilirubin of ≤ 3.0 x ULN is acceptable.);
                  AST (aspartate aminotransferase)/ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ≤ 2.5 x the ULN

                  limit of normal (ULN) prior to biopsy. Patients with prior history of
                  thrombosis/embolism are allowed to be on anticoagulation, understanding that
                  anti-coagulation will be held in the peri-operative period per the neurosurgical
                  team's recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred. If a
                  patient is on warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) is to be
                  obtained and value should be below 2.0 prior to biopsy;

                  partner is male, or if the patient is a sexually active male, whose partner is a
                  female of child bearing potential, the patient must agree to use appropriate
                  contraceptive measures for the duration of the treatment of the tumor and for 6
                  months afterwards as stated in the informed consent. Female patients of child
                  bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the time of
                  screening and within 48 hours of starting the D2C7-IT infusion

          -  Patients will sign an IRB-approved informed consent form prior to any study-related
             procedures.

          -  Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of
             cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin;

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding;

          -  Patients with contrast-enhancing tumor component crossing the midline, actively
             growing multi-focal tumor, infratentorial tumor or extensive tumor dissemination

             proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups);

          -  Patients who have not completed standard of care treatment prior to participation in
             this trial, i.e. surgical procedure and radiation therapy (at least 59 Gy). Note: If
             tumor is unmethylated, patients are not mandated to have received chemotherapy prior
             to participation in this trial. However, if tumor is methylated, patients must have
             received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participation in this trial.
