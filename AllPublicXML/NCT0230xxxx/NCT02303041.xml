    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well sonidegib and buparlisib work in treating patients with
      basal cell carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body. Sonidegib and buparlisib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of sonidegib (erismodegib) in combination with
      buparlisib (hereby referred to as &quot;LB therapy&quot;) for patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in Smoothened inhibitor-naive patients (Cohort 1) and
      those whose disease is refractory or relapsed on Smoothened inhibitor monotherapy (Cohort 2).

      NOTE: This study does not compare the treatment effect between these 2 dissimilar participant
      groups.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the median duration of response, on or after LB therapy.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of LB therapy.

        -  Assess the histopathologic effect of LB therapy in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline
           and following 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Assess the effect of LB therapy on gene expression including Hedgehog pathway and
           phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

        -  Assess correlation between gene mutations in Smoothened, suppressor of fused homolog
           (Sufu), patched (PTCH), glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli)1, 2 and gene expression
           profiles and response to LB therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and buparlisib PO QD on days 1 to 28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.

                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female subjects

                            suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed

               -  Fertile males, must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of
                  contraception (eg, spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the
                  study, and continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for
                  6 months following the study drug; a condom is required to be used also by
                  vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to
                  prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid; female partner of male
                  study subject should use highly effective contraception during dosing of any
                  study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study therapy

               -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (eg, oral, injected, implanted) are not
                  allowed

               -  Note: woman are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential if
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (eg, age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol
                  &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B or
             hepatitis C

          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
