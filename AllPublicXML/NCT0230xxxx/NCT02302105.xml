  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence to justify the use of the pelvic field is lacking for men with high risk localized
      prostate cancer. An additional randomized study is needed in men with a potential risk of
      nodal involvement to test the hypothesis that the use of the pelvic field contributed to the
      benefit observed in those studies.

      This trial aims to compare the outcomes with whole pelvis RT and Prostate alone RT in
      patients with High risk, non metastatic Prostate cancer with a Lymph nodal &gt;20% with Primary
      5 year Biochemical failure free survival and Secondary Disease free survival, overall
      survival, Acute toxicity, Late toxicity and QOL Patients will be randomized to one of two
      arms Arm 1 Whole pelvis radiotherapy and Arm 2 Prostate only radiotherapy. The Dose
      prescription will be 66 Gy in 25 fractions will be prescribed for the prostate PTV in Arm 2
      an additional 50 Gy in 25 fractions for nodal PTV in patients in Arm 1. An overlap volume at
      rectal-prostate interface will receive 64 Gy/25#.

      All patients will receive hormone therapy starting at least 8 weeks prior to the beginning of
      radiotherapy. They will continue the hormone therapy and later for a total duration of 2-3
      years.
