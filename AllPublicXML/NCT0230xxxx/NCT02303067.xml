      Background:

      - This study is designed for people who need a standard, non-research invasive coronary
      angiogram to find out if they have heart disease. Researchers want to take a computed
      tomography (CT) scan of people s hearts before their procedure to see if this less invasive
      test can also diagnose coronary artery disease.

      Objectives:

      - To learn if a new way to view CT pictures is able to accurately diagnose coronary artery
      disease.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 55 and older who need a coronary angiogram.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with their medical records.

        -  Participants may give a blood sample.

        -  Participants may have a CT scan of the heart with and without contrast. The CT scan will
           not interfere with their medical care.

        -  Participants blood pressure and heart rhythm will be monitored before, during, and after
           the CT scan. They may have an electrocardiogram.

        -  Before the scan, participants will have an intravenous catheter put into their arm. It
           will be used to inject contrast.

        -  Participants may take a beta blocker to slow their heart rate.

        -  Participants may take nitroglycerin under their tongue. It will enlarge their heart
           blood vessels and improve picture quality. It may cause a flushing sensation or
           headache.

        -  Participants will lie on their back on a padded table. The table slides into a large,
           donut-shaped machine. An x-ray tube will move around their body, taking pictures. They
           will be asked to hold their breath for 5 seconds at a time.

        -  Participants will be called 30 days after their angiogram. They will answer questions
           about their health, hospital visits, or medical treatments.

      Coronary calcium can impair the accurate evaluation of the coronary arteries with coronary
      computed tomography angiography (CCTA). A novel approach to potentially overcome this
      limitation is coronary calcium subtraction, where areas of calcification identified on a
      non-contrast scan are removed from the contrast enhanced images.
