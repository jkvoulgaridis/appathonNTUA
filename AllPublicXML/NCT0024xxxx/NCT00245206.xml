      This study will compare four atypical antipsychotic medications in terms of the risk of
      specific side effects each of them presents in middle-aged and elderly individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotic medications introduced within the last decade have been used
      increasingly for the treatment of several types of psychotic disorders and severe behavioral
      disturbances in older individuals. This trend is primarily due to a decrease in side effects
      caused by the new medications, as compared to conventional neuroleptic medications. There is
      a lower risk for developing tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms, both of which are
      movement abnormalities, with new antipsychotic medications. However, there has been a growing
      concern that the newer medications can cause a different set of potentially serious adverse
      side effects. Specifically, they may cause long-term metabolic, cardiovascular, and
      cerebrovascular effects, which may result in weight gain, diabetes, or stroke. This study
      will compare four atypical antipsychotic medications in terms of the risk of metabolic,
      cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular side effects that each presents in middle-aged and
      elderly individuals.

      Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive one of three
      atypical antipsychotic medications: aripiprazole; olanzapine; or risperidone. Although
      assignment is random, a technique that may reflect the participant's own interests or the
      researcher's knowledge of relevant participant characteristics will be used to assign the
      participant to a medication. Dosing will be determined by each participant's psychiatrist.
      Participants will be followed for up to 5 years to assess the side effects of the study
      medications, with study visits at baseline, Week 6, and every 3 months thereafter.
