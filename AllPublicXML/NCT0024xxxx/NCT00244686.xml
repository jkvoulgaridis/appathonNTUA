  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      104317: The market authorisation application for mepolizumab for the indication of
      hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) was filed in 2008, but later the file was withdrawn due to
      outstanding questions from regulator's raised from the application. On the basis of sponsor's
      evaluation, participants with life-threatening HES who have documented failure (lack of
      efficacy or a contra-indication) to at least 3 standard HES therapies (compassionate use) and
      participants who have participated in a previous GSK sponsored study in HES (long-term
      access) can be consider for mepolizumab treatment where the country regulation permits. In
      this study, participants will receive mepolizumab in an open-labelled manner, and limited
      data will be collected to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of mepolizumab.

      201956: This is a Long-term Access Programme (LAP) which aims to support provision of
      mepolizumab, until it is commercially available, to eligible subjects with severe asthma who
      participated in a GSK-sponsored mepolizumab clinical study in severe asthma. Eligible
      subjects will initiate mepolizumab within a 6-month period following the individual subject's
      last scheduled visit in their preceding clinical study. For each subject benefit versus risk
      will be assessed throughout the study to support continued treatment with mepolizumab.

      112562: To provide a mechanism for expanded access to mepolizumab therapy for eligible
      patients with HES. Whenever possible, use of an investigational medicinal product by a
      patient as part of a clinical trial is preferable. However, when patient enrollment in a
      clinical trial is not possible (such as when the patient is not eligible for ongoing clinical
      trials or the patient is not able to attend investigational sites), appropriate patients may
      receive mepolizumab through expanded access. This expanded access protocol was designed to
      allow access to mepolizumab for HES patients with seriously debilitating or life-threatening
      disease that are not able to enroll in clinical trials, including those patients that have
      already participated in a mepolizumab clinical trial.
