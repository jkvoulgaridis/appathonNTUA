      Background:

        -  Chromatin is is the structural building block of a chromosome. It is found inside the
           nucleus of the cell and consists of a complex of DNA and protein.

        -  Cancers of the lung, pleura (lung lining) and esophagus show profound changes in
           chromatin structure that may affect the course of disease in patients.

        -  A better understanding of these diseases and the genetic changes associated with them
           may be helpful in developing new treatments for them.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate people with cancer of the lung, pleura or esophagus for participation in NCI
           clinical trials.

        -  To obtain biopsies (small pieces of tissue) from tumor, normal tissue and blood samples
           to learn more about the cellular changes in blood and tissue in tumors of the lung,
           esophagus and pleura and surrounding structures in the chest.

      Eligibility: Patients 2 years of age and older with cancer of the lung, esophagus, pleura,
      mediastinum or chest wall, or cancers of other origin that have invaded the lung. Note:
      Patients &gt;= 2 years of age and under 18 years of age may only participate in research sample
      collection.

      Design:

        -  Up to 1100 patients may be included in this study.

        -  Patients undergo standard tests for evaluating the stage of their disease and for
           determining eligibility for an NCI investigational treatment study.

        -  All patients undergo bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (&quot;washing&quot; with salt water)
           to assess their tumor and collect a sample of normal tissue. Patients whose tumor is
           located on the outside portion of the lung may also undergo thoracoscopy to obtain a
           tumor sample. For bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage a tube with a light is passed
           through the nose or mouth into the lungs to examine the airways. Salt water is injected
           through the tube and then withdrawn to obtain cells for laboratory studies. For the
           thoracoscopy a small tube with a light is put through a small hole in the chest to
           obtain the tumor sample. Both procedures are usually done under general anesthesia. The
           tissue is examined to identify cell characteristics of people who respond to certain
           therapies and to identify markers on the surface of the tissue that may be useful in
           future research and treatment.

        -  Blood and urine samples are collected from patients.

        -  Patients who are eligible for a treatment study at NCI are offered participation in the
           study.

        -  Patients for whom standard surgery, radiation or chemotherapy is more appropriate may
           receive treatment at NCI or with their own physician.

        -  Patients who receive treatment at NCI return for follow-up examinations 4 weeks after
           discharge and then every 2 to 4 months depending on the nature of their cancer.

      Background:

        -  Lung and esophageal cancers as well as malignant pleural mesotheliomas exhibit
           epigenetic perturbations that may impact the clinical course of these neoplasms.

        -  To date, epigenetic alterations in primary thoracic malignancies and neoplasms
           metastatic to the chest have not been evaluated in a systematic, longitudinal manner.

      Objectives:

        -  To permit evaluation of patients referred to the Thoracic Surgery Branch, NCI in order
           to identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for clinical research protocols.

        -  To obtain tumor and adjacent normal tissues as well as serum and urine samples from
           patients with primary or metastatic malignancies involving the lung, esophagus, pleura,
           and mediastinum to support preclinical research endeavors in the Thoracic Surgery
           Branch.

        -  To perform focused germline testing of genes modulating drug metabolism, possible future
           whole genome sequencing studies, possible ex vivo generation of autologous tumor cell
           lines and EBV-transformed B cell lines for research. Tumor tissue obtained during
           previous protocol participation and cryopreserved may undergo this process if the
           patient consents on this trial.

        -  To permit standard treatment for patients who are not eligible for investigational
           therapy on a current Thoracic Surgery protocol, but who present a novel and unique
           clinical training opportunity, or who manifest a clinical condition that requires
           immediate intervention to prevent compromise to the patient's well-being.

        -  To permit long term follow up of patients with thoracic malignancies including the
           collection of tissue and fluids to support preclinical research particularly to
           ascertain if gene expression and DNA methylation profiles coincide with response to
           therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with potentially malignant or suspicious lesions or with biopsy proven, lung or
           esophageal cancers, malignant pleural mesotheliomas, mediastinal or chest wall
           neoplasms, thymoma/thymic neoplasms, or pulmonary metastases from cancers of nonthoracic
           origin.

        -  Patients who have an ECOG performance score of 0-2.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 2 years and older. Note: Patients greater than or equal to
           2 years of age and under 18 years of age may only participate in research sample
           collection if the tissue acquisition is performed during a clinically indicated surgical
           procedure, and the sampling of tissue, blood or urine does not add risk to the
           clinically indicated procedures.

      Design:

        -  This protocol is designed to:

        -  Facilitate screening of patients for investigational protocols in the Thoracic Surgery
           Branch, NCI, and to obtain tissue samples to enable evaluation of epigenetic events in
           primary and metastatic thoracic malignancies, as an extension of ongoing laboratory

      research in the Thoracic Epigenetics Laboratory.

        -  Allow for the establishment of tumor cell lines and EBV-transformed B cell lines to
           support immunologic evaluation of the patient s response to other clinical trials.

        -  Patients will be screened to determine appropriate diagnostic and treatment
           interventions. Where appropriate, patients will receive standard staging, surgical
           intervention, and follow up care. Tissue, blood, and/or peritoneal/pleural effusion
           samples obtained during surgery/biopsy or clinic visits will be processed and either
           stored for analysis or cultured for generation of tumor cell lines and EBV-transformed B
           cell lines for research. After recovery from biopsy or surgery patients will continue to
           be followed, blood and urine samples may be collected as well as tissue when
           appropriate.

        -  No investigational treatment will be administered on this protocol. In circumstances
           approved by the Section Chief, a patient may be deemed ineligible for investigational
           therapy, yet may undergo standard of care treatment at the NIH Clinical Center on this
           study.

        -  It is anticipated that the protocol will enroll a maximum of 1100 patients.
