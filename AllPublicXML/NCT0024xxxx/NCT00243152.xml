  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine
      (trade name Lamictal) on neuropathic facial pain or neuralgia using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no pharmacological agents that can control neuropathic pain akin to the
      efficacy of antibiotics for bacterial infection. All current neuropathic pain drugs have
      approximately the same efficacy of less than 30% in controlled trials, and many of these
      drugs do not have known mechanisms of action. fMRI studies may provide insight into how brain
      circuitry is altered by chronic pain, and how these drugs act on altered circuitry. The
      trigeminal system in particular offers unique advantages for studying such alterations,
      including a large central representation and high degree of somatotopy. The administration of
      lamotrigine to neuropathic pain patients in conjunction with fMRI will allow us to compare
      subjective ratings of pain with objective measures of neural activity during increased
      conditions of allodynia/hyperalgesia.

    <description>The drug lamotrigine will be given for 9 weeks prior to imaging session 1. A rescue drug, Gabapentin, will be provided for pain control. Patients will taper off the Gabapentin 2 weeks before each scan date. After a taper and washout, placebo (cross over) will be administered. At the end of the trial (after imaging session 2), a taper for placebo will be given. Patients will be required to maintain a pain diary during the study, documenting the perceived effects of the drug on the severity of their pain and keeping track of their subjective pain ratings day to day. Patients will also complete the McGill Pain Questionnaire at each visit.</description>
