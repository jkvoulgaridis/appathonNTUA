  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of pathological gambling.
      Pathological gambling (PG) is a debilitating disorder, generally leading to severe personal,
      familial, financial, social, and occupational impairments. In PG, the patient experiences a
      progressive inability to resist impulses to gamble, and gambling significantly disrupt the
      patient's functioning in the personal, familial, and/or vocational spheres. Topiramate has
      shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in some impulse control disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 14-week, outpatient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      flexible-dose study of topiramate in subjects with pathological gambling. After giving
      informed consent, subjects who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria may be enrolled.
      The study will consist of three phases:

        -  Washout/Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to randomization or longer for those
           medications requiring a longer washout period;

        -  Double-Blind Phase (Titration: up to 6 weeks; Maintenance: 8 weeks); and

        -  Taper Phase (approximately 1 week).

      The study medication will be titrated to 300 mg/day or the subject's maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). Subjects must reach a minimum dose of 50 mg/day by Week 2. The taper phase will last
      approximately one week where subjects gradually reduce their medication until they are no
      longer taking study medication.

      Patient may also give an optional blood sample for pharmacogenomic testing

    <description>The obsessions subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for PG (PG-YBOCS) measures the severity and change in severity of PG symptoms such as thoughts/urges and behaviors and has been shown to be reliable and valid and correlate with global severity and South Oaks Gambling Screen scores. The scale is a clinician-rated, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms), Each component, Obsession and Compulsion, score ranges from 0-20, yielding a total possible score range from 0 to 40, with higher score indicating more symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Gambling-Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) is a 12-item self-rated measure that is designed to assess gambling symptom severity and change during treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point scale from 0-4 with 0 meaning no symptoms and 4 meaning extreme symptoms. The total score is 0 - 48, with higher score indicating more gambling problem. Scores 7 and lower are considered normal behavior, 8-20 are considered a mild gambling problem, 21-30 are considered a moderate gambling problem, 31-40 are considered a severe gambling problem and 40-48 are considered an extreme gambling problem.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is a questionnaire designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness, composed of 30 items describing common impulsive or non-impulsive (for reverse scored items) behaviors and preferences. Subscale attentional score 8-32, subscale motor score 11-44, subscale nonplanning score 11-44, with higher scores for each subscale indicating worse outcomes. Total score from 30-120, with higher score indicating more impulsive symptoms. Items are scored on a 4-point scale:
Rarely/Never = 1 Occasionally = 2 Often = 3 Almost Always/Always = 4 Total scores of 72+ = high impulsiveness Total scores between 52 and 71 = within normal limits for impulsiveness Total scores lower than 52 are representative of an individual that is either extremely over-controlled or who has not honestly completed the questionnaire</description>

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of mania and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. YMRS total score varies between zero and 60, with higher score indicating more symptoms. A score of &lt;= 12 indicates remission of symptoms.</description>

The scale is a clinician-rated, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms), Each component, Obsession and Compulsion, score ranges from 0-20, yielding a total possible score range from 0 to 40, with higher score indicating more symptoms.</description>

        <title>Gambling-Symptom Assessment Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>The Gambling-Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) is a 12-item self-rated measure that is designed to assess gambling symptom severity and change during treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point scale from 0-4 with 0 meaning no symptoms and 4 meaning extreme symptoms. The total score is 0 - 48, with higher score indicating more gambling problem. Scores 7 and lower are considered normal behavior, 8-20 are considered a mild gambling problem, 21-30 are considered a moderate gambling problem, 31-40 are considered a severe gambling problem and 40-48 are considered an extreme gambling problem.</description>

        <description>The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is a questionnaire designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness, composed of 30 items describing common impulsive or non-impulsive (for reverse scored items) behaviors and preferences. Subscale attentional score 8-32, subscale motor score 11-44, subscale nonplanning score 11-44, with higher scores for each subscale indicating worse outcomes. Total score from 30-120, with higher score indicating more impulsive symptoms. Items are scored on a 4-point scale:
Rarely/Never = 1 Occasionally = 2 Often = 3 Almost Always/Always = 4 Total scores of 72+ = high impulsiveness Total scores between 52 and 71 = within normal limits for impulsiveness Total scores lower than 52 are representative of an individual that is either extremely over-controlled or who has not honestly completed the questionnaire</description>

        <description>The YMRS is an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of mania and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. YMRS total score varies between zero and 60, with higher score indicating more symptoms. A score of &lt;= 12 indicates remission of symptoms.</description>
