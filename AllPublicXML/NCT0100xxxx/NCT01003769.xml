      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) that has returned after a period of
      improvement (relapsed). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune
      system to attack cancer cells. R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and causing the cells to die. Giving
      lenalidomide with R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid may be an effective treatment for relapsed or
      refractory B-CLL. - Funding Source - FDA OOPD

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in combination with AT-101
      (R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid). (Phase I) II. To assess the overall response rate of
      lenalidomide in combination with AT-101. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rates of lenalidomide in combination with AT-101 at 6
      months and 12 months.

      II. To evaluate time to progression (TTP) for the combination of lenalidomide + AT-101.

      III. To evaluate the safety of this combination in patients with relapsed B-CLL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct correlative studies for further understanding of the mechanism of antitumor
      activity of lenalidomide and lenalidomide + AT-101.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Beginning in course
      3, patients also receive AT-101 PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 11 courses (49-56 days for course 12 or last course of treatment) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 2 years.
