  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence of the immune response to HAV (Hepatitis A Virus)
      antigens and HBs (Hepatitis B surface) antigens in healthy adults previously vaccinated with
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Twinrix Adult. The subjects will be invited for blood
      sampling 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years after vaccination to evaluate the antibody persistence.
      For subjects in whom low circulating antibodies are detected, the presence of immune memory
      against hepatitis A &amp; B antigens will be investigated by the administration of a challenge
      dose of the appropriate vaccine (Havrix and/or Engerix-B) at the next planned visit.

      No new subjects will be recruited during this study.
