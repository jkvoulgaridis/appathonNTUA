    <measure>Number of Participants With Tumor Response (Complete Response [CR], Clinical Complete Response [CCR], and Partial Response [PR]) in up to 5 Index Lesions as Determined by Investigator's Composite Assessment (CA) of Index Lesion Disease Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Index lesion symptoms/grade include: erythema=0 (no evidence)-8 (very severe); scaling=0 (no evidence)-8 (very severe); plaque elevation=0 (no evidence)-8 (extreme elevation); hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation=0 (no evidence of change)-8 (very severe change); area of involvement=0 (0 centimeters [cm]^2)-18 (&gt;300 cm^2). CA generated by sum of grades of signs/symptoms for each index lesion. Index lesion CA grade at baseline was divided into CA grade at each subsequent study visit to determine participant's response to treatment. Ratio of CA &lt;1.0=improvement in disease; ratio &gt;1.0=worsening of disease. Tumor response as determined by CA=percentage of participants achieving CR (CA ratio=0, no clinically abnormal lymph nodes, and absence of histologic signs of CTCL); CCR (CA ratio=0 and no clinically abnormal lymph nodes); and PR (CA ratio=≤0.5, &lt;25% increase in number/aggregate area of abnormal lymph nodes/tumors, and no new abnormal lymph nodes in documented area of absence of disease).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Tumor Response of CR, CCR, PR, SD, and PD as Determined by Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Clinical Condition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA was an assessment of the overall extent of improvement/worsening from Baseline of the participant's overall disease compared with the condition every 4 weeks thereafter during treatment. CR=PGA grade of 0 (completely clear of disease since Baseline) and absence of histologic signs of CTCL. CCR=PGA grade of 0. PR=PGA grade of 1 (almost clear [≥90%-&lt;100%] of disease since Baseline), 2 (marked improvement [≥75%-&lt;90%] of disease since Baseline), 3 (moderate improvement [≥50%-&lt;70%] of disease since Baseline). Stable Disease (SD)=PGA grade of 4 (slight improvement [&lt;25%-&lt;50%] of disease since Baseline) or 5 (no change in disease [+/-&lt;25% change since Baseline]). Progressive Disease (PD)=PGA grade of 6 (worse disease [≥25%] than at baseline). If visceral disease or an abnormal lymph node was located in a documented area of absence of disease, then PD would be reported for the participant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Tumor Response of CR, CCR, PR, SD, and PD as Determined Percent Body Surface Area (BSA) Involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>To determine BSA involvement, the area of the participant's palm was defined as 1% of the participant's BSA. The extent of involvement of disease was determined as multiples of the participant's palm area and expressed as a percentage of the participant's total BSA at Baseline (Day 1) and every 4 weeks thereafter during treatment. CR=percent BSA 0% and documented absence of histologic signs of CTCL. CCR=Percent BSA 0%. PR=a decrease from Baseline in percent BSA of at least 50%. SD=none of the response classifications (that is, CR, CCR, PR, or PD) accurately describe the disease status. PD=an increase from Baseline in percent BSA of at least 25%.</description>

Index lesion symptoms/grade: erythema/scaling=0 (no evidence)-8 (very severe); plaque elevation=0 (no evidence)-8 (extreme elevation); hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation=0 (no evidence)-8 (very severe change); area of involvement=0 (0 cm^2)-18 (&gt;300 cm^2).

                  If antipruritic medication cannot be avoided, antihistamine or antipruritic
                  agents must be administered using a stable dose regimen for at least 1 week prior
                  to initiation of study drug treatment and throughout the study, unless it is
                  determined that a discontinuation or reduction in dose is indicated. Prior to the
                  enrollment of any participant who will be taking systemic or
                  dermatologically-applied antihistamine or anti-pruritic agent, the investigator

         10. Systemic antibiotic therapy within 2 weeks of entry in the study. (Participants with
             infections requiring antibiotics or likely to require antibiotics should be
             appropriately treated with a course of antibiotics terminating at least two weeks
             prior to entry, or if indicated, a chronic suppressive or prophylactic dose of
             antibiotics stabilized at least 2 weeks prior to entry. Participants who require
             initiation of or changes in antibiotic therapy during the study will not be considered
             a violation of the study protocol).

         11. History of pancreatitis or significant risk factors for developing pancreatitis (for
             example, prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol
             consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications
             known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity).

        <description>The PGA was an assessment of the overall extent of improvement/worsening from Baseline of the participant's overall disease compared with the condition every 4 weeks thereafter during treatment. CR=PGA grade of 0 (completely clear of disease since Baseline) and absence of histologic signs of CTCL. CCR=PGA grade of 0. PR=PGA grade of 1 (almost clear [≥90%-&lt;100%] of disease since Baseline), 2 (marked improvement [≥75%-&lt;90%] of disease since Baseline), 3 (moderate improvement [≥50%-&lt;70%] of disease since Baseline). Stable Disease (SD)=PGA grade of 4 (slight improvement [&lt;25%-&lt;50%] of disease since Baseline) or 5 (no change in disease [+/-&lt;25% change since Baseline]). Progressive Disease (PD)=PGA grade of 6 (worse disease [≥25%] than at baseline). If visceral disease or an abnormal lymph node was located in a documented area of absence of disease, then PD would be reported for the participant.</description>

          <title>Time to Tumor Progression as Determined by PGA of Clinical Condition</title>
          <description>Defined as time interval from first day of bexarotene treatment to time of first observation when participant met criteria for PD. PGA was an assessment of the overall extent of improvement/worsening from Baseline of the participant's overall disease compared with the condition every 4 weeks thereafter during treatment. PD=PGA grade of 6 (worse disease [≥25%] than at baseline). If visceral disease or an abnormal lymph node was located in a documented area of absence of disease, then PD would be reported for the participant.</description>

        <title>Time to Tumor Progression as Determined by Percent BSA Involvement</title>
        <description>Defined as time interval from first day of bexarotene treatment to time of first observation when participant met criteria for PD. To determine BSA involvement, the area of the participant's palm was defined as 1% of the participant's BSA. The extent of involvement of disease was determined as multiples of the participant's palm area and expressed as a percentage of the participant's total BSA at Baseline (Day 1) and every 4 weeks thereafter during treatment. PD=an increase from Baseline in percent BSA of at least 25%.</description>
