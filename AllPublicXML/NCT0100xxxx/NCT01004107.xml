      of Radiesse® Dermal Filler for hand treatment.

      This is a prospective, randomized, masked, controlled study to investigate the effectiveness
      of Radiesse® Dermal Filler for hand treatment, comprised of a 3-month main study followed by
      an open-label extension (OLEX) study through 12 months. At 3 months, untreated controls
      received Radiesse Dermal Filler for hand treatment and were followed for the remainder of the
      study. All study subjects were eligible for retreatment 6 months after initial treatment, and
      all subjects were followed through 12 months from study enrollment in the OLEX.

    <measure>Mean Change on Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS), by Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by mean change on the 5-point Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS) between baseline and 3 months, by hand, among treated subjects and untreated controls. Ratings were completed by three, blinded evaluators. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in BHVSS score.
Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS) rating definitions are as follows:
4 = All 3 central tendons are fully exposed when hand is at rest; 3 = All 3 central tendons are partially exposed with 1 to 2 tendons fully exposed when hand is at rest; 2 = All 3 central tendons are partially exposed when hand is at rest;
1 = One or 2 central tendons are slightly exposed when hand is at rest; and 0 = No tendons exposed when hand is at rest.</description>

          <description>The Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) represent a standard classification of skin color based on one's response to sun exposure (i.e., burns or tans), rather than defined by race or ethnicity.
All FST were eligible for participation in the current study.

        <title>Mean Change on Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS), by Hand</title>
        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by mean change on the 5-point Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS) between baseline and 3 months, by hand, among treated subjects and untreated controls. Ratings were completed by three, blinded evaluators. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in BHVSS score.
Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS) rating definitions are as follows:
4 = All 3 central tendons are fully exposed when hand is at rest; 3 = All 3 central tendons are partially exposed with 1 to 2 tendons fully exposed when hand is at rest; 2 = All 3 central tendons are partially exposed when hand is at rest;
1 = One or 2 central tendons are slightly exposed when hand is at rest; and 0 = No tendons exposed when hand is at rest.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by a ≥ 1-point change on the 5-point Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS) between baseline and 3 months, by subject, among treated subjects and untreated controls. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in BHVSS score.
Busso Hand Volume Severity Scale (BHVSS) rating definitions are as follows:
4 = All 3 central tendons are fully exposed when hand is at rest; 3 = All 3 central tendons are partially exposed with 1 to 2 tendons fully exposed when hand is at rest; 2 = All 3 central tendons are partially exposed when hand is at rest;
1 = One or 2 central tendons are slightly exposed when hand is at rest; and 0 = No tendons exposed when hand is at rest.</description>

        <title>Difficulty Performing Activities During Prior Week</title>
        <description>Effectiveness was measured by evaluating subject's difficulty in performing routine activities during the prior week according to a 5-point Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHOQ) scale at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline, by hand. Activities were as follows and were graded by subject as 1 = not at all difficult, 2 = a little difficult, 3 = somewhat difficult, 4 = moderately difficult, and 5 = very difficult:
Turn a knob
Pick up a coin
Hold a glass of water
Turn a key in a lock
Hold a frying pan</description>

        <title>Difficulty Performing Activities During Prior Week, Both Hands</title>
        <description>Effectiveness was measured by evaluating subject's difficulty in performing routine activities, that require both hands, during the prior week according to a 5-point Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHOQ) scale at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline. Activities were as follows and were graded by subject as 1 = not at all difficult, 2 = a little difficult, 3 = somewhat difficult, 4 = moderately difficult, and 5 = very difficult:
Open a jar
Button a shirt / blouse
Eat with a knife and fork
Carry a grocery bag
Wash dishes
Wash your hair
Tie shoelaces / knots</description>

How often were you unable to do your work because of problems with your hand(s) / wrist(s)?
How often did you have to shorten your work day because of problems with your hand(s) / wrist(s)?
How often did you have to take it easy at your work because of problems with your hand(s) / wrist(s)?
