  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab
      and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is
      an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the
      laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually
      chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or
      stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When
      the blood supply is decreased, the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to
      grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been
      approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies
      suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating
      breast cancer.

      This study used a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy bevacizumab and carboplatin based on
      Central Nervous System (CNS) response. The null and alternative therapy response rates are 5%
      versus 20%. If 1 or more participants assessable in the stage one cohort (n=12 assessable
      participants) achieve CNS response then accrual proceeds to stage two (n=25 additional
      assessable participants). If at least 4 participants in the final set of 37 assessable
      participants achieve CNS response then this regimen would be deemed worthy of further study.
      The probability of stopping early is 0.54 if the true CNS response rate is 5% and 0.07 if the
      true CNS response rate is 20%. The probability of deeming the treatment worthy of further
      study is 0.10 and 0.90 if the true CNS response rate is 5% and 20%, respectively.

    <measure>Central Nervous System (CNS) Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Response was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 cycles on treatment. Treatment duration for this study cohort was a median (range) of 8 cycles (1-20) which approximates months given the 4 week cycle length.</time_frame>
    <description>CNS objective response rate is the percentage of participants that achieve CNS complete or partial response as follows:
CNS complete response (CR) is achieved if all of the following are satisfied:
Complete resolution of all measurable (&gt;= 1 cm in longest dimension [LD]) and non-measurable brain metastases
No new CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;= 6 mm in LD)
Stable or decreasing steroid dose
No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms
No progression of extra-CNS disease as assessed by RECIST
CNS partial response (PR) is achieved if all of the following are satisfied:
-&gt;/= 50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all measurable (&gt;/= 1 cm in LD) brain metastases compared to baseline
No progression on non-measurable lesions
No new CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;/= 6 mm in LD)
Stable or decreasing steroid dose
No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms
No progression of extra-CNS disease as assessed by RECIST</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, cycle 2, cycle 4 and thereafter on treatment every 2 cycles (CNS disease) and every 4 cycles (non-disease). Maximum PFS follow-up for this study cohort was 18.6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of disease progression (PD), second cancer, or death, whichever occurs first. PD if any of the following occur:
CNS Disease
&gt;/=40% increase in the volumetric sum of all measurable lesions as compared to the smallest volume on treatment
Progression of non-measurable lesions
New lesions (&gt;/=6 mm)
Non-CNS Disease
• RECIST 1.0 criteria: at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded on treatment or the appearance of &gt;/=1 new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.
Symptomatic
Increasing steroid requirement
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment
New/progression tumor-related neurologic signs and symptoms except for transient worsening lasting &lt;/=14 days</description>

No progression on non-measurable lesions
No new CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;/= 6 mm in LD)
Stable or decreasing steroid dose
No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms
No progression of extra-CNS disease as assessed by RECIST
CNS Progressive Disease (PD) was experiencing any of the following:
-&gt;/- 40% increase in the volumetric sum of all measurable (&gt;/= 1 cm in LD) brain metastases compared to baseline
Progression on non-measurable lesions
New CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;/= 6 mm in LD)

    <measure>Site of First Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, cycle 2, cycle 4 and thereafter on treatment every 2 cycles (CNS disease) and every 4 cycles (non-disease). Maximum progression follow-up for this study cohort was 18.6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Site of first progression is classified as follows:
CNS Disease
&gt;/=40% increase in the volumetric sum of all measurable lesions as compared to the smallest volume on treatment
Progression of non-measurable lesions
New lesions (&gt;/=6 mm) Non-CNS Disease
Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.

        <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of disease progression (PD), second cancer, or death, whichever occurs first. PD if any of the following occur:
CNS Disease
&gt;/=40% increase in the volumetric sum of all measurable lesions as compared to the smallest volume on treatment
Progression of non-measurable lesions
New lesions (&gt;/=6 mm)
Non-CNS Disease
• RECIST 1.0 criteria: at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded on treatment or the appearance of &gt;/=1 new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.

        <title>Site of First Progression</title>
        <description>Site of first progression is classified as follows:
CNS Disease
&gt;/=40% increase in the volumetric sum of all measurable lesions as compared to the smallest volume on treatment
Progression of non-measurable lesions
New lesions (&gt;/=6 mm) Non-CNS Disease
Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.
Symptomatic
Increasing steroid requirement
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment
New/progression tumor-related neurologic signs and symptoms (NSS) except for transient worsening lasting &lt;/=14 days</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, cycle 2, cycle 4 and thereafter on treatment every 2 cycles (CNS disease) and every 4 cycles (non-disease). Maximum progression follow-up for this study cohort was 18.6 months.</time_frame>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were assessed day 1 of each cycle throughout the treatment period. Median (range) treatment duration for this study cohort was 8 cycles (1-20) which approximates months given the 4-week cycle duration.</time_frame>
      <desc>Maximum grade toxicity by type was first calculated. Serious AEs were defined as events with treatment-attribution of possibly, probably or definitely and grade 3 or higher per NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (CTCAEv3). All remaining events regardless of treatment attribution were classified as Other AEs. No further data is available to specify classification of other beyond the general term.</desc>
