  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, multi-site, clinical trial is to determine whether intensive
      therapy consisting of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs plus apheresis to cleanse the blood
      of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is more effective than statin therapy alone in
      reducing plaque volume in heart arteries of patients who have already suffered an acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS). The study will also investigate whether this intensive approach can
      help increase the presence of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), stem cells that have been
      shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) events in ACS patients. This study has II phases and FDA
      approval for phase II has been received.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using statins to lower blood cholesterol, and specifically LDL, is well established as a
      long-term strategy to reduce CVs and even death. But the most intensive pharmacologic
      lipid-lowering therapy with statins, though proven superior to standard dose regimens, is
      still associated with an unacceptably high rate of recurrent CV events early after an ACS.
      This study hypothesizes that for ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI), intensive lipid-lowering therapy consisting of statins and LDL-apheresis (ILLT) will
      significantly reduce the total coronary atheroma volume of vulnerable plaque and augment
      mobilization of peripherally circulating EPC colony forming units, compared to guideline
      statin monotherapy (SMT). ILLT will lead to fewer CV events for these patients.

      Patients presenting at two VA sites with ACS will be screened and consented before undergoing
      uncomplicated PCI (balloons or stents) and intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology
      (IVUS-VH). They will then be randomized into the ILLT arm or SMT arm of the study. The ILLT
      group will receive one treatment of LDL-apheresis plus a daily oral 80mg dose of
      Atorvastatin; the SMT group will only get the Atorvastatin. Patients will again undergo
      IVUS-VH 12 weeks after enrollment to measure atheroma volume; EPC level will also be checked.

      The four-year duration of the study includes 24 months of accrual, six months of follow-up,
      and 12 months of study closure and data analysis. A two-sample t-test of mean difference with
      90% power and 0.65 Cohen's D effect size provides a total sample size estimate of 102.
      Counting 20% drop-out rate, the sample size increases to 128.

      The recent FDA recommendations regarding the design of the study has been included in the
      revised study protocol:

        1. The first stage will enroll 30 patients with a 2:1 randomization favoring LDL-apheresis.
           the safety data will be submitted to the FDA.

        2. The enrollment of the second stage of the study will be contingent to the
           recommendations of the FDA.

        <title>Change in the Total Atheroma Volume of the Target Coronary Artery From Baseline to 12 Weeks Post-PCI as Assessed Via Intravascular Ultrasound With Virtual Histology (IVUS-VH)</title>
        <description>The primary effectiveness outcome measure was the change in the total atheroma volume within a ≥ 20 mm long segment of the target coronary artery from baseline to 12 weeks post-PCI. The measurement was done via IVUS-VH at 2 time points (baseline during index PCI and 12-week follow-up).</description>

            <description>Patient of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is randomized to LDL-apheresis in addition to the standard statin therapy of an oral daily dose of 40-80mg of Atorvastatin or equivalent. The device used in this study is the LIPOSORBER LA-15 System, manufactured by Kaneka Pharma America LLC. A filter separates plasma from whole blood, the Liposorber -columns remove LDL from the plasma. The system recombines plasma and blood cells and returns them into the patient's body. This procedure typically takes about 3 hours. The procedure provides an immediate reduction in a patient's lipid levels. A single apheresis treatment can lower LDL by more than 80%, but levels return to baseline within 3 weeks.</description>

        <description>The cell culture assay and quantification of circulating EPC-CFU were performed for patients recruited at the Dallas VA center only. The assay were done at 4 time points (pre-PCI, post-PCI, 4-week follow-up, and 12-week follow-up).</description>

            <description>Patient of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is randomized to LDL-apheresis in addition to the standard statin therapy of an oral daily dose of 40-80mg of Atorvastatin or equivalent. The device used in this study is the LIPOSORBER LA-15 System, manufactured by Kaneka Pharma America LLC. A filter separates plasma from whole blood, the Liposorber -columns remove LDL from the plasma. The system recombines plasma and blood cells and returns them into the patient's body. This procedure typically takes about 3 hours. The procedure provides an immediate reduction in a patient's lipid levels. A single apheresis treatment can lower LDL by more than 80%, but levels return to baseline within 3 weeks.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) were monitored at the study sites throughout the whole period of the study at each clinic visit and telephone contact, beginning as soon as a study participant signs the Informed Consent and continuing through end-of-study for each participant. Most participants were followed for around 6 months for AE/SAE/UADE.</time_frame>
      <desc>All AE/SAE/UADE including both those related to the study intervention and those not related to the intervention, will be collected and recorded on the appropriate case report forms (CRF). For the purpose of safety monitoring, the study intervention is defined as the use of 1) statins with or without the addition of LDL-apheresis, 2) LDL-apheresis, and 3) cardiac catheterization and IVUS-VH as described in this protocol.</desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our study is limited by its relatively small sample size and short follow-up. All study sites were Veterans Affairs medical centers and therefore enrolled a disproportionate number of men, limiting the generalizability of its findings</limitations_and_caveats>
