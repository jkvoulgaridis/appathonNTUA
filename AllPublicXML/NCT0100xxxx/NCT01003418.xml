  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the H1N1
      candidate vaccine administered in children aged between 8 and 12 weeks at the time of first
      vaccination.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated prematurely for logistic reasons, not related to safety or efficacy of
    the vaccine.

    <time_frame>During the 7-days post-Dose 1 period (Days 0-6)</time_frame>

    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities/crying that cannot be comforted. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

    <time_frame>During the 2-weeks post-Dose 1 period (Days 0-13)</time_frame>

    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Also any 'solicited' symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms will be reported as an unsolicited AE. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities/crying that cannot be comforted. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Results about unsolicited AEs for this endpoint were based on individual listings.</description>

        <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities/crying that cannot be comforted. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited AEs</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Also any 'solicited' symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms will be reported as an unsolicited AE. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities/crying that cannot be comforted. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination. Results about unsolicited AEs for this endpoint were based on individual listings.</description>
