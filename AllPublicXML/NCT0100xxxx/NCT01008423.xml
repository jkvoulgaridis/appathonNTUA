  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy profile of rectally administered
      budesonide foam, as compared to an equivalent volume of rectally administered placebo foam
      over the same dosing schedule, in participants who present with a diagnosis of active, mild
      to moderate, ulcerative proctitis (UP) or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS). During the
      study, eligible participants will be allowed to maintain previously established oral
      5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) treatment at doses up to 4.8 grams/day (g/day).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Remission was a combined assessment of clinical and endoscopic variables, defined as an endoscopy score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1, a rectal bleeding score of 0, and an improvement or no change from baseline in stool frequency subscales of the Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI) at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. MMDAI was used to assess the overall disease activity for each participant. MMDAI evaluated 4 indices: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment (PGA) and endoscopy findings each on a scale of 0 to 3 with a maximum total score of 12. Stool frequency MMDAI subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal number of stools per day and 3 indicated 5 or more stools than normal. Rectal bleeding MMDAI subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated no blood seen and 3 indicated blood alone passed. Endoscopy MMDAI subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal or inactive disease and 3 indicated severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Remission</title>
        <description>Remission was a combined assessment of clinical and endoscopic variables, defined as an endoscopy score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1, a rectal bleeding score of 0, and an improvement or no change from baseline in stool frequency subscales of the Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI) at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. MMDAI was used to assess the overall disease activity for each participant. MMDAI evaluated 4 indices: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment (PGA) and endoscopy findings each on a scale of 0 to 3 with a maximum total score of 12. Stool frequency MMDAI subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal number of stools per day and 3 indicated 5 or more stools than normal. Rectal bleeding MMDAI subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated no blood seen and 3 indicated blood alone passed. Endoscopy MMDAI subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal or inactive disease and 3 indicated severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration).</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in MMDAI Total Score and Subscale Scores</title>
          <description>The MMDAI was used to assess the overall disease activity for each participant. The MMDAI evaluated 4 indices: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, PGA and endoscopy findings each on a scale of 0 to 3 with a maximum total score of 12. Rectal bleeding subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated no blood seen and 3 indicated blood alone passed. BF subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal number of stools per day and 3 indicated 5 or more stools than normal. PGA subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal and 3 indicated severe disease. Endoscopy subscore ranged from 0-3, where 0 indicated normal and 3 indicated severe disease. MMDAI total score ranged from 0-12, where higher score indicated severe disease. Missing data was imputed using LOCF method.</description>
