  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past 5 years cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) have become the standard of care in
      pediatrics. However, hyperinflation of the cuff can compromise the tracheal mucosal perfusion
      while an inadequate seal may impact ventilation and potentially increase the risk of
      aspiration. Hence, the goal after placement of a cuffed ETT is to create a safe and effective
      tracheal seal. The two ways to measure that are to hold CPAP while listening for an audible
      leak and measuring the difference between the inspired and expired tidal volumes (TV). This
      is a prospective study to compare these two methods used to create a tracheal seal and
      measure the intracuff pressure after a satisfactory tracheal seal is established.

    <description>The ratio of the inspired to expired tidal volume will be determined using the following formula: (TVinspired - TVÂ¬expired)/TVinspired. The peak inflating pressure (PIP) required to achieve the set TV will be noted. The air in the cuff will then be increased or decreased as needed to achieve a set delivered ratio of 0.9-1.0.</description>
