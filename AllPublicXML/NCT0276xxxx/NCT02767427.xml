  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team hypothesizes that at-home cleansing of the surgical site with chlorhexidine
      wipes provide no added benefit to decreasing microbial activity or preventing surgical site
      infections.

      Patients will be randomized to the chlorhexidine or no additional intervention groups.
      Patients will be randomized to use 4% chlorhexidine cloths, while the other half receive no
      additional intervention. Those randomized into the chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)
      home-application group will be asked to shower the night before surgery, and to use a
      standardized pre-packaged CHG wipe (that the patients would receive at their pre-surgical
      consultation) on their surgical site after thoroughly drying those areas. The patients will
      be asked to use a second wipe in each area the morning of surgery. The surgical sites will be
      analyzed in two groups: anterior cervical and posterior spine. Each of these two groups will
      be randomized separately. All patients will undergo a standardized preoperative cleansing
      regimen. Once positioned, they will be cleansed with an alcohol solution. Then, the surgical
      site (either the anterior portion of the neck or the posterior area of the spine) will be
      scrubbed with chlorhexidine soaked brushes and then painted with chlorhexidine solution.
      Perioperative antibiotics will be given per attending surgeon preference. Cutaneous samples
      will be taken from the surgical site of each patient at each time point.

      To the investigator's knowledge no prior study has evaluated the effects of cleaning the skin
      at home before surgery in patients undergoing spine surgery. This study will investigate
      whether patients who use a chlorhexidine cleansing wipe have decreased amounts of bacteria on
      their skin when they arrive for scheduled spine surgery. Spine surgeons strive to decrease
      infections in their patients, so it is important to see if this intervention helps to do
      this.

Those who forget to use the wipe in the morning were allowed to use the wipe in the pre-operative area and included if this occurs more than one hour before skin prep.
