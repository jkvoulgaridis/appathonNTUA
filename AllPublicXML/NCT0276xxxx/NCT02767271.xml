    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of luliconazole cream 1%, as
      measured by circulating plasma levels of luliconazole, when maximal quantity of luliconazole
      cream 1% is applied to participants of 12 years to less than (&lt;) 18 years of age with
      moderate to severe inter-digital tinea pedis or tinea cruris.

             all scheduled visits, have all blood draws, and successfully complete the study.

          -  Participants must be in good general health and free of any disease that in the
             Investigator's opinion might interfere with the study evaluations.

          -  Participants must be able to communicate, be able to understand the study procedures,
             and be willing to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Participants with active atopic or contact dermatitis in the treatment area.

          -  Female participants who are pregnant and/or nursing or planning a pregnancy during the
             course of the trial. Participants who test positive for pregnancy after start of test
             treatment will be discontinued from test treatment but will be followed for safety
             purposes.

          -  Participants who are immunocompromised (due to disease, for example; human
             immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or medications).

          -  Participants who have a recent history of or current drug or alcohol abuse.
