        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on the Immunotherapy Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (iRANO) Criteria [Part 1]</title>
        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). Overall DCR was based on iRANO criteria: CR: complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease on consecutive MRI at least 4 weeks apart, off steroid, sustained for at least 4 weeks; PR: &gt;=50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; SD: does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression disease, and stable clinically.</description>
