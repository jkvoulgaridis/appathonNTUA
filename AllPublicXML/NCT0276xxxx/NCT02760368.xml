  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how safe and effective the study drug Olokizumab
      is, in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who are already receiving, but not fully
      responding to, treatment with methotrexate (MTX).

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of this Phase III study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of OKZ
      in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who have responded inadequately to MTX. The
      primary endpoint of the trial is at Week 12. Olokizumab is expected to reduce the disease
      activity and improve physical function. The study is expected to provide safety information
      in a large group of subjects over at least a 24 week period.
