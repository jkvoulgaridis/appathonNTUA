  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary revascularization improves survival for patients with coronary artery disease.
      However,many patients are left with poor physical and mental health. Traditional cardiac
      rehabilitation involves moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE). Alternatives to
      traditional cardiac rehabilitation programming may however provide superior understudied
      benefits to patients with poor physical and mental health. Nordic walking (NW) and
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are two examples of alternative programs for cardiac
      rehabilitation, which may provide superior physical and mental health benefits when compared
      to traditional MICE. The main purpose of this project is, therefore, to determine the short
      and long term physical and mental health benefits of alternative cardiac rehabilitation
      modalities, including NW and HIIT on exercise capacity, quality of life and depression after
      a 12-week program.
