      Abstract:

      It is intuitive that post discharge surgical complications are associated with increased
      patient dissatisfaction, and directly associated with an increase in medical expenditures. It
      is also easy to make the connection that many post hospital discharge surgical complications
      including surgical site infections could be influenced or exacerbated by patient
      co-morbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes,
      smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were all of among significant predictors
      of surgical site infections after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for
      optimal patient care especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia is to have
      early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of early surgical site infection with subsequent
      indicated interventions. This theme will lead to patient satisfaction, minimizing third party
      interventions and decrease the total cost associated with these complications. Nevertheless,
      it seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the
      general health care patients receive after a hospital vascular intervention will improve
      overall health and reduce post-operative complications.

      Aims/Objectives:

      1. The primary objective of the current project is to compare early and late outcomes for
      patients who receive post discharge health care monitoring (which includes using Telehealth
      electronic monitoring; THEM) to patients who receive standard of care (SOC) and routine
      discharge instructions and no monitoring.

      Methods:

        1. Randomize patients who are scheduled to have revascularization interventions with groin
           incisions to receive either telehealth electronic health care monitoring or normal
           standard of follow-up care.

        2. Follow patients for 4 weeks, record any 30-day hospital readmissions or complications.
           In addition, have participants complete the follow-up survey questionnaires.

    <measure>The Difference Between Baseline and 30-day Quality of Life (Short-Form 8) Physical Summary Score</measure>
    <time_frame>30-day</time_frame>
    <description>The Difference between baseline and 30-day quality of life (Short-Form 8) Physical summary T-scores. The short-form (SF-8) Health Survey is an 8-item survey designed to measure quality of life. The SF-8 has 8 questions that first measures eight ordinal items (i.e., 1-5 Likert scale): general health, physical health functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health and emotional roles. Summing the responses of the 8 items can be used to report an overall measure of physical and mental functioning. The raw Likert scale scores are converted to normalized standard T scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Measuring physical and mental health both before and after an intervention, as continuous summary scores can indicate better self-reported quality of life with higher scores. A difference score of 0 would indicate no change, while a larger positive difference score would indicate an increase in self-reported quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction as Measured by the General Satisfaction Sub-scale of the Short-Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ18)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' satisfaction was compared using the General Satisfaction sub-scale of the Short-Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ18). The PSQ-18 contains 18 items (questions) that can measure seven dimensions of satisfaction: general satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with doctor, and accessibility and convenience. Responses to the PSQ-18 require a selection on a Likert scale from 1 Strongly Agree to 5 Strongly Disagree with some of the questions worded in such a manner that agreement reflects greater satisfaction (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 15 &amp; 18). These responses were &quot;re-coded&quot; in order for a larger number to reflect greater satisfaction. Next, two individual items (3 and 17) are summed and averaged to produce the general satisfaction sub-scale. A larger number reflects greater satisfaction, with a range of 1 to 5.</description>

        <title>The Difference Between Baseline and 30-day Quality of Life (Short-Form 8) Physical Summary Score</title>
        <description>The Difference between baseline and 30-day quality of life (Short-Form 8) Physical summary T-scores. The short-form (SF-8) Health Survey is an 8-item survey designed to measure quality of life. The SF-8 has 8 questions that first measures eight ordinal items (i.e., 1-5 Likert scale): general health, physical health functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health and emotional roles. Summing the responses of the 8 items can be used to report an overall measure of physical and mental functioning. The raw Likert scale scores are converted to normalized standard T scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Measuring physical and mental health both before and after an intervention, as continuous summary scores can indicate better self-reported quality of life with higher scores. A difference score of 0 would indicate no change, while a larger positive difference score would indicate an increase in self-reported quality of life.</description>

        <title>Patient Satisfaction as Measured by the General Satisfaction Sub-scale of the Short-Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ18)</title>
        <description>Patients' satisfaction was compared using the General Satisfaction sub-scale of the Short-Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ18). The PSQ-18 contains 18 items (questions) that can measure seven dimensions of satisfaction: general satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with doctor, and accessibility and convenience. Responses to the PSQ-18 require a selection on a Likert scale from 1 Strongly Agree to 5 Strongly Disagree with some of the questions worded in such a manner that agreement reflects greater satisfaction (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 15 &amp; 18). These responses were &quot;re-coded&quot; in order for a larger number to reflect greater satisfaction. Next, two individual items (3 and 17) are summed and averaged to produce the general satisfaction sub-scale. A larger number reflects greater satisfaction, with a range of 1 to 5.</description>
