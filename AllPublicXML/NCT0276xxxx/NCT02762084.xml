    <textblock>
      Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study that evaluates the efficacy
      and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% in comparison with vehicle in participants at least 18
      years of age that meet the diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS).
      Participants will be randomized to receive patidegib gel 2%, patidegib gel 4%, or the vehicle
      gel for a 26-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
      patidegib gel 2%, patidegib gel 4%, vehicle gel. One or two tubes of the assigned study drug
      will be dispensed to the participant at the Baseline visit. Additional tubes will be
      dispensed at subsequent visits through Week 22. The study drug will be applied topically to
      the entire face as well as to treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas
      (SEBs) at other anatomical sites twice daily for 26 weeks of treatment.

      Information on reported and observed adverse events will be obtained at each visit. An
      abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 14, and Week 26.

      At Baseline and Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26, all visible basal cell carcinomas (BCCs)
      (excluding areas below the knees) will be identified by the Investigator, circled in ink,
      photographed, measured, and recorded on a body diagram. Treatment-targeted SEBs (defined as
      the 5 SEBs on the face and/or other anatomical areas identified at Baseline as SEBs) will be
      treated during the 26-week treatment phase. If a participant has 5 eligible previously
      untreated facial SEBs (excluding tumors on nose and eyelids) these tumors will be the
      participant's 5 baseline treatment-targeted SEBs and non-facial baseline SEBs will not be
      treated with study drug. Tumors to be measured and mapped include the 5 baseline
      treatment-targeted tumors as well as all other facial tumors including those on the eyelids
      and the nose. In addition, up to 10 non-treatment-targeted non-facial tumors will also be
      measured and mapped.

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Percent Change in Tumor Size of Treatment-targeted Surgically Eligible Basal Cell Carcinomas (SEBs) From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 5 millimeters (mm) or greater in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 mm or greater at sites other than the face. The percent change in greatest diameters of treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) from Baseline to Week 26 was calculated as follows: (sum [Baseline] - sum [Week 26] / sum [Baseline] * 100), where sum = the greatest diameters of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs and positive numbers represent decrease in tumor size and negative numbers to represent increase in tumor size. Missing values were imputed using Last-Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).</description>

    <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 mm or greater in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9-mm or greater at sites other than the face. A single baseline SEB designated as a treatment targeted tumor at Baseline was biopsied first at Baseline and again following 6 weeks of treatment. This was used to assess percent change in GLI1 mRNA levels as follows: (Baseline - Week 6) / Baseline * 100, where positive numbers to represent decrease in GL1 mRNA level and negative numbers to represent increase in GL1 mRNA level. Any missing values were not imputed; all available data is summarized.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The ISGTA is a scale with scores ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (minimal residual tumor), to 3 (clearly visible tumor). The Investigator assessed each Baseline treatment-targeted SEB at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 mm or greater in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 mm or greater at sites other than the face. The percentage of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs evaluated as being clear or almost clear at Week x (Week x = Week 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 or 26) based on the ISGTA scale was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs with ISGTA score of 0 or 1 at Week x) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100. Missing data were imputed using LOCF. The percentage of responders achieving clear (0) or almost clear (1) on the ISGTA scale are presented by Week.</description>

          4. The participant must have a history of at least 10 BCCs in toto present at Baseline
             and/or treated within 24 months prior to screening.

          5. The participant has at Baseline a total of at least 5 previously untreated SEBs
             (greatest diameter 5 millimeters [mm] or greater on the face excluding the nose and
             periorbital skin, 9 mm or greater on non-facial areas excluding the skin below the
             knees), as documented clinically by the Investigator at Baseline. Untreated is define
             as no previous surgical or topical or intralesional drug treatment. Previous treatment
             with systemically administered drugs more than 6 months prior to Baseline is not
             considered previous treatment as long as there was no clinical evidence of resistance
             to oral hedgehog (HH) pathway inhibitors (such as vismodegib, patidegib, and
             sonidegib). Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs must not exceed a diameter of &gt;2
             centimeters (cm). At least one of these tumors must be appropriate for a 2 mm punch
             biopsy for biomarker analysis at Baseline and Week 6 visits. If a participant has 5 or
             more facial, excluding periorbital and nasal skin, SEBs at Baseline, non-facial SEBs
             will not be treatment-targeted SEBs.

          6. The participant is willing to have SEBs biopsied for biomarkers and plasma to be
             collected to measure drug levels as required in the protocol.

          7. The participant is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical
             prescription and over the counter medications to facial skin and within 5 cm of
             treatment targeted SEBs at other anatomical areas for the duration of the study except
             as prescribed by the Investigator. Moisturizers and emollients are allowable.
             Participants will be encouraged to use sunscreen with a sunscreen protection factor
             (SPF) 15 or higher at least once daily on all exposed skin sites.

          8. Female participants must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.

          9. If the participant is a male with a female sexual partner who is of childbearing
             potential the couple is willing to use two effective methods of birth control during
             the duration of the trial and for one month after the last application of the gel. A
             female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone
             a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time in the
             preceding 24 consecutive months), must agree to use 2 effective methods of
             contraception for the duration of the study and at least 1 month after the last study
             drug application. The two forms of birth control authorized are defined as the use of
             a barrier method of contraception (condom with spermicide) in association with one of
             the following methods of birth control: bilateral tubal ligation; combined oral
             contraceptives (estrogens and progesterone) or implanted or injectable contraceptives
             with a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Baseline; hormonal intra-uterine
             device (IUD) inserted at least 1 month prior to Baseline.

         10. The participant is willing to contact the study center after each primary skin care
             physician (PSCP) visit to provide the study center details of the visit and any
             treatment of skin tumors.

         11. The participant is willing to forego treatment of the treatment targeted baseline SEBs
             except when the Investigator and/or primary care giver believes that delay in
             treatment potentially might compromise the health of the participant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant is a woman of childbearing potential. This proscription is based on
             the key role of the HH pathway in embryogenesis, the known preclinical teratogenic
             effects of systemic cyclopamine, a naturally occurring inhibitor of SMO, and the
             unknown level of systemic exposure following topical application in humans. A female
             of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time in the
             preceding 24 consecutive months).

          2. The participant has used topical products to the face or within 5 cm of a treatment
             targeted SEB or systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of the
             study medication during the study. Specifically, these include the use of:

               -  Topical glucocorticoids 30 days prior to screening

               -  Retinoids (such as etretinate, isotretinoin, tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene)
                  systemically or topically or &gt; 5% of an alphahydroxy acid (such as glycolic acid,
                  lactic acid) or 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod (except as topical treatment to
                  discrete BCCs) systemically or topically to the skin during the 6 months prior to
                  entry.

               -  Systemic chemotherapy within one year prior to screening. (Note: field therapy
                  with topically applied treatments can be done as long as they are not applied
                  within 5 cm of a treatment targeted tumor).

               -  Known inhibitors of the HH signaling pathway (such as vismodegib, patidegib, and
                  sonidegib) topically or systemically within 6 months of entry into the study.

          3. The participant has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the
             study drug formulation.

          4. The participant is unable or unwilling to make a good faith effort to return for all
             follow-up visits and tests.

          5. The participant has uncontrolled systemic disease.

          6. The participant has clinically important history of liver disease, including viral
             hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.

          7. The participant has any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may
             put the participant at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could
             interfere significantly with the participant's participation in the study. This
             includes history of other skin conditions or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination findings, or clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might
             affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the participant at high
             risk from treatment complications.

          8. The participant has a history of invasive cancer within the past 5 years excluding
             non-melanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of breast,
             or chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (Stage 0).

          9. The participant has current, recent (within 4 weeks of Baseline visit), or planned
             participation in an experimental drug study while enrolled in this study.

         10. Female sexual partner(s) of male participants who are unwilling or unable to comply
             with pregnancy prevention measures.

        <title>Clinical Efficacy: Percent Change in Tumor Size of Treatment-targeted Surgically Eligible Basal Cell Carcinomas (SEBs) From Baseline</title>
        <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 5 millimeters (mm) or greater in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 mm or greater at sites other than the face. The percent change in greatest diameters of treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) from Baseline to Week 26 was calculated as follows: (sum [Baseline] - sum [Week 26] / sum [Baseline] * 100), where sum = the greatest diameters of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs and positive numbers represent decrease in tumor size and negative numbers to represent increase in tumor size. Missing values were imputed using Last-Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).</description>

        <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 mm or greater in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9-mm or greater at sites other than the face. A single baseline SEB designated as a treatment targeted tumor at Baseline was biopsied first at Baseline and again following 6 weeks of treatment. This was used to assess percent change in GLI1 mRNA levels as follows: (Baseline - Week 6) / Baseline * 100, where positive numbers to represent decrease in GL1 mRNA level and negative numbers to represent increase in GL1 mRNA level. Any missing values were not imputed; all available data is summarized.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Central Facial SEBs From Baseline</title>
        <description>Central facial SEBs were defined as those located on the nose or periorbital area (eyelids) which were 3 mm or greater at Baseline. The percent change from Baseline to Week x (Week x = Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, or 26) in central facial SEBs was calculated as follows: [sum (Baseline) - sum (Week x)] / [sum (Baseline)] * 100 where sum = the greatest diameters of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs where positive numbers to represent decrease in tumor size and negative numbers to represent increase in tumor size. Missing values were imputed using LOCF.</description>

The proportion of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs that at the end of 26 weeks of treatment were no longer large enough to be classified as SEBs (that is, the proportion of Baseline treatment targeted SEBs on the face that became &lt; 5 mm in greatest diameter and non-facial Baseline treatment targeted SEBs that became &lt; 9 mm in greatest diameter) were calculated for each participant as follows:
(Number of Baseline treatment-targeted facial SEBs with greatest diameter &lt; 5 mm) + (Baseline treatment targeted non-facial SEBs with greatest diameter &lt; 9 mm) / Number of baseline treatment targeted SEBs.
Missing values were imputed using LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Treatment-targeted SEBs Achieving Clear or Almost Clear on the 5-point Investigator Static Global Tumor Assessment (ISGTA) Scale</title>
        <description>The ISGTA is a scale with scores ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (minimal residual tumor), to 3 (clearly visible tumor). The Investigator assessed each Baseline treatment-targeted SEB at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 mm or greater in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 mm or greater at sites other than the face. The percentage of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs evaluated as being clear or almost clear at Week x (Week x = Week 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 or 26) based on the ISGTA scale was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs with ISGTA score of 0 or 1 at Week x) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100. Missing data were imputed using LOCF. The percentage of responders achieving clear (0) or almost clear (1) on the ISGTA scale are presented by Week.</description>
