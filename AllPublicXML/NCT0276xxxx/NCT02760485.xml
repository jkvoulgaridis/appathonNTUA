        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of DLBCL.

               -  Phase 1: any DLBCL subtype.

               -  Phase 2: activated B-cell or unclassifiable subtypes confirmed by
                  immunohistochemistry using the Hans algorithm

          -  Relapsed or refractory DLBCL, defined as having received at least 1 but no more than 3
             prior treatment regimens and ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy/autologous stem
             cell transplant.

          -  Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid disease (based on local evaluation) per the Lugano
             Classification. Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid disease is defined as disease with a 5-point
             scale score of 4 or 5.

          -  Archived tumor tissue (block or 15-20 unstained slides) available, or be willing to
             undergo an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of accessible adenopathy (or, in
             less accessible lymph nodes, 4 to 8 core biopsies).

          -  At least 1 measurable (≥ 2 cm in longest dimension) lesion on CT scan or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Transformed DLBCL or DLBCL with coexistent histologies (eg, follicular or
             mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma).

          -  Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma.

          -  Known central nervous system lymphoma (either primary or metastatic).

          -  Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the previous 6 months, or active graft versus
             host disease following allogeneic transplant.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive therapy within 28 days of starting study treatment.
             Immunosuppressive therapy includes but is not limited to cyclosporine A, tacrolimus,
             or high-dose corticosteroids. Subjects receiving corticosteroids must be at a dose
             level ≤ 10 mg/day within 7 days of initiating study treatment.

          -  Prior or concurrent therapy with a Janus kinase inhibitor or Bruton's tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor
