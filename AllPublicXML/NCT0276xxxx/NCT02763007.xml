      Double blind, three arm, comparative intervention trial for 24 weeks(PEAK study) with open
      label extension trial for 28 weeks followed by 2 year observational study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PEAK trial is now undergoing (Multicenter, randomized, double blind, three-arm parallel group
      study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone combination therapy on
      glucose control in type 2 diabetes subjects who have inadequate control with Metformin
      monotherapy in Korea, Takeda No. ALO-IIT-012).

      Duration of combination treatment is 24 week in the PEAK trial. Long-term efficacy and safety
      of alogliptin + pioglitazone + metformin combination therapy is not defined in Korea yet.

      Thus, extension of the PEAK trial for the longer treatment upto 1 year has been planned.

      PEAK trial will be followed by another 28 week open-label treatment of the same drug as
      initial randomization (total duration of treatment as randomized 52 week), and followed by 2
      year of observation.

      During observation period, any antidiabetic medication can be added/changed when HbA1c of the
      subject is off target 7% with clinician's clinical decision.

      After 3 years of initial randomization, durability of glucose control will be assessed
      between 3 treatment group.
