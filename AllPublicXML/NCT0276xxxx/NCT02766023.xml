  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2b trial is designed to provide a screening evaluation for the hypothesis that,
      following a 5-day treatment with MetroGel® to treat BV, L. crispatus CTV-05 (LACTIN-V, Osel,
      Inc.) administered at 2 x 10^9 cfu/dose using a vaginal applicator reduces the 12-week
      incidence of BV recurrence when compared to placebo. The primary objectives of this study
      are: 1) To estimate the efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V (2 x 10^9 cfu/dose) as
      compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence by 12 weeks following treatment of BV with
      MetroGel vaginal gel (MetroGel). 2) To assess the safety of LACTIN-V over 24 weeks by
      comparing the incidence of AEs between individuals randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II-b multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess
      the efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence in
      women diagnosed with BV. The study will also assess the safety of LACTIN-V by comparing the
      incidence of AEs between women randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo. The study plans to enroll
      228 non-pregnant, pre-menopausal women age 18 to 45 years. Women will be randomized 2:1 to
      receive LACTIN-V or placebo. Potentially eligible women will start a standard 5-day course of
      MetroGel. Women will return to the study clinic within 2 days after completing the 5-day
      course of MetroGel to re-evaluate eligibility criteria and review the BV test results from
      the screening visit. Women with Amsel criteria &gt; /=3 and Nugent score 4-10 will be instructed
      to administer the LACTIN-V or placebo at home for 5 consecutive days and then twice weekly
      for 10 weeks. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To estimate the efficacy of
      repeated doses of LACTIN-V (2 x109 cfu/dose) as compared to placebo in preventing BV
      recurrence by 12 weeks following treatment of BV with MetroGel vaginal gel (MetroGel). 2) To
      assess the safety of LACTIN-V over 24 weeks by comparing the incidence of AEs between
      individuals randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo. Secondary objectives are: 1) To investigate
      the colonization of LACTIN-V (presence of L. crispatus CTV-05 in the vaginal specimen) and
      fluctuations over 12 weeks, in relation to menses and sexual intercourse 2) To evaluate user
      acceptability and tolerability of LACTIN-V over 12 weeks, including perceptions around method
      of delivery and dosing. 3) To measure long-term colonization of LACTIN-V at 24 weeks (12
      weeks after last dosing) 4) To estimate the long-term efficacy of repeated doses of LACTIN-V
      (2 x 109 cfu/dose) as compared to placebo in preventing BV recurrence at 24 weeks (12 weeks
      after last dosing)

    <measure>The Proportion of Participants With a Positive BV Diagnosis in Each Study Arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>A positive BV diagnosis was defined by meeting at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 4-10. Amsel criteria are: homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; vaginal pH &gt;4.5; positive whiff-amine test, defined as the presence of a fishy odor when a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is added to a sample of vaginal discharge; and presence of clue cells (&gt;20%) on microscopy. The Amsel score ranges from 0-4, where higher scores mean a worse outcome. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods scored as 0 to 4, small Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 4, and curved Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 2, and adding all component scores. The Nugent score ranges from 0-10, where higher scores mean a worse outcome. All BV diagnoses following 15 days after enrollment (22 days after commencement of MetroGel treatment) were considered a recurrent episode.</description>

        <title>The Proportion of Participants With a Positive BV Diagnosis in Each Study Arm.</title>
        <description>A positive BV diagnosis was defined by meeting at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 4-10. Amsel criteria are: homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; vaginal pH &gt;4.5; positive whiff-amine test, defined as the presence of a fishy odor when a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is added to a sample of vaginal discharge; and presence of clue cells (&gt;20%) on microscopy. The Amsel score ranges from 0-4, where higher scores mean a worse outcome. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods scored as 0 to 4, small Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 4, and curved Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 2, and adding all component scores. The Nugent score ranges from 0-10, where higher scores mean a worse outcome. All BV diagnoses following 15 days after enrollment (22 days after commencement of MetroGel treatment) were considered a recurrent episode.</description>

        <population>The analysis population was the intent-to-treat population (all randomized participants). Missing BV recurrence data was imputed using Last Observation Carried Forward</population>

        <title>The Proportion of Participants With a Positive BV Diagnosis in Each Study Arm.</title>
        <description>A positive BV diagnosis was defined by at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 4-10. Amsel criteria are: homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; vaginal pH &gt;4.5; positive whiff-amine test, defined as the presence of a fishy odor when a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is added to a sample of vaginal discharge; and presence of clue cells (&gt;20%) on microscopy. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods scored as 0 to 4, small Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 4, and curved Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 2. All BV diagnoses following 15 days after enrollment (22 days after commencement of MetroGel treatment) were considered a recurrent episode.</description>

          <title>The Proportion of Participants With a Positive BV Diagnosis in Each Study Arm.</title>
          <description>A positive BV diagnosis was defined by at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 4-10. Amsel criteria are: homogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; vaginal pH &gt;4.5; positive whiff-amine test, defined as the presence of a fishy odor when a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is added to a sample of vaginal discharge; and presence of clue cells (&gt;20%) on microscopy. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods scored as 0 to 4, small Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 4, and curved Gram-variable rods scored as 0 to 2. All BV diagnoses following 15 days after enrollment (22 days after commencement of MetroGel treatment) were considered a recurrent episode.</description>
