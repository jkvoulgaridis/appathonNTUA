  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, single-institution, single-arm phase II study of Axitinib
      in patients with unresectable recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
      The subjects will be started on treatment with 5 mg of Axitinib twice a day continuously,
      with subsequent dose escalation to 7 mg and then 10 mg twice a day in the absence of grade 2
      or worse toxicities. This will be followed by clinical and/or radiologic response assessment
      after 8 weeks and subsequently every 2 months until disease progression or intolerable
      toxicity.
