      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  1. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of infusing reduced volume Factor Eight
           Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA) at the standard infusion rate of 2 U/kg/min

        -  2. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of infusing reduced volume FEIBA at increased
           rates of 4 and 10 U/kg/min, in comparison to the standard rate of 2 U/kg/min at the
           regular volume

      15 JUN 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the
      COVID-10 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries/sites, and the study is now again
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of
      new patients due to the pandemic.

      23 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

                  of all exogenous hormonal treatments and with follicle-stimulating hormone levels
                  within the laboratory-defined postmenopausal range or postmenopausal with

             device during the course of this study.

         12. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.

         13. Clinically significant medical, psychiatric or cognitive illness, or recreational
