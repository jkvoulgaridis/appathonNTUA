  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic effects between the axillary
      bilateral-breast approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic
      thyroidectomy.To explore the efficacy, safety, cosmetic results and clinical value by the two
      approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although several reports on operative outcomes of the robotic technique have appeared, no
      prospective trials comparing the clinical results of between the axillary bilateral-breast
      approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic thyroidectomy have
      been described. The investigators therefore designed a prospective trial comparing outcomes,
      including surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction, between patients undergoing robotic and
      conventional open thyroidectomy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of VAS Pain Scores for the First 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>The pain scores of 2pm, 10pm and 6am on the first day after operation were evaluated.The mean values were calculated and recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale is utilized to assess the postoperative pain change for the first 24 hours.Using a 10cm straight line, one end is marked 0 for &quot;pain free&quot; and the other end is marked 10 for &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. The pain intensity of the patient's own feelings was marked on a straight line, and the length from 0 to the marked point represented the pain level of the patient. The evaluation criteria of VAS were as follows: 0 for pain, 3 for mild pain, 4 to 6 for moderate pain and 7 to 10 for severe pain.Lower values represent better outcomes, higher values represent worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction with cosmetic outcomes was analyzed quantitatively using a scoring system that ranged from 1 to 4(1, extremely; 2, fairly; 3, normal; 4: not at all) that was rated by patients at the outpatient clinic 3 months after the operation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Voice</measure>
    <time_frame>After operation 8 a.m. on the 7th day</time_frame>
    <description>We have developed a questionnaire with a total of 30 questions, each with a score of 4, and the patients scored according to their own situation. The highest score of the questionnaire is 120, the lowest score is 0, the best, the score is 0-30, 30-60 is good, 60-90 is normal, 90-120 is poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Swallowing Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>8 a.m. on the 3rd day after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The patient sat upright and drank 30 ml warm boiled water to observe the time required and the cough.
score (excellent) can swallow water smoothly once
score (good) more than 2 times, can swallow without coughing
score (middle) can swallow once, but have a choking cough
score (may) more than 2 times swallowing, but with choking cough
score (difference) frequent cough, not all swallowing Calculate the average value for statistical analysis</description>

        <title>Change of VAS Pain Scores for the First 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The visual analogue scale is utilized to assess the postoperative pain change for the first 24 hours.Using a 10cm straight line, one end is marked 0 for &quot;pain free&quot; and the other end is marked 10 for &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. The pain intensity of the patient's own feelings was marked on a straight line, and the length from 0 to the marked point represented the pain level of the patient. The evaluation criteria of VAS were as follows: 0 for pain, 3 for mild pain, 4 to 6 for moderate pain and 7 to 10 for severe pain.Lower values represent better outcomes, higher values represent worse outcomes.</description>
        <time_frame>The pain scores of 2pm, 10pm and 6am on the first day after operation were evaluated.The mean values were calculated and recorded.</time_frame>
