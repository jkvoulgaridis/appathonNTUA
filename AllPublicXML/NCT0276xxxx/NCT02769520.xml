  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pembrolizumab, when given after salvage
      surgery, is effective in increasing the time a person with squamous cell cancer of the head
      and neck remains disease-free following locoregional disease recurrence.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open label, phase II study with a window of opportunity
      component in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
      treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab following salvage surgery. Forty-five (45) patients will
      participate in this study to determine disease-free survival probability at 12 months.
      Secondary objectives include assessments of disease-free survival probability at 2 years,
      overall survival, adverse events and toxicity, and immune and molecular correlatives. For the
      window of opportunity component, patients will be randomized 3:1 in favor of receiving
      pembrolizumab 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every three weeks for a maximum of two
      doses, versus placebo prior to salvage surgery. Approximately three to six weeks following
      the first dose of pembrolizumab, patients will undergo salvage surgery. Tumor tissue and
      blood will be collected at the time of surgery for immune correlative studies.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has pathologically confirmed SCCHN (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx) with
             evidence of local and/or locoregional recurrence. Laryngeal tumors will only be
             included if there is evidence of extralaryngeal spread, or there is associated nodal
             disease. For all other sites, superficial tumors can only be included if there is
             associated nodal disease.

          -  Has a documented disease-free interval (minimum 16 weeks) after initial curative
             intent therapy.

          -  Candidate for salvage resection.

          -  Able to provide tissue from diagnostic core biopsy of tumor lesion(s).

          -  Patient has adequate organ function.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate birth control.

          -  Male patient with a partner of childbearing potential agrees to use an adequate method
             of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after
             the last dose of study therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has disease of nasopharyngeal carcinoma histology.

          -  Patient has evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Patient is currently receiving or has received another investigational agent within 4
             weeks prior to study Day 1.

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy
