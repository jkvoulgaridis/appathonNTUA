      This study seeks to assess trends in hCG between the 9th and 12th weeks of gestation. Women
      presenting at prenatal care at the study site who are 70 days gestation or less will be
      offered participation in the study. 75 consenting women will be asked to provide urine for an
      MLPT and to have blood drawn for hCG serum testing at 56-63 days, 64-70 days, and 71-77 days'
      gestation, and 75 consenting women will be asked to provide urine for an MLPT and to have
      blood drawn for hCG serum testing at 64-70 days, 71-77 days, and 78-84 days' gestation.

      Women presenting at the study site for a prenatal visit, and who are â‰¤ 70 days' gestation,
      will be offered participation in the study. Efforts will also be made to recruit patients
      through physician or treating health care professional referral and advertisements. One
      hundred and fifty consenting women will be enrolled. Up to three additional study visits will
      be scheduled: At the enrollment, if an ultrasound-confirmed gestational age is not available
      in the woman's medical record, a transvaginal ultrasound will be performed. If the woman is
      56-63 days gestation on the day of enrollment, she will be asked to return weekly until she
      reaches 71-77 days. If the woman is 64-70 days gestation, she will be asked to return weekly
      until she reaches 78-84 days. If the woman is less than 56 days gestation, she will be asked
      to return for the three research visits at the appropriate time to provide the urine samples
      and blood draws. Women will have one visit during each of their three assigned gestational
      age weeks. At each visit, women will provide a urine sample for an MLPT and have a blood draw
      to measure serum hCG.
