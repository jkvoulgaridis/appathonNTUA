    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 41 sites were approved for recruiting subjects, of which 40 sites screened and randomized the subjects.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Insulin treated subjects on current treatment: basal insulin, premixed insulin or a self-mixed insulin regimen, all administered once daily or twice daily (BID) with or without metformin. The treatment regimen should have remained unchanged for at least 8 weeks prior to randomisation.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>IDegAsp BID</title>
          <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

          <description>Subjects received s.c. injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30, a mixture of soluble insulin aspart [IAsp] 30% and protaminated IAsp 70%) BID for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG ≤5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day.

Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

The model included treatment, anti-diabetic therapy at screening and sex as fixed factors, and age as covariate. Confirmed hypoglycaemia is defined as either severe episodes or episodes with plasma glucose &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms. The nocturnal period was defined as the period between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m. (both inclusive). A treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode was defined as an episode that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment.</description>

            <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

        <title>Responder for HbA1c (HbA1c ≤6.5%) Without Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>A responder for HbA1c without confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined as a subject who meets the HbA1c target (≤6.5%) at end of trial without treatment emergent confirmed hypoglycaemia during the last 12 weeks of treatment or within 7 days after the last randomised treatment. Confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined as either severe episodes or episodes with plasma glucose &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms. Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Missing data is imputed using last observed value.</description>

            <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

        <title>Mean of the 9-point Profile (SMPG) After 26 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>SMPG values were recorded at 9 time-points: before and after (90 min after the start of the meal) breakfast, lunch, main evening meal, before bedtime, at 4 am and before breakfast on the next day. Missing values were imputed using last observed value. The mean of 9-point profile (SMPG) was defined as the area under the profile divided by the measurement time and was calculated using the trapezoidal method.</description>

The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

        <title>2-point Profile (SMPG) Measurements Obtained Throughout the Trial for Dose Adjustment - Time From Randomisation (Measured in Weeks) to Achieve Titration Targets</title>
        <description>2-point profiles (SMPG): pre-breakfast and pre-dinner (main evening meal) SMPGs were to be taken for titration/dose adjustments. The pre-specified titration targets were to achieve SMPG level &lt;5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) both before breakfast and before main evening meal. For each target, the time from randomisation to the date a subject achieves the titration target for the first time was derived (Kaplan-Meier method). Reported results are time to all titration target (pre-breakfast and pre-dinner) was met for the first time.</description>

          <title>2-point Profile (SMPG) Measurements Obtained Throughout the Trial for Dose Adjustment - Time From Randomisation (Measured in Weeks) to Achieve Titration Targets</title>
          <description>2-point profiles (SMPG): pre-breakfast and pre-dinner (main evening meal) SMPGs were to be taken for titration/dose adjustments. The pre-specified titration targets were to achieve SMPG level &lt;5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) both before breakfast and before main evening meal. For each target, the time from randomisation to the date a subject achieves the titration target for the first time was derived (Kaplan-Meier method). Reported results are time to all titration target (pre-breakfast and pre-dinner) was met for the first time.</description>

        <title>2-point Profile (SMPG) Measurements Obtained Throughout the Trial for Dose Adjustment - Within-subject Variability as Measured by Coefficient of Variance (CV)% After 26 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The logarithm transformed SMPG values available before breakfast and main evening meal were analysed separately as repeated measures in a linear mixed model with treatment, anti-diabetic therapy at screening and sex as fixed factors, age as covariate and subject as random factor. The model assumed independent within- and between-subject errors with variances depending on treatment. Within-subject variability as measured by CoV% for a treatment could be calculated from the corresponding residual variance.</description>

Severe: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.
Asymptomatic: An episode not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but with a measured PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L.
Documented symptomatic: An episode during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia are accompanied by a measured PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L.
Relative: An episode during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and interprets those as indicative of hypoglycaemia, but with a measured PG level &gt;3.9 mmol/L.
Probable symptomatic: An episode during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia are not accompanied by a PG determination but that was presumably caused by a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L.

            <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (Treatment Related Impact Measures - Diabetes Device [TRIM-D Device])</title>
        <description>TRIM-D device is an eight item measure with two domains assessing Device Bother and Device Function. This captures information on the ease of use, convenience, and handling of the device(s) used to take diabetes medication. The measure has acceptable reliability, validity and ability to detect change. The scores were transformed to a 0−100 scale with higher scores indicating less treatment related impact. Missing data was imputed using last observed value.</description>

Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

        <description>Device Specific Questionnaires I (How easy or difficult is it to feel the clicks for each unit increment?) was measured on following categories: Very easy, Fairly easy, Neither easy nor difficult, Rather difficult and Very difficult. Reported results are number of participants reporting the individual category of the question at week 26. Missing data was imputed using last observed value.</description>

            <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

            <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

            <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>

          <title>IDegAsp BID</title>
          <description>Subjects received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks. Subjects started insulin treatment at dose corresponding to their pre-trial insulin treatment. The insulin dose adjustments aimed to reach pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, based on the subject’s pre-breakfast and pre-dinner SMPG. The dose taken with main evening meal was adjusted according to mean pre-breakfast plasma glucose measured on the day of adjustment and the two preceding days. The dose taken at breakfast was adjusted according to mean pre-main evening meal plasma glucose measured on the three days preceding the adjustment day. If one of the PG values was below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L), the corresponding dose was to be reduced. If one or more SMPG values were missing, the adjustment was to be performed on remaining SMPG values. Subjects continued the pre-trial treatment with metformin at stable dose.</description>
