  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichen planus is a chronic cutaneous and mucosal disease characterized by the infiltration of
      cluster of differentiation (CD) CD8 T lymphocytes, localized under the basal membrane and
      associated with apoptosis of basal keratinocytes, suggesting a reactivity of T lymphocytes
      toward keratinocyte antigen(s), so far unidentified. In a recent study, the research team at
      Institut Pasteur has demonstrated in a peculiar clinical form of lichen planus (erosive
      lichen planus), that the immunogenic target of CD8 T lymphocytes could be the immunodominant
      peptide of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 16.

      In line with this recent work which shows for the first time a link between HPV-16 and an
      autoimmune disease, erosive lichen planus, the aim of te study is to test the hypothesis that
      HPV could be also involved in the pathogenesis of other clinical forms of lichen, such as non
      erosive lichen planus or lichen sclerosus.

      as non erosive lichen planus or lichen sclerosus.

      Regarding erosive lichen planus, the aim is to test the cytotoxic function of the previously
      identified CD8 T lymphocytes specific for HPV16 E711-20.

    <measure>The use of the different segments of the Vbeta gene assessed by quantitative PCR, and the distribution of the different sizes of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) CDR3 by immunoscope.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with a non-erosive type of lichen and with a lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, the hypothesis for oligoclonal bias in the T-cell receptor repertoire on peripheral and in situ CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes will be tested realizing, on the 2 sorted subpopulations, a study of the use of the different segments of the Vbeta gene using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and a study of the distribution study of the different sizes of the CDR3 using immunoscope method.
Depending on whether or not bias in the T-cell receptor repertoire exists, the study will be continued by looking for the same repertoire bias in situ, on injury site (skin or mucous, depending on the clinical type of lichen), and the research of clonal sequences (or clonotypes) from RNA of patients after cloning and complete sequencing. If clonotype T CD8 Vbeta3 are identified in these types of lichen, their specificity to HPV16 E711-20 wil be assessed by flow cytometry.</description>
