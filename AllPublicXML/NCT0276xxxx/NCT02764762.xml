  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of triple combination therapy with an
      anti-integrin (vedolizumab intravenous [IV]), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist
      (adalimumab subcutaneously [SC]), and an immunomodulator (oral methotrexate) on endoscopic
      remission in participants with newly-diagnosed CD stratified at higher risk for
      complications.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have CD. This study will look at the endoscopic remission and mucosal
      healing of gastrointestinal tract of people who take vedolizumab as triple combination
      therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. Participants will receive triple
      combination therapy which includes:

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg (intravenous)

        -  Adalimumab 160/80/40 mg (subcutaneous)

        -  Methotrexate 15 mg (Oral)

      All participants will receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion on Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22
      along with adalimumab 160 mg, subcutaneous injection at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg
      once at Week 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 26 along with methotrexate tablets
      orally, once weekly from Weeks 0 up to Week 34. In monotherapy phase, all participants will
      receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion once at Weeks 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94 and
      102.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 128 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up
      assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety questionnaire, by phone,
      at 26 weeks (6 months) from the last dose of study drug.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Endoscopic Remission at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) scale score from 0-2. The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, percentage of the surface area that is ulcerated, percentage of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 colonic segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable is sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
