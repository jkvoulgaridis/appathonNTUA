  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents have some of the highest rates of risk behaviors of all age groups and health
      behaviors developed in adolescence can persist into adulthood. These behaviors carry
      significant risks for subsequent disease, disability, and healthcare burden. Despite these
      risks, health risk screening in primary care is infrequently performed and results are rarely
      followed by targeted intervention. In response to the need for screening-linked
      interventions, our study team has developed a web-based, electronic Personalized Motivational
      Feedback tool which we refer to as &quot;Check Yourself.&quot; Based on motivational interviewing, a
      technique to mobilize personal change, Check Yourself is designed to promote healthy choices
      for the multiple behaviors relevant to adolescents as well as to provide information to
      providers to promote discussions around health behaviors between providers and adolescents.

      Building on electronic health interventions, primary care providers can play an essential
      role in helping adolescents to make healthy behavior choices. Emerging evidence suggests that
      the consistency of preventive counseling can be increased through provider training and the
      provision of screening tools; yet, we know very little about the quality of such counseling,
      and if it impacts outcomes that are important to adolescent patients themselves.

      This study is a stepped-wedge, controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an interactive
      adolescent-centered training for primary care providers (I-ACT) and Check Yourself to usual
      care. This study will take place in six pediatric practices. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether this system of interventions (i.e., I-ACT, Check Yourself, and the summary
      report) is more effective than usual care in reducing health risk behaviors, improving
      adolescent motivation for health, and improving quality of care among adolescents receiving
      primary health care services.

    <description>Adolescents complete Check Yourself which delivers personalized, motivational feedback on their health behaviors prior to their primary care appointment. Check Yourself includes the provision of age normative feedback, goal setting strategies, and strategies to highlight discrepancies. Primary care providers will receive I-ACT and the Check Yourself summary report of health risk behaviors before an adolescent patient's appointment. I-ACT will provide training in adolescent-preferred communication methods and use of Check Yourself as a framework for the provider to use motivational interviewing to consider the patients' change readiness and their personal health goals. I-ACT includes online interactive, case-based learning, with booster sessions and feedback reports to reinforce new skills.</description>

          <description>Adolescents completed Check Yourself which delivered personalized, motivational feedback to them on their health behaviors prior to their primary care appointment. Primary care providers received training (I-ACT) and the Check Yourself summary report of health risk behaviors before the adolescent’s appointment. I-ACT consisted of online, interactive training in adolescent-preferred communication methods and motivational interviewing, with booster sessions and feedback reports to reinforce new skills.</description>

          <description>In the usual care group, adolescents are asked to complete health risk screening on a computer. No personalized feedback is provided to adolescents and primary care providers do not receive I-ACT or the Check Yourself summary report of the adolescent's health risk behaviors.</description>
