  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective revascularization for their peripheral artery disease will be
      randomized to a &quot;prehabilitation&quot; program prior to their surgery or to usual care. The
      prehabilitation program is self-directed program designed to improve health and quality of
      life prior to surgery. The program is currently offered to general surgery patients; this
      study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of such a program in a different patient
      population.

    <measure>Feasibility of Study as Indicated by Number of Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of the study will be assessed by analyzing the recruitment of subjects to the study and the compliance of recruited subjects to the protocol. Feasibility will be defined as able to screening, approaching, and enrolling 25 eligible patients to the pilot study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of Study as Indicated by Percentage of Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The willingness of patients to enroll and complete the basic study procedures. Acceptability will be defined as low drop out-rates (&lt;15%), completion of quality of life surveys, and &gt;85% usage of the pedometers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increased Physical Activity Characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Increased physical activity characteristics will be assessed through the Godin Leisure Time and International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and questionnaires on barriers to and self-efficacy of exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life and physical activity characteristics will be measured during the pre, peri, and post-operative period. This will be done through PROMIS surveys, which assess physical function, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and ability to participate in and satisfaction with social roles/activities.</description>
