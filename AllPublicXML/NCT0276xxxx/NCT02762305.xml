  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that participation in the Retired and Senior Volunteer
      Program (RSVP) Bone Builders program 1 hour, twice per week, for 12 weeks may result in
      significant positive changes to the health status of older adult participants as demonstrated
      by increased leg strength and walking speed, improved balance and balance confidence, and
      enhanced life satisfaction. These improvements may lead to a reduction in risk of falls.

      The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of the RSVP Bone Builders program, to
      document benefits this program may have for older adults and also provide additional evidence
      that further confirms the importance of exercise for the older adult population. Exercise has
      the potential to reduce falls, injuries, emergency room visits, surgeries, insurance costs,
      and improve the overall quality of life in the older adult population. If the RSVP Bone
      Builders proves to be beneficial for older adults, the program could be recommended by
      healthcare and exercise professionals for their patients and clients who are at risk for
      falls.
