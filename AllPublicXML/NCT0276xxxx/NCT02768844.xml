  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to to quantify the physiology of neonatal drug
      withdrawal and develop non-pharmacological techniques to help improve the therapeutic
      management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel approaches to diagnosing and treating Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) are needed for
      reducing prolonged pharmacological management, minimizing hospitalization and improving
      developmental outcomes in drug exposed newborns. This study seeks to examine the physiology
      and symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.g., irritability marked by movement activity;
      cardio-respiratory instabilities) in infants exposed to drugs in utero and test whether
      sensory stimuli (tactile, auditory) reduce dysregulated systems in the withdrawing infant.

      Candidates at-risk for NAS due to fetal drug exposure will be identified to investigators by
      the infant's primary medical caregiver. Investigators will use a modified-consecutive
      sampling technique, restricted by equipment and personnel availability, for enrolling
      infants. Participants will be studied throughout their hospitalization. Effects of
      stimulation will be examined at different stages of withdrawal. Efficacy of stimulation will
      be examined as a potential complementary treatment of NAS.

    <description>Prospective, within-subject design. Compare effects of mattress SVS (ON) and Control (SVS OFF) on physiology in opioid-exposed newborns. SVS is alternated in intervals between continuous stimulation (ON) and no stimulation (OFF/Control) throughout inter-feed intervals. The order of the ON-OFF cycles is randomized across subjects and counterbalanced between feeding periods within subjects.</description>
