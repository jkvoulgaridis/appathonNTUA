  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, subjects who were vaccinated with a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine in a
      previous study (whose objectives &amp; outcome measures are presented in a separate protocol
      posting with NCT number = 00227422) will be vaccinated with a new vaccine using conjugation
      technology.

      These subjects will be compared to subjects vaccinated with the new vaccine, but who were not
      previously vaccinated with a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals has developed a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK134612). This candidate
      vaccine has been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in toddlers, children aged 3-5
      years, and adolescents/young adults. Repeated vaccinations with unconjugated meningococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine has shown to induce hyporesponsiveness to re-vaccination, this for
      serogroup C, and a recent publication suggest the same may be true for other serogroups.

      This study will evaluate GSK Biologicals' candidate vaccine's ability to induce satisfactory
      immune response for the serogroups it contains across subjects 4.5 through 34 years of age
      who previously received a tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine when aged 2-30
      years. A non-randomised age-strata matched group of subjects, who have not previously
      received (or not received within the preceding 10 years) any meningococcal vaccine, will also
      be administered the GSK134612 vaccine for comparison.
