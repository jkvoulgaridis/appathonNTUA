  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a uncontrolled, open-label, non-randomized Phase II study of oral BAY73-4506 to
      evaluate the response rate of BAY73-4506 in previously untreated patients with metastatic or
      unresectable renal cell cancer (RCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The final analysis of efficacy will be performed after last patient has been treated for at
      least 6 months. Additional periodic safety and efficacy data reviews will be performed for
      any patients continuing to receive study drug afterwards.

    <measure>Objective Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first participant until database cut-off approximately 13 months later (13May2008 - 31May2009). Assessed every 8 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response of a participant was defined as the best tumor response (confirmed Complete Response [CR, tumor disappears] or Partial Response [PR, sum of lesion sizes decreased at least 30% from baseline]) observed during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) committee.</description>

    <description>Tumor response of a participant was defined as the best tumor response (confirmed Complete Response [CR, tumor disappears], Partial Response [PR, sum of lesion sizes decreased at least 30% from baseline], Stable Disease [SD, steady state of disease], or Progressive Disease [PD, sum of lesion sizes increased at least 20% from smallest sum on study or new lesions]) observed during trial period assessed according to the RECIST committee.</description>

    <measure>Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first participant until database cut-off approximately 13 months later (13May2008 - 31May2009). Assessed every 8 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control was defined as the percentage of participants who had a best response rating of CR (tumor disappears), PR (sum of lesion sizes decreased at least 30% from baseline), or SD (steady state of disease) that was maintained for at least 28 days from the first demonstration of that rating.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first participant until database cut-off approximately 13 months later (13May2008 - 31May2009).</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time from the first date of receiving study medication to death, due to any cause. Participants alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first participant until database cut-off approximately 13 months later (13May2008 - 31May2009). Assessed every 8 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was calculated as time from first date of receiving study drug until date of first observed disease progression (PD) (radiological or clinical, whichever was earlier) or death due to any cause, if death occurred before PD was documented. The actual date of tumor assessments (i.e., date on which radiological procedure was performed, rather than scheduled date) was used for this calculation to determine both the event date and censoring date. Patients without PD or death at time of analysis were censored at last date of tumor evaluation.</description>

    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever was earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurred before progression was documented). Duration of response for subjects who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the date of their last tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first participant until database cut-off approximately 13 months later (13May2008 - 31May2009). Assessed every 8 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of SD was calculated as the time from the first date of receiving study drug until the date of documented PD or the last observation if the subject did not progress.

Participants who had none of these features = low risk; participants with 1 or 2 of these features = intermediate risk; participants with 3 or more of these features = high/poor risk and were excluded from participating in the study.</description>

        <description>PFS was calculated as time from first date of receiving study drug until date of first observed disease progression (PD) (radiological or clinical, whichever was earlier) or death due to any cause, if death occurred before PD was documented. The actual date of tumor assessments (i.e., date on which radiological procedure was performed, rather than scheduled date) was used for this calculation to determine both the event date and censoring date.
