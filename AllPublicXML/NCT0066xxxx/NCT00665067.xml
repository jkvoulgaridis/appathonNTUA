  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers will use abnormal blood and/or bone marrow cells, or materials derived from these
      abnormal cells, like DNA, RNA, protein or plasma, in laboratory studies. Toenail clippings
      will provide normal material like DNA for comparison with the abnormal material derived from
      the blood and/or bone marrow. The results of these studies will be correlated with subjects'
      disease symptoms and response to their experimental treatment. The MPD-RC researchers are
      interested in studying molecules from the blood and bone marrow, the exact molecules changing
      over time with the investigators choosing only the most promising for investigation.

      The investigators are attempting to better understand the causes of MPD and to develop
      improved methods for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. These syndromes carry a
      high risk of developing leukemia. It is important to continue to learn more about these blood
      cancers and to learn more about the effectiveness and potential side effects of various
      treatments. It is believed that further basic knowledge about these cancer cells as well as
      the effects of treatment will lead to the improvement of current therapies and the
      development of entirely new treatments for these diseases. The MPD-RC is hoping to determine
      if a number of laboratory tests (biomarkers) will allow for the prediction of response in
      future patients to the treatment they would receive.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are to be registered to this study if they meet the eligibility criteria for
             one of the MPD-RC treatment protocols linked to this study.

          -  Patients diagnosed with the following Myeloproliferative disorders including:
             polycythemia vera (PV), idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM), and essential thrombocythemia
             (ET) who are participating in treatment protocols of the MPD-RC are eligible.

          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent to participate in a Myeloproliferative
             Disorders Research Consortium (MPD-RC) treatment study to which this protocol is a
             companion study. The subject must also have signed a consent to participate in this
             mandatory companion study.
