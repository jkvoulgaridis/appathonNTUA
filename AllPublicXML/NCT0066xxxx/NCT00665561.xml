  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess if use of maraviroc along with an optimized background regimen of
      antiretroviral drugs in usual clinical practice is as safe as using only an optimized regimen
      of antiretroviral drugs.

    <measure>Density Rate Per 1000 Participant-Years for Incidence of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category C AIDS -Defining Opportunistic Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years following enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of centers for disease control and prevention category C acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -defining opportunistic infections was reported. Density rate was calculated as the number of events (n) per 1000 participant-years at risk. Poisson regressions were fit to the categorical events with only treatment in the model to obtain the crude rate and confidence interval (CI).</description>

    <description>Density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of myocardial infarction or ischemia (definite + possible) was reported. Events of myocardial infarction or ischemia were adjudicated as definite or possible; where definite= an event had definitely occurred; possible =an event had possibly occurred.

    <description>Density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of myocardial infarction or ischemia (definite + possible + insufficient data) was reported. Events of myocardial infarction or ischemia were adjudicated as definite or possible or insufficient data; where definite= an event had definitely occurred; possible =an event had possibly occurred; insufficient =insufficient data to determine whether an event had occurred. Density rate was calculated as the number of events (n) per 1000 participant-years at risk.

        <title>Density Rate Per 1000 Participant-Years for Incidence of All Malignancies (AIDS Defining Malignancies and Non-AIDS Defining Malignancies)</title>
        <description>Density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of all malignancies as well as its types (categorized as: AIDS defining malignancies and non-AIDS defining malignancies) were reported. AIDS defining malignancies included malignancies due to any of these: cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma; whereas all other malignancies (except AIDS-defining) were non-aids defining malignancies. Density rate was calculated as the number of events (n) per 1000 participant-years at risk. Poisson regressions were fit to the categorical events with only treatment in the model to obtain the crude rate and CI.</description>

          <title>Density Rate Per 1000 Participant-Years for Incidence of Myocardial Infarction or Ischemia: Events Adjudicated as 'Definite' or 'Possible' or 'Insufficient Data'</title>
          <description>Density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of myocardial infarction or ischemia (definite + possible + insufficient data) was reported. Events of myocardial infarction or ischemia were adjudicated as definite or possible or insufficient data; where definite= an event had definitely occurred; possible =an event had possibly occurred; insufficient =insufficient data to determine whether an event had occurred. Density rate was calculated as the number of events (n) per 1000 participant-years at risk. Poisson regressions were fit to the categorical events with only treatment in the model to obtain the crude rate and CI. In this outcome measure, density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of myocardial infarction or ischemia (which included sum of definite + possible events + insufficient data) was reported.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Density Rate Per 1000 Participant-Years for Incidence of All Malignancies (AIDS Defining Malignancies and Non-AIDS Defining Malignancies)</title>
        <description>Adjusted density rate per 1000 participant-years for incidence of all malignancies as well as its types (categorized as AIDS defining malignancies and non-AIDS defining malignancies) were reported. AIDS defining malignancies included malignancies due to any of these: cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma; whereas all other malignancies (except AIDS-defining) were non-AIDS defining malignancies. Density rate was calculated as the number of events (n) per 1000 participant-years at risk. Poisson regressions were fit to the categorical events with treatment as the main effect, PS quartile and imputed FS as covariates in the model to obtain the adjusted rate and CI.</description>
