      The purpose of this study is to describe the 3D joint biomechanics of the lower extremities
      of patients having had a total hip replacement or hip resurfacing surgery as compared to a
      healthy age and weight matched control group during level walking, stair ascent and descent,
      and entering and exiting the front seat of a car.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Much research has shown that patients are generally satisfied with pain relief in the months
      and years following a total hip replacement (THR) or hip resurfacing procedure. However, many
      express dissatisfaction with their ability to perform daily activities, a reduced walking
      ability and long-term lower extremity muscle weakness. Given the general lack of knowledge
      surrounding joint motion of the lower extremities in the THR population, there is a need to
      characterize the joint mechanics of people having undergone THR, so that interventions and
      rehabilitation strategies can be designed to reduce post-operative complications and improve
      mobility.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  15 patients between the ages of 50 and 75 yrs having undergone a primary total hip
             replacement or hip resurfacing within 6 to 18 months of the study will participate, as
             well as an equal number of age, sex, height and weight matched healthy control
             participants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants for the control group will be asked if they have had previous
             lower limb ailments or surgery, and if they have they will be excluded. Moreover, the
             THR participants cannot have had secondary hip replacement due to infection, revision
             surgery, or a concomitant surgical procedure (i.e., graft). Participants from both
             groups cannot have had any medical conditions which could affect physical movement
             such as a stroke.
