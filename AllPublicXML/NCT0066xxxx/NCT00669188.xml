      Summary:

      A few studies have explored factors which influence patient-provider communication in a
      controlled setting. However, more information is needed about how different factors affect
      communication so that it can be improved.

      Third- and fourth-year medical students may be eligible for this study. Participants are
      recruited from the Washington, D.C. area.

      At the research center, participants will use a virtual reality headset to view a virtual
      clinic environment and interact with a virtual patient.

      After interacting with the virtual patient, participants will complete a questionnaire about
      their experience within the virtual clinic and other research-related information.

      The total time for the study visit is 60 minutes.

      Eligibility:

      Third- and fourth-year medical students at least 18 years of age. You may not take part in
      the study if you have a history of seizures and/or are pregnant.

      This study will investigate research questions regarding factors influencing patient-provider
      communication. Participants will interact with a virtual patient in a virtual clinical
      setting.

      Third- or fourth-year medical students may be eligible for this study. Participants are
      recruited from the Washington, D.C. area.

      Study participants will perform one task and complete one set of questions at the study
      appointment. The task involves viewing a virtual patient s health information and interacting
      with the virtual patient in a virtual environment clinical scenario. While in the virtual
      environment, the subject wears a head-mounted video unit that allows him or her to see
      elements of the environment. The activities in the virtual environment take about 15 minutes.
      The total time for the study is about 60 minutes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy adult volunteers who are third or fourth-year medical students. Both men and women
        over age 18 will be eligible for this study (though in practice the age range is likely to
        naturally be constrained by the typical age of medical students).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) persons with seizure or vestibular disorders; 2) women with known
        pregnancy; 3) persons who are highly prone to motion sickness; 4) those with low,
        uncorrected vision or hearing; 5) all current and past employees and contractors of

        NHGRI; and 6) persons who have received information about the study purpose or procedure
        from a past participant.
