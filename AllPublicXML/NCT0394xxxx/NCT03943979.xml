  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to: 1) investigate the effects of cognitive training (CT) and combined CT and
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on food intake and 2) to further understand
      its neuropsychological and neurophysiological basis (i.e. EEG) as well as its impact in
      endocannabinoids (EC) in a sample of morbidly obese patients seeking for a gastric bypass
      surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the impact of a 4-day intervention with either CT (Active control
      condition) or CT+tDCS (Active condition) stimulation on food intake in a sample of morbidly
      obese patients, as measured by dietary assessments the week before, during and the week after
      the intervention. Additionally, to further understand the neuropsychological and
      neurophysiological basis of its impact, measures of executive function and attention
      performance and EEG recordings, respectively, will be collected. Furthermore, we will explore
      the effect of the intervention on endocannabinoids previously related to eating behaviour.

      The Active Control condition will receive sham stimulation together with CT, through a
      computerized cognitive training platform (Guttmann NeuropersonalTrainer), including different
      tasks with designed to train executive functions and attention. Each session will last
      approximately 30-40 min.

      The Active condition will receive tDCS stimulation (20 min, multichannel with an excitatory
      target over the r-dlPFC) together with CT (same as for the Active Control condition).

      Participants will undergo a basal (the week before intervention) and a post treatment
      assessments (the day after finishing the intervention) that will include medical history,
      blood testing, anthropometric measures, a cognitive assessment battery and a 4-day dietary
      assessment.

    <masking_description>The difference between the two groups is the tDCS therapy. To mask this difference, the duration time of the session will be the same under both conditions but a standard Sham tDCS protocol will be used for the Active Control group. That is, a 3-sec ramp-up and ramp-down current stimulation, so the subject perceives the current just like the real tDCS, but it is not strong nor durable enough to have any effect on the neuronal activity.</masking_description>

    <description>EEG was recorded before and after tCS/sham using a Starstim device (Neuroelectrics), same electrode positions as for the stimulation with a sampling frequency of 500 S/s . Electrode impedance: below 10kΩ; electrical reference placed at the right earlobe. EEG data was analyzed offline by means of customized Matlab code (MathWorks Inc. Natick, MA, USA). Data was split into 1s non-overlapping epochs (epochs with amplitudes &gt;50 μV were rejected). EEG-metrics extracted: EEG-power and coherence. To compute EEG power, the power spectral density (PSD) was estimated for each epoch. Band Power was computed for the bands θ=[4,8 Hz], α=[8,13 Hz] β=[13,25 Hz], γ=[30, 45 Hz] and broadband=[4-45Hz] by integrating the PSD within the band frequency limits. Functional connectivity was estimated by means of coherence by the Welch method averaged over all electrodes. Frontal asymmetry (FA) computed as follows: log(avg(AF4 F4 F8 FC6))-log(avg(AF3 F3 F7 FC5); FA&lt;0 reflects dominance of left-hemisphere</description>

    <description>tDCS: 4 consecutive days, 20 min session, delivered through multichannel tDCS (Starstim, Neuroelectrics), with an excitatory target over the r-dlPFC, and an inhibitory target on the contralateral lobe (l-dlPFC). The positioning of the multichannel tCS (electrode location and currents) was solved using the Stimweaver (Ruffini 2013). The resulting tCS montage employed 8 gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes of π cm2 size (Pistim, Neuroelectrics) placed at AF3(-1093uA), AF4 (1178uA), F3 (-1161uA), F4 (1104uA), F7 (-414uA), F8 (530uA), FC5 (1189uA), FC6 (-1332uA).</description>
