  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled study, the investigators hypothesize that sugammadex is
      superior to neostigmine in higher risk patients undergoing laparoscopic outpatient surgery in
      an urban, stand-alone ambulatory surgery center.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the &quot;fit to discharge time in the PACU.&quot;
      The secondary objectives are PACU adverse events, use of additional medications in the PACU,
      0-30 day ED or inpatient admissions for a pulmonary diagnosis and patient satisfaction at
      discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited published data in the use of sugammadex for high-risk patient populations,
      such as those undergoing laparoscopic procedures in standalone outpatient surgery facilities.
      About 90% of the ambulatory surgical patient population at this institution is non-caucasian
      with the majority of the higher-risk patients having obesity and one or more additional
      chronic health conditions. In this randomized controlled study, the investigators hypothesize
      that sugammadex is superior to neostigmine in higher risk patients undergoing laparoscopic
      outpatient surgery in an urban, stand-alone ambulatory surgery center.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the &quot;fit to discharge time in the PACU.&quot;
      The secondary objectives are PACU adverse events, use of additional medications in the PACU,
      0-30 day ED or inpatient admissions for a pulmonary diagnosis and patient satisfaction at
      discharge.

      In this double-blinded randomized controlled study, the study team is evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of sugammadex in patients undergoing ambulatory surgical procedures. Currently,
      both neostigmine and sugammadex are standard of care in this institution. Other than the
      emergent need for NMB reversal, practice preference and individual indications dictate the
      selection of reversal medication.

    <masking_description>On the day of surgery, an envelope containing the randomization code will be given to an anesthesiology physician or nurse anesthetist responsible for the clinical care of the study patient. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive neostigmine or sugammadex using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients will be stratified based on their ASA physical score. A research associate who is not directly involved with the study procedures will maintain the randomization codes. All others will be blinded</masking_description>

    <description>The Aldrete Score will determine transfer from phase 1 to phase 2 recovery. The following criterias will be scored from 0 to 2- activity level, respiration, blood pressure, consciousness, oxygen saturation. Patients who get a total score of 9 or more are considered ready for discharge from Post Anesthesia Care Unit</description>

    <description>The Post Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) will be used to determine discharge to home readiness. Six criterias to score- vital signs, ambulation, nausea/vomiting, pain, bleeding and voiding. Each one is given a score from 0 to 2. Patients who get a total score of 9 or more are considered ready for discharge from Post Anesthesia Care Unit</description>

    <description>Neostigmine is the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor most commonly used in pharmacologically reversing the effects of neuromuscular blockers [8]. Reversal of NMB is facilitated by increasing acetylcholine levels at nicotinic skeletal muscle-binding sites.</description>

    <description>Sugammadex is a modified gamma-cyclodextrin, the first of a new class of drugs called selective relaxant binding agents, with an unusually high affinity for rocuronium. This medication offers an alternate mechanism of action to antagonize the effects of steroidal neuromuscular blockade agents.</description>
