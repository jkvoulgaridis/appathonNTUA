    <textblock>
      Atotal of 150 consecutive patients with chronic supraspinatous tendinopathy were invited to
      participate in the study .patients were recruited from the out patient clinic of rheumatology
      and rehabilitation department,Mansoura university hospital

      a. perineural injection therapy group (subcutaneous prolotherapy) This group included 30
      patients aged from 18 to 60 years Deep prolotherapy injection group The injection fluid
      contain 1 ml of 255 glucose and 1ml of lidocaine. The pathological area of the supraspinatous
      tendon was identified and graded using ultrasound pathology rating scale guided by
      ultrasonography (Simens Acuson p300 machine) Proper preparation with antiseptic solution of
      skin overlying the point of injection .

      Baseline Evaluation

      All patients were subjected to the following:

        1. Thorough History Taking

             1. Personal history: collected data include: age, sex, marital status, handedness,
                special habits and the current occupation.

             2. Complaint in the patient's own words.

             3. Present History he current symptoms, mode of onset, duration, , factors that may
                aggravate or relieve pain Characters of pain (dull aching,sharp pain ,burning
                sensation ,parasthesia). Distribution of pain . Review of systems: symptoms related
                to rheumatic conditions in particular conditions with predilection for shoulder
                joint affection.

                Symptoms suggestive of medical disorders e.g. diabetes mellitus or thyroid
                dysfunction.

             4. Past History Previous significant trauma(direct or occupational) orsugery to
                shoulder. Previous steroid injection to the shoulder. Previous injection of any
                type of regenerative medicine (as prp)

        2. Thorough General Examination

             1. General condition.

             2. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature)

             3. Examination of systems (chest,cardiovascular,abdominal,neurological) to identify
                medical condition that may cause shoulder pain.

                3-Muscloskeletal examination

             1. General muscloskeletal examination

      Examination of all joints for :

      I.deformity,visible swelling or muscle atrophy II.Palpation for tenderness,warmth,palpable
      swelling either bony enlargement or synovial effusion.

      III.Abnormalities in range of motion. IV.Diffuse muscloskeletal pain. V.Abnormalities of
      gait.

    <description>The VAS-pain score is composed of a continuous horizontal line. This line is 100 mm in length. To measure the intensity of pain, the score is anchored by (0 score = no pain) at one end and (100 score = worst imaginable pain) on the other end. The patient places a mark to the VAS line at the point which represents the intensity of his pain</description>
