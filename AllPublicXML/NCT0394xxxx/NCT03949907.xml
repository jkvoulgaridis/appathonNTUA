  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will be conducted to verify if early supplemental parenteral nutrition in
      combination with nutritional counseling improves survival and the feasibility of
      chemotherapy, in addition to nutritional status, body composition, functional status and
      quality of life in treatment-na√Øve patients with metastatic gastric cancer at nutritional
      risk undergoing first-line chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although it is known that nutritional support can improve clinical outcomes, the literature
      shows that only around 50% of cancer patients are able to satisfy estimated protein-calorie
      requirements. It is also emerging a strong correlation between nutritional status,
      particularly body composition, and adherence to active treatment. International guidelines
      suggest that parenteral nutrition (PN) is recommended in malnourished, hypophagic cancer
      patients suffering from gastrointestinal complications or with expected prolonged inadequate
      food intake, when enteral nutrition is not feasible. Although recent trials suggest that
      supplemental PN (SPN) could help to improve the nutritional status of malnourished cancer
      patients, there are no studies on the clinical effects of early SPN in cancer patients at
      nutritional risk receiving first-line chemotherapy.

    <description>Nutritional counseling consists of a personalized dietary prescription (including sample meal plans and recipe suggestions) tailored on personal eating patterns and food preferences, in order to achieve estimated protein-calorie requirements and to take into account chewing and swallowing abilities. Regular consultation by a registered dietitian will be also provided every 10 days by means of face-to-face interviews (at scheduled follow-up visits - chemotherapy cycle) and telephone interviews (planned between chemotherapy cycles and as required by the patient). In the presence of significant reduction of normal food intake, the use of oral nutritional supplements will be also considered.
In the presence of body weight loss &gt;10% of the weight recorded at enrollment, patients allocated to this group group will be censored and treated according to current supportive care guidelines, including home parenteral nutrition.</description>

Supplemental home parenteral nutrition will be prescribed, provided daily and adjusted throughout the study (approximately every 10 days, until the end of the scheduled first-line chemotherapy) according to estimated protein-calorie oral intakes, in order to satisfy estimated requirements. Home parenteral nutrition will be infused mainly during night hours, using multi-chamber bags containing olive oil-based lipid emulsions, when not contraindicated.</description>
