  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and
      emotional dysregulation are characterized by high severity of ADHD, comorbid behavior
      disorders and increased risk of chronic difficulties.

      New studies have shown promising results by focusing on improving emotional regulation. We
      lack knowledge about differences in symptom patterns, stability of symptoms over time,
      comorbid disorders, neurocognitive functions, knowledge and regulation of emotions,
      psychosocial risk factors and reactions to stress.

      Children 6 to 12 years admitted to specialist and diagnosed with ADHD will be recruited. ADHD
      children with and without emotional dysregulation defined as fullfilling the criteria for the
      diagnosis Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) with regard to differences in symptom
      patterns, stability of symptoms over time, comorbid disorders, neurocognitive functions,
      knowledge and regulation of emotions, psychosocial risk factors and reactions to stress..

      Children referred to outpatient psychiatric service will be informed about the study and
      asked to participate. The clinical assessments in the study will be those that are
      recommended as good clinical practice, so results will be included in the diagnostic work for
      the patient.

      The data security will follow the Norwegian rules and be monitored by REC and the Data
      Inspectorate of the hospital.
