  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled Na√Øve participants will be randomized to one of two arms, the investigational or
      control arm. Once randomized the institutions will fit the participant with the procedures
      outlined in the protocol. Each participant will be required to trial the mask for a period of
      90 days. Any Unscheduled Visits or Calls that occur during the participants 90 days
      documented.
