  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pimodivir after a
      single oral dose of 600 milligrams (mg) in adult participants with severe renal impairment
      who are not on dialysis and in adult participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are
      not yet on dialysis compared to adult participants with normal renal function (Part A).
      Optionally, to evaluate the PK in adult participants with mild and/or moderate renal
      impairment compared to adult participants with normal renal function (Part B).
