  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to conduct a randomized controlled study to examine the
      association between the increase in extravascular lung water as determined by lung ultrasound
      and the development of radiologic pulmonary edema as diagnosed by chest roentgenogram in
      patients undergoing major elective open intra-peritoneal surgeries under general endotracheal
      anesthesia.

      This study will be conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's post- anesthesia
      care unit (PACU). A total of 60 patients will be randomly selected from the 5th and 7th floor
      surgical suite daily display boards and enrolled in the study. A preoperative and
      postoperative Point of Care (POCUS) lung U/S exam and Point of Care (POCUS) transthoracic
      echo will be performed with a Sonosite Edge II bedside U/S machine (approved by UAB
      Biomedical and Clinical Engineering Dept-#9365) in the pre-anesthesia holding area before the
      surgical procedure, and after the end of the procedure in the post- anesthesia care unit
      (PACU). EVLW will be defined as B-line score ≥7 before and after the surgical procedure.
      Pulmonary edema will be defined by the official radiology report on a chest X ray in the
      first 72 hrs postoperatively. Pre and Post Op POCUS Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)
      will be obtained via Trans-thoracic bedside Ultrasound measuring Mitral Valve Inflow (E)
      Velocity and Early Diastolic Lateral Mitral Annulus Velocity/Tissue Doppler Imaging (E'). A
      5-1Mhz Phased Array Probe will be used to obtain images. The PCWP data obtained will be used
      to correlate with EVLW findings. Ultrasound windows for PCWP measurements will be obtained
      using the Apical 4-chamber View and/or modified Subcostal View.-
