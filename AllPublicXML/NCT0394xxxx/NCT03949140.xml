  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a pilot study to determine if symptomatic pilonidal disease can be primarily
      managed with laser hair removal vs surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will consist of surgical evaluation in pediatric surgery or colorectal surgery
      clinics, referral to dermatology clinic for informed consent, and if enrolled, participation
      in 6 laser hair removal sessions with regular follow-up for a period of 2 years after
      completion of therapy.

    <description>This study will investigate qualitative outcomes including pain. Pain will be assessed via the Promis 3A Pain Short Form at 6, 9, 12, and 24 months. This is a one question survey that has participants rate the intensity of their pain over the last 7 days, on average. The scale is from 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>Patients who choose to enroll will plan to undergo a total of 6 laser hair removal sessions every 4-6 weeks. If patients develop abscess or infection during this time, they will undergo I&amp;D and/or antibiotics, consistent with standard therapy for infection or abscess. If patients have 2 or more infections in 1 year, pain or drainage for more than 1 month, or miss more than 1 week of school or work due to ineffective treatment of pilonidal disease, these patients will undergo surgical excision and subsequent follow-up at surgeon's discretion. Patients will follow up at 2-4-week intervals for 3 months, then at 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after conclusion of the laser therapy sessions. At all follow-up sessions, patients will be given the DQLI, CDQLI, and Promis 3A Pain survey. Unscheduled visits such as unplanned clinic visits, emergency department encounters, and hospitalizations, will be included in data collected for analysis of primary and secondary outcomes.</description>
