    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well dyadic yoga intervention works in improving physical performance
      and quality of life in patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer undergoing
      radiotherapy and their caregivers. Dyadic yoga intervention may help to improve physical
      function, fatigue, sleep difficulties, depressive symptoms, and overall quality of life for
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer and/or their caregivers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the extent to which the yoga program improves patient physical performance
      (i.e., 6-minute walk test [6MWT]) as compared to the education group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the extent to which the yoga program improves patient and caregiver quality of
      life (QOL) (SF-36) compared to the education group.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore if, compared to the education group, the yoga program improves symptom burden,
      reduces inflammatory cytokine and cortisol rhythmicity dysregulation, and improves dyadic
      symptom management skills at the end of treatment, which will in turn mediate intervention
      outcomes at the subsequent follow-up assessments.

      II. To explore if baseline factors such as depressive symptoms moderate the treatment
      response.

      QUALITATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To understand the patient and caregiver experience of cancer, cancer treatment, and
      experience in the behavioral interventions, and explore emerging themes as possible
      mediators.

      OUTLINE: Patients and caregivers are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients and caregivers undergo dyadic yoga intervention session involving physical
      exercises and relaxation techniques over 60 minutes each for up to 15 sessions.

      GROUP II: Patients and caregivers undergo dyadic education program session focusing on
      strategies of how to manage patient and caregiver symptoms over 60 minutes each for up to 15
      sessions.

      After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up every 2 weeks for 3 months
      and then every month for up to 6 months.
