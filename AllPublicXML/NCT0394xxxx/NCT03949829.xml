  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with a history of preeclampsia (PE) have increased risk of hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. Thus, PE is acknowledged as an independent risk
      factor for CVD, which is the number one cause of death in women in the western part of the
      world.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate 1) the prevalence of CVD after PE, 2) which women
      have the highest risk of developing CVD, 3) when early stages of CVD can be detected in women
      with previous PE and 4) how CVD progress over time.

      Methods:

      1000 women with previous PE between the age of 35-55 years will be invited to participate in
      a follow-up study consisting of anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement,
      urine- and blood samples, cardiac CT-scan and questionnaires. Coronary atherosclerosis will
      be evaluated using CT imaging.The women will be compared with women with a formerly
      uncomplicated pregnancy,

      Summary:

      The study will provide new important information to guide future clinical follow-up, and
      potentially prevent disease and early death in a large group of women with a history of PE.

      Women with a history of preeclampsia (PE) have increased risk of hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. Thus, PE is acknowledged as an independent risk
      factor for CVD, which is the number one cause of death in women in the western part of the
      world. Despite this, solid and uniform guidelines regarding follow-up after a pregnancy
      complicated by PE are lacking. Little is known about the time-course of the development of
      CVD and how early stages can be identified in women with previous PE. The link between PE and
      CVD is well established. However, no large clinical study using cardiac CT-scans exists.
      Moreover, the study will focus on the time-perspective of the development of CVD in relation
      to index pregnancy, and this knowledge may prove to be essential to establish solid clinical
      guidelines addressing timely prevention and treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate

        1. The prevalence of CVD after PE,

        2. Which women have the highest risk of developing CVD

        3. When early stages of CVD can be detected in women with previous PE

        4. How CVD progress over time.

      Thus, we hope to identify a window of opportunity where screening and preventive measures may
      be relevant and potentially beneficial to these women.

      A total of 1000 women with previous PE (aged 35-55 years) will be invited to participate in a
      clinical follow-up study consisting of anthropometric measurements, blood pressure
      measurement, urine- and blood samples, cardiac CT-scan (identifying coronary atherosclerotic
      changes) and questionnaires. These women will be compared to age-matched women, without
      previous preeclampsia investigated in the Copenhagen General Population Study with an
      identical CT protocol.
