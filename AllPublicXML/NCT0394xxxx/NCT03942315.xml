  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a curative treatment in hereditary
      hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with severe hepatic involvement. The investigating team
      provides a long-term evaluation of graft status after LT for HHT with a focus on the risk of
      recurrence. The present study included all patients prospectively followed up after LT for
      HHT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit from 1993 to 2010 with a survival of more than 1 year.

    <intervention_name>Data collection from standard follow-up after liver transplant</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients underwent regular follow-up every 6 to 12 months after the first year post-liver transplant (LT). Complete laboratory investigations were performed at each visit. Doppler ultrasonography was performed every 1 to 3 years after LT. Computed tomography (CT) scan and/ or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after LT, or when clinically indicated. All available radiological material was reviewed. Cardiac evaluation was performed regularly in patients who received transplant for cardiac failure.</description>
