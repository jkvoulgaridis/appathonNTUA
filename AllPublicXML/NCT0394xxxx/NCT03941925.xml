      The aim of the study is to confirm the effectiveness of chicory-derived prebiotic inulin-type
      fructans on bowel function in young children. It is a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial.This study plans to recruit into the group of 100 participants (at
      least 80 of them completed) in 2018-2020.The two groups for the study are product group
      (prebiotic fructans) and control group (placebo maltodextrin).Duration of intervention is 6
      weeks, including 2 weeks for run-in and 4 weeks for intervention.Efficacy parameters are
      stool consistency (assessed with Amsterdam infant stool scale),stool frequency, stool amount
      and stool color (assessed with Amsterdam infant stool scale, treatment success, tolerance and
      acceptability).
