  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of belimumab and
      intravenous rituximab co-administration at inducing a complete remission (CR) compared to
      rituximab alone in participants with PM.

      Background:

      Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is among the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in
      adults. MN affects individuals of all ages and races. The peak incidence of MN is in the
      fifth decade of life.

      Primary MN is recognized to be an autoimmune disease, a disease where the body's own immune
      system causes damage to kidneys. This damage can cause the loss of too much protein in the
      urine.

      Drugs used to treat MN aim to reduce the attack by one's own immune system on the kidneys by
      blocking inflammation and reducing the immune system's function. These drugs can have serious
      side effects and often do not cure the disease. There is a need for new treatments for MN
      that are better at improving the disease while reducing fewer treatment associated side
      effects.

      In this study, researchers will evaluate if treatment with a combination of two different
      drugs, belimumab and rituximab, is effective at blocking the immune attacks on the kidney
      compared to rituximab alone. Rituximab works by decreasing a type of immune cell, called B
      cells. B cells are known to have a role in MN. Once these cells are removed, disease may
      become less active or even inactive. However, after stopping treatment, the body will make
      new B cells which may cause disease to become active again.

      Belimumab works by decreasing the new B cells produced by the body and, may even change the
      type of new B cells subsequently produced. Belimumab is approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (also referred to as lupus or
      SLE). Rituximab is approved by the FDA to treat some types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis,
      and vasculitis. Neither rituximab nor belimumab is approved by the FDA to treat MN. Treatment
      with a combination of belimumab and rituximab has not been studied in individuals with MN,
      but it is currently being tested in other autoimmune diseases, including lupus nephritis and
      Sjögren's syndrome.

      This trial is a two-part study (Part A and Part B) of adults with primary membranous
      nephropathy (MN), ages 18-75 inclusive. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the
      United States and Canada.

      Part A: Open-label Phase

      Part A is an open-label, pharmacokinetics (PK) phase to compare belimumab exposure between
      participants who have &quot;low&quot; proteinuria (≥ 4 to &lt; 8 g/day) and &quot;high&quot; proteinuria (≥ 8 g/day)
      at the Screening Visit, Visit-1.

      Part A will enroll 20 individuals with primary MN: 10 individuals with low proteinuria and 10
      individuals with high proteinuria. All Part A participants will receive 200 mg subcutaneous
      belimumab weekly for 52 doses (weeks 0-51), unless a dose increase is warranted by the PK
      analysis. Trough serum belimumab levels will be obtained weekly following the first 4 doses
      of belimumab. Participants will receive rituximab 1000 mg intravenously (IV) at weeks 4 and
      6.

      All participants will be followed after the 52 week treatment period on no study medication
      until week 156.

      Belimumab serum trough levels will be analyzed after all participants receive the first 4
      belimumab doses to compare belimumab exposure between the low and high proteinuria groups.
      Belimumab serum trough levels will also be analyzed to determine if a different proteinuria
      level (instead of 8 g/day) warrants increased belimumab dosing and should be used to define
      &quot;high&quot; proteinuria.

      Dose determinations for participants with high proteinuria in Parts A and B will be made by
      an adjudication committee.

      The study participation phase is 156 weeks (3 years), which includes a treatment phase of 52
      weeks and a post-treatment observation phase of 104 weeks.

      Part B: Randomized Phase

      Part B is a prospective, randomized, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      clinical trial in adults with primary MN. Part B will commence after the analysis of the PK
      data in Part A.

      A total of 104 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into two treatment arms.

      Randomization will be stratified by low and high proteinuria as determined by the identified
      threshold in Part A.

      Participants in both arms will receive rituximab 1000 mg IV at weeks 4 and 6. Participants
      randomized to the experimental arm will receive subcutaneous belimumab 200 mg weekly for 52
      doses (weeks 0-51), unless the results from Part A indicate that participants with high
      proteinuria should receive belimumab 400 mg weekly. If the participant's proteinuria
      subsequently decreases to below the high proteinuria threshold, the belimumab dose will be
      decreased to 200 mg weekly for the remainder of the treatment phase.

      Participants randomized to the comparator arm will receive subcutaneous belimumab placebo
      according to the same dose and schedule.

      The study participation phase is 156 weeks (3 years), which includes a treatment phase of 52
      weeks and a post-treatment observation phase of 104 weeks.
