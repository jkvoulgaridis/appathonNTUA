  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Inflammatory arthritis (IA) causes work disability, absenteeism (sick leave) and
      presenteeism (reduced productivity) at high cost to individuals, employers and society. A
      trial of job retention vocational rehabilitation (VR) amongst people with IA in the US showed
      that VR reduced work disability. However, it is unknown whether this approach transfers to
      the United Kingdom (UK) with a different social and welfare structure. Previously, we
      modified the VR for the UK, funded by Arthritis Research UK (the WORKWELL programme) and
      demonstrated it to be deliverable and acceptable in a feasibility trial. Our aim now is to
      move to the definitive UK trial testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WORKWELL.

      Methods: A multicentre randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Employed people with
      rheumatoid, psoriatic or inflammatory arthritis (n=240), with concerns about continuing
      working due to arthritis, will be randomized to receive WORKWELL or control (written advice).
      WORKWELL includes individualised VR (maximum 4.5 hours over several months): assessing work
      problems; encouraging arthritis self-management in the workplace; addressing ergonomics;
      considering fatigue and stress management; providing orthoses and educating on employment
      rights and support services, assistive technology and work modifications. It also includes
      psychological and disclosure support, workplace visits and employer liaison (as applicable).
      Outcomes will be assessed at 0, 6 and 12 months by questionnaire. The primary outcome is the
      Work Limitations Questionnaire-25 (measuring presenteeism: summed score) at 12 months, with
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

      Discussion: If effective and cost-effective, WORKWELL can be rolled out in Rheumatology
      services to help improve the quality and duration of people with arthritis' working lives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Work problems are common in people with inflammatory arthritis (IA). In rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) 33% stop working within two years and 50% within 10 years. Work difficulties
      include: pain (particularly hand pain); fatigue; unadapted work environments, equipment and
      work schedules; poor work self-efficacy (i.e. lack of confidence about working); job strain;
      limited use of self-management strategies; and limited support from employers and work
      colleagues. Two USA trials of brief (3 hours) job retention vocational rehabilitation (VR)
      identified job loss was postponed by modifying such factors. A UK proof-of-principle trial
      (n=32) identified 10 hours (minimum) of VR reduced work instability. VR is not routinely
      available in the NHS and Rheumatology departments. It is unclear from the evidence if brief
      VR provided by therapists is effective and cost-effective in the UK.

      Aims

        1. Assess if there is a difference in work presenteeism between people with RA,
           undifferentiated IA (UIA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who receive either: usual care,
           written work self-help information plus brief VR (WORKWELL) provided by a therapist
           trained in providing VR; or usual care and written work self-help information only
           (WP1).

        2. To assess if there are differences in self-reported work instability, work, activity
           limitations, work productivity, absenteeism, work status, work self-efficacy, health
           status, NHS and societal costs between people receiving WORKWELL or written work
           self-help information only (WP1)

        3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of WORKWELL from the perspective of: the NHS using
           health-related quality of life as the primary outcome; the employer using presenteeism
           as the primary outcome; and the employer using health-related quality of life as the
           primary outcome and including presenteeism as a cost. (WP5)

        4. To update and evaluate a VR programme for occupational therapists and physiotherapists
           to help them keep people with RA, IA or PsA in work (WP2).

        5. To measure fidelity to the WORKWELL intervention (WP3).

        6. To understand the social and structural context in which the intervention is delivered
           and to identify factors which may influence the quality of implementation (WP3).

        7. Investigate contextual factors influencing participants' presenteeism (WP4).

      Design A pragmatic, multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the
      effects of brief VR (intervention) with written self-help advice only (control).
      Cost-effectiveness and process evaluations will also be conducted.

      Methodology Employed people with RA/ UIA/ PsA who have concerns about being able to continue
      to work in future due to arthritis, will be consented into the study. They will complete a
      baseline questionnaire (hard copy or online according to participant preference) and will
      then be randomly allocated in equal numbers, stratified by participants' job skill levels, to
      either intervention or control groups. Participants (in both groups) will be mailed a
      self-help work information pack. Participants' in the intervention group will be referred to
      receive the WORKWELL intervention from a trained occupational therapist/ physiotherapist. The
      Lancashire Clinical Trials Unit (CTU: University of Central Lancashire) will contact
      participants monthly by text/ e-mail/ telephone to identify numbers of days on sick leave.
      Six months after completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete a short
      postal/online questionnaire including presenteeism, productivity health status measures and
      resource data. At 12 months, participants will complete a third postal/online questionnaire
      with most of the measures collected at baseline. Two sub-samples from the intervention group
      will be interviewed: employed participants about their views of VR; and any unemployed/
      retired due to ill-health participants about factors contributing to job loss.

      Planned Sample Size 240 people will be recruited from 18 sites. On completion of the trial,
      qualitative interviews will be completed with 15 employed participants and up to 7 (if any)
      unemployed / early retired through ill-health from the intervention group. WORKWELL
      participants' line managers/employers will also be interviewed (where possible: n=10).
      WORKWELL Therapists and their line managers will also be interviewed (one each from each
      site, or less if data saturation is reached (n=18 for each).

      Analyses Statistical analyses will investigate differences in outcomes at 12 months after
      baseline between intervention and control groups using mixed effects linear, logistic or
      ordinal logistic regression modelling, adjusted for baseline values and stratification
      variables (as applicable). The primary outcome is the summed score of the Combined Work
      Activities Limitations Scale -Work Limitations Questionnaire-25 (a measure of work
      presenteeism) at 12 months after baseline assessment. The health economic analysis will be
      conducted from the UK National Health Service (NHS) and employer perspectives. Interviews
      will be thematically analysed. Records will be analysed using content analysis.

    <masking_description>The Investigators will remain blinded to group allocation until the participant has completed and returned their baseline questionnaire, and the data verified at the Lancashire CTU.
Data co-ordination staff at the CTU, who will be responsible for contacting patients to obtain missing data from 6- and 12-month questionnaires will be blinded to group allocation. The Data Manager and Information Systems team will be unblinded.
Due to the nature of the intervention it will not be possible for therapists to be blinded to group allocation. Participants cannot be blinded to the intervention they receive.
The statistician will be blinded to group allocation by using a dummy variable for group allocation until analysis is complete. The health economist will not be blinded as the costs of WORKWELL will need to be included into the analysis.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (i.e. aged ≥ 18 years)

          -  diagnosed with RA, UIA or PsA by a Rheumatology Consultant. (Undifferentiated
             Inflammatory Arthritis is defined as: persistent synovitis in more than one small
             joint of the hand, without any other known cause, but the person does not yet meet all
             the diagnostic criteria for RA. Participants can have co-morbidities (which may also
             be related to having RA, UIA or PsA, for example, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, heart
             condition, mild to moderate anxiety or depression; or are unrelated, e.g. diabetes.

          -  In paid work (full or part-time, self-employed or contractual work) for at least 15
             hours per week.

          -  Participants may be on sick leave at the time of screening BUT this must be for less
             than 4 weeks duration and not planned or likely to extend for longer than 4 weeks.

          -  Able to read and understand English.

          -  Score ≥10 on the RA-Work Instability Scale (RA-WIS), a measure of mismatch between the
             person's abilities and their job demands.

          -  Able to attend the participating site for WORKWELL appointments, if allocated to that
             group

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  on extended sick leave (i.e. &gt; 4 weeks). The WORKWELL intervention is designed for
             people currently in work. Long-term sick leave is defined as being &gt; 4 weeks [NICE,
             2009b].

          -  Already planning to retire due to age or to take early retirement (for any health or
             non-health reason) within the next 12 months (i.e. within the trial follow-up period)

          -  planning to move out of area within the next 3 months and therefore would be unable to
             attend for WORKWELL sessions if allocated to that group (as treatment may not be
             completed in time).

          -  already receiving or awaiting VR services from Access to Work or a Vocational
             Rehabilitation company. These services conduct work assessments as part of VR
             provision. (Those receiving work services from other sources (e.g. occupational health
             or human resources in their organisation, online advice from Fit for Work) may still
             be recruited as VR provision can be of varied quality and this will be considered as
             &quot;usual care.&quot;

          -  Employed in the armed forces (as they could be stationed overseas during the trial
             period. The armed services also have their own Vocational Rehabilitation service.
