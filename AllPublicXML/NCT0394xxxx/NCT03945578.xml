  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of visceral manual therapy on the
      symptoms of urinary incontinence and on the impact on quality of life in women. This is a
      randomized controlled trial with simple blinding. Participants will be randomized into two
      groups: control and intervention. Both groups will undergo a pelvic floor muscle training
      (PFMT) program twice weekly for 5 consecutive weeks. Participants in the intervention group
      will also receive, once a week, a visceral manual therapy protocol. Visceral manual therapy
      associated with PFMT is expected to yield superior results to the isolated PFMT in UI
      symptoms and quality of life.

      This study will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial, parallel in two groups
      (experimental group and control). Participants will initially be evaluated by a trained
      investigator who will be blinded and assigned randomly (random numbers generated on the
      computer) block for the experimental and control groups by means of an opaque envelope draw.
      Participants will be randomized into two groups: control and intervention. Both groups will
      undergo a pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) program twice weekly for 5 consecutive weeks.
      Participants in the intervention group will also receive, once a week, a visceral manual
      therapy protocol. When making the invitation to participate in the survey, individuals will
      not be required to participate if they do not agree, and therefore will not be penalized.
      Participants who agree to participate in the survey will sign a Free and Informed Consent
      Form and will be informed of the possibility of withdrawing from the survey at any stage,
      without penalty. The collection of the evaluation and intervention will be carried out in a
      salon Clinic School of Physiotherapy in the Center of Health and Sports Sciences (CEFID) of
      the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC) in the city of Florianópolis - SC. All
      personal identification data of the participants will be preserved according to resolution of
      the national health council, taking into account the possibility of scientific dissemination
      of the results obtained. The risks of these procedures will be medium, since the participant
      may present muscle pain after the intervention protocol. To minimize these risks will be
      available, if necessary, attendance at the Clinic School of Physiotherapy. The sample will be
      selected in a non-probabilistic way for convenience. The participants will Female volunteers
      , aged from 18 years with urinary incontinence.

    <description>This outcome will be measured through the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form. This is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the frequency, severity, and impact of urinary incontinence on the quality of life of patients of both sexes. It consists of four items. The first three assess the frequency, severity, and impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life. From the sum of these three items the total score is obtained, which can vary between 0 and 21 points. The higher the score, greater the severity of the symptoms of urinary incontinence. The overall score can be divided into four severity categories: mild (1-5 points), moderate (6-12 points), severe (13-18 points), very severe (19-21 points). The fourth item does not enter the total score but serves to determine the type of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency or mixed).</description>
