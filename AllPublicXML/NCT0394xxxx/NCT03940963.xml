      Comparing safety, pain, user experience, healthcare economic costs, work productivity,
      impairment and quality of life outcomes between Axoguard® Nerve Cap and neurectomy in the
      treatment of symptomatic neuromas in the foot. Study consists of a 15 subject pilot phase
      with Axoguard Nerve Cap implants followed for 3 months and then a comparative study of 86
      subjects randomized between the treatment groups followed for 12 months.

    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) For Pain Score at 3 post-operative months in Pilot Phase Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) For Pain is a patient reported outcomes scale whereby the patient indicates his/her current pain level by making a mark on a continuous horizontal 10 centimeter (100 millimeter) line. The distance from the 0 millimeter to the patient's mark corresponds to the amount of pain the subject is currently experiencing. VAS for Pain data are recorded as the number of millimeters from the left of the line to the patients mark across the range of 0-100 millimeters, with 0 millimeter representing no pain and 100 millimeters representing &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>2. Change in Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) - Pain Related Measures through 12 post-operative months compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) - Pain Related Measures is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors a patient's physical health and pain. The PROMIS - pain related measures include domains evaluating fatigue, pain intensity, paint interference, sleep Disturbance, and Pain Behavior. Short forms containing fixed sets of 4-10 items or questions are included for each domain. All PROMIS scores are presented as T-scores where the T-score is the standardized score with a mean of 50 (range 20-80) and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the concept being measures where sometimes the concept is desirable (e.g., physical function) and sometimes this it is undesirable (e.g., fatigue). PROMIS instruments are scored using item-level calibrations based on response patterns by HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_scoringservice).</description>

    <measure>Change in Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) Score at 1,3,6,9, and 12 post-operative months compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) measures foot health related to quality of life based on responsiveness in overall foot health status in 4 subscale areas (foot function, foot health, footwear and foot pain). The FHSQ is comprised of 13 questions. The questionnaire is self-administered. Subscale ratings are summed and the FHSQ score is reported as 0 (representing poorest state of foot health) to 100 (representing optimal foot health) with higher scores reflecting better foot health and quality of life.</description>
