    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BHV3000 compared to placebo for
      subjects with treatment refractory Trigeminal Neuralgia as measured by a 2-point or greater
      reduction in the average Numeric Pain Rating Scale between the two-week treatment phases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of typical or atypical classical trigeminal
             neuralgia based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd
             edition, beta version.

          2. Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to randomization visit.

          3. Neuroimaging to exclude another cause for the neuralgia, other than neurovascular
             compression.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a structural lesion on neuroimaging, other than vascular compression of
             the trigeminal nerve or nerve root that would explain the neuralgia

          2. Subject has a clinically evident neurologic deficit on neurologic exam of the cranial
             nerves

          3. Subjects with a history of HIV disease

          4. Subject history with current evidence of uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed
             cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, and
             cerebral ischemia. Subjects with Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute Coronary Syndrome
             (ACS), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), cardiac surgery, stroke or transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) during the 6 months prior to screening

          5. Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure) at screening

          6. Subject has a current diagnosis of major depression, other pain syndromes, psychiatric
             conditions (e.g., schizophrenia), dementia, or significant neurological disorders
             (other than migraine) that, in the Investigator's opinion, might interfere with study
             assessments

          7. Subject has a history of gastric, or small intestinal surgery (including Gastric
             Bypass, Gastric Banding, Gastric Sleeve, Gastric Balloon, etc.), or has a disease that
             causes malabsorption

          8. Subject has a history or diagnosis of Gilbert's Syndrome or any other active hepatic
             or biliary disorder

          9. The subject has a history or current evidence of any significant and/or unstable
             medical conditions (e.g., history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known
             suspected infection, hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion,
             would expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with
             assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial

         10. History of, treatment for, or evidence of, alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12
             months or subjects who have met DSM-V criteria for any significant substance use
             disorder within the past 12 months from the date of the screening visit

         11. Hematologic or solid malignancy diagnosis within 5 years prior to screening. Subjects
             with a history of localized basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible for
             the study if they are cancer-free prior to the screening visit in this study.

         12. Hematologic or solid malignancy diagnosis within 5 years prior to screening. Subjects
             with a history of localized basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible for
             the study if they are cancer-free prior to the screening visit in this study.

         13. Body mass index &gt;33kg/mÂ²

         14. History of gallstones or cholecystectomy
