  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To-date there have been only very few studies to examine the effect of cataract surgery to
      patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. The evidence on the effects of cataract
      surgery in such patients suggests improvement of their visual function and quality of life,
      but at the same time a subclinical susceptibility to macular edema and exacerbation of the
      choroidal neovascularization. Therefore it is highly important to identify the optimum
      treatment regime, pursuing the best anatomical and functional postoperative results.

      To-date there have been only very few studies to examine the effect of cataract surgery to
      patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially in the era of
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Furthermore the issue of optimum
      treatment regimen that should be used in the peroperative period has never been addressed.
      Since the human life expectancy gradually increases, the number of patients who are under
      anti-VEGF intravitreal injections for wet AMD will be increasing accordingly. Cataract
      surgery in such patients, despite guarded prognosis has been proved to improve their visual
      function and quality of life. On the other hand, it has been shown that cataract surgery
      induces anatomic changes based on optical coherence tomography analysis, suggesting a
      subclinical susceptibility to postoperative cystoid macular edema or exacerbation of
      choroidal neovascularization. Therefore it is highly important to identify the optimum
      treatment regime, pursuing the best anatomical and functional postoperative results.

    <description>The status of the age-related macular degeneration will be evaluated based on optical coherence tomography parameters at the at final follow-up and compared to the baseline. Our main focus is to identify any subfoveal scarring and/ or subfoveal atrophy that may develop during the follow-up and assess changes from the baseline state of the macula.</description>
