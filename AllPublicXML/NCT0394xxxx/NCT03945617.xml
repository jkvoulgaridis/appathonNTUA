  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with a high burden of disease,
      costs and individual impairment worldwide. Psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT), is the first line treatment for anxiety disorders. CBT is effective in
      modifying dysfunctional cognitions and reducing avoidance behavior, thus leading to a lasting
      reduction of symptoms.

      Even though CBT is generally effective, around 50% of patients do not benefit sufficiently
      from this treatment. The current study aims at optimizing the treatment of anxiety disorders
      by identifying predictors of treatment response. Multiple (neuro-)psychological, biological,
      genetic and behavioral variables will be combined into a comprehensive prediction model of
      treatment outcome. Knowledge on predictors can then be used to improve therapy on an
      individual patient level.
