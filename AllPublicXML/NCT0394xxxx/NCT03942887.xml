  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Most recent insights in the treatment for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis
      (AAV) have demonstrated that 'tailored' maintenance treatment with rituximab (RTX) is
      effective to achieve durable remission of disease. As such, RTX re-treatment can be tailored
      on the basis of relevant immunological parameters that reflect minimal residual autoimmunity
      (MRA) in AAV patients. Now, the present study intends to evaluate whether combining rituximab
      with cyclophosphamide is superior to current standard of care with rituximab only to induce a
      favorable immunological state of MRA in AAV patients that can beneficially influence, i.e.
      reduce, the necessity of tailored re-treatment with rituximab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The primary objective is to prove the superiority of combination treatment RTX
      with cyclophosphamide to achieve a state of MRA as defined as number of patients that reach
      ANCA seroconversion to negative within 24 weeks. The secondary objectives are alternative
      measurements for MRA such as time to ANCA return, duration of B-cell depletion and the
      composition of the memory B-cell and plasma cell populations.

      Study design: Open label, two-center, randomized controlled trial Study population: Adult AAV
      patients with a clinical diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic
      polyangiitis (MPA) who have 'generalised disease' and a positive ANCA-test for
      anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) or anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO).

      Intervention: In addition to standard of care corticosteroid therapy, AAV patients will be
      randomized to receive either standard induction therapy with 2 infusions of RTX 1000 mg or
      induction therapy combining 2 infusions of RTX 1000 mg RTX with 6 infusions of low dose
      intravenous cyclophosphamide 500mg. Thereafter, as part of standard of care patients will
      receive tailored RTX re-treatment as maintenance therapy.

      Main study parameters: AAV patients will be evaluated for MRA by prospectively and
      consecutively studying ANCA levels, B-cell depletion by standard flowcytometry and subsets of
      the B-cell and plasma cell compartment with high-sensitivity flowcytometry at predefined
      timepoints. Additionally, the study will perform safety and toxicity monitoring according to
      World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity criteria and evaluate the clinical response, the
      number of RTX re-treatments and the number of moderate and severe flares during study
      follow-up.

      Study duration: 2 years
