      The purpose of this research study is to collect data/measurements that are routinely
      collected in standard of care cerebral angiogram

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research for this study is to determine how the injection of contrast material influences
      vessel measurements, as these measurements guide device selection when interventions are
      warranted.

      The data will be used to determine if there is a significant change in vessel diameter with
      intra-arterial injection of contrast material in cerebral angiography, how changes in force
      of contrast injection augments the significance of the changes in vessel geometry, and the
      extent of propagation downstream from the catheter tip that such changes in vessel diameter
      are detected and found to be significant, as these changes could potentially lead to less
      optimal device selection by providing an overestimation of true vessel diameter.

    <description>Subjects will undergo the standard of care cerebral angiogram and any intervention(s) (when applicable) that were discussed with their provider, following the standard procedural protocol for the procedure at WFBMC. There are no additional interventions or changes to the planned intervention(s) that will take place by agreeing to participate in the study.
The data collected from this procedure, following the standard of care protocol, will include the following: force of injection of contrast material for each angiographic run (peak pressure associated with injection, duration of peak, and area under pressure curve), volume of contrast utilized, images from the procedure, measurements of vessel diameter at defined distances from the catheter tip utilizing the images, catheter type, any additional device(s) (when applicable) utilized during the procedure, and if spasmolytic agents are utilized (including dose and time of administration).</description>
