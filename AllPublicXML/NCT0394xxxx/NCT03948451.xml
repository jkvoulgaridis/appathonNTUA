  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor is developing the test medicine, AZD5718, for the potential treatment of
      cardiovascular disease.

      The study is an open-label, single dose study involving 6 healthy male subjects. The
      volunteers will receive a single dose of 200 mg radiolabelled AZD5718 (14C-AZD5718 Oral
      Suspension) containing not more than 9.9 MBq of radiocarbon.

      Volunteers will attend the clinic for 9 days (Day -1 to Day 8) to receive a single dose of
      the test medicine. It is planned that the volunteers will be discharged as a group once all
      volunteers have reached the discharge criteria. This may result in the subjects being
      discharged as a group prior to completion of the planned residency period. If the discharge
      criteria are not met by volunteers by Day 8, the individual volunteers who have not met the
      criteria will remain in the clinical unit for a further 48 h (until Day 10).

      A follow-up call will take place 7 to 10 days after discharge to ensure the ongoing wellbeing
      of volunteers.

             by case basis, if considered not to interfere with the objectives of the study, as
             agreed by the PI and sponsor's medical monitor.

             2 Units = 125 mL glass of wine, depending on type).

         19. Subjects who are study site employees, or immediate family members of a study site or
             sponsor employee.

         20. Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background
             radiation but including diagnostic x-rays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5 mSv
             in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 5 years. No occupationally exposed worker,
             as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 2017, shall participate in the study.

         21. Judgment by the investigator that the volunteer should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (ie during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of the study data or are
             considered unlikely to comply with the study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

         22. Failure to satisfy the investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason.
