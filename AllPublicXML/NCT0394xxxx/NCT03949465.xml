  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulatory technique that is
      effective in major depression. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that rTMS is
      effective in peripartum depression as well, however this comes from a number of very small
      studies.

      The objective is to study the effectiveness of rTMS in peripartum depression. The
      investigators will do so using an open label design in which participants will receive rTMS
      for four weeks. The focus is on clinical improvement in depressive symptoms; however the
      investigators will also look at other aspects such as perinatal anxiety and maternal-infant
      bonding as measured by self-report questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum Depression (PPD) is common and severely disabling. Pharmacological intervention
      remains the first line of treatment, however many patients do not experience any benefits
      from them. Furthermore, many women are hesitant about pharmaceutical interventions due to the
      unknown effects on foetal health and lactation. Hence novel treatment approaches are required
      for such patients. Neuromodulation techniques involve selective targeting of brain areas
      which are promising avenues for such depressed patients.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an investigational and therapeutic modality that
      impacts neurons by delivering patterned energy safely and noninvasively. In response to this
      patterned energy, neurons fire, and adapt by changing their connection strengths. This change
      in connection strength is believed to be the underlying mechanism whereby rTMS has
      therapeutic benefit in conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). There are
      preliminary evidences suggesting that it is effective in PPD as well, however this comes from
      a number of very small studies and is therefore unclear.

      Given the promising preliminary evidence, the investigators propose to study the
      effectiveness of intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation rTMS (iTBS) to the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in treating PPD. Participants with PPD will receive iTBS rTMS for
      four weeks (20 sessions) in an open label manner. The primary measure will be clinical
      improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS) with iTBS-rTMS. In addition, the investigators will look at other
      aspects such as peripartum anxiety and maternal attachment during treatment and 8 weeks
      postpartum.
