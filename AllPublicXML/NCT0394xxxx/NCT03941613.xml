  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is the most classical subtype of temporal lobe epilepsy,
      which is the indication of surgical intervention after evaluation. Until now, anterior
      temporal lobectomy (ATL) is still the recommended treatment for mTLE. However, evidences are
      accumulated including post ATL tetartanopia and memory deterioration and new minimized
      invasive treatments are introduced. Stereotactic EEG (SEEG) guided radio-frequency
      thermocoagulation (RF-TC) is one of the option with lower seizure freedom but with higher
      neurological function reservation. This study is aiming at comparison of the efficacy and
      safety between SEEG guided RF-TC and classical ATL in the treatment of mTLE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, more and more patients received SEEG implantation for the evaluation of intractable
      seizures. SEEG is not only a diagnostic method to locate the origin of the epileptic seizures
      but also a media to treat or to cure this disease. Using radiofrequency thermocoagulation, we
      are able to coagulate some part of the brain guided by SEEG. However, until now, we don't
      have high level evidence for the efficacy and safety of RF-TC. In our resent series, we found
      the 1 year seizure free rate of mTLE patients after RF-TC is about 80% without any notable
      complication.

      In this trail, we will compare the efficacy as well as the safety of anterior temporal
      lobectomy with RF-TC for the mTLE patients, including the 1 year Engel class, perioperative
      complications, cognitive function, visual field, etc. Thus we can provide more high level
      evidence on the usage of SEEG guided RF-TC on mTLE patients.
