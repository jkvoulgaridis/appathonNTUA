      Multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of BION-1301 in healthy volunteers and adults with IgA Nephropathy
      (IgAN).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of BION-1301, a first-in-class humanized IgG4 anti-a
      proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) monoclonal antibody.

      The study will be conducted in three parts. Part 1: double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) in healthy volunteers (HVs). Part 2:
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose (MAD) in HVs. Part 3:
      Open-label, multiple dose (MD) in subjects with IgAN.

      The study will enroll up to 72 healthy subjects and up to 20 subjects with IgAN.
