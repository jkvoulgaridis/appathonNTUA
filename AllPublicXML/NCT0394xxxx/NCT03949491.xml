      The purpose of this study is to determine if 3D modeling and Virtual Planning Surgery can
      improve the clinical outcome with patient who have a mastectomy requiring breast
      reconstruction.

      Primary objective: Using 3D medical models of the abdomen, a virtual plan will assist
      reconstruction to clearly define and 3D model the normal and aberrant vascular anatomy of the
      donor site in order to decrease dissection time and secondary perioperative complications
      including fat necrosis and donor site complications.

      Secondary objective: To propose incision lines to match the corresponding volumetric analysis
      of the transposed tissue in order to facilitate the creation of a patient specific tailored
      flap, which will improve the aesthetic outcomes.

      This is a single-armed, prospective study to determine the feasibility of using 3-D virtual
      planning and medical modeling in breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction

    <description>Incidence of fat necrosis will be measured in the postoperative period using a classification system. Grade I necrosis will be defined as minimal requiring no surgical intervention; Grade II necrosis will be minor with some aesthetic defect requiring primary excision and closure; Grade III necrosis will be defined as requiring secondary procedures after excision to achieve satisfactory cosmesis; Grade IV necrosis will involve a necrosectomy requiring a either a completely new flap or at least a second flap to address such problems; Grade V necrosis will be defined as complete flap failure 5.
Higher grade of fat necrosis is worse.</description>

    <description>Using 3D medical models of the abdomen, a virtual plan will assist reconstruction to clearly define and 3D model the normal and aberrant vascular anatomy of the donor site in order to decrease both operative time and dissection time. This will also allow for the proposal of incision lines to match the corresponding volumetric analysis of the transposed tissue in order to facilitate the creation of a patient specific tailored flap, which will improve the aesthetic outcomes, decrease donor site complications and improve patient satisfaction</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast caner undergoing
             delayed or immediate breast reconstruction.

          -  Performance statusECOG Performance status ≤ 2

          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dl

          -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Serum Creatinine within normal institutional limits

          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects receiving any prior abdominoplasty or abdominal liposuction, or patient that
             plan on undergoing radiation therapy after reconstruction.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to IV contrast.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from
             this study because IV contrast and CT scans have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with breast cancer,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued.

          -  Unsuitable donor site volume or vasculature based on pre-operative imaging or physical
             exam.
