  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the relationship of small blood vessels
      irregularities observed with an imaging system called video nailfold capillaroscopy in people
      with primary open-angle glaucoma. Nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) is a video camera with a
      magnifying lens used for studying the movement of blood in small blood vessels. It is simple,
      safe and does not penetrate the skin. The skin fold that is at the tip of the finder is
      called the &quot;nailfold&quot;. NFC has been used to assess blood vessel narrowing in patients with
      glaucoma.

      In this study, the study team investigates the effect of topically-applied latanoprostene
      bunod (LTB) on the blood flow at the nailfold of the 4th finger in patients with primary open
      angle glaucoma. LTB is a new anti-glaucoma eye drop which received FDA clearance in early
      November 2017. It has two components: the prostaglandin analog (PGA) which decreases
      intraocular pressure (IOP) by enhancing the drainage of the aqueous (the fluid in the front
      part of the eye) from the eye, and the nitric oxide (NO) moiety which naturally dilates
      arteries in the body. The capillaries at the nailfold are comparable to those of the optic
      nerve head, which makes them a reasonable surrogate for evaluation of the effect of LTB on
      the blood flow. Therefore, this study may provide indirect evidence for the beneficial effect
      of LTB on blood flow to optic nerve which can potentially save the optic nerve from
      glaucomatous damage. Primary open angle glaucoma is a progressive condition and is the most
      common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a
      subset of the glaucomas defined by an open, normal appearing anterior chamber angle and
      raised intraocular pressure (IOP), with no other underlying disease.

      In addition to LTB, the study team will use latanoprost (L), an-FDA approved PGA
      anti-glaucoma eye drop and normal saline (NS: the physiologic solution composed of 0.9% salt
      and water), as controls to make sure the effects of LPB on nail fold capillary blood flow is
      not due to its PGA (as L is) or due to the placebo effect (as NS is).

      This study may also serve as background information for the development of new anti-glaucoma
      medications which can be injected into the eye to facilitate blood flow to the optic nerve.

    <masking_description>Patients will have baseline NFC blood flow measurements after application of cedar oil. Then the study team will use NF application of either normal saline, latanoprost 0.005% or LTB 0.024% in random sequence. The patient and imager will know which study article is applied. NFC blood flow will be remeasured after 15 minutes. Preliminary data on controls suggests that 15 minutes is sufficient time to see a change in blood flow. NF article application will occur on a specially designed well applied to the 4th digit of the non-dominant hand. Two masked observers will evaluate NFC blood flow.</masking_description>
