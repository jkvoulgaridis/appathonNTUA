  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous researches demonstrated that a prepackaged low-residue diet (LRD) could achieve
      better bowel preparation quality compared with a self-prepared LRD. However, up to now, there
      has been no widely acceptable standard of LRD for bowel preparation. Moreover, these
      prepackaged LRD adopted in previous studies mainly consisted of traditional foods without
      further processing. Recently, a prepackaged LRD for Special Medical Purpose was specifically
      designed for bowel preparation. This trail was to compare the impact of the prepackaged LRD
      on bowel preparation for colonoscopy with self-prepared LRD by patients.

    <description>BBPS was developed to evaluate the quality of colon preparation and was used in our previous study. Each section of the colon (i.e. the right, the transverse, and the rectosigmoid colon) was rated (0, very poor; 1, poor; 2, good; and 3, very good). Adequate bowel of bowel preparation was defined as a total BBPS score ≥ 6 and all colon segments BBPS ≥ 2. Inadequate bowel preparation was defined as any colon segment BBPS ≤ 1.</description>
