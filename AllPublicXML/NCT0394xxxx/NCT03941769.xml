      This phase I trial studies side effects and best dose of recombinant interleukin-7 in
      promoting immune cell recovery in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
      syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myeloproliferative disease after a cord blood
      transplant. Umbilical cord blood is a source of blood-forming cells that can be used for
      transplant, also known as a graft. However, there is a small number of blood-forming cells
      available in the transplant, which may delay the &quot;take&quot; of the graft in the recipient.
      Recombinant interleukin-7 may affect the &quot;take&quot; of the graft and the recovery of certain
      blood cells related to the immune system (called T-cells, natural killer cells, and B cells)
      in patients who have had a cord blood transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT) of recombinant interleukin-7 (interleukin 7 [IL-7, CYT107]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and BK viral
      infections in cord blood transplant (CBT) patients who receive three doses of IL-7 following
      engraftment.

      II. To calculate the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cumulative
      incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and cumulative incidence of relapse.

      III. To evaluate the effects of CYT107 on the recovery of T, natural killer (NK) and B cell
      populations and their functions in vitro; these data will be used to identify the optimal
      dose to move to a phase II trial.

      IV. To obtain information about the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CYT107 by estimating time
      to maximum concentration (Tmax), concentration maximum (Cmax), half-life, clearance and
      area-under-the-curve (AUC).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Within 60-180 days after CBT, patients receive recombinant interleukin-7 intramuscularly (IM)
      or subcutaneously (SC) once per week for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 3 years.
