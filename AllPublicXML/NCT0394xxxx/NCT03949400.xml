  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain - Numerical rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6+12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is the most common pain scale for quantification pain. The respondent selects a whole number on a scale from 0-10, that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. 0 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Y-balance test (YBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6+12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The YBT test is a test commonly used in clinical practice to investigate functional balance. The YBT is based on the Star Excursion Balance Test and it has been thoroughly researched. Measured with and without the soft knee brace at baseline, after the treatment program and at 12weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>6+12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems. KOOS has been evaluated and compared to other instruments in several studies. Measured at baseline, after the treatment program and at 12weeks.</description>
