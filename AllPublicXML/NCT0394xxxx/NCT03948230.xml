  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently changes in mood and cognition have been reported following minor reductions in
      hydration status. The aim is to explore that such changes in part at least reflect placebo
      response; therefore the consumption of plain or coloured water will be compared in drinks
      designed to differ in their ability to rehydrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      162 individuals will be subject to a temperature of 30Â°C for three hours, and mood and
      cognition monitored. Randomly on two occasions they will consume no drink or 300ml of plain
      or red colored water. In addition they will take a capsule containing sodium chloride or a
      placebo. Mood will be monitored using visual analogue scales and a battery of cognitive tests
      will be completed on three occasions: attention, episodic and working memory, reactions
      times. Urine osmolality will be measured at the beginning and end of the study and changes in
      body mass will be recorded. Changes in functioning will be related to the nature of the drink
      and changes in osmolality and body mass.
