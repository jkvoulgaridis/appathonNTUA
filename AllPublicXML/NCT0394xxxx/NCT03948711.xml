  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the feasibility of Nonin SenSmart H500 device to measuring brain
      oxygenation during prehospital anesthesia of adult patient. The study also estimates the
      incidence of cerebral hypoxic events of anesthetized patients during prehospital care. The
      study does not affect the treatment of the patient. The study is pilot study and will be
      followed with a main study to assess the association between cerebral oxygenation during
      prehospital care and outcome of the patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  sedation or anesthesia provided to facilitate endotracheal intubation, performed by
             HEMS team regardless of the reason

        Exclusion Criteria:

             scene after inclusion)

          -  Workload too high to ensure standard level of clinical care during the study

          -  Known special vulnerability including known mental disability (permanent, not related
             to acute condition), patients in nursing homes, prisoners and forensic psychiatric
             patients.
