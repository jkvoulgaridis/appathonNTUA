  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to gain an understanding of the willingness of women with a
      history of early stage breast cancer and current obesity to enroll in a weight-loss study,
      accept an assigned intervention (bariatric surgery with lifestyle intervention or lifestyle
      intervention alone), and comply with the study plan for 1 year. If there is successful
      enrollment in this study, the plan is to use what is learned in this study to design a
      larger, longer-term clinical trial to look at the effect of weight loss and incidence of
      cancer recurrence.

    <description>All participants receive lifestyle intervention. The lifestyle intervention program is modeled closely after that used in the Diabetes Primary Prevention Trial and the LookAHEAD diabetes treatment studies. Intervention includes counseling sessions weekly for the first six months, twice a month during months 7-9, and monthly during months 10-12, and energy intake and exercise goal monitoring and guidance.</description>
