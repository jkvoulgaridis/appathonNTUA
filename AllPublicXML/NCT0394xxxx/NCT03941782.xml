  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use protocol of BYL719 (alpelisib) treatment for a single patient
      with locally advanced lymphangioma positive PI3K alpha H1047R mutation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a single agent, alpelisib will be administered at a starting dose of 350 mg orally once
      daily on a continuous dosing schedule and can be adjusted for toxicity per the
      recommendations in this protocol. No pretreatment will be given prior to the medication.

      We plan on treating this individual patient for a tentative period of 12 weeks at which time
      treating physician will reevaluate the patient's clinical and radiological response and
      further duration of treatment will be contingent on that assessment.

                  Appendix 1, Table 2 for a full list of prohibited medications).

                  Note: The patient must have discontinued strong inducers for at least one week
                  and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the treatment with alpelisib

                  abnormality, e.g. congenital long QT syndrome, high-grade/complete AV-blockage:
                  per guidelines.

                  e. Symptomatic pericarditis f. QTcF &gt; 480 msec on the screening ECG (using the

                  to prolong the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes, and the treatment
                  cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting
                  treatment with alpelisib.

              11. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may
                  significantly alter the absorption of alpelisib (e.g., ulcerative diseases,
                  uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel
                  resection)

              12. Patient has other prior or concurrent malignancy (except for the following:
                  adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately
                  treated in situ cancer, early gastric or GI cancer resected completely by
                  endoscopy procedures or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease
                  free for ≥ 3 years)

              13. Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant
                  consent

              14. Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the treatment
                  with alpelisib and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of
                  alpelisib:

                    1. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking
                       drug and for 4 weeks* after the final dose of alpelisib and should not
                       father a child in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on
                       conservation of sperm. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                       men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

                    2. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all female physiologically
                       capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during
                       the IPP and through at least 4 weeks* after the final dose of alpelisib

                    3. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:

                  i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
                  of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception].

                  ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                  without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks
                  before starting treatment with alpelisib. In case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                  level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For
                  female patients participating to this IPP, the vasectomized male partner should
                  be the sole partner for that patient] iv. Use a combination of the following
                  (both a+b):

                    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

                  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not
                  allowed as alpelisibBYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal
                  contraceptives.

                  * Please consult your local product labels should any concomitant medications be
                  used, as this period may be longer for other potentially genotoxic compounds.

                  A female is considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six
                  weeks ago before the treatment start. For females with therapy-induced
                  amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone
                  (FSH) and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.

                  NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
                  (LHRH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for
                  induction of ovarian suppression.
