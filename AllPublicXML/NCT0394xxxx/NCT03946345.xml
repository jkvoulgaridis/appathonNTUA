  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 25-35% of all children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) will develop Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) during the first
      seven days after admission. AKI is associated with a worse outcome, including an increased
      risk of mortality compared to patients without AKI. However, this AKI prevalence estimation
      is based on serum creatinine based glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is known to be
      inaccurate. The investigators postulate that measured GFR (mGFR) based on iohexol clearance
      in critically ill children will detect a higher prevalence of children with AKI than
      currently used methods based on endogenous markers. This study will additionally provide
      mechanistic knowledge on the relative contribution of GFR and renal transport to renal
      function in critically ill children.

      Primary objective: To determine the prevalence of AKI in critically ill children based on
      clearance of iohexol.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine the prevalence of AKI in critically ill children using serum creatinine,
           creatinine clearance, cystatin C and/or blood urea nitrogen based eGFR equations as well
           as urinary iohexol clearances.

        2. To determine serum Proenkephalin (PENK) levels in critically ill children.

        3. To compare the prevalence of AKI when this diagnosis is based on plasma iohexol
           clearances with the prevalence of AKI based on serum creatinine, creatinine clearance,
           serum cystatin C, PENK and/or Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) based eGFR and to assess
           agreement between those methods

        4. To determine risk factors for the development of AKI when based on iohexol clearance.

      Exploratory endpoint: To explore the relationship of genetic variation with the development
      of AKI.

    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>AKI will be defined by using age-specific reference values of GFR. Based on their standard deviations (SD), three groups are defined:
Stage 1: mean -1 SD &gt; GFR &lt; mean -1.5 SD
Stage 2: mean -1.5 SD&gt; GFR &lt; mean -2 SD
Stage 3: GFR &lt; mean -2 SD
Patients will be grouped according whether they lack AKI or have AKI (either stage 1, 2 or 3). When a patient will be classified as having AKI at one moment and not fulfilling the AKI-criteria at another, or classified into different stages of AKI within one day, the highest stage of the 72 hours will be used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of AKI using serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary iohexol, serum cystatin C, serum PENK and/or blood urea nitrogen based eGFR equations.</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Classification of AKI based on serum creatinine levels:
Stage 1: serum creatinine concentration &gt;150% of median age specific reference value.
Stage 2: serum creatinine concentration &gt;200% of median age specific reference value.
Stage 3: serum creatinine concentration &gt;300% of median age specific reference value.
Creatinine clearance: CrCl(ml/min/1.73m2) = (urine volume × urine creatinine × 1.73)/ (serum creatinine × 120 minutes × body surface area)
AKI classification based on serum cystatin C levels will be similar to classification based on serum creatinine levels
Urinary iohexol clearance: Ku(X)(t)=dXu/dt &amp; Cl(u)=dXudt/AUCpdt
AKI will be classified based on eGFR calculated by the CKiD Schwartz Equation
Data will be analysed for the overall 72 hour period, using the highest grade of AKI during the study duration, as well as per 24 hour period.</description>
