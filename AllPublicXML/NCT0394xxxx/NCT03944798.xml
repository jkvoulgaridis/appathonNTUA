  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following treatment for a primary extremity sarcoma, patients remain at risk for the
      development of local and systemic disease recurrence. Metastasis (distant recurrence) to the
      lung is the most frequent single location of disease recurrence in sarcoma patients,
      occurring in almost half of all patients. Therefore, careful post-operative surveillance is
      an integral element of patient care. However, the detection of metastases does not
      necessarily affect long-term survival and may negatively impact quality of life. Surveillance
      strategies have not been well researched and have been identified as the top research
      priority in the extremity sarcoma field. Using a 2X2 factorial design to maximize efficiency
      and reduce overall trial costs, the SAFETY trial will randomize 830 extremity soft-tissue
      sarcoma (STS) patients to determine the effect of surveillance strategy on overall patient
      survival after surgery for a STS of the extremity by comparing the effectiveness of both
      surveillance frequency (every 3 vs. every 6 months) and imaging modality (CT scans vs. chest
      radiographs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-treatment STS surveillance is an integral element of patient care. Although earlier
      detection of metastatic disease may improve long-term survival, no study has yet provided
      definitive evidence to support this assumption. A thorough systematic review of the
      literature has identified only a single limited randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating
      this clinical question, and surveys of sarcoma surgeons have determined that surgeons
      typically follow their patients based on the way in which they were trained. The orthopaedic
      oncology field has identified sarcoma surveillance strategy as the top research priority in
      the field. In order to fill the evidence gap in sarcoma surveillance, a large international
      RCT is required. The investigators, therefore, propose the Surveillance AFter Extremity Tumor
      surgerY (SAFETY) trial. In preparation for the SAFETY trial, the SAFETY investigators have
      completed the following preparatory work: A) establishment of a worldwide research
      collaborative group that spans 6 continents; B) collection of data from international sarcoma
      patients to determine their perceptions of sarcoma surveillance and their willingness to
      participate in a study in which randomization will determine their follow-up protocols; and
      C) the organization of a large Protocol Development Meeting with international and
      multidisciplinary participation, including sarcoma patient involvement, where critical
      aspects of the protocol were discussed and finalized.

      The international, multi-center SAFETY trial will determine the effect of surveillance
      strategy on overall patient survival after surgery for a STS of the extremity by comparing
      the effectiveness of both surveillance frequency (every 3 vs. every 6 months) and imaging
      modality (CT scans vs. chest radiographs). Ultimately, the SAFETY trial will provide the
      necessary evidence to develop evidence-based surveillance guidelines, and is poised to have a
      significant impact on the post-operative care and outcomes of extremity soft-tissue sarcoma
      patients.

    <masking_description>The local clinical team, site study personnel and participants cannot be blinded to the treatment allocation as the imaging modalities are visually distinguishable and these individuals will be required to arrange the booking of surveillance visits and imaging at their respective clinical site.
The Central Adjudication Committee (CAC) will be blinded to surveillance frequency; however, because the imaging modalities are visually distinguishable, the CAC cannot be blinded to imaging modality. The data analysts will, however, remain blinded throughout the trial and all interpretation of study results will be conducted in a blinded manner. Since the primary outcome (overall survival) is objective, a lack of blinding of study personnel and patients, and the incomplete blinding of outcome assessors, introduces minimal threats to validity.</masking_description>

    <description>The PROMIS® Cancer-Anxiety instrument assesses self-reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness), and somatic symptoms related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness). The PROMIS® Cancer-Anxiety instrument is a computer adaptive test. A minimum of 4 questions must be answered. One's responses will guide the system's choice of the next question. The test will continue until either the standard error drops below a specified level or the participant has answered the maximum number of 12 questions (whichever comes first). Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. To find the raw score, sum the values of the response to each question. The lowest possible raw score is 4 and the highest is 60. The raw score will then be converted into a standardized T-score for each participant using the applicable conversion table. A higher T-score represents a higher degree of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Patient Quality-of-Life</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The validated EuroQol-5 Dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire measures generic health status and consists of 2 sections: the descriptive system and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive system is comprised of 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression). Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. To find the raw score, sum the values of the response to each question. The lowest possible raw score is 5 and the highest is 25. A lower raw score in the descriptive system represents fewer issues with each of the 5 domains. The VAS records a participant's self-rated health from 0 to 100 on a vertical VAS with endpoints labeled '100 - the best health you can imagine' and '0 - the worst health you can imagine'. The participant is asked to mark an 'X' on the scale and write the corresponding number, which is this section's raw score.</description>

          -  The patient has recently undergone surgical excision of a local recurrence;

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with one of the special sub-types, myxoid / round cell
             liposarcoma or extra-skeletal Ewing's sarcoma*;

          -  The patient has been previously diagnosed with a genetic syndrome with an elevated
             risk of malignancy, such as Li-Freumeni Syndrome‡;

          -  The patient has been previously diagnosed with a co-morbid condition that has a life
             expectancy of less than (&lt;) one year;

          -  The site-specific surveillance protocol for the patient's disease is not compatible
             with the study protocol (i.e., regular planned whole-body imaging with positron
             emission tomography [PET] scans);

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with another malignancy within the past five years;

          -  Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigator, with the patient maintaining
             follow-up (with the specific reasoning requiring approval of the Methods Center);

          -  The patient has already been enrolled in the SAFETY trial.

               -  A second CT scan may be required to confirm that indeterminate nodules are false
                  positives before the patient can be enrolled (provided that the second CT scan
                  shows no evidence of metastatic disease);

                    -  Myxoid liposarcoma and extra-skeletal Ewing's sarcoma have different
                       metastatic patterns, which necessitate different surveillance protocols;

                         -  Individuals with Li-Freumeni Syndrome, or other genetic syndromes with
                            an elevated risk of malignancy, appear to be at an elevated risk for
                            radiation-induced cancers, so the use of CT scans should be limited.
