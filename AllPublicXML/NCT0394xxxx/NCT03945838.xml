  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find whether complete decongestive therapy used in breast cancer-related
      lymphedema has an effect on muscle strength in the affected arm, while assessing the efficacy
      of the therapy itself. 74 patients with breast cancer related lymphedema were included in
      this study. Patients were taken their demographic and clinical history and were evaluated
      with measurements of extremity volumes and hand grip strengths using a hand dynamometer
      before and after the complete decongestive therapy. Data were then assessed using relevant
      statistical methods.

    <description>Hand grip strength: Hand grip strength was measured using JAMAR® hand dynamometer. It has been used to assess hand grip strength in many studies over half a century. Patients were asked to sit down with shoulder adducted, elbow flexed (90°) and forearm in the neutral position. Mean of the 3 measurements taken with 1 minute apart from each other was recorded. Patients' measurements were taken for both affected and unaffected arm, and recorded as kgf.</description>

    <measure>Extremity volume</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Volume measurements were taken using ulnar styloid process as a index point, and circumferential measurements were taken with 5 cm spaces from distal to the proximal. Using a computer programme (Limb Volumes Professional version 5.0), the total volume of the arm was calculated and recorded before and after the treatment for both arms.
All patients' measurements were taken by the same researcher.</description>

    <description>It is given in two phases. First phase includes intensive therapy which aims to reduce the volume of the extremity. Second phase aims to preserve these reductions of volume.
All patients were prescribed lymphedema specific exercises and were advised to walk (for 30 minutes everyday) daywhile taking complete decongestive therapy. They were specifically informed that exercise does not aggravate the severity of their lymphedema.
Short stretch bandages were applied to the patients with self manual lymphatic drainage. Intensive phase was given 5 days a week, and short stretch bandages applied for 23 hours a day with 1 hour interval. To increase the local pressure on the areas required, foams were added. Patients were screened with arm circumferential measurements once a week. After gaining a plateau in the volumes, patients were prescribed compression garments.</description>
