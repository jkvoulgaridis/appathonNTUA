      The purpose of this study is to establish a multi-center clinical registration platform, to
      form the real world evidence of New Blood Syndrome Theory intervention in psoriasis, and to
      evaluate the therapeutic advantages of New Blood Syndrome Theory therapy in the clinical
      effective and recurrence rate of psoriasis vulgaris.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease. The incidence of the
      disease is increasing year by year, seriously affecting people's quality of life. The
      systematic treatment of psoriasis in modern medicine is limited of wide application due to
      the adverse reactions of different degrees and the high economic cost.

      Chinese Medicine (CM) has unique advantages in treatment of psoriasis. On the basis of CM
      principle——&quot;Blood Differentiation and Treatment&quot; in psoriasis and the combination of clinical
      experience, Chinese famous professor Wanzhang Qin proposed the &quot;New Blood Syndrome Theory&quot; in
      psoriasis——the psoriasis based in blood, with blood heat first, and blood stasis throughout
      the whole process of psoriasis. This study will form a systematic report on the diagnosis and
      treatment of psoriasis with the New Blood Syndrome Theory; theoretically verified by
      prospective cohort studies, a theoretical system of the New Blood Syndrome Theory for
      psoriasis will be constructed.

      Objectives of this study are to establish a multi-center clinical registration platform, to
      form the real world evidence of New Blood Syndrome Theory intervention in psoriasis, and to
      evaluate the therapeutic advantages of New Blood Syndrome Theory therapy in the clinical
      effective and recurrence rate of psoriasis vulgaris.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index involves grading psoriatic plaques based on erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D). Severity is graded from 0-4 for each criteria (0 - none, 1 - slight, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe, and 4 - very severe). The body is divided into 4 regions, head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, and for each region, the surface area involvement is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 - 0% involvement, 1 - &lt;10%, 2 - 10-&lt;30%, 3 - 30-&lt;50%, 4 - 50-&lt;70%, 5 - 70-&lt;90%, 6 - 90-100%).The highest potential PASI score is 72, with higher PASI scores indicating worse psoriasis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of BSA involved in psoriasis is estimated by fingerprinting, where the entire palm of the patient represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints on psoriasis skin in a body part is used to determine the extent to which the body part is affected by psoriasis (%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D) across all psoriatic lesions. It is calculated as follows: PGA score = (E + I + D) / 3, then the score needs to be rounded to the nearest whole number [PGA scale: Clear (0) - Very Severe (5)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life quality index(DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a participant-reported questionnaire used to measure the health-related quality of life (QOL) of adults suffering from a skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PRQoL is used to assess the impact of psoriasis on individual social life. Scores range from 0-25, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's social life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure lesion pruritus from 0 to 100 mm at eash visit (with 0 being no pruritis and 100 being maximum pruritis).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CM symptom score</measure>
