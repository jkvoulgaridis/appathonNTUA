  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to confirm the utility of chemosensitivity (ChemoID)
      tumor testing on cancer stem cells as a predictor of clinical response in recurrent platinum
      resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      Population studied will be female participants experiencing a recurrent platinum-resistant
      ovarian cancer (no mucinous, low grade serous, or pure sarcoma types), with ≤ 5 prior
      treatments, and a performance status 0-1.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine
      if recurrent platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with
      chemotherapy predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated
      with standard-of-care control therapy chosen by the physician.

      Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (no mucinous, low grade serous, or pure sarcoma types),
      with ≤ 5 prior treatments, and a performance status 0-1 will have a tumor biopsy or a
      cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug response testing with
      multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment
      (chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from a provided list), or to a study arm of
      FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.

      A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata
      based on number of prior platinum treatments and BRCA status to ensure balance within these
      cells.

    <description>The ChemoID test is a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited drug response assay performed by a hospital clinical pathology laboratory that uses patient's live tumor cells to indicate which chemotherapy agent (or combinations) will kill bulk of tumor cells, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are known to cause cancer to recur. During the assay, cancer stem cells and bulk tumor cells from an individual patient are exposed to FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.
The test measures the cytotoxic effect of actual doses of standard-of-care chemotherapies. The ChemoID drug response assay reports a prioritized list of effective and ineffective chemotherapies. The test is designed to target cancer stem cells to mitigate tumor relapse.</description>

         12. CA-125 only disease without RECIST 1.1 measurable or otherwise evaluable disease.
