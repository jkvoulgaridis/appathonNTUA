    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the engraftment of donor microbiota's sulfate
      reducing bacteria (SRB) in subjects with active ulcerative colitis (UC) following sequential
      fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Specifically this study will evaluate if low SRB donor
      microbiota translates to lower SRB microbiota in the UC recipient. It is widely unknown if
      the microbiota in UC is dysfunctional and therefore perpetuates inflammation, or if the
      ongoing inflammation shapes the microbiota. Patients with UC have a higher relative abundance
      of SRB compared to healthy controls. It is the aim of this study to determine if the
      microbiota in UC can be altered to favor a low SRB fraction.

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing remitting inflammatory disease of
      the intestine. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis
      (UC). There is no cure for IBD and the etiology is unknown, however IBD is thought to arise
      as an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. The intestinal microbiota
      closely correlates with inflammation in IBD. Currently, the treatment of IBD is based on
      suppressing the aberrant immune response in the intestine. This often takes the form of
      systemic immunosuppression, which in turn carries a multitude of risks including infection
      and malignancy. Thus there is an urgent need for safe, effective therapies that ultimately
      have the potential to cure IBD.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the process of transferring fecal microbiota from
      one individual to another. FMT has revolutionized the treatment of multiple recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection with a cure rate around 90%. Given the success of FMT in C.
      difficile colitis, attention turned to other forms of colitis, in particular IBD. Early pilot
      studies demonstrated a mixed result for the use of FMT in IBD. One of the key issues
      surrounding the use of FMT in IBD is the challenge of engrafting a new microbiota.
      Additionally IBD flares following FMT for C. difficile infection have been reported, although
      it is difficult to account for the confounding of the underlying C. difficile infection. This
      study will examine how FMT donor selection can impact the engraftment of the microbiota into
      patients with UC.
