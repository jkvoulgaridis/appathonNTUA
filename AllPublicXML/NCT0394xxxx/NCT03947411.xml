      This is an add-on study of efficacy and safety of intravenous injection of Xiyanping
      injection in pediatric subjects with severe Influenza-Like Symptoms.

      The purpose to determine the efficacy and safety of Oseltamivir Phosphate combined with or
      without Xiyanping injection in the treatment of severe Influenza-Like Symptoms. The study
      will enroll 72 Pediatric severe Influenza-Like Symptoms volunteers, who will be randomized
      into 2 groups (1:1 ratio): volunteers from the first group will receive Oseltamivir Phosphate
      and Xiyanping injection for severe Influenza; volunteers from the second group will receive
      Oseltamivir Phosphate for severe Influenza. Xiyanping injection will be administration as
      intravenous injection of 0.4mL/kg/day once daily for 7-10 days concomitantly with Oseltamivir
      Phosphate for severe Influenza-Like Symptoms.
