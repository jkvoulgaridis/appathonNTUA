  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction potentially fatal. The treatment is based on injection of
      epinephrin as soon as possible. Guidelines by the World Allergic Organisation highlight the
      importance of medical follow-up. This follow-up consists of an allergy consultation, the
      prescription and demonstration of epinephrin auto-injector and the implementation of specific
      measures in schools. There is no study about the recurrence of anaphylactic reaction outside
      the hospital.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the allergy follow-up of children after anaphylactic
      reaction. The secondary objective is to evaluate the use of medical advice in case of
      recurrence of anaphylactic reaction.

      Investigators will use a phone call questionnaire for parents of children who underwent an
      anaphylactic reaction between the 1st July 2014 and the 31st June 2016 treated in the
      Paediatric Emergency Department in Femme-Mère-Enfant Hospital in Lyon in France. 179 children
      could be included in the study.
