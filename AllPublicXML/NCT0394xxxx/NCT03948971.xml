  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to document normal intracranial venous sinus pressures.
      Participants who need to have a cerebral angiogram to evaluate a medical problem not related
      to Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) will be invited to participate. Participation
      in this research will not require any extra visits. The intervention will take place in the
      interventional radiology suite when the subject has an angiogram. IIH is a condition that
      causes increased pressure in the brain in the absence of a tumor or other diseases that may
      be causing symptoms. Symptoms include headaches and visual disturbances not explained by
      other things. In IIH there is a narrowing in the sinuses of the brain that causes the
      increased pressure.

      Patients will be prospectively enrolled into the study. All adult patients, aged of 18-60,
      determined to be candidates for elective cerebral arteriography will be screened for
      inclusion in this study. Patients consenting to participate and enrolled in the study will
      first undergo their standard cerebral angiogram procedure, as clinically indicated. Once the
      procedure is completed, enrolled subjects will then undergo the study intervention.

        1. Insertion of an additional catheter in the femoral vein.

        2. Navigation of the catheter into the internal jugular bulb and then catheter navigation
           into the superior sagittal sinus will result in additional fluoroscopic time (requires
           ~60 seconds of additional fluoroscopy time; carries a minimum risk of vessel perforation
           or other untoward event [incidence of complication associated with this procedure in the
           PI patient series is 0%]). There is additionally some ear pain that can happen with this
           Venogram.

        3. 5-10 minutes of additional procedure time. Much of this time period is merely a waiting
           period while the pressures stabilize and are recorded.

        4. An additional venogram injection through the catheter which exposes subjects to an
           additional 1-2 ml of contrast dye and 3-4 seconds of additional fluoroscopy time and its
           associated radiation dose.

    <description>The 5 French (5F) diagnostic catheter will be navigated into the inferior then superior vena cava and then into the internal jugular bulb on the dominant venous side (as determined from the arteriographic images). Next, a 0.027 inch microcatheter will be navigated using fluoroscopic guidance into the superior sagittal sinus and a venogram will then performed by injecting a small dose of contrast. Next, the venous sinus pressure waveforms will be recorded as the catheter is withdrawn into the jugular bulb and then in the superior vena cava to obtain a central venous pressure. Once completed, the catheters will be removed and the sheaths will be removed. Manual pressure will be held at the venous access site for a few minutes. The arterial sheath will be closed based upon standard arteriogram protocol.</description>
