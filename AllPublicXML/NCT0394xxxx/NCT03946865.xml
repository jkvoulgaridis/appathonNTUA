  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      Primary Aim:

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of offering and providing Reiki
      Therapy in hospitalized hematology/oncology cancer patients. The intervention should not -
      interfere with the medical management of the participants. The investigators hypothesize that
      Reiki Sessions will be successfully integrated into conventional care of hospitalized cancer
      patients.

      Secondary Aim:

      The secondary aim is to evaluate the patient reported outcomes of their symptoms (pain,
      fatigue, anxiety) and feelings (happy, energetic, relaxed, and calm) before and after Reiki
      Therapy. The investigators' hypothesis is that there will be improvement of patients'
      symptoms/feelings score after the Reiki Therapy.
