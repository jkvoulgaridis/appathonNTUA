  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 20 years, concerns have been raised about rare but serious adverse outcomes
      associated with macrolide use during pregnancy. The strongest evidence comes from a large
      randomised controlled trial (RCT, ORACLE Child Study II) of women with spontaneous preterm
      labour (SPL), which reported an increased risk of cerebral palsy in children whose mothers
      received erythromycin compared with no erythromycin. A recent systematic review on macrolides
      prescription during pregnancy showed consistent associations with miscarriage, and less
      consistent associations with adverse child outcomes such as congenital malformations,
      cerebral palsy and epilepsy. In this study, the investigators will evaluate associations
      between macrolide antibiotics prescription during pregnancy and a range of adverse child
      outcomes.

      The investigators compare children whose mothers were prescribed an only monotherapy of
      macrolides or penicillins during pregnancy (from 5 gestational week (GW) to delivery and by
      trimesters). The investigators estimate the risk ratios of major malformation (overall and
      five system-specific) and hazard ratios of four neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy,
      epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder) with
      control for potential confounders. The associations will also be examined by subtype of
      macrolides and treatment duration.

      Mother-child pairs will be analysed in a cohort selected from the UK Clinical Practice
      Research Database (CPRD) between 1990 and 2016.

    <description>Major malformation overall will be defined as any of the 11 major system-specific malformations defined in the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT)(Congenital heart defect, nervous system, eye, ear/face/neck, respiratory tract, oro-facial cleft, digestive system, abdominal wall defect, urinary tract, genital tract, and other malformations). The investigators exclude musculoskeletal malformations which are not reliably recorded in general practice (GP) records, and malformation with known cause such as malformation resulted from maternal infections, fetal alcohol syndrome and chromosomal malformations. The malformations will be identified in the children's medical records using Read codes mapped from the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code lists provided by EUROCAT.</description>
