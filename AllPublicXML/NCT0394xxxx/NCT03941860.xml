    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well lenalidomide in combination with ixazomib works
      compared to lenalidomide alone in treating patients with evidence of residual multiple
      myeloma after stem cell transplantation. Immunotherapy with lenalidomide may induce changes
      in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving lenalidomide and ixazomib together may work better than giving lenalidomide
      alone in treating patients with evidence of residual multiple myeloma after a stem cell
      transplantation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether escalating maintenance therapy with the addition of ixazomib citrate
      (ixazomib) to lenalidomide improves overall survival among patients who are MRD positive
      after approximately 1 year of lenalidomide maintenance following an early stem cell
      transplant (=&lt; 12 months from diagnosis).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish whether progression-free survival is superior with the addition of ixazomib
      to lenalidomide maintenance.

      II. To evaluate best response on treatment and compare response rates between arms.

      III. To evaluate the safety profile of ixazomib added to lenalidomide and compare toxicity
      rates between arms.

      EXPLORATORY CLINICAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure treatment exposure and adherence. II. To estimate treatment duration, duration
      of response and time to progression.

      PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the extent and timing of neuropathy associated with the addition of ixazomib
      to lenalidomide maintenance on patient reported health-related quality of life outcomes.

      II. To assess the impact and timing of disease control with the addition of ixazomib to
      lenalidomide maintenance on patient reported health-related quality of life outcomes.

      III. To evaluate attributes of select patient reported treatment-emergent symptomatic adverse
      events (Patient-Reported Outcomes - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      [PRO-CTCAE]) longitudinally and compare responses with provider-reported adverse events.

      IV. To measure the likelihood of medication adherence and examine the relationship with
      treatment exposure.

      V. To assess correlation among patient reported outcome measures and association with
      clinical outcomes.

      VI. To tabulate PRO compliance and completion rates.

      IMAGING OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between baseline fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and patient outcomes.

      II. To compare overall survival with the addition of ixazomib to lenalidomide among baseline
      FDG-PET/CT-positive and FDG-PET/CT-negative subgroups.

      III. To compare the change in quantitative FDG-PET/CT parameters over time with the addition
      of ixazomib to lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and ixazomib
      citrate PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21 and a placebo PO on days 1, 8, and
      15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if &lt; 2 years
      from study entry, every 6 months if 2-5 years from study entry, then every 12 months for up
      to 15 years from study entry.

          -  Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and
             serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) =&lt; 3
             times the upper limit of normal (obtained =&lt; 14 days prior to randomization)

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0,
             1, or 2

          -  Patients must not have grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy or grade 1 peripheral
             neuropathy with pain per CTCAE

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients must not have grade 2 or higher diarrhea per CTCAE in the absence of
             antidiarrheals

          -  Patients must not have been on systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first
             dose of ixazomib, with strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort

          -  Patients must agree to register into the mandatory Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
             Strategies (REMS) program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of
             REMS

          -  Women must not be pregnant due to potential harm to the fetus from ixazomib and
             lenalidomide. All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a blood test or
             urine study with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days prior to the
             first dose of lenalidomide and again within 24 hours prior to the first dose of
             lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing while on treatment. A
             female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or
             whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has
             achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy, or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer
             therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months
             (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must either abstain from sexual intercourse
             for the duration of their participation in the study or agree to use TWO acceptable
             methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective
             method AT THE SAME TIME for 1) at least 28 days before starting study treatment; 2)
             while participating in the study; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 90
             days after the last dose of protocol treatment. Women must also agree to not
             breastfeed during this same time period. Men must agree to either abstain from sexual
             intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study or use a latex condom
             during sexual contact with a FCBP while participating in the study and for 90 days
             after the last dose of protocol treatment even if they have had a successful
             vasectomy. Men must also agree to abstain from donating sperm while on study treatment
             and for 28 days after the last dose of protocol treatment even if they have had a
             successful vasectomy. Both women and men must both agree to abstain from donating
             blood during study participation and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             protocol treatment
