  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Major depression disorder is a common psychological disease. It is the second-ranked cause of
      disability worldwide. The pathophysiology is not yet understood. The main theory is
      monoaminergic theory based on the effect of monoaminergic drugs. Current treatment includes
      psychotherapy, medication and electroconvulsive therapy. The onset of action for
      antidepressant is often slow, therefore strategies to improve the outcome are important.
      Bright light therapy has been found to be effective in reducing the severity of depression
      not only in seasonal affective disorder but also in other affective disorder. Previous
      meta-analyses of light therapy for non-seasonal major depression, however, has yielded
      conflicting evidence for efficacy.

      Purpose:

        1. To investigate possible imaging biomarkers of major depression disorder

        2. To evaluate the effect of light therapy on depression

      Materials and Methods:

      This prospective study will recruit 100 patients, randomized into 2 study groups: (1)
      antidepressant plus treatment light, and (2) antidepressant plus placebo light. All patients
      will accept a thorough psychological evaluation (including Hamilton Depression Rating Scale,
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Severity and Patient
      Health Questionnaire-9 items) at baseline and at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th week during the
      8-week experiment intervention, by a blind assessor. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview (MINI) and Morningness- Eveningness Questionnaire-Self-Assessment Version (MEQ-SA)
      were only evaluated at baseline. Adverse events were evaluated at baseline, 2nd,4th,8th
      weeks. MRI study will be arranged at baseline and in 4-week experiment.

      Predicted Results and Influence:

        1. To evaluate the additional effect of the treatment light on depression disorder

        2. To compare the difference of functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI), structural MRI
           among the two groups and between the patients with and without treatment effect in order
           to detect imaging biomarkers.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRS) at 1,2,4,8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,4,8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.
The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms
1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts
0 to 6 - normal /symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Possible ratings are:
Normal, not at all ill
Borderline mentally ill
Mildly ill
Moderately ill
Markedly ill
Severely ill
