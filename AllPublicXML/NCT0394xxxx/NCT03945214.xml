    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention
      and/or a healthy eating intervention in a sample of UCSF employees with overweight and
      obesity (BMI&gt;=25kg/m2) who report mild to moderate stress. We will randomize UCSF employees
      to 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available
      application, Headspace), a healthy eating intervention, a digital meditation+healthy eating
      intervention, or a waitlist control condition.

      The aim of the present study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention
      and/or a healthy eating intervention in a sample of UCSF employees with overweight and
      obesity (BMI&gt;=25kg/m2) who report mild to moderate stress. We will randomize UCSF employees
      to 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available
      application, Headspace), a healthy eating intervention, a digital meditation+healthy eating
      intervention, or a waitlist control condition.

      Participants assigned to the digital meditation intervention group will be asked to download
      and use the Headspace mobile application for at least 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks.
      Participants assigned to the healthy eating intervention group will be asked to participate
      in a 50 minute motivational interviewing counseling session centered around healthy eating
      behaviors , three 10-minute booster phone calls at weeks 1, 4, and 8, and weekly
      participation in a digital mindful eating activity.

      All study participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline, week 4, week 8
      (post-intervention), and a 4-month follow-up period. Among participants who are randomized to
      the digital meditation intervention, they will also take part in a 1-year follow-up
      assessment. Physiological assessments (body composition, blood spot) will be obtained at an
      in-person clinic visit at baseline and week 8. Fitness, sleep, and mood data will be gathered
      for seven consecutive days at baseline and week 8.

      Prior to randomization, participants will go through an eligibility screening and complete
      the baseline questionnaire battery. Adherence in the digital meditation intervention will be
      tracked remotely. The goal is to recruit as many as 150 participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived stress score, as determined by the total score on the Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale has a total score scale range of 0 to 40, with higher values indicating more perceived stress</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in food action and acceptance and action questionnaire (FAAQ), as determined by the summary score on the FAAQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Acceptance and Action Questionnaire has a total score scale range of 10 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater acceptance of motivations to eat.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in job strain, as determined by Siegrist Job Strain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The job strain measure is comprised of two sub scales, effort (5 items) and reward (11 items), each ranging from 1 to 4. The job strain score is calculated as the ratio of demand to reward, with a higher ratio reflecting more job strain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective mindfulness, as determined by total score on the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale is a 15-item measure with each item ranging from a score of 1 to 6. To score the scale, we compute the average score across items, with a higher score reflecting higher levels of mindfulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the intentional use of palatable food to cope with negative feelings, as determined by total score on the Palatable Eating Motives, Coping Subscale (PEMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Palatable Eating Motives, Coping Subscale is a 4-item measure, with each item ranging from 1 (almost never/never) to 5 (almost always/always). A total coping sub scale score is determined by an average of the 4 items. Higher scores reflect greater use of palatable food to cope with negative emotions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in food cravings, as determined by total score on the trait food craving questionnaire, reduced (FCQ-T-r)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Trait Food Craving Questionnaire, reduced, is a 15-item measure of behavioral, cognitive, and physical aspects of cravings for different types of food. Item response choices range from 0 (never) to 5 (always), and the total score is an average of the 15 items. Higher scores reflect greater cravings to eat densely caloric snack.</description>
