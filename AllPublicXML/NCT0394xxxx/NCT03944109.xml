  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled phaseⅠb/Ⅱclinical study. Totally 108
      subjects are planned to enrolled with 36 subjects in three low-dose groups (group 1, group 2
      and group 3) and 72 subjects in three high-dose groups (group 4, group 5, and group 6).12
      subjects with hyperlipidemia who received statin stable treatment for more than 28 days are
      enrolled in each low-dose group, randomly given SHR-1209 or placebo treatment at a ratio of
      5:1. 24 subjects with hyperlipidemia who received statin stable treatment for more than 28
      days are enrolled in each high-dose group, randomly given SHR-1209 or placebo treatment at a
      ratio of 5:1. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and efficacy of multiple subcutaneous injections of SHR-1209 in hyperlipidemia subjects
      treated with stabilized dose of statin. Groups detail as follows:

        1. SHR-1209 dose 1 /placebo frequence 1

        2. SHR-1209 dose 2 /placebo frequence 2

        3. SHR-1209 dose 3 /placebo frequence 3

        4. SHR-1209 dose 4 /placebo frequence 1

        5. SHR-1209 dose 5 /placebo frequence 2

        6. SHR-1209 dose 6 /placebo frequence 3
