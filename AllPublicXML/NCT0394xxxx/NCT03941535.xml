  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Vitamin K in treating bleeding diatheses is well documented and accepted as
      standard of care, as is the effect of Vitamin K on calcium and bone metabolism. In the
      treatment of larger burns however, there is a paucity of available literature related to
      optimal daily dosing, goals of therapy and potential complications. This study aims to
      identify any potential issues arising from the administration of a standard of care dose in
      an historical cohort of subjects with larger burns to a prospective patient population given
      a decreasing dose during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

      This will be a prospective, single-center study. Eligible subjects will present with a
      minimum 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burn injury and expected to receive the standard
      dose of intravenous Vitamin K (10mg/day). Exclusion criteria will include any patient
      admitted with a history of, or having present at baseline: bleeding disorders,
      thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, or liver dysfunction (MELD Score ≥20). Subjects who are
      moribund, or in the opinion of the investigator, not expected to survive will be excluded, as
      well as burns induced as a result of a suicide attempt.

      The study will enroll approximately 25 subjects in the prospective arm and 25 subjects will
      be matched from our medical record data base to the basic subject criteria for the chart
      review portion of the study. Study duration will be 90 days.

      The research foundation will request exemption, waiver of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability
      and Accountability Act) authorization and waiver of informed consent for the data collection
      /cohort portion of the study as only burn injury demographics, lab results and dosing regimen
      will be collected. No protected health information (PHI) will be recorded on patients
      identified for the cohort arm of the study.

        Historical Cohort Inclusion/Exclusion All criteria will be the same except there will be no
        informed consent requirement. The data collection portion in the historical cohort will be
        to match burn size, type and etiologies and to collect lab results and other outcomes as
        specified in the study objectives. No PHI will be collected or shared. Additionally, only
        patients that received intravenous Vitamin K 10m/day for at least 14 days will be chosen
        for data collection. Every attempt will be made to match study drug duration (90days) as
        closely as possible.
