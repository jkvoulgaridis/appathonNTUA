  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two programmes have been built to prevent suicidal ideation; one focuses on stress management
      based on cognitive and behavioural principles and the other on health promotion.

      The main objective will be assessing their respective effectiveness on suicidal ideation (at
      least one occurrence over a 12-month period after the end of the intervention), through a
      randomized controlled trial, in medical students and interns.

    <intervention_model_description>An open three-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of two programmes of suicide prevention in fourth-year medical students and first-year interns; one based on stress management using cognitive and behavioural principles and the other on health promotion. Their respective effectiveness will be compared with a control condition. Participants will be assessed using validated questionnaires online at inclusion (before intervention) and at 6 (end of the intervention), 12, and 18 months.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal ideation observed at least at one of the three assessment contacts (6, 12, 18 months).</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (e-CSSRS) will be used to investigate suicide ideation &amp; behaviors.
Questionnaire was developped with NIMH support to screen &amp; quantify suicide risk using consecutive questions. No score is computed when using this scale.
Questionnaire investigates suicide ideation using several questions (response yes/no):
Have you wish you were dead?
Have you actually had any thought of killing yourself? If 1 and/or 2 are answered &quot;yes&quot;, 4 other questions are asked. For this study, suicide ideation will be considered as a &quot;yes&quot; answered to question 1 or 2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal behaviour identified at least once after the intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (e-CSSRS) will be used to investigate suicide ideation and behaviors.
This questionnaire was developped with NIMH support to screen and quantify suicide risk using consecutive questions. No score is computed when using this scale.
The questionnaire investigates also suicide behaviours using questions (response yes/no) on
actual attempt (have you made a suicide attempt? Have you done anything to harm yourself? have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?)
interrupted attempt
aborted or self-interrupted attempt
preparatory acts or behavior
For the present study, suicide behavior will be considered as a &quot;yes&quot; to any of these 4 questions.</description>
