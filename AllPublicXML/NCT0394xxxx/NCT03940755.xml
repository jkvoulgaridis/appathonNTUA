      The goal of this study is to assess the Long-term Outcomes of Critical Illness
      Survivors,including physical, psychological, and cognitive sequelae.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of patients survive critical illness; however, the evidence reveals that
      over the same period the number of patients being sent to rehabilitation settings have
      tripled . For those who do survive, the latest data indicate that 50-70% of ICU &quot;survivors&quot;
      will suffer cognitive impairment and 60-80% of &quot;survivors&quot; will suffer functional impairment
      or ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW).Still,there is a lack valid data on the long-term impact on
      morbidity from prospective observational studies. Therefore, the investigators designed an
      observational cohort which cover a broader range of outcomes to quantify long-term physical,
      psychological, and cognitive impairment after intensive care unit (ICU).Intensive Care Unit
      patients survive from critical illness will be approached for study recruitment and
      participation.Survival rate,Quality of life,Cognitive impairments,Depression and
      anxiety,PTSD,Physical activity,Neuromuscular impairment will be assessed 3 or 6 months after
      ICU discharge.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of life quality</measure>
    <time_frame>3 or 6 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life assessed with help of The 36-item short from health survey(SF-36)questionnaire.The SF-36 has 8 scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0-100. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability.The 8 sections are listed below:PF：Physical Functioning,RP：Role-Physical,BP：Bodily Pain,GH:General Health,VT：Vitality,SF：Social Functioning,RE：Role-Emotional,MH：Mental Health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment in Physical dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 or 6 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disabilities assessed with help of Barthel index of ADL(activities of daily living).10 variables are addressed. Range of summed total score: 0-100. higher values represent better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment in depression and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>3 or 6 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Depression and anxiety assessed with help of The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS).For Depression(D), 7 questions in total. Range of score for each question: 0-3. Total score summed: 0-21 ;For Anxiety(A): 7 questions in total. Range of score for each question: 0-3. Total score summed: 0-21 .For both D and A scales, higher scores represent worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment in PTSD</measure>
    <time_frame>3 or 6 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Post-traumatic stress syndrome assessed with help of trauma screening questionnaire(TSQ).There are 10 questions in the TSQ. For each question, the answer is either YES or NO. More YES = worse outcome. At least 6 YES represents PTSD diagnosis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment in Cognitive impairments</measure>
    <time_frame>3 or 6 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive impairments assessed with help of mini-mental state examination(MMSE).The MMSE has 5 scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. The 5 sections and their range of score are listed below:Orientation 0-10;Registration 0-3;Attention and calculation 0-5;Recall 0-3;Language 0-9.Total score range from 0-30. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability.</description>
