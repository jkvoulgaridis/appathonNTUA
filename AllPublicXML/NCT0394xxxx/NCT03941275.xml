      This study is designed to collect high-quality shoulder and intracardiac bi-plane
      fluoroscopic images during two standard arm motions on patients implanted with a market
      released SelectSecure 3830 lead for the purposes of developing a fracture reliability model.

    <measure>Collect high quality shoulder and intracardiac bi-plane fluoroscopic cine images of the SelectSecure 3830 pacing lead.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Fluoroscopic cine images will be collected in conjunction with a specialized calibration object. When imaging data is processed and analyzed it will characterize the time-varying lead shape changes.</description>

    <measure>Acquire accelerometer-based motion data</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>During fluoroscopy of the two standard arm motions, accelerometer-based motion data will be collected which will allow matching of arm position with lead shape based on the fluoroscopic images.</description>

             of birth control

          -  Subjects that were implanted with a pacing, ICD, CRT device and/or cardiac leads less
             than three months ago
