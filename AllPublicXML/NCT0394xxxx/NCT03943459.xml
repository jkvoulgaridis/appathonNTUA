  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Higher consumption of fruits and vegetables promote greater availability of phenolic
      compounds and these compounds were associated with vascular health. Quercetin, a phenolic
      compound, is the most abundant natural antioxidant belonging to the group of flavonoids.
      Quercetin improved lipoprotein metabolism, had antioxidant capacity, produced vasodilating
      substances in the vascular endothelium and reduced platelet aggregability. Likewise, statins
      are medications known to reduce cardiovascular events in women with coronary disease by
      reducing serum LDL-cholesterol. Therefore, a number of metabolic pathways are responsible for
      vascular health. The serum concentration and gene expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and RAGE
      soluble (sRAGE) are directly associated with vascular protection. This study will analyse the
      influence of atorvastatin and quercetin on serum concentrations and gene expression of Sirt1
      and sRAGE in postmenopausal women with stable coronary artery disease.

      Higher consumption of fruits and vegetables promote greater availability of phenolic

      compound, is the most abundant natural antioxidant belonging to the group of flavonoids.
      Quercetin improved lipoprotein metabolism, had antioxidant capacity, produced vasodilating
      substances in the vascular endothelium and reduced platelet aggregability. Likewise, statins
      are medications known to reduce cardiovascular events in women with coronary artery disease
      (CAD) by reducing serum LDL-cholesterol. Therefore, a number of metabolic pathways are
      responsible for vascular health. The serum concentration and gene expression of sirtuin 1
      (Sirt1) and RAGE soluble (sRAGE) are directly associated with vascular protection. This study
      will analyse the influence of atorvastatin and quercetin on serum concentrations and gene
      expression of Sirt1 and sRAGE in postmenopausal women with stable coronary artery disease and
      also the correlation between the changes in serum concentration of Sirt1 and sRAGE and the
      changes in lipid profile, inflammatory biomarkers and sex hormones in response to these
      drugs. This is a 60-day randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 60
      postmenopausal women with CAD, divided into three groups with 20 women each: Group 1 -
      Quercetin (500 mg / day); Group 2 - atorvastatin (80 mg / day): Group 3 - control.
