  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster headache is a primary headache condition characterized by clusters of one-sided,
      high-intensity pain attacks. The headache may be episodic or chronic. Treatment options are
      limited and their effects unsatisfactory. An important nerve pathway involved in the pain
      attacks has a switching station at the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) located in the depth of
      the facial bones. SPG is a known therapy target for cluster headache. The area can be
      identified on CT images, but is difficult to access due to its location. Thus, the Multiguide
      navigation system has been developed to enable precise delivery of the drugs that target SPG
      activity. In Trondheim, two phase 1 / Phase 2 study have been carried out using botulinum
      toxin A (Botox®) against SPG in patient with chronic cluster headache and chronic migraine.
      The results indicate that such a treatment strategy is safe and beneficial. The current study
      is a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded study to investigate whether precise
      single-injection of botulinum toxin A reduces the frequency of attacks in chronic cluster
      headache .
