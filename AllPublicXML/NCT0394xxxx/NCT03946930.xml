  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is lack of information on the risk factors of accelerated cognitive decline in older
      people with Alzheimer disease (AD). The extent of neurodegeneration and white matter disease
      has been reported to be important factors. In addition there may be biomarkers e.g.
      inflammatory cytokines that can contribute to cognitive decline. The impact of care
      arrangement and physical activity may also be important. Insulin signaling is impaired in
      Alzheimer disease (AD). Insulin and Insulin growth factor (IGF) pathways are closely related.
      IGF in the brain is in turn modulated especially by IGF binding protein -2. Higher plasma IGF
      binding protein -2 was associated with brain atrophy in older people.

      We therefore propose to perform a cohort study to test the hypothesis that higher plasma IGF
      binding protein-2 is independently associated with greater cognitive decline in older people
      with AD. This will be based on an on-going AD registry which was designed to identify genetic
      biomarkers for AD. Detailed neurocognitive tests and lifestyle information are available. In
      addition, volumetric MRI brain scans were performed in all AD subjects. The hypothesis is
      that MRI brain volumes, serum biomarkers, physical activity, physical functioning are
      independently associated with cognitive decline in older people with AD. The objective is to
      identify risk factors of accelerated cognitive decline so that preventive measures can be
      designed to delay dependency in AD.
