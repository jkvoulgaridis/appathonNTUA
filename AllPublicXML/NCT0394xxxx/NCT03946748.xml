  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a reduction in intravascular hemolysis
      by REGN3918 over 26 weeks of treatment in patients with active PNH who are treatment-naive to
      complement inhibitor therapy or have not recently received complement inhibitor therapy.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN3918.

        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN3918 on parameters of intravascular hemolysis

        -  To assess the concentrations of total REGN3918 in serum.

        -  To evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies to REGN3918 over
           time

        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN3918 on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measuring fatigue
           and health-related quality of life

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-F is a 13-item, self-reported PRO measure assessing an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. This questionnaire is part of the FACIT measurement system, a compilation of questions measuring health-related QoL in patients with cancer and other chronic illnesses. The FACIT-fatigue assesses the level of fatigue using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 26</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-reported, 30-item generic questionnaire developed to assess 15 domains: global health status scale, five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning) and nine symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties). All the scales range from 0 to 100. A high score on the functional scales represents a high level of functioning, and a high score on the symptom scales represents a high level of symptomatology. A high score on the global QOL represents a high general quality of life.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a self-administered standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It is a health questionnaire that consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems.</description>

          -  History of bone marrow transplantation
