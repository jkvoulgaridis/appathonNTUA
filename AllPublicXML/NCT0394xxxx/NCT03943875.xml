  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating whether 15-26 year old males and females need a 3rd dose of the human
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, or whether 2 doses provide similar protection as 3 doses from
      the 9 types of HPV that it protects against.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying an amended dosing regimen of an approved drug (Gardasil 9) in
      the population for which it is approved (vaccine is approved for ages 9-45 years and
      participants in this study will be 15-26 years of age.) The purpose of the study is to
      examine a delayed dosing schedule. The current recommendation is to administer the vaccine in
      3 doses (administered at 0, 1-2 months and 6 months) to those 15-26 years of age but only 2
      doses (0 and 6 months) if given at 9-14 years of age. The investigators will conduct a
      randomized study to determine if 2 doses will elicit an immune response similar to the
      standard 3 doses in those 15-26 years of age. Participants in the study group will receive 2
      doses of Gardasil 9 at 0 and 6 months. Participants in the control group will receive 3 doses
      of Gardasil 9 at 0, 1-2 months and 6 months. All participants (Target Accrual n=512) will
      have 5 mLs of blood drawn at 0, 7, and 12 months. Following the 12 month blood draw,
      participants randomized to 2-doses will receive the 3rd dose. Potential participants will be
      recruited in the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) clinics where providers have given
      the PI permission to directly contact patients. The investigators will also display signs and
      use email announcements at UTMB and other college campuses and will advertise the study
      online or by mail. The investigators will call UTMB patients if their provider gave
      permission to contact the patient, or if the patients gave prior consent to contact through
      the UTMB system. Potential participants (and their parents, if under 18 years of age) will be
      screened with inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible and interested parents and patients will
      sign informed written consent. Patients under 18 years of age will sign written assent. At
      the initial visit, eligible, consented participants will have their blood drawn, be
      randomized into either the study or control group, and receive a dose of the HPV vaccine.
      Participants will be re-screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria at subsequent
      visits. All participants will receive compensation administered through a ClinCard following
      each of the 3 blood draws.

             female subjects will be required to take a urine pregnancy test before each Gardasil 9
             dose. Any subjects with positive tests will be disqualified from the study and advised
             to seek prenatal care.

          2. History of 6 or more lifetime sexual partners.

          3. History of any immunodeficiencies (HIV+, chemotherapy treatment, status splenectomy)
             or autoimmune disorders (lupus, thyroid disorder, psoriasis).

          4. History of bleeding or platelet disorders such as hemophilia.

          5. Currently taking medication which can suppress immune function including systemic
             corticosteroids, radiation therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate,
             cyclosporine, leflunomid, TNF-alpha antagonists, monoclonal antibody therapies, or
             intravenous immunoglobulin treatment.

          6. Known allergies to any components of the vaccine, including aluminum, yeast or
             Benzonase.

          7. Febrile at ≥100°F in the 24 hours prior to vaccination. This will be reviewed before
             each Gardasil 9 dose.

          8. Received any non-study inactive vaccines within the past 14 days or any live vaccines
             within the past 30 days. Those excluded for this reason will be re-screened under the
             same study number at a later date.

          9. Plan to move out of the Galveston/Houston area in the 13 months following study entry.
