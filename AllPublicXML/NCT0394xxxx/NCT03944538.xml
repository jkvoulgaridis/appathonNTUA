  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular comorbidities, such as high cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes,
      are common among people with multiple sclerosis (MS), and can negatively impact disease
      diagnosis, treatment, and progression. Physical inactivity may be one possible reason for
      this increased risk and may occur through changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (the ability
      of the body to transport and use oxygen during sustained physical activity). While exercise
      training is effective for improving fitness, factors such as accessibility to facilities and
      financial cost may not make it a viable option for most people with MS. An alternative
      approach for improving fitness is by increasing daily physical activity levels. The research
      team has developed and tested an Internet-delivered lifestyle physical activity intervention
      that has been shown to improve physical activity levels among people with MS. This lifestyle
      intervention is a promising approach for also increasing fitness and managing vascular
      comorbidity risk in persons with MS. This randomized clinical trial will examine the efficacy
      of a 6-month lifestyle physical activity intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness and
      vascular comorbidity risk in persons with MS.

    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale is a standard neurological examination for persons with MS. The scale is used to assess neurological function within eight functional systems: pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other. The total score generated for each participant ranges between 0 (normal neurological function) to 10 (death due to MS).</description>

    <description>The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire includes three items that measure the frequency of vigorous, moderate, and light physical activities that occur for at least 15 minutes during one's leisure-time over the previous 7 days. The three items are weighted and then summed into a total score that can range between 0 (low active) to 119 (high active).</description>

    <description>The primary content of the website will be delivered through interactive video courses. The courses will be released seven times during the first two months, four times during the second two months, and twice during the final two months of the intervention.
The website Tracker feature will allow for tracking of daily step counts as well as setting goals and monitoring progress.
The one-on-one video chats will be conducted face to face through Zoom and will be semi-scripted. The chats will consist of an ongoing review of goal-setting and progress toward goal attainment through Tracker as well as discussion of strategies and facilitators of behavioral changes based on social cognitive theory and current website content. The chats will occur at the same frequency as the video course release. For the second 6 months of the study, participants will be asked to maintain their usual activities.</description>

    <description>The general wellness condition will focus on self-managing MS through means other than physical activity. The materials are transformations of brochures provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The delivery of the Internet materials and chat sessions will occur on the same schedule and frequency as the intervention condition, and will have a comparable time commitment. This condition will account for attention and social contact as well as other possible biases such as initial reactivity and time spent on the website and video chats. For the second 6 months of the study, participants will be asked to maintain their usual activities.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of two primary components: a dedicated Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach via Zoom. The intervention focuses on the skills, techniques, resources and strategies for becoming and staying physically active with MS, but does not provide a prescription for exercise or physical activity itself.</description>
