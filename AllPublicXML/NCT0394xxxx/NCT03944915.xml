      This study is looking to see if nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug, given with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel (2 chemotherapy agents) during induction therapy in advanced stage HPV negative
      patients can significantly shrink the subject's cancer.

             (i.e. with steroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy e.g.
             levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid doses for adrenal or pituitary
