  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will focus on the use of EDDY tips, because it is known that the complete
      debridement of the canal is very difficult, which leads to an accumulation of tissue debris,
      bacteria and their products, resulting in persistent periradicular inflammation. So, it's of
      great importance, the study of other approaches of cleaning and disinfecting the root canal,
      which at the same time, may produce a lower risk of postoperative pain.

      The above mentioned topics have never been analysed simultaneously with the use of EDDY tips,
      and the evaluation of the postoperative pain was never addressed.

      This research is of great clinical interest, due to the complexity of root canal system, with
      isthmuses, ramifications and dentinal tubules, that make the total elimination of bacteria
      impossible, even with the best clinical protocols, because the irrigants cannot penetrate the
      dentinal tubules, and the postoperative pain is an exhausting factor for patients.

      Therefore, a new protocol, with better disinfection rate and less postoperative pain, will be
      able to increase the success rate of endodontic treatments, allowing to save condemned teeth.

      CLINICAL STUDY:

      1. Rate of postoperative pain of 2 endodontic disinfection protocols.

      -A clinical study will be carried out, in patients that attend the Faculdade de Medicina
      Dentária Dental Clinic at Universidade do Porto, for initial nonsurgical root canal
      treatments. About 80 single-rooted and premolar teeth with mature, fully formed apices and
      diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis will be selected.

      Patients will be excluded if they were &lt;12 years of age; pregnant; had an indication for
      antibiotic prophylaxis; uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus; chronic renal
      failure; hematologic diseases; HIV; osteoporosis treated with bisphosphonates; steroid
      therapy &gt;5mg/day of prednisolone and prior to head and neck irradiation therapy. We will also
      exclude teeth with abnormal root canal anatomy, with more than 26mm in length and with
      advanced periodontal disease. Those patients will be divided in 2 groups: Group 1: (control
      group) 5,25% NaOCl with syringe needle irrigation alone. Group 2: 5,25% NaOCl with syringe
      needle irrigation, activated with sonic system EDDY (VDW, Munich, Germany)

      All the patients will receive anaesthetic solution and after anaesthesia, each tooth will be
      isolated using rubber dam and the access cavity will be made.

      The glide path will be determined using stainless steel hand files, confirmed by periapical
      radiographs. The root canals will be instrumented, confirming the apical patency with a size
      15 K-file, and then the instrumentation sequence. The apical patency will be maintained
      throughout the shaping procedure using #10 k-file between each instrument.

        -  All the canals will be irrigated continuously with 5,25% NaOCl during the
           instrumentation, with a conventional endodontic syringe with 27 gauge needle. In group 1
           (control group), a final irrigation will be made with 1.5 ml of NaOCl per canal, during
           30 seconds in an up-and-down motion, with the needle 1 mm short of the working length,
           without binding. After this, a 30 seconds pause will be done. This step will be repeated
           once again. In group 2, a final irrigation will be made with 1.5 ml of NaOCl per canal
           and the irrigant will be activated using EDDY tips, 1 mm short of the working length
           without binding. The activation will be performed during 30 seconds, followed by a 30
           seconds pause, and the cycle will be repeated once again, according to manufacture
           instructions.

        -  After the final irrigation protocol, all the canals will be dried and sterile cotton
           pellets will be placed in the pulp chamber with a provisional restoration. No intracanal
           medicament will be placed. The obturation will be executed in the following appointment.

    <description>All patients will receive a paper with a visual analogue scale, to score their pain from 0 to 10. None of the patients will have analgesics prescribed immediately after the treatment. They will be advised to not take any medication at any point of the follow-up. If they need some advice or analgesic medication, they will be able to contact with the investigator.
The investigator will reach the patients after 8, 24 and 48 h, in order to ask their pain intensity and to ask if they need to take any analgesic to stop the pain. In case of any patient mentioning an important pain, it will be advised to take Ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours, until the pain disappears. If any patient is allergic to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, they will be advised to take paracetamol 1g and not take more than 4g per day. All the controls will be recorded on each patient's chart.</description>
