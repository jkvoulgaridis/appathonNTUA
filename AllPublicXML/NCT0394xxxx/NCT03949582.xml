  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet is the cornerstone treatment to manage blood sugar in people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).
      Fibres like guar gum and protein are macronutrients that have an effect in blood sugar
      levels. Mycoprotein is a fungi-based food high in both dietary fibre and protein shown to
      have a role in regulating blood sugar levels in healthy. However, little is known about the
      effects of mycoprotein on blood sugar levels in people with T2D. We are interested in South
      Asian because they have a different blood sugar response to the same food than a Caucasian.

      The main aims of the study is to assess:

        -  The effect of mycoprotein in different formats (soup or mince) in blood sugar levels and
           appetite in South Asian and Caucasian with Type 2 Diabetes.

        -  The effect of the combination of mycoprotein with guar gum in different formats (soup or
           mince) in blood sugar levels and appetite in South Asian and Caucasian with T2D.

      This is a double-blind crossover RCT. A total of 48 participants (24 Caucasian and 24 South
      Asian) with T2D and non insulin treated will be recruited. Participant will be randomly
      allocated to one of these two groups:

      Group 1: Test food in form of soup and Group 2: Test food in form of mince. Once allocated in
      one of the groups, participant will consume in a random order 6 different test foods (soy,
      chicken, mycoprotein with and without guar gum) in a determined format (either as in soup or
      mince).

Questions assessed are:

&quot;how strong is your desire to eat?&quot;
&quot;how much food do you think you could eat?&quot;
&quot;how full do you feel?&quot;

For questions 1 to 4 the desirable outcome considered as &quot;good result&quot; for the test food mycoprotein are values less than 30 milimetres, and for questions 5 and 6, values above 60 milimetres.</description>
