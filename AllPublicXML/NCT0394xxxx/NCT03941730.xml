    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well estradiol works in treating patients with estrogen
      receptor beta (ER beta) positive, triple negative breast cancer that has spread to nearby
      tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Hormone
      receptors like ER beta allow the body to respond appropriately to hormones. Triple negative
      means that the breast cancer does not express other hormone receptors called ER alpha,
      progesterone, and HER2. In some people with triple negative breast cancer, ER beta is
      overexpressed. Tumor cells that overexpress ER beta grow slower in the laboratory and this
      growth is slowed in the presence of estrogen. Estradiol is a form of estrogen. This study may
      help doctors determine whether tumor cells that overexpress ER beta shrink in the presence of
      estradiol.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity of estradiol in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that expresses ERbeta (&gt; 25% moderate or
      strong nuclear staining) and who have prior receipt of taxane and anthracycline based
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the safety profile of estradiol when administered at a dose of 2 mg three times
      daily (tid) to women with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC that expresses ERbeta.

      II. To examine the changes in phosphorylated (phospho)-ERbeta, cystatins 1, 2, 4 and 5,
      phospho-Smad2/3 and Ki-67 in tumor biopsies taken before and after the first cycle of
      treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine changes in plasma estradiol, serum cytokine and cystatin levels before/after 1
      cycle of estradiol.

      II. Analyze the global gene expression profiles of paired biopsies prior to and following 1
      cycle of therapy.

      III. To develop patient derived xenografts (PDX) that are ERalpha negative, HER2 negative and
      ERbeta positive (Mayo only).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive estradiol orally (PO) TID for days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years from study
      registration.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. All grade 2, 3, 4 or 5 adverse events will be documented and assigned an attribute by treating clinician as to its relationship to treatment. For a given AE, the proportion of patients who report developing a grade 2-5 of this AE are determined. The number of dose reductions per patient and the reasons for the dose reduction are summarized.</description>

    <description>The tumor response rate is defined as the 100% time the number of patients with a CR or PR (as defined by the RECIST criteria) on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart divided by the total number of eligible patients who began study treatment. A 90% binomial confidence interval is constructed for the true response rate.</description>

    <description>Patients undergo tumor biopsies prior to the start of treatment and at completion of cycle 1 treatment. These specimens will be undergoing immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with the following antibodies: phosphorylated (phospho)-ERbeta, cystatins 1, 2, 4 and 5, phospho-Smad2/3 and Ki-67. For each of these biomarkers, a times series plot are constructed so that an individual patient's data will be represented using the same color for each of the five graphs.
