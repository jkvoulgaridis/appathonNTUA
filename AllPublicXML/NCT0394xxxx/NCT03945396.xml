  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of a multidisciplinary intervention (diet, exercise,
      motivational support and homeopathy or placebo) for overweight and obesity in Mexican
      adolescents. Half of study participants will receive the multidisciplinary intervention plus
      Calcarea carbonica ostrearum, a homeopathic medicine, while the other half will receive the
      same multidisciplinary intervention plus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity in children and adolescents are a major public health issue in Mexico.
      Whilst many factors (genetic, cultural, socioeconomic and environmental) contribute to
      develop obesity during childhood, a multidisciplinary intervention (nutritional, behavioral
      and exercise) is the best approach to improve weight loss. In Mexico, the use of homeopathy
      for obesity is widespread. Although there are some homeopathic medicines used for obese
      individuals, there is a lack of well-designed clinical trials to demonstrate its efficacy in
      weight loss. Calcarea carbonica ostrearum is a homeopathic mineral medicine. Previously, it
      has been demonstrated that Calcarea carbonica has an effect in reducing the percentage of fat
      in adolescents.

      Therefore, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, superiority trial with a
      3 month study duration, will be conducted to prove the efficacy and safety of Calcarea
      carbonica ostrearum in reducing weight, body mass index (BMI) and fat percentage, as well as,
      to prove its effect on the lipid profile, fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and
      insulin.

    <description>Exercise program: includes a five-times per week routine: warm-up during 10 to 15 minutes, then 40 minutes of aerobic exercise that will be increased progressively until reaching 60 minutes. Thereafter, muscular strength initiating 5%, and increasing until 10 to 15% of body weight. Then, 10 to 15 minutes of stretching. Finally, 5 min cool-down.
Diet: Subjects will receive a balance diet calculated based on energetic needs according FAO: 15-20% of proteins, 50-60% of carbohydrate, 20-25% of fat per day.
Motivational support: 50 min session where empathy and neutral understanding of the perspective and feelings of the adolescent, and his family, are fostered to motivate the change and to state realistic goals in reducing weight.</description>
