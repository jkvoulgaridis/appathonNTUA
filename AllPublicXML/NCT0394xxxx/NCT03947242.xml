      This study is a single-arm, prospective, open label clinical study for evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus Vinorelbine given as
      neoadjuvant treatment in Trastuzumab-refractory HER2 positive early stage or locally advanced
      breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and is used
      to reduce tumors to make them operable, and to increase breast-conserving rates. In recent
      years, the anti-HER2 treatment mode, which is double-blocked by a combination of
      dual-targeted drugs, has obtained clinical approval in adjuvant therapy and neoadjuvant
      therapy. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2
      receptors. Based on previous clinical studies, we designed the study to explore the
      possibility of Pyrotinib in combination with Trastuzumab plus Vinorelbine given as
      neoadjuvant treatment in HER2 positive early stage or locally advanced breast cancer.
