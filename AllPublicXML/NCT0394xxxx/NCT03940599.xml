      Investigating the impact of self-monitoring feedback for health behaviors

      Obesity is highly prevalent in Samoa, where a 2010 study estimated that 64.6% of adult
      females were obese, according to Polynesian BMI cut offs (BMI â‰¥32.0 kg/m2).1,2 Interventions
      designed to increase physical activity or facilitate weight loss often include a
      self-monitoring component, but these intervention programs have not yet been tested in the
      Samoan setting. The goal of this project is to pilot test such an approach.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To investigate the acceptability and feasibility of self-monitoring of physical activity
           and weight through the introduction of step counting devices (FitBit Zips) and scales
           (BodyTrace).

        2. To measure any changes that occur in participants' health, health behaviors related to
           diet and physical activity, or conceptions of health (including self-efficacy and
           perceptions of weight) over the study period.

    <description>This visit will take place on the same day as recruitment, after participants have completed the Village-Based Screening. Eligible participants will be flagged based on their responses to the screening questionnaire, at which point they will be informed of this additional project, complete an eligibility questionnaire, and, if interested in participating, give informed consent. At this baseline visit, they will receive a FitBit Zip with the screen covered so that they are not able to see any of the recorded information. The screen will be sealed such that the researcher will know if the participant has broken through to check the screen. Contact information will also be collected and a visit scheduled for one week later.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight measure - randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will then complete a one week run in period to establish their baseline physical activity as measured by the FitBit. Participants will not be informed of their measured physical activity for this week and the screen will remain covered so that they are not receiving feedback from the device. After this period, the first home visit will take place. All participants will complete additional questionnaires at this time that will include information about their current health behaviors, their conceptions of their health (including their self-reported health status, self efficacy, health locus of control, and body image), and an estimate of their weight and perceived weight category (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The next visit will occur two weeks later, at the midpoint of the four week follow up period with the self-monitoring devices. This visit will not involve any further questionnaires and will occur for the purpose of syncing physical activity data from the FitBit, which only stores physical activity data for 23 total days.</description>

    <measure>Weight measure final</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The final visit will occur two weeks later, after the full four weeks of follow up with the devices. This visit occurs at week 5 of the study, including the one week run in period. At this point participants will repeat all of the questionnaires that they previously completed, as well as having their height and weight measured again. They will also complete added questions related to changes in their health behaviors over the past month of the follow up period. All participants will also complete a semi structured, qualitative interview to capture their experience of using the self-monitoring devices. These interviews are optional. The interview will include questions about what they did or did not like about the devices, how they felt about the feedback they were receiving, and how it may have influenced their thinking and behaviors. In addition, they will keep the device.</description>
