  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sufficient physical activity and a good cardiorespiratory fitness level (CRF) are central in
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. However, many people remain inactive, partly
      because current exercise recommendations fail to address important barriers to exercise. A
      novel exercise protocol has previously been developed called 'reduced-exertion high-intensity
      interval training' (REHIT), which can remove several common perceived barriers to exercise.
      REHIT 1) improves CRF and other key CVD risk factors, 2) is genuinely time-efficient (total
      time-commitment of just 2x10 min per week), 3) is well-tolerated, manageable, and not
      associated with negative affective responses, and 4) can be done in the workplace, in
      work-clothes and without a need to shower afterwards. To date, this intervention has only
      been investigated in a lab-setting. Therefore, in the present randomised controlled trial,
      the 'real-world' effectiveness of REHIT in improving maximal aerobic capacity (V̇O2max; a key
      risk factors of CVD) will be investigated in a workplace setting. Participants' attitudes and
      psychological responses to REHIT will be assessed to evaluate the likelihood of successful
      implementation. In 2 study centres, a total of up to n=50 physically inactive male and female
      office workers will be recruited to perform 6 weeks of unsupervised, computer-guided,
      office-based REHIT (n=25) or act as a control (n=25).

    <measure>Change in motivation for exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 days after the 6-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to exercise as assessed using the RM 4-FM questionnaire, a 16-item questionnaire assessing reasons for trying to be physically active on a scale from 1 ('not at all true') to 7 ('very true'). Higher scores indicate a greater motivation for performing exercise. Scores are added to get an overall score, with higher overall scores indicating greater intrinsic motivation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health status</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 days after the 6-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health status as assessed using the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF36), which is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 days after the 6-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress as assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire, which measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The 10-item questionnaire ask for the frequency of stressful events in the last month, scored on a scale from 0 ('never') to 4 ('very often'). The sum score is taken, with higher scores indicating more perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Intervention acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after the 6-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention acceptability as assessed using a questionnaire published by Boereboom et al (2016). This 11-item questionnaire asks how strongly participants agree with statements on the acceptability of the exercise intervention on a scale from 1 ('strongly disagree') to 5 ('strongly agree').</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the intervention group will be asked to perform 2 exercise sessions per week for 6 weeks. Each session will involve 10 min of low-intensity cycling (25 W) interspersed with two 20-s 'all-out' cycle sprints against a resistance equivalent to 5% of body mass. The exercise intervention will be delivered on a commercially available cycle ergometer with software developed by CAR.O.L.</description>
