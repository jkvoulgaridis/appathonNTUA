      This project intends to transplant a clinical level human embryonic stem cells derived
      retinal pigment epithelium into subretinal space to treat eetinitis pigmentosa(RP) diseases.
      Through the statistical analysis EDTRS, BCVA, OCT, ERG, Fluorescein angiography, Ophthalmic
      AB ultrasound changes between before and after the treatment to assess the efficacy and
      safety 0f RPE transplants to treat RP disease.
