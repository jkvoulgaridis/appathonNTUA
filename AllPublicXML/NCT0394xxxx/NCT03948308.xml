  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study &quot;ARIIBO&quot; was conducted to analyze changes in immune parameters reported in
      obese subjects, which had never been the subject of a global study outside of an infectious
      context, and studied in period septic only sporadically. This study was intended to
      contribute to a better understanding of the probably adverse impact of obesity on the immune
      response to bacterial infections, and to describe a specific immunological profile of an
      infectious excess risk in obese subjects.

      In terms of infection, obesity is a risk factor due to &quot;mechanical&quot; and pharmacodynamic
      variations, but also to the immune system. One of the best studied immunological parameters
      in obese patients, leptin resistance, is associated with a decrease in innate and adaptive
      immunity through a modification of the lymphocyte and cytokine profile.

      It is important to compare the data collected in obese patients infected (first study called
      &quot;ARIIBO&quot;), with those of non-obese subjects presenting the same type of infection, which will
      be included in the study &quot;ARIIBACT&quot;
