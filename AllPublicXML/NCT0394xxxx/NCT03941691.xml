    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to verify the safety and effectiveness of the Fully
      Absorbable VSD Occlusion System and VSD Occlusion System produced by Shanghai shape memory
      alloy materials co., LTD. Clinical trials are designed as prospective, multicenter,
      randomized controlled, noninferiority clinical trials. Prospective randomized multicenter
      trial involving about 108 subjects will be enrolled in 4 centers. Patients will be randomized
      to two groups in equal proportion (54 in each). The success rate of occlusion at 6 months
      after operation is the main evaluation index in this clinical trial.

      1. This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized and noninferiority clinical trial, which
           is designed to compare the effectiveness and safety with the fully absorbable
           ventricular septal defect (VSD) occlusion system and VSD occlusion system produced by
           Shanghai shape memory alloy materials co., LTD.

        2. This trial will recruit about 108 subjects from 4 centers. Patients will be randomized
           to two groups in equal proportion (54 in each). The proposal recruiting period is 12
           months and the follow-up will be performed at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after
           surgery.
