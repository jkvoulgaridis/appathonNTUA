    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to compare the efficacy and safety of a practical individualized pro re
      nata treatment regimen between Brolucizamab and Aflibercept in patients with polypoidal
      choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.
      In its exudative or wet form, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) causes an exudative
      maculopathy resulting in sudden loss of vision with severe effects on patients' quality of
      life. Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti-VEGF)
      have become the mainstay of treatment for AMD CNV and has been shown to have favourable
      outcomes in most AMD CNV subtypes. In the Asian population, however, a particular subtype
      called polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), which affects about 50% of exudative
      maculopathy, has been shown to have less favourable response to anti-VEGF therapy.

      The best treatment option for PCV has remained unclear. Having favorable visual outcomes,
      anti-VEGF monotherapy has superseded photodynamic therapy as an effective first line of
      treatment for PCV.3,4 The non-inferiority of intravitreal (IVT) Aflibercept monotherapy vs
      combined therapy in terms of mean change in visual acuity from baseline to 1 year was well
      described in a pivotal randomized control trial, the PLANET study in 2018.5 In the recent
      released results of the Hawk and Harrier Study (2019), Brolucizumab, a novel anti-VEGF
      therapy, showed non-inferior clinical results compared to Aflibercept therapy in patients
      with neovascularAMD. In this study, a 3 monthly loading dose was given and a treat and extend
      protocol was followed. Visual function was found to be comparable between treatment arms
      while, anatomical outcomes were significantly better with Brolucizumab.

      Though anti-VEGF therapy has improved visual outcomes in the treatment of PCV, frequent
      clinic visits, injection visits as well as cost has remained to be a burdensome unmet need
      for patients diagnosed with PCV. A need for a more sustainable and cost-effective treatment
      regimen should therefore be studied to provide a practical solution for this unmet need. A
      multi-centred randomised controlled trial would give the best evidence in comparing the 2
      treatment modalities.
