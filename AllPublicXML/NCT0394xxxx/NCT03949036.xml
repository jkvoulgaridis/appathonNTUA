    <textblock>
      The investigators sought to compare the effect of two preload targets of stroke volume
      variation of ≤6% and ≤12% on the postoperative renal function in patients undergoing living
      donor kidney transplantation. Goal-directed fluid therapy will be performed in both groups to
      maintain adequate stroke volume, stroke volume variation, mean arterial pressure (or systemic
      vascular resistance) during kidney transplantation. Only the preload target for giving
      crystalloid during surgery will be different between groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The adequate preload target of fluid management has not yet been established during kidney
      transplantation. Traditionally, sufficient intravascular volume status has been recommended
      to maintain perfusion to renal graft. Stroke volume variation was reported to be superior to
      the traditional target of central venous pressure. In this regard, the investigators sought
      to compare the effect of two preload targets of stroke volume variation of ≤6% and ≤12% on
      the postoperative renal function in patients undergoing living donor kidney transplantation.
      Goal-directed fluid therapy will be performed in both groups to maintain adequate stroke
      volume, stroke volume variation, mean arterial pressure (or systemic vascular resistance)
      during kidney transplantation. Only the preload target for giving crystalloid during surgery
      will be different between groups.
