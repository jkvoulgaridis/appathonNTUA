  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comparing the effect of a long-acting insulin analogue (insulin 287) with
      insulin glargine (LantusÂ®) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the study is
      looking at symptoms of low blood sugar, awareness of low blood sugar and the time and amount
      of glucose needed to recover from low blood sugar after injecting 2 and 3 times the basal
      dose of insulin 287 and glargine. The purpose of the study is to make a once-weekly
      injectable basal insulin treatment for people with type 2 diabetes. Participants will get
      insulin 287 as well as insulin glargine - which treatment any participant gets first is
      decided by chance. Insulin 287 is a new medicine; insulin glargine can already be prescribed.
      The study medicines will be in a pen, and must be injected with a needle in the thigh once
      per day (insulin glargine) or once per week (insulin 287). The study will last for minimum 3
      months and up to approximately 6 months. Participants will have 21 clinic visits and at least
      2 phone calls with the study doctor. The participants' health will be monitored carefully and
      blood samples will be taken at the clinic visits.
