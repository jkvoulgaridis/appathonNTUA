  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is diffusely accelerated atherosclerosis of a
      transplanted heart. Evolocumab (repatha) is an FDA-approved drug for lowering LDL in patients
      who have not received a heart transplant. This drug works as a PCSK9-inhibitor. The primary
      objective of this study is to measure the impact of PCSK9-inhibitors on serum LDL in heart
      transplant patients with CAV after 12 weeks compared to baseline.

    <textblock>
      Heart transplant remains the treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure.
      Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is diffusely accelerated atherosclerosis of the donor
      heart, and limits long term survival after transplant. The pathophysiology of CAV is complex
      and involves smooth muscle proliferation, inflammatory infiltrates, and lipid deposition. To
      date, only statin therapy has reduced CAV-related mortality. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new lipid
      lowering therapy shown to reduce cardiovascular clinical events in patients with coronary
      artery disease. We hypothesize that PCSK9 inhibition via evolocumab will significantly lower
      LDL and be well-tolerated in transplant patients with CAV. This phase II, open label, single
      center trial with enroll up to 40 heart transplant patients with CAV for treatment with
      evolocumab for one year. The primary outcome will be percent change in LDL at 12 weeks.
      Secondary outcomes will include change in CAV progression, impact of evolocumab on
      immunosuppression regimens and transplant rejection, and change in serum lipids after 52
      weeks. Results of this study are intended to provide safety data in heart transplant patients
      with CAV and assess secondary outcomes including CAV progression and impact on
      immunosuppression and transplant rejection.

    <description>Enrolled study participants will be treated with evolocumab (Repatha) 140 mg injected subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. All study participants will receive instruction on correct self-administration by research pharmacists. Study drug will be mailed to patients on a monthly basis for self-administration by patients. The evolocumab dose (140 mg every 2 weeks) will remain constant for the duration of the study. Side effects will be assessed on a quarterly basis. Serious adverse events considered related to treatment, death, and pregnancy will all result in immediate discontinuation of the study drug.</description>
