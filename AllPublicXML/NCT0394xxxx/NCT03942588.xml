  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic conditioning is very important after stroke as it may reduce the risk of subsequent
      stroke and overall mortality. High-intensity interval training (HIIT), in which aerobic
      training workload is varied between lower and higher intensity bouts within a training
      session, is known to be effective for maximizing aerobic capacity in healthy individuals and
      those with cardiac disease. HIIT has not been studied extensively in adults with stroke, but
      it could be an efficient way to maximize aerobic capacity in this population. Furthermore,
      using heart rate response to establish training intensity may lead to underestimation of
      target intensity after stroke because blood pressure medications may blunt the heart rate
      response. Ventilatory threshold is an alternate method of establishing training intensity and
      is derived independently of heart rate response. The investigators hypothesized that a
      10-week program of treadmill HIIT with intensity based on ventilatory threshold would be
      feasible in adults at least 6 months post-stroke, and would increase aerobic capacity.

      Stroke is the main cause of serious, long-term disability among Americans. The effects of a
      stroke make it difficult to participate in routine, daily activities so people become
      seriously deconditioned after a stroke. This increases the chances of having another stroke
      and it also increases the risk of death. Even a small increase in aerobic capacity reduces
      these risks, making aerobic training an important component of post-stroke management.

      Twenty to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most days of the week is recommended
      for people with cardiovascular disease, but this is not very practical for many people after
      a stroke, who need to practice functional tasks like using the impaired arm and improving
      walking and balance. Another problem is that even when people do participate in aerobic
      training after a stroke, the improvements in aerobic capacity are sometimes surprisingly
      small. It is possible that the intensity of the training program was inadequate to improve
      aerobic capacity in some interventions. High-intensity interval training, in which people
      alternate between short, intense bouts of exercise and recovery bouts within the session, may
      be a way to improve aerobic capacity after a stroke with a more feasible training schedule
      that leaves time to practice functional skills too. High-intensity interval training on a
      treadmill might be appropriate to improve aerobic capacity and walking ability.

      This non-randomized, non-blinded pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of ten
      weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) using treadmill training for adults with
      impaired walking who were at least 6 months post-stroke.

      A secondary objective was to measure change in aerobic capacity, and a tertiary objective was
      to measure functional change in self-selected walking speed and leg strength as a result of
      the intervention.

      10 participants completed HIIT intervention while 5 participants served as controls and
      received no intervention, but completed both baseline and post-testing sessions.

      HIIT participants completed twice-weekly, 35-minute training sessions in a research
      laboratory for 10 consecutive weeks. At baseline and 12 weeks, all participants completed a
      graded exercise test, 10-meter walk test at self-selected and fastest, safe overground
      walking speeds, and a 30-second sit-to-stand test.
