        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form

          2. Aged 40 to 80 years old (inclusive)

          3. Kellgren-Lawrence grading II-IV, as determined by American College ofRheumatology
             (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee

          4. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score of 7
             ~ 17 (inclusive) in the target knee despite use of NSAID

          5. Contraindicated to long term systemic NSAID (e.g. suffer from severe gastrointestinal
             side effects upon systemic NSAID administration, or due to underlying increased
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or renal risk) and not able to receive or wish to
             delay knee arthroplasty

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. With previous surgery of articular fracture, ligament reconstruction, meniscal
             reconstruction, and knee arthroplasty on the target knee joint

          2. With previous intra-articular intervention (e.g. steroid, anesthetics, hyaluronate,
             arthroscopic surgery) on the target knee joint 12 weeks prior to screening

          3. Administered or required systemic or local on the target knee joint immunosuppressive
             agent, anti-inflammatory drug, steroid, analgesics, opioid, or duloxetine for OA knee
             except for acetaminophen and NSAID within 1 week prior to screening

          4. With joint diseases other than knee osteoarthritis considered by investigator not
             eligible to enter the study

          5. Unable to receive MRI examination, including allergic to the contrast medium for MRI
             used in the study, with known history of claustrophobia, having any existing metallic
             intraocular foreign body or active/inactive implanted medical devices, such as cardiac
             pacemaker, cochlear, intracranial vascular clips or neurostimulator

          6. Active or suspected infection of the target knee joint

          7. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          8. History of malignancy within 2 years prior to screening

          9. With body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 35 kg/m2

         10. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational product or the active
             control

         11. Participated other investigational study within 4 weeks prior to screening

         12. With ongoing or within the past 2 years serious medical conditions (e.g. concomitant
             illness) such as cardiovascular (e.g. New York Heart Association grade III or IV),
             hepatic (e.g. Child-Pugh Class C), psychiatric condition (e.g. alcoholism, drug
             abuse), medical history, physical findings, or laboratory abnormality that in the
             investigators' opinion could interfere with the results of the trial or adversely
             affect the safety of the subject

         13. Female subject with childbearing potential who is lactating or has positive serum or
             urine pregnancy test at Screening

         14. Subject with childbearing potential refuses to use highly effective contraceptives
             from signing informed consent until Final/Early Termination Visit. At least two forms
             of birth control must be adopted and one of which must be a barrier method. Acceptable
             forms include:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
