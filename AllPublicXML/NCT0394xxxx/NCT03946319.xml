  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the self-report adherence and assessment completion rates when
      presented with a transdiagnostic, partial assessment multiple times a day when compared with
      a monotopic, complete assessment once a day. Specifically, the investigators are testing the
      hypothesis that the personalization of diagnostic assessment topics and timing will lead to
      improved self-report regiment adherence rates, assessment completion rates, and total
      assessments completed during the study period. The study does not test the efficacy of the
      personalized assessments as a diagnostic instrument, there is no clinical decision support
      provided to clinicians during this study, and there is no treatment provided during this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broadly, the goal of Introspect Health is to shift clinical practice from reactively treating
      psychiatric disorders and mental health issues once manifested to a preventative care model
      for integrative mental health in a way that is cost-effective and scalable. One of the
      principal areas of struggle in preventative mental health is self-report adherence and the
      ability for primary care physicians and non-psychiatrists to perform mental health
      surveillance with their patients. This study specifically examines the relationship between
      individuals and a novel self-report assessment tool. To do this, the investigators are
      performing a randomized controlled trial with two classes of users (the general public and
      patients undergoing treatment for mental health issues) for a six week trial comparing the
      novel self-report assessment tool to the standard of care assessment tools available to
      clinicians. Participants will be randomized to one of the two daily assessment regiments
      within the internet-delivered assessment tool: one that is representative of standard of care
      monitoring and one that is personalized both in terms of content and timing based on the
      participant's intake as well as ongoing participation. Neither the participants nor
      researcher will be aware of which arm the individual is randomized. After using the software
      for six weeks, the data will be analyzed specifically targeting self-adherence and assessment
      completion metrics to evaluate the potential benefits of a transdiagnostic assessment system
      over the standard-of-care monotopic assessment system. Assessment scoring is handled by an
      automated scoring engine, using the rules set forth by the standards in the assessment
      protocols. The study does not test the efficacy of the personalized assessments as a
      diagnostic instrument, there is no clinical decision support provided to clinicians during
      this study, and there is no treatment provided during this study.

The content of both assessment systems is the same, but the approach to delivering the assessments differs based on the arm.

    <description>One or more times per day, participants in the Experimental Arm will be presented with a variable-length assessment based on the personalization algorithm. The assessment will include a dynamic number of questions based on personalized relevancy, engagement level, and assessment completion metrics. Questions are scored immediately upon submission, regardless of how many questions are answered. As questions are scored, the personalization algorithm takes the previous responses and response times into consideration when determining what and when to ask additional questions.</description>
