    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb clinical trial in malaria-exposed individuals to assess the
      immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of the two vaccines in the context of controlled human
      malaria infection, P. falciparum sporozoite challenge (PfSPZ Challenge).

      A total of 64 participants will be enrolled for challenge and divided into four groups as
      follows:

        -  20 participants to receive R21/Matrix M (R21/MM) with intradermal PfSPZ Challenge;

        -  20 participants to receive viral-vectored ME-TRAP with intradermal PfSPZ Challenge;

        -  10 participants to receive R21/MM with direct venous inoculation PfSPZ Challenge; and

        -  14 participants comprising of the control group with intradermal PfSPZ Challenge.

      Blood tests and clinical assessments will be conducted to screen out participants with health
      conditions that may impact participation in the study.

             participants. For those with no contraception, they will be referred for contraception
             at the relevant health facility. For female participants, we will ask them to attend
             with their family planning records for verification. Effective contraception is
             defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly, in accordance with the product label. Examples of these
             include: combined oral contraceptives; injectable progestogen; implants of
             etenogestrel or levonorgestrel; intrauterine device or intrauterine system; male
             condom combined with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or suppository); and
             male condom combined with a female diaphragm, either with or without a vaginal
             spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository)

             are allowed).

          -  Sickle cell disease

          -  Any history of anaphylaxis in relation to vaccination

          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormality as judged by the study clinician

          -  Haemoglobin less than 11.3 g/dl for men and less than 10g/dl for in women, where
             judged to be clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate

          -  Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
             product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned use during the study period

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C (HCV IgG)

          -  Use of systemic antibiotics with known antimalarial activity within 30 days of

          -  Any significant disease, disorder or situation which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the
             trial, or may influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to
             participate in the trial

          -  Confirmed parasite positive by PCR a day before challenge i.e. at C-1.
