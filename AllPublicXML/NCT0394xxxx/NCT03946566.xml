  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic health records of stroke convalescent patients will be selected from the third
      affiliated hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University from January 2012 to December
      2019. Relevant clinical data will be extracted according to case data, and model-based
      decision tree analysis will be conducted to establish and evaluate the clinical prediction
      Model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cases will be screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.Patients' basic
      information, risk factors, types of stroke, TCM diagnosis, all treatment during
      hospitalization, neurological impairment evaluation, imaging examination results and other
      contents will be recorded.Finally, statistical processing will be carried out to establish
      the prediction model, draw ROC curve and evaluate the model.

    <time_frame>Change from neurological functional impairment score at 6 months(or the last discharge time ，which less than 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the consciousness, muscle power, dysarthria, sensory disturbancen and ataxia of stroke patients on the first day, the seventh day, the fifteenth day, the first month and the sixth month after admission (or the last time of discharge).The total score is 0-29 points. The lower the score, the less the neurological defect. The efficacy will be assessed as an improvement in the neurological functional impairment score (eg, score improvement = score at admission - score at discharge), and treatment was effective when the score was reduced by more than 18%.</description>
