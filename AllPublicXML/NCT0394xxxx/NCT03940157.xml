      Specific Aims/Study Objectives:

      1. Evaluate acceptability and implementation of the &quot;Oh Happy Day: Still I Rise Class,&quot; which
      comprise a one-time 4-hour class in which participants will learn about depression with the
      goal of increasing knowledge of depression and self-management of depression with use of a
      guided class and self-help workbook. Measures of acceptability will include class attendance,
      completion of workbook activities and satisfaction. Measures of implementation will include
      satisfaction, class enrollment, fidelity in delivery of class content, and cost analysis.

      2) Evaluate participants' knowledge of depression pre-and immediate post-class, and 3-months
      post class. Measure: depression quiz. The investigators hypothesize participants will show
      increased knowledge of depression pre -and post-class.

      3) Examine effectiveness of the Oh Happy Day Class- Still I Rise (OHDC-SIR) in prevention of
      depression and 3- months' post- class. Measure, Patient Health Questionnaire - ( PHQ-9)

      4) Examine effectiveness of OHDC-SIR in reducing symptoms of depression 3- months' post-
      class. Measure, PHQ-9. The investigators hypothesize the OHDC-SIR will result in reduction in
      depressive symptoms 3- months' post-class.

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a major public health concern and is quickly approaching
      the status of a global public health crisis. According to the World Health Organization, by
      2020 MDD will be the leading cause of disability globally. In the US an estimated 9.0% of
      adults report symptoms for current MDD (i.e., during the preceding 2 weeks). It is well
      documented that women (4.0%) are significantly more likely to report and be diagnosed with
      MDD compared to men (2.7%) NIMH, 20017). In addition, health disparities research examining
      MDD show African Americans evidence higher prevalence of depression (4.0%) compared to Whites
      (3.1%) and African Americans report more chronic MDD and associated disability than do Whites
      (56.5% vs. 38.6%; Williams et al., 2007). Despite being burdened by MDD, African Americans
      evidences low seeking of professional help. However, they highly rely on religious coping.
      This, it is important to work in partnership with African American clergy and African
      Americans in community based research to create programs that are more aligned with their
      cultural and religious beliefs.

      Investigators propose using a one-group (OHDC-SIR) non-randomized observational trial and a
      sample of 100 African American men and women participants (age 25 and older) with measures at
      baseline, immediately at the end of the class, and 3- months' post-class. The total duration
      of the study is 4 months.

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 is a depression measure. PHQ-9 is a self-administered (5 minutes completion time) depression scale, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV) criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). A PHQ-9 score â‰¥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores are summed, and scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.</description>
