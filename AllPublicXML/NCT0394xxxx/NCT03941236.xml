  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multinational, multicenter, long-term safety and efficacy extension
      trial in patients with Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) who completed either ZP4207-17103 or
      ZP4207-17109 (defined as lead-in trials).

      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety of dasiglucagon administered as
      subcutaneous (SC) infusion in children with CHI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completed treatment in either Trial ZP4207-17103 or ZP4207-17109

          -  Expected to continue to have a positive benefit-risk assessment for treatment with
             dasiglucagon (based on considerations of glycemic effect, tolerability, and nature and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient developed any conditions prohibited by the lead-in trial, requires
             medication prohibited by the lead-in trial, or has other new complications that
