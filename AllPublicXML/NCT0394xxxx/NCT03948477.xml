    <textblock>
      This study explores whether a commonly used medication called Pantoprazole can help prevent
      delayed nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy for early breast cancer.

      Delayed nausea, and occasionally vomiting, can occur after breast cancer chemotherapy,
      affecting quality of life. A potential cause of these delayed side effects is that the
      chemotherapy may cause stomach irritation. Pantoprazole is commonly used to treat stomach
      irritation by reducing stomach acid, which may in turn improve nausea and/or vomiting.

      Patients undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy before or after primary surgery will be
      invited to participate in the study. They will be asked how much nausea or vomiting they have
      with and without Pantoprazole from Day 2 until 5 after they receive chemotherapy. All
      participants will still receive all of the usual anti-sickness medications, which are very
      effective in preventing sickness in the first 24 hours after treatment, but not for delayed
      symptoms.

      Information from the study may lead to a change in practice with patients using Pantoprazole
      to reduce the risks of delayed nausea and vomiting.

    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer is the most common cancer type in women in New Zealand and has the second
      highest mortality (Ministry of Health NZ) Many women with early breast cancer still receive
      chemotherapy, before or after surgery and delayed nausea is a particular challenge. Ensuring
      tolerable therapy is critical to improving outcomes, by enabling patients to complete optimal
      anti-cancer therapy and to improve quality of life during therapy. Despite recent advances in
      antiemetic regimens, recent trials showed that rates of delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea
      and Vomiting (CINV) are is in excess of 50%, with significant impacts on quality of life
      during treatment. This suggests that different mechanisms than those targeted by centrally
      acting anti-emetics account for such symptoms. There is strong evidence that chemotherapy
      regimens can result in gastrointestinal mucosal injury and dyspepsia. A number of studies
      have shown chemotherapy-induced dyspepsia can be relieved by a proton pump inhibitor, but
      none have reported their use as prophylaxis for delayed CINV, which may be a linked symptom.
      Proton pump inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of non-malignant dyspeptic conditions
      and are the most potent medications at reducing gastric acid secretions. They are considered
      safe in short-term use and are commonly used in clinical practice in cancer patients as well
      as the wider population. The pharmacokinetics Pantoprazole make it the ideal PPI for this
      study. The experience of New Zealand Medical Oncologists is that delayed nausea is often
      completely resolved by the delayed use of a PPI when symptoms occur. In this study we hope to
      see a 30% difference in the rates of delayed nausea by using a drug which is readily
      available and of very low cost. This will be the first time it has been used as preventive
      therapy in this setting. If this benefit occurs, it would significantly improve the treatment
      journey and may improve compliance to anti-cancer therapies.
