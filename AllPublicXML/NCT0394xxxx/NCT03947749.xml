  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic variability from epigenetic modification of genes related to pain physiology and
      opioid pharmacodynamics may influence susceptibility to high-impact chronic musculoskeletal
      pain, opioid efficacy, and vulnerability to opioid abuse. Exploring the role of epigenomics
      and opioid addiction may improve understanding and treatment of these complex multifactorial
      conditions and, potentially, reduce their development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 19 million adults suffer with chronic pain, which frequently limits life or work
      activities. Many of these patients are chronic prescription opioid consumers and may be at
      risk for opioid use disorder. Genetic variability of genes related to pain physiology and
      opioid pharmacodynamics may influence susceptibility to high-impact chronic musculoskeletal
      pain (HICMP), opioid efficacy, and vulnerability to opioid abuse. There is a paucity of
      research on the epigenetic profile of patients with HICMP and of those who fall in the
      spectrum between opioid addicted and opioid naive. Exploring the role of epigenomics in HICMP
      and opioid addiction may improve understanding and treatment of these complex multifactorial
      conditions and, potentially, reduce development.

      The long-term goal is to create a profile of genetic and psychosocial risk factors for
      identifying patients susceptible to HICMP and opioid abuse. The objective of this pilot study
      is to gather preliminary data on the association of epigenetic modification of genes with
      HICMP and prescription opioid abuse.The study team propose to compare COMT and OPRM1 DNA
      methylation patterns in patients with HICMP (Group 1) to those without HICMP (Group 2).The
      investigators will also correlate OPRM1 DNA methylation patterns with the likelihood of
      misuse and abuse in chronic opioid consumers. It is hypothesized: (1) the promoter region of
      the COMT and OPRM1 genes will be hypo- and hyper-methylated, respectively, in Group 1
      compared to Group 2; and (2) the OPRM1 gene in patients at high risk for opioid misuse and
      abuse will be hyper-methylated.

    <measure>Opioid Risk Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Prescription opioid abuse or misuse will be measured using the Opioid Risk Tool. This tool should be administered to patients upon an initial visit prior to beginning opioid therapy for pain management. A score of 3 or lower indicates low risk for future opioid abuse, a score of 4 to 7 indicates moderate risk for opioid abuse, and a score of 8 or higher indicates a high risk for opioid abuse.</description>

    <description>Seven question survey concerning prescription pain medication use within the last 3 months. Self reported answers ranging 1-5; with 1 being 'never' to 5 being 'almost always.' Prescription opioid abuse or misuse will be measured using the PROMIS Short Form v1.0-Prescription Pain Medication Misuse. Patients with PPMM scores of 60 or more will be considered high risk for opioid misuse or abuse.</description>
