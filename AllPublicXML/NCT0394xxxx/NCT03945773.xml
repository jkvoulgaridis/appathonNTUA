      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib as
      2nd line treatment in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC with a
      clear-cell component, who progressed after prior Checkpoint Inhibitors (CPI) therapy with
      ipilimumab and nivolumab in combination or CPI combined with Vascular Endothelial Growth
      Factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.
