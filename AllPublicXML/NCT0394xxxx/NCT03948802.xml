  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of interleukin 33 in the blood plasma in
      patients with the acute ischemic stroke of the brain in relation to mode of treatment
      (thrombolysis, thrombectomy, no treatment), risk factors in correlation with other
      inflammatory state markers (hsCRP, morphology with smear ). Blood is collected on the first
      and seventh days of stroke.

      The purpose is to clarify utility of IL 33 as a biomarker of acute stroke.

      Stroke is the third most frequent cause of death in highly developed countries (after heart
      disease and cancer), the main cause of disability in adults and the second most frequent
      cause of dementia syndromes. The annual incidence of stroke in the general population is
      approximately 0.2%. The risk of stroke increases with age.

      Globally 15 million people are affected each year and 5.5 million die every year for this
      reason (20% in 30 days and up to 40% in a year from getting ill). In Poland, the incidence of
      stroke is around 175/100,000 in men and 125/100 in women.It is assumed that the cause of
      sudden cerebral insufficiency is mainly the embolism coming from the newly formed wall clot
      forming at the site of the atherosclerotic plaque rupture.

      In recent years, the role of inflammatory factors is associated with the occurrence of severe
      atherosclerotic complications such as stroke or heart attack. Cytokines are glycoproteins
      that are released by activated cells of various tissues. They have a significant impact on
      the inflammation processes, they control all phases of the immune response. Interleukin is
      one of the cytokine groups. This study aims to find a relationship between level of IL 33
      concentration and the size of the stroke and neurological deficit.

      Blood will be collected on the first and seventh days of stroke for examination of Il 33,
      blood morphology and hsCRP

    <description>Comparison of patients in DRAGON scale on the 1st and the 7th day. DRAGON scale was developed to make early predictions about clinical outcomes for ischemic stroke patients using only information that is available shortly after they arrive at the hospital and before tPA is given. The DRAGON score, especially at the low and high end of the scale, can help predict which patients are likely to have good clinical outcomes and those who are likely to have miserable clinical outcomes even if given tPA. These patients may also be potential candidates for endovascular thrombectomy, though the benefits of this procedure have not yet been demonstrated in the literature.</description>

    <measure>ASTRAL scale</measure>

    <description>ASTRAL scale is used in patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted within 24 hours of stroke onset. It can provide additional information on medium-term functional outcome in patients that have suffered acute ischemic stroke, in addition to clinical judgment based on relevant clinical and laboratory variables.It can be used to adjust for functional outcome in multivariate models in acute stroke-related research studies.It can serve as a selection criterion for cohorts in acute stroke-related research studies.</description>

    <description>Change in disability. mRS can help users determine the degree of disability in patients who have suffered a stroke. mRS assesses disability in patients who have suffered a stroke and is compared over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability. A score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs; 6 is death</description>

      For the examination a venous blood is taken up from the elbow vein - 10 ml into the test tube
      containing 3.2 % solution of sodium citrate, for routine examinations (including the
      morphology with the smear, hsCRP). The concentration of interleukin 33 is assessed with the
      Elisa test. Blood is taken twice: in first twenty-four hours and seventh day after the
      cerebral stroke.
