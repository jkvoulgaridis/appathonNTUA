  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current project is to test the acceptability and feasibility of a
      computerized intervention, titled Computerized Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST),
      delivered to Veterans seeking treatment for an opioid use disorder. The second aim of the
      study is to examine the utility of CAST by gathering data on symptom change. The final aim of
      the current study is to test the effects of CAST on rates of attendance and retention in a
      substance use disorder treatment (SUDT) program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot project will examine the effects of a brief, one-session computerized intervention
      delivered to Veterans seeking treatment for an opioid use disorder. The opioid epidemic in
      the United States (US) is having a disproportionate impact on Veterans. Indeed, Veterans are
      twice as likely to die from an accidental opioid overdose than members of the general
      population, even after accounting for gender and age distribution. Although many individuals
      with an opioid addiction seek treatment, a large proportion drop out prematurely and/or
      relapse, highlighting the need to identify modifiable factors that may contribute to this
      process. One variable that may be useful in understanding attrition in addiction treatment is
      anxiety sensitivity (AS). AS is a well-established psychological risk factor reflecting the
      tendency to fear anxious arousal due to the belief that this arousal will have harmful
      physical, mental, and/or social consequences. AS is elevated in opioid use populations and
      predicts treatment dropout among opioid users. Importantly, research suggests that AS is
      highly malleable. Despite this, to our knowledge no published research to date has
      systematically explored the utility of AS reduction protocols among opioid users. The first
      aim of the current project is to test the acceptability and feasibility of a brief,
      one-session Computerized AS Treatment (CAST) delivered to Veterans seeking treatment for an
      opioid use disorder. Because this is a pilot project and the study will likely be
      underpowered to detect treatment effects, we will not emphasize symptom reduction.
      Nevertheless, a second aim of the current project is to examine the utility of CAST by
      gathering data on symptom change. Finally, a third aim of the current project is to examine
      the effects of CAST on rates of attendance and retention in a substance use disorder
      treatment (SUDT) program.

    <time_frame>One week post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The IAQ is an 11-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure treatment satisfaction. The IAQ includes nine items assessing acceptability (e.g., Do you think the information provided during the computerized intervention was helpful? How likely are you to use the information and techniques you learned during the computerized intervention?), which are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (0 = no; 1 = somewhat; 2 = moderately; 3 = yes) and two free response items requesting suggestions for improving the treatment. The IAQ will be administered at post-intervention to allow us to assess treatment acceptability.</description>

    <description>CAST is a newly developed computerized intervention designed to closely model the educational and behavioral techniques that are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety and related conditions. A psychoeducation component focuses on the nature of anxiety and its effects on the mind and body. Veterans will be taught that physiological and psychological arousal is not dangerous, although they may have developed a conditioned fear of this arousal. Interoceptive exposure (IE) exercises will also be introduced to as a way to reduce or eliminate the conditioned fear response.</description>
