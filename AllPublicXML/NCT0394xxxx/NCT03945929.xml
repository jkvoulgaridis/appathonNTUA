  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain management during medical care is considered to be a basic human right and also affects
      patient satisfaction. In addition, effective management of acute pain contributes to improved
      patient outcomes. Patient satisfaction is a subjective state that indicates whether the
      healthcare provided has met the patient's needs and expectations. Many nurse theorists,
      including Florence Nightingale, have expressed the importance of providing comfort and relief
      for patients. In fact, comfort has been a crucial aspect of patient care since Nightingale's
      days, and has been considered an indispensable constituent of integrated nursing care.
      Studies to improve comfort may contribute to improving individuals' health outcomes,
      enforcing health-improvement behaviors, and improving healthcare quality as well as
      satisfaction and contentment of the individual and the nurse in the process of administering
      healthcare. In the literature, although the efficacy of various pharmacological methods for
      reducing pain associated with the insertion of PIC has been evaluated in adults, studies on
      nonpharmacological methods are limited. However, most of the studies were performed in
      healthy adults. Easy, inexpensive, and fast methods with unlikely side effects are needed to
      control pain and distress due to the PIC insertion in adults. Therefore, this study was
      performed to evaluate the effectiveness of distraction methods.

    <description>Distraction-1 Group: Cards containing approximately six optical illusion pictures were shown to the patients and as a method of distraction during the PIC insertion procedure they were asked what they saw in these cards.
Distraction-2 Group: Underwater 3D audial videos were played with visual reality (VR) goggles during PIC insertion until the procedure was completed.</description>
