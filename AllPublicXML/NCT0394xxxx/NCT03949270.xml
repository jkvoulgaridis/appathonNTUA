  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. The primary objective is to compare rates of persistence (continuation) of any endocrine
           therapy (ET) between patients assigned to standard of care follow-up (control arm)
           versus standard of care plus a bi-directional text messaging intervention (intervention
           arm)

        2. The secondary objectives are:

           (i) To assess time to permanent discontinuation of ET (switching from an aromatase
           inhibitor to another ET is permitted). The investigators will also account for treatment
           breaks.

           (ii) To assess QOL at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after initiation of ET (FACT-ES1,
           Brief Pain Inventory2, Overall Treatment Burden3,4, individual symptom LASA scales4) and
           compare between arms (iii) To assess adherence self-efficacy (SEAMS5 tool, Voils Extent
           of Non-Adherence Scale6), financial burden (COST tool7,8), beliefs about medications
           (modified BMQ tool9,10), and perceived ability to communicate with one's physician
           (PEPPI11 tool) and compare between arms (iv) To compare the time to endocrine therapy
           discontinuation in both the intervention and control arms (v) To characterize factors
           (including clinicopathologic features, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities)
           associated with non-adherence in both the intervention arm and the control arm, which
           may enable us to identify women who are at particularly high risk of non-adherence.

           (vi) To assess adherence to medication as reported through the BETA-Text intervention
           (vii) To collect the time to onset and trend of severity of side effects in women
           assigned to the text messaging intervention.

    <description>Patients in the text messaging arm will receive daily, weekly, and monthly text messages. The daily message asks whether or not the patient has taken their breast cancer medication. The weekly message asks about any side effects and their severity. The monthly text message asks about any barriers that the patient might be experiencing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed stage I-III, estrogen and/or progesterone
             receptor positive, as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines, invasive breast cancer for whom
             adjuvant hormonal therapy is indicated following standard NCCN practice guidelines.42

          2. Patients must initiate an aromatase inhibitor (AI), with the choice of AI (letrozole,
             anastrozole, or exemestane) left to the discretion of the treating provider (have just
             started or plan to start within 4 weeks)

          3. Patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancers are eligible if both tumors are
             hormone receptor positive.

          4. Patient must be able to provide informed consent and agree to:

               1. Complete questionnaires according to the pre-specified study design

               2. Own or have access to a personal cell phone, agree to send and receive text
                  messages (including any costs), and share their personal cell phone number to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with history of prior stage I-III breast cancer in the same or contralateral
             breast are not eligible (because exposure to prior endocrine therapy may confound

          2. Patients with metastatic breast cancer.

          3. Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or other pre-malignant lesions of the
