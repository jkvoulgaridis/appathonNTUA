  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial palsy affects between 23 to 35 people per 100,000. As well as affecting an
      individual's appearance, it also can lead to difficulties with: eating, drinking, speaking,
      eyelid closure, pain and taste.

      Facial palsy has been shown to have a significant impact on an individual's psychological
      wellbeing, including issues with anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. These elevated
      levels of distress have been thought to be partly due to the impact that facial palsy has on
      the face's ability to express emotions, which is a crucial aspect of face-to-face
      communication.

      Although not researched yet in a facial palsy population, one type of psychological
      intervention that has been found to be effective at improving the psychosocial wellbeing of
      people with visible differences has been psychological self-help. With this in mind, the
      investigators have developed seven self-guided information and therapy guides (ITGs), for
      people with facial palsy and/or their friends or relatives. The investigators have written
      these guides by drawing on interventions with a strong evidence-base in other populations,
      such as cognitive behavioural therapy, social skills training and acceptance and commitment
      therapy:

        1. Facial palsy: Coping with the early stages.

        2. Facial palsy: Coping with comments, questions and staring.

        3. Facial palsy: Communicating with confidence.

        4. Facial palsy: Managing anxiety.

        5. Facial palsy: Managing your mood.

        6. Facial palsy: Building your self-esteem.

        7. Facial palsy: Advice for friends, family and partners.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness, usability and acceptability of these
      guides to people with facial palsy and/or their friends, family and partners, by piloting
      their use over a 4-6 week period. Assessment of psychosocial wellbeing will be carried out
      before and after the 4-6 week period, while participants will be invited to provide usability
      and acceptability feedback on the guides after the 4-6 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that this study represents an initial pilot of the use of self-guided information and
      therapy guides for people with facial palsy (and/or their friends and relatives), all
      eligible participants will receive the intervention (i.e. there will be no control group). As
      a result, this study will have a repeated-measures design.

      Eligible participants will be recruited by one of two means:

        1. Face-to-face of recruitment of OUH NHS patients during clinics at the Oxford Facial
           Palsy Service

        2. Recruitment of people with facial palsy, not under the care of the Oxford Facial Palsy
           Service, through relevant web and social media pages (e.g. the Facial Palsy UK Facebook
           page)

      Potential participants who have expressed an interest in the study will be provided with an
      information sheet, and be invited to provide written consent. Participants recruited through
      the Oxford Facial Palsy Service will proved written consent via Survey Hero, either in clinic
      or remotely online at a later if they wish for longer time to consider their involvement in
      the study. Participants recruited through Facial Palsy UK/social media will provide written
      consent via Survey Hero.

      Once participants have provided consent, they will be provided with an online screening
      questionnaire (in order to check for eligibility). Participants recruited in Oxford Facial
      Palsy Service clinics will complete the screening questionnaire on the researcher's laptop.
      Alternatively, if participants recruited in clinic wish to have more time to consider whether
      or not to participate, they will be able to complete online screening (and subsequent
      baseline assessments) remotely online. Participants recruited on social media will be emailed
      a link to the screening questionnaire.

      Eligible participants will then be invited to complete baseline questionnaires:

      People with facial palsy: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; FACE-Q Satisfaction with
      appearance; FACE-Q Psychological function; FACE-Q Social function and Facial Disability
      Index. The Facial Disability Index will allow for control of improvement in facial palsy
      symptoms over time.

      Friends, relatives and partners: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Adult Carer
      Quality of Life Questionnaire.

      Like the screening questionnaires, written consent and baseline questionnaires will be
      completed online.

      Eligible participants will then be administered the relevant self-guided information and
      therapy guide. For eligible carers/relatives this will be the guide entitled &quot;Facial palsy:
      Advice for friends, family and partners&quot;. For eligible participants with facial palsy, this
      will be determined by their score on the screening questionnaire.

      Participants will then utilise the guide over a period of four-to-six weeks. Half-way through
      the intervention period (after 2-3 weeks), they will receive an email reminding them to
      complete the guide and will be provided a web-link to complete a questionnaire, designed for
      the purpose of the current study, measuring the participants' ratings of acceptability and
      usability of the guides (participant satisfaction questionnaire).

      At the end of the four-to-six week period, participants will be re-administered the baseline
      questionnaires, along with a questionnaire designed for the purpose of the current study
      measuring the participants' ratings of acceptability and usability of the guides (participant
      satisfaction questionnaire). Participants with facial palsy will also be re-administered the
      initial screening questionnaire. This will indicate whether the participant is eligible to
      complete a further guide. If this is the case, then their post-intervention questionnaires
      will serve as a new baseline and the participant will be invited to complete the new guide
      over a second four-to-six week period (followed by the same follow-up assessments as followed
      the first guide). This process will occur up to a maximum of six times (reflecting the
      potential for a participant to trial all six guides). If they do not wish to complete further
      guides then the participant will be thanked for their involvement in the study and their
      involvement will be registered as 'complete'.

      Friends, relatives and partners of people with facial palsy will only be required to complete
      pre and post questionnaires if they are actively involved in the study due to completing the
      friend, relative or partner ITG. Likewise, individuals with facial palsy are not required to
      complete questionnaires if they are not actively involved in the study (i.e. not trialing and
      ITG), but their friend or relative is.

      The investigators aim to trial the guides over a period of one year (May 2019 - May 2020).
      This will lead to the predicted sample size of 140 participants (120 with facial palsy, 20
      per each of the 6 guides; 20 friends and family). This target is based on there being
      approximately 3000 people who have access to the Facial Palsy UK website. Given that
      approximately one-third of people with facial palsy experience a significant level of
      distress; the investigators hope that our guides would be relevant to, and accessible by,
      around 1000 people. 140 is therefore a conservative estimate of the number of participants
      that the investigators will be able to recruit.

      Participants recruited from OUH NHS Foundation trust will be provided with an information
      sheet during their clinic appointment with the Oxford Facial Palsy Service. Written consent
      will be obtained in the clinic by a member of the research team.

      Participants recruited from social media will be provided with an information sheet via email
      and will provide written consent online.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - person with facial palsy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item scale with two seven-item subscales looking at anxiety and depression. A score equal-to-or-lower-than 7 on a subscale falls below the clinical cut-off, a score of 8-10 indicates probably clinically significant anxiety or depression, while a score of 11 or more indicates clinically significant anxiety or depression. It is well validated in the physical health population, excluding somatic symptoms of anxiety and depression that may overlap with symptoms of a physical health condition. It has been shown to have good test-retest reliability (= .70 to .84; 16).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>FACE-Q Satisfaction with appearance - person with facial palsy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>A nine-item scale assessing an individual's concerns regarding their facial appearance. The higher the score, the greater the patient's dissatisfaction with their appearance, with a highest possible score being 32. This measure has been demonstrated to have good reliability within a plastic surgery population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>FACE-Q Psychological function - person with facial palsy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>This 11-item scale measures psychological wellbeing using a series of positively worded statements, with participants invited to rate how much they agree/disagree with each statement. A high score (maximum = 40) indicates greater psychological wellbeing. This measure has been validated within a clinical setting and has been shown to have a Cronbach alpha of .96, indicating very good internal consistency</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>FACE-Q Social functioning - person with facial palsy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>Like the FACE-Q psychological function scale, participants are provided with a series of positively worded statements. In this scale there are 9 statements and they pertain to measuring social functioning. Just as with the psychological function scale, the social functioning scale has a Cronbach alpha of .96 and has been shown to have good convergent and discriminant construct validity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Disability Index - person with facial palsy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item self-report measure of physical and social function in people with facial palsy. Both the physical (=.88) and social (=.83) subscales have been shown to have good internal consistency and construct validity. Each scale is scored out of 100 (100 = high function).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - friend, relative or carer</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item scale with two seven-item subscales looking at anxiety and depression. A score equal-to-or-lower-than 7 on a subscale falls below the clinical cut-off, a score of 8-10 indicates probably clinically significant anxiety or depression, while a score of 11 or more indicates clinically significant anxiety or depression. It is well validated in the physical health population, excluding somatic symptoms of anxiety and depression that may overlap with symptoms of a physical health condition. It has been shown to have good test-retest reliability (= .70 to .84; 16).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adult carer quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and upon completion of the 4-6 week trial period</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 40-item self-report scale that measures the overall quality of life for adult carers. Subscale scores include: support for caring; caring choice; caring stress; money matters; personal growth; sense of value; ability to care and carer satisfaction. Scores fall on a 0-120 scale, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
