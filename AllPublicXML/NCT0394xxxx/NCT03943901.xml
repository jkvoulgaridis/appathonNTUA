  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new administration schedule of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide,
      Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy for participants with Diffuse
      Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), focusing on an underserved elderly population (aged 75 and up;
      certain participants 70-74 may be eligible) that is often excluded from clinical trials.
      Participants can expect to be on study for 2.5 years (treatment for 6 months and 2 years of
      post treatment follow-up).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the efficacy of split-dose R-CHOP for the treatment of elderly patients
      with de novo diagnosis of DLBCL or transformed DLBCL. Split-dose R-CHOP involves giving
      Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy at 14 days'
      interval with Rituximab given once/month. The safety for every 14-day CHOP administration was
      studied in a large prospective randomized control trial of patients up to the age of 80
      years. In this study, R-CHOP given every 14 days for up to 6 cycles was felt to be the best
      method of delivery of chemotherapy. Receiving greater than 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy
      was not found to be beneficial compared to participants receiving 6 cycles of R-CHOP.
      Additionally, an interim response adapted approach by combining imaging and MRD testing will
      be used to identify participants who will receive an abbreviated chemotherapy course if they
      are both Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) and Minimum Residual Dose
      (MRD) negative.

      In the proposed study, participants will receive a 50% dose reduction of CHOP chemotherapy on
      Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle with full dose Rituximab on Day 1 for up to a total of 6
      months of chemotherapy. Participants who are MRD and PET/CT negative after 2 months will be
      placed on an abbreviated regimen with R-CHOP x 4 additional doses with full dose Rituximab
      and a 50% dose reduction in CHOP chemotherapy. The hypothesis is that this method of
      administration of R-CHOP will be a safe and effective form of chemotherapy for older patients
      with DLBCL and will allow older patients to receive curative intent treatment.

    <description>Simon 2-stage design with complete response (CR) rate at the end of treatment as our primary outcome. 40% is an unacceptable boundary for complete response rate and 60% as an acceptable complete response rate.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS measures survival without relapse/progression or death starting from study enrollment. Relapse or progression of disease and death will be considered as events; subjects who survive without recurrence or progression will be censored at last contact. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier estimate and presented with graphically with pointwise 95% confidence intervals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS measures time to death starting from study enrollment. Death from any cause will be considered an event; surviving subjects will be censored at time of last follow-up. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with graphically with pointwise 95% confidence intervals. Exploratory Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to evaluate the effect of baseline covariates on PFS and OS.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of serious adverse events will be reported for all subjects who received at least one dose of the study treatment. The proportion of subjects experiencing a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) will be reported with 95% confidence intervals overall, as well as classified by grade and organ system. Toxicity will be monitored using the formal boundary described in the protocol.</description>

    <description>Cancer-specific geriatric assessment prior to, during, and after completion of chemotherapy treatments to evaluate for changes in physical function, mental health, cognition, and other relevant geriatric specific outcomes. The geriatric assessment measures will be summarized descriptively at each measurement time-point using appropriate descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages with standard errors for categorical variables, mean with standard error or median with quartiles for continuous variables.</description>
