  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as a
      downward displacement of one or several of the followings: &quot;the anterior wall of the vagina&quot;,
      &quot;the posterior wall of the vagina&quot; or &quot;the cervix&quot;.

      Principal risk factor of the POP is the muscular trauma of the Levator Ani Muscle (LAM) or
      pelvic nerve injury during vaginal delivery and pregnancy. The POP is a real public health
      problem. Nearly a quarter of the female population will be affected by this pathology during
      their lifetime. Also, the POP is responsible for impaired quality of life. POP management is
      mainly surgical. The LAM is classically described as a striated muscle. In an anatomic study
      based on female human fetuses, it has been described a new representation of nerve supplying
      LAM innervation with both autonomic and somatic participation. In a second study, it has been
      observed within the LAM, a visceral medial area (interface with the pelvic viscera) composed
      of smooth muscle cells under autonomic nervous control and a lateral parietal area (interface
      with the bone basin) composed of striated muscle cells under somatic control. Because of the
      medial localization of these smooth muscle areas, it is hypothesed that the visceral medial
      zone within the LAM plays a major role in pelvic status maintaining.

      The main goal is to compare the proportion of smooth muscle cells within the MEA in patients
      with urogenital prolapse and in asymptomatic ones.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare the expression of neurotransmitters within smooth muscle cell areas in
           patients with POPs and asymptomatic patients.

        -  To compare the proportion of striated muscle cells in MEA in patients with POPs and
           asymptomatic patients.

      It is a monocentric case-control study (1: 1). The inclusion of cases and witnesses will be
      prospective. For each case, a witness will be included with matching on parity (0, at least
      one child). Concerning the age, they will be matched according to the following age groups:
      18-39 years old, 40-44 years old, 45-49 years old, 50-54 years old, over 55 years old.

      For cases and controls, before the intervention, a questioning (age, weight, height, parity,
      mode of delivery, hormonal status), clinical symptoms of POPs and urinary incontinence, a
      detailed clinical examination, and an urodynamic assessment (in case of POPs) will be noted.

      All cases and controls will have an ultrasound guided MEA biopsy. A fine needle will be used.
      The biopsy (5mm) will interest the medial part located between the vagina and the rectum.

      Patients will be seen on post-operative visits between 15 days and 2 months after surgery for
      an examination and clinical examination.

      From the biopsy, it will be performed a classic staining (Masson's trichrome) and specific
      immuno-markings to detect all the nerves, and to differentiate parasympathetic autonomic,
      sympathetic autonomic, erectile, and somatic nerves. Immunostaining for smooth muscle,
      striated muscle and relaxin system will also be performed. An immunofluorescence technique
      will be associated. Thus, some additional slides will be reserved for an actomyosin ATPase
      enzymatic reaction to differentiate muscle fiber types. Treated sections will be digitized
      with a Hamamatsu slide scanner for subsequent image analysis and analysis. The size of the
      different types of striated muscle fibers (1, 2a, 2b) will be measured using the NDPview
      (Hamamatsu) software. The labeling surface of the different antibodies will be quantified
      objectively by the NIS-Elements Viewer software.

      Benefits are collective :

        1. Clinical impact: Find new medical therapeutic targets and improve rehabilitation
           techniques.

        2. Repercussion in research:

             -  To set up a PHRC with a randomized controlled multicenter study on the comparison
                of electrical stimulation and voluntary muscular contraction in postpartum with
                measurement of pelvic floor muscle strength and pelvic-perineal evaluation (search
                for pelvic prolapse , urinary incontinence).

             -  To improve knowledge of anatomy and physiology of pelvic floor muscles by mapping
                neurotransmitters in LAM in adult patients with POPs and asymptomatic patients.
