  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobility impairment is one of the most common, poorly managed, and life altering consequences
      of MS. Current therapies for managing MS do not prevent the long-term accumulation of
      mobility impairment, highlighting the need for alternative strategies that prevent or slow
      progressive mobility disability. The proposed trial will test the efficacy and lasting
      effects of functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling as an exercise-based
      rehabilitation strategy for managing mobility impairment and associated consequences in MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an assessor-blinded RCT for examining the efficacy and lasting effects of 24
      weeks of supervised FES cycling exercise compared to passive leg cycling on mobility and
      secondary outcomes in people with MS with mobility impairment. Participants who meet the
      eligibility criteria will undergo the informed consent process and baseline assessment.
      Participants will then be randomized to either the FES or passive leg cycling program.
      Following baseline assessment, participants will complete a 24-week leg cycling program, with
      a mid-point assessment at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, participants will undergo a
      post-intervention assessment. Following a 12-week follow-up period, participants will undergo
      a final assessment. Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 10
      months.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Performance: Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks (mid-point), 24 weeks (immediately post intervention), and 36 weeks (12 weeks follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) battery involves three cognitive tasks: the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the California Verbal Learning Test II (CVLT-II), and the revised Brief Visualspatial Memory Test (BVMT-R). The SDMT is a timed thinking task that involves associating numbers with symbols. Participants will be asked to provide as many correct numbers as possible in 90 seconds. The CVLT-II is a test of verbal memory and involves recalling a list of words read aloud by an examiner. The participant will be read a list of 16 words and asked to recall as many words as possible. The BVMT is a test of visual memory which involves recalling and manually drawing a series of 6 abstract designs as accurately as possible. The SDMT is performed once, while there are five trials of the CVLT-II and three trials of the BVMT in the BICAMS battery. Higher scores on all three tests indicate better cognitive function.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>FES cycling will involve systematic, transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the leg muscles to produce leg-cycling movement. The intensity and duration of training will be prescribed based on guidelines for aerobic exercise training for persons with MS and from the American College of Sports Medicine, and will progressively increase across 24 weeks. Participants will be encouraged to actively cycle at a minimum cadence of ~40-50 rpm, at 40-60% VO2peak for between 10-50 minutes. The intensity of stimulation will be adjusted per leg muscle group based on sensory tolerance with the goal of maintaining pedaling action and target heart rate over the entire session. At each session, we will record the distance traveled, energy expended, power output, resistance, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE).</description>

    <description>Passive leg cycling will involve movement of the participant's legs by the cycle ergometer motor without electrical stimulation. The duration of training will follow the same schedule as the FES cycling condition and the same data will be recorded at each session. The passive cycling condition will include the same exposure with the training facility, the exercise equipment (i.e. RT300 cycles), and the research staff (i.e. social contact and attention) as with the FES cycling condition.</description>
