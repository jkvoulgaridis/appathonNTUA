    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate MEDI1191 delivered by intratumoral
      injection in sequential and concurrent combination with intravenous durvalumab to subjects
      with solid tumors. The study has a dose escalation design using mTPI-2 to evaluate a range of
      doses.
