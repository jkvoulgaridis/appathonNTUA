  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research, EMDR protocol model specific for bipolar patients with a history of trauma,
      developed by Benedikt Ahmann et al (2017), who applies EMDR in adults with Bipolar Disorder
      (BD) and history of trauma will be adapted for adolescents. This protocol consists of a
      detailed survey of traumatic events, intervention and processing of these events according to
      the standard protocol developed by Shapiro.

      The main hypothesis is that the use of EMDR in adolescents with BD and history of trauma, as
      a complement to the pharmacological treatment (Usual Treatment), would have beneficial
      effects in the course of the disease. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to examine
      whether EMDR therapy in adolescents with BD and history of traumatic events can reduce
      affective relapses within a 12-month period. In addition, improvement in biological markers
      related to BD is expected to be found when compared to the Usual Treatment. It is also
      expected that patients treated with EMDR will present a better neurocognitive functioning
      profile, assessed by means of a neuropsychological evaluation battery before and after the
      intervention, since recent studies show that the profile of humoral dysregulation,
      impulsiveness, difficulty in dealing with frustrations and social feedback in children and
      adolescents with BD is associated with poor cognitive control and executive function
      deficits.

      This will be a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be assigned to Eye Movement
      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy or Treatment as Usual (TAU) through block
      randomization. This process will be done using the program available at www.
      randomization.com.

      In this study, EMDR Therapy will be applied in adolescents with BD and compared to the Usual
      Treatment. The neuropsychological profile of the patients will be evaluated before and after
      the interventions. In addition, the collection of the biological markers related to BD will
      be done by measuring the levels of salivary cortisol and serum levels of C-reactive protein
      (CRP), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Interleukin (IL) - 1β, IL - 2, IL - 4, IL -
      6, IL - 10, Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha(TNF-α) in these
      patients, since a study proposing the use of serological biomarkers for BD diagnosis
      concluded that the use of a single biomarker would be of little use and a combination of
      several biomarkers would be necessary.

    <description>Patients will be submitted to 20 individual sessions of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy of 60 minutes each, combined to the Treatment as usual (TAU).
It's an eight-step process aimed at the traumatic events, also used to address current situations that evoke emotional disturbances so they do not trigger more symptomatic reactions. In addition, it is helpful to assist the patient in developing the specific skills and behaviors required for a healthy functional life.
Our group will adapt the EMDR protocol model specific for bipolar patients with a history of trauma, developed by Ahmann et al (2017), who applies EMDR in adults with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and history of trauma.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the Treatment as Usual. TAU will consist of the psychopharmacological approach appropriate to each patient according to the evaluation of a psychiatrist of childhood and adolescence's outpatient service. Patients are expected to be euthymic (or with subsyndromal symptoms) with the same medication for at least 3 months.
Although the medications used by patients are relevant and taken into account in future analyzes, our group will not interfere with drug treatment. Thus, patients who require any type of drug intervention will be considered losses.</description>

    <description>The reprocessing and desensitization of each traumatic memory occurs in eight phases. In the first two phases, the therapist identifies targets and develops a treatment plan, enhances and develops personal resources, before working on traumatic memories. In stages 3 to 6, reprocessing and desensitization of memory is done. The patient focuses on the image of the event, negative beliefs and associated bodily sensations, while moving the eyes from side to side, following the therapist's fingers or other dual attention stimuli (eg, manual touch, auditory stimulation). Phases 7 and 8 are closing and reassessing, where the therapist determines if the memory has been processed properly.</description>
