  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to design a new model of human itch by application of
      Zyclara cream. Further, the aim is to characterize the model and to verify if the mechanism
      of action of imiquimod follows the histaminergic or non-histaminergic pathway by using the
      anti-histamine drug doxepin. The last goal is to evaluate the interaction between the
      activation of TLR7 receptor and the activation of TRPA1 and TRPM8 receptors, which are two of
      the most important receptors involved in the transduction of noxious stimuli, and to evaluate
      to which extent these three channel populations functionally overlap.

    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of itch in psoriasis is unclear. A recent study found that there is no
      correlation between the severity of the disease and the intensity of the pruritus in patients
      with psoriasis. Imiquimod (IMQ)-treated mice represent a useful model to examine the neuronal
      mechanisms underlying itch and its sensitization in psoriasis. Zyclara cream is most commonly
      used for topical treatment of external genital warts, actinic keratosis and superficial basal
      cell carcinoma. Its active component, imiquimod, is a TLR7/8 agonist that induces a potent
      anti-viral response characterized by the production of type I interferons (IFN),
      proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Its clinical use has highlighted common local side
      effects including erythema, swelling, scabbing and itching of the skin, and it has
      subsequently been tested in rodents as a potential model of psoriasis.Based on these
      considerations, the aim of this research project is to design a new model of human itch by
      application of Zyclara cream. Further, the aim is to characterize the model and to verify if
      the mechanism of action of imiquimod follows the histaminergic or non-histaminergic pathway
      by using the anti-histamine drug doxepin. Doxepin hydrochloride (HCl) is one of a class of
      agents known as dibenzoxipine tricyclic compounds used for the treatment of clinical
      depression. Doxepin has also been found to have very potent H1 and H2 histamine receptor
      blocking properties. Recent studies have also shown an emerging role of Toll-like receptors
      in the control of pain and itch. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are germline-encoded
      pattern-recognition receptors expressed in both non-neuronal and neuronal cell types in the
      central nervous system (CNS) and contribute to both infectious and non-infectious disorders
      in the CNS. Considering that the involvement of TRP channels in itch pathway has been
      demonstrated, the interaction between the activation of TLR7 receptor and the activation of
      TRPA1 and TRPM8 receptors, which are two of the most important receptors involved in the
      transduction of noxious stimuli, will be evaluated together with the evaluation of to which
      extent these three channel populations functionally overlap.

    <description>To deliver histamine, standard allergy skin prick test (SPT) lancets are applied. The lancets have a 1 mm shouldered tip adapt to introduce a small amount of test substance extremely locally and approximately at the dermo-epidermal junction. .

    <description>Cowhage spicules are 1-2 mm in length and have diameter of 1-3 um at their tip. The active substance delivered (mucunain) has been calculated to be in the nanogram range. The insertion of cowhage spicule(s) rapidly and consistently produces itch with no or very little flare reaction. This insertion is conducted by forceps using a stereo-microscope, and 30-35 spicules are gently rubbed into a 1 cm diameter skin area.</description>
