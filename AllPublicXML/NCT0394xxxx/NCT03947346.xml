  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about biomarkers of kidney function in the
      blood and urine of neuroblastoma survivors. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in
      blood, urine, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process,
      or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a
      treatment for a disease or condition.

    <description>Upon enrollment, all subjects will receive a urine collection kit by mail. Participants will bring in a first-morning urine specimen on the day of their routinely scheduled long-term follow-up visit, and will then have an additional blood and urine sample drawn with their other clinical care labs upon arrival to MSK.</description>

    <description>The urine collected from the first morning void will be used to assess urine creatinine and microalbumin. The fresh urine specimen will be analyzed for novel urinary biomarkers of (urinary NGAL, TGF-Î²1, IL-18 and KIM-1). Serum BUN, creatinine, and cystatin-C will be assessed using serum samples drawn for routine clinical care.</description>
