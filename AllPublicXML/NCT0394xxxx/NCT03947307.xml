  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative edema is a common condition affecting wound healing and function.
      Traditionally, manual lymphatic drainage and compressive bandages have been employed to
      reduce swelling. Kinesiotaping might be an alternative approach. To analyse the efficacy,
      cost-effectiveness, satisfaction, quality of life, functional outcome and and morbidity of
      the use of kinesiotape for the treatment of postoperative edema after knee replacement
      surgery, compared to standard manual lymphatic drainage with compression (i.e. compressive
      stockings or bandages) or sham taping.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be blind to the difference between kinesio- and sham-taping, allowing a double blinded design for the evaluation of the effect of kinesio- versus other tapes. Patient blinding for kinesiotaping versus manual lymphatic drainage is not feasible. The assessment of the primary outcome i.e. the assessment of leg circumference on day 1 and 8 will be performed by a blinded assessor unaware of the treatment allocation.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>assessed on day 8 and week 12 after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported score. The KOOS results in summary scores for five subscales. It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee Problems.</description>

    <description>Patients in the experimental group will receive lymphtaping using Easytape® according to common practice on day 1 after surgery by specifically trained physiotherapists. The tape has an elasticity of 150%. The material is moisture- and air-permeable with a hypoallergenic adhesive coating that is activated by body temperature to increase durability of contact. If possible the taping will be left for 7 days, in case of insufficient adhesion taping will be repeated.</description>
