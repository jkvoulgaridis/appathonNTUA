  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evidence is urgently needed to be able to advise patients on which cannabis-based
      products to take, or to avoid, in managing cancer-related symptoms. This trial was therefore
      designed to determine which cannabis extract combination (High THC-Low CBD, Low THC-High CBD,
      or Equal amounts of THC and CBD) is most effective at treating cancer related symptoms for
      each patient relative to placebo. Investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, N-of-1
      trial to test the effectiveness of each cannabis extract combination using cannabis oils in a
      minimum of 120 patients on 4 cancer-related symptoms: nausea, pain, anxiety and sleep
      disturbance.

      The three active treatments will be the following cannabis oil extract combinations: High
      THC/Low CBD, Low THC/High CBD, and Equal amounts of THC/CBD.

        -  THC = Tetrahydrocannabinol

        -  CBD = Cannabidiol

      The placebo treatment will be coconut/olive oil. The overpowering flavor of the olive oil in
      the active oils and the placebo will effectively blind subjects.

      Primary objective:

      To identify whether there is an active cannabis extract that is more effective than placebo
      in managing overall cancer-related symptoms for individual subjects who completed at least 1
      treatment cycle for the entire patient population represented by those individual subjects,
      and for subsets of that subject population defined by relevant baseline patient
      characteristics.

      Secondary objective:

      To identify whether there is a cannabis extract that is more effective than placebo in
      managing each of the 4 index symptoms (pain, nausea, anxiety and sleep disturbance) for
      individual subjects who completed at least 1 treatment cycle, for the entire patient
      population represented by those individual subjects, and for subsets of that subject
      population defined by relevant baseline patient characteristics.

      Tertiary objectives:

      To investigate the safety (e.g., serious adverse events) of each of the three cannabis
      extracts.

      To identify subject preference of each of the 4 oils (if any).

      Investigators propose a study consisting of a series of N-of-1 trials comparing 3 different
      active cancer-related symptom management treatments against a placebo treatment in terms of
      effectiveness and safety. Using formal statistical modeling, effectiveness will be assessed
      for single patients, for the entire patient population and for relevant subsets of the
      patient population defined by baseline patient characteristics. Safety will be assessed in a
      descriptive fashion for all patients who are part of the safety population.

      Subjects will be on treatment in the study for a minimum of 16 days with the opportunity to
      repeat the 16-day cycle of cancer-related symptom treatment with all four oil extracts up to
      2 more times. The extracts will be supplied to subjects at the beginning of the study in four
      distinct 30-ml bottles, randomly labelled as #1, #2, # 3 and # 4. The random labelling will
      be generated via a computer-generated randomization code.

      The study will include at least 120 adult subjects (recruitment target 150 to allow for
      drop-outs) residing in Canada who have symptoms from cancer and/or from cancer treatment but
      will exclude patients with active recreational use, cannabis use disorder, or high risk of
      diversion.

      Each treatment cycle will have a length of 16 days and will consist of 4 four-day periods.
      The first 2 days of each 4-day period will be a washout period where data will not be used
      for the analysis of effectiveness, to make sure there is no confusion with effects from the
      prior period. Subjects can use one and only one cannabis oil extract during each period to
      treat their cancer-related symptom(s).

      Given a cannabis oil extract, the daily use of that extract by patients will involve the
      following: On each day within a specific treatment cycle, the patient will be asked to take a
      minimum of 3 drops of that extract per day (e.g., in the morning) and if any of the four
      major symptoms (nausea, pain, anxiety, and sleep disturbance) continue to trouble the patient
      as the day progresses, they will be instructed to take up to 3 drops every 4 hours for a
      maximum of 6 times a day (for a total of no more than 18 drops per day).

      All subjects will be instructed to use the following validated scales: Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment Scale (ESAS) and Patients' Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC). The revised
      ESAS will be used modified to include sleep disturbance (previously validated), and added
      night sweats in replacement of the additional symptom option (ESAS-r-SN) because of reports
      of benefit of medical cannabis for this symptom and its relevance for sleep disturbance.This
      is in order to capture a complete picture of potential factors contributing to sleep
      disturbance. Additionally, subjects will be instructed to fill in a study medication use log
      which will record the timing and dose of each extract applications, any side effects
      associated with each application, as well as any rescue medication (if taken).

    <intervention_model_description>An N-of-1 trial is a crossover trial, usually randomized and often blinded, conducted in a single patient. This type of trial provides an objective, data-driven way to determine the most effective intervention for an individual patient from among a set of competing interventions and to investigate the side-effect profiles of each intervention.
It is possible to analyze the results produced by each N-of-1 trial in a series separately in order to determine whether (i) the active treatment(s) involved in the trial were effective for the corresponding patient or (ii) the novel treatment(s) involved in the trial were effective relative to the established treatment. It is also possible to aggregate the results produced by a series of simultaneous N-of-1 trials (all conducted in a similar way) using either meta-analytic methods or mixed effects modelling in order to obtain information on how to treat subsets of the target patient population or even the entire patient population at large.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Average Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) for overall cancer-related symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>16-48 days; 90 minutes after each dose</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC provides a single, general estimate of improvement or deterioration using scores from 1 to 7 and has been used as a research outcome indicator in a variety of contexts, particularly in chronic pain.
The PGIC asks subjects to rate their current status as:
No change (or condition worse)
Almost the same (hardly any change at all)
A little better (no noticeable change)
Somewhat better (change has not made any real difference
Moderately better (slight but noticeable change)
Better (definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference)
A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference
Subjects will be reporting their PGIC score 90 minutes after each dose of cannabis oil (1 to 6 times daily). Only scores collected on non-washout days of a treatment cycle corresponding to a particular oil formulation will be used.</description>

    <measure>Average change from baseline in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System - revised to include Sleep Disturbance and Night Sweats (ESAS-r-SN) score</measure>
    <time_frame>16-48 days; once daily</time_frame>
    <description>The ESAS-r-SN is a set of 0-10 numerical scales that patients use to rate the severity of the most common cancer-related symptoms. A score of 0 means that patients are not experiencing that symtpom and a score of 10 indicates that patients are experiencing the most severe symptom (for example, experiencing a pain score of 10 indicates worst possible pain).
Subjects will be reporting their ESAS-r-SN scores once daily. Only scores collected on non-washout days of a treatment cycle corresponding to a particular oil formulation will be used.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked by study personnel at the end of the study which oil they preferred most (i.e. Oil 1, 2, 3, or 4) after study completion but prior to un-blinding and preference of oils will be recorded. Percentages of subjects who prefer each type of oil will be recorded.</description>
