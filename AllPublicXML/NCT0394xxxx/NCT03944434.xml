  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II, multicenter, single arm trial to assess the feasibility of first line ribociclib in
      combination with a non steroidal aromatase inhibitor in women or men aged 70 years-old or
      older, with hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative advanced breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are generally more susceptible to the side effects of active treatments.
      Patients entered in clinical trials, especially the elderly, are not completely
      representative of the &quot;real&quot; population because of selection process. The lack of data
      collected from a real population turns the indication of treatment a challenging task and
      expose older patients to a risk of under treatment (fear of excessive toxicity because of the
      lack of data).

      With the aim of covering this gap, we are planning to run a phase II trial evaluating the
      feasibility of delivering the combination of ribociclib plus NSAI as first-line treatment
      specifically in a population of breast cancer patients aged ≥70 years.

      Primary endpoint:

      • The treatment feasibility will be evaluated as the proportion of patients not having
      experienced disease progression (PD), still on treatment with ribociclib plus NSAI 6 months
      after the first drug administration

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Treatment adherence

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Patient reported outcomes (PROs)

        -  Overall response rate (ORR)

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)
