    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to analyze the chronic effects of sedentary behavior breaks using
      the leg extension isometric exercise in the cardiovascular health indicators of healthy
      adults exposed to prolonged time in the sitting position. The patients recruited will be
      randomized into two groups: leg extension isometric training (TIE) and control group (CG).
      The TIE group will perform 12 weeks of isometric training. The CG will be advised not to
      change their routine activities, especially diet and physical activities.In the pre and
      post-intervention periods cardiovascular measures will be obtained.

    <textblock>
      Long periods in sedentary behavior promote deterioration of vascular function, which is
      directly associated with the occurence of chronic noncommunicable diseases. In this context,
      the execution of interruptions in this behavior (breaks) is recommended. Studies have shown
      benefits of isometric training in vascular function, which could be useful to minimize the
      consequences of time spent in sedentary behavior. Thus, the goal of this study is to analyze
      the chronic effects of sedentary behavior breaks using leg extension isometric exercise in
      the cardiovascular health indicators of adults exposed to prolonged time in the sitting
      position. The target population of the study will consist of healthy subjects above 18 years
      of age of both genders. All subjects will be submitted to measurements of endothelial
      function, blood pressure and cardiac autonomic modulation. After these measurements, the
      subjects will be randomized into two groups: leg extension isometric training group (TIE) and
      control group (CG). After 12 weeks both groups will be submitted to the same measurements
      from pre-intervention.
