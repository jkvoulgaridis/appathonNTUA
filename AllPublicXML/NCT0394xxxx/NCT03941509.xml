      The study will explore the impact of a nurse-led bundled antimicrobial stewardship
      intervention on the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in residential aged care facilities.
      The intervention will be assessed in a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial
      across 14 residential aged care facilities over an 18-month period.

    <textblock>
      The study will explore the impact of a nurse-led bundled antimicrobial stewardship
      intervention on the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in residential aged care facilities
      (RACFs).

      The antimicrobial stewardship intervention will include the following components:

        1. Education

             -  Focused on antimicrobial stewardship and appropriate antimicrobial use

             -  Delivered face-to-face, via workbooks and fact sheets to aged care staff, general
                practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, and residents and families. Education will be
                delivered by the research coordinator.

        2. Guidelines

             -  Aged care-specific guidelines for the assessment and antimicrobial management of
                urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections and skin and soft tissue
                infections.

             -  Antimicrobial management recommendations including empirical oral therapy, doses
                and duration of therapy.

        3. Communication

             -  Documentation for the assessment and antimicrobial management of infections.

             -  Nurse-led engagement with residents and families.

             -  Newsletters and online updates to highlight evidence-based prescribing practice

        4. Audit and feedback - Surveillance and feedback to prescribers on antimicrobial use and
           facility-level antimicrobial susceptibility data.

      The intervention bundle will first be implemented and tested for feasibility and
      acceptability over a 3-month period in two RACFs in Victoria, Australia. This tailored
      intervention will then be assessed in a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial
      across 14 RACFs over an 18-month period.

      A cluster of two facilities will each transition through three phases over the 18 month
      trial:

        -  Control phase: baseline data collection. Usual care at each facility.

        -  Transition phase: Delivery of education and integration of the intervention. No data
           collection.

        -  Intervention phase: implementation of the intervention and outcome data collection.
           Ongoing education to new and existing staff will be provided as required.

      Following the 18-month trial, the refined intervention bundle will be implemented nationally
      across a network of RACFs.

    <intervention_model_description>Stepped-wedge design will see a staggered roll out of the intervention over 18 months. Each cluster of two facilities will commence in the control phase (2 months) and transition to the intervention phase until all facilities receive the intervention. A transition phase of 2 months between the control and intervention phase will occur to allow for education and integration of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
