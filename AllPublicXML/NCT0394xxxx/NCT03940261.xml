  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise is recommended for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and can improve
      quality of life, both physically and mentally. The most efficacious program to achieve these
      exercise benefits is unknown. Recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been
      shown to be safe and more effective in many high-risk populations with limited exercise
      tolerance. Shorter bouts of exercise are likely better tolerated in PD due to difficulty
      sustaining muscle contractions. The goal of this project is to determine whether HIIT
      produces superior cardiorespiratory, neuromuscular, biomechanical, and clinical adaptations
      than conventional continuous moderate intensity training (CMIT) in PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific research aims are to compare, in PD, the effects of HIIT or CMIT on: 1) maximal
      exercise capacity; 2) neural and non-neural factors contributing to muscle strength, power
      and fatigability; 3) biomechanical measures of postural stability and gait; and 4) Clinical
      markers (Mini-BESTest and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)). The
      investigators hypothesize that, HIIT will produce greater improvements in: 1) exercise
      capacity; 2) muscle strength, power and reduced fatigability; 3) stability and gait velocity;
      and 4) clinical markers.

      Methods: This pilot project will involve a randomized trial of 30 individuals with PD
      comparing the effects of HIIT and CMIT. Training will be completed thrice weekly for 10
      weeks. Participants will include men and women between 50-85 years of age, who are able to
      stand unsupported for 1 min, walk 18m without use of an aid, and mount a stationary bike.
      Participants will be randomized to either HIIT (10, 1-minute cycling intervals at 90% of peak
      power output, each separated by 1-min at 10% peak power output) or CMIT (30-50min cycling at
      60% of peak power output). Participants will undergo the following pre- and post-training
      assessments: Cardiovascular testing will examine hemodynamic and efferent muscle sympathetic
      responses to static handgrip exercise and post-exercise circulatory occlusion; Neuromuscular
      testing will examine muscle activity (electromyography) during voluntary and electrically
      stimulated contractions of the knee extensors; Biomechanical testing will examine whole-body
      stability, gait, and balance patterns; and Clinical risk assessments (Mini-BESTest and
      UPDRS).
