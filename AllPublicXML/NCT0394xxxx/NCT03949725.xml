  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hans Kai trial is a randomized wait-list controlled trial looking at the impact of the
      Hans Kai program, a peer-led, self-sustaining preventative health program that empower
      participants to take control of their health with social support. The interventions consists
      of a health school to develop health knowledge and skills, then participants form Hans Kai
      groups of 3 or more people, who meet on a monthly basis independently in a self-sustaining
      model. The trial will look at the impact of the 6 months of the Hans Kai program, compared to
      wait list control, on mental health, loneliness, health behavior changes and clinical
      measures of cardio-metabolic health.

    <measure>Mental Health</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mental health will be measured using the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF). MHC-SF measures emotional, social and psychological well-being by assessing the regularity with which respondents experience symptoms of positive mental health. The MHC-SF contains 14 items: 3 items for emotional well-being, 5 items for social well-being, and 6 items for psychological well-being. Each item is assessed with a 6-point Likert (0-5) scale. Items are summed, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 70. Higher scores indicate greater levels of positive well-being.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Friendship and Social Connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation will be measured by the UCLA loneliness scale. The UCLA Loneliness Scale is a 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item on a scale from 1 (Never) to 4 (Often), yielding a total score ranging from 20 to 80, with lower scores indicating greater loneliness and/or social isolation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Knowledge and Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health knowledge and self-efficacy will be measured using the perceived health competence scale (PHCS). The eight-item PHCS is a measure of general health management self-efficacy beliefs scored on a 5-point Likert scale designed to measure an individual's self-perceived ability to accomplish things that are undertaken or that are important to the individual.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Behavior</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
