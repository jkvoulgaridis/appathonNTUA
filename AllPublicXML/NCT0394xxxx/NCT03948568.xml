  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REaCT-RETT will demonstrate the non-inferiority of concurrent compared to sequential
      endocrine therapy in patients receiving post-operative radiotherapy for early stage breast
      cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical equipoise exists around the optimal time to start adjuvant endocrine therapy in
      patients who will receive post-operative radiotherapy for breast cancer. Patients receive
      either concurrent or sequential endocrine and radiation therapy, where concurrent therapy
      consists of endocrine therapy started before, with or during radiotherapy, while sequential
      treatment is defined as endocrine therapy starting after the completion of radiotherapy. A
      recent survey of Canadian oncologists showed that the main reason for prescribing sequential
      endocrine therapy was a concern that concurrent endocrine therapy and radiotherapy would
      worsen the toxicity of endocrine treatment. This is despite the absence of any clinical trial
      evidence to support this. Indeed, a recent systematic review by our group was unable to
      confirm or refute whether increased toxicities, related to the timing of endocrine therapy
      and radiotherapy actually exist in clinical practice. The investigators are therefore
      proposing a pragmatic randomised trial to assess whether or not concurrent endocrine therapy
      and radiotherapy worsens endocrine treatment-related symptoms in an era of modern endocrine
      and radiation therapy.

    <description>To measure endocrine toxicity. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Endocrine Sub-scale (FACT-ES) is a questionnaire specific to patients with endocrine symptoms and measures the side effects and putative benefits of hormonal treatments given (endocrine therapy) in breast cancer. The FACT-ES questionnaire is comprised of 5 sections; physical well-being (7 questions), social/family well-being (7 questions), emotional well-being (6 questions), functional well-being (7 questions) and additional concerns (19 questions). A total of 46 questions are asked that all contain an answer on a scale range of 0-4, with 0 representing the answer 'not at all' and 4 representing the answer 'very much'. Of the 46 questions asked 31/46 have 'very much' representing the worst answer and the remaining 15/46 have 'very much' representing the best answer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiotherapy toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (+/- 2 weeks) post final fraction of radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the acute and early-moderate late toxicities of radiotherapy in terms of skin toxicity, pneumonitis, and breast pain. This will be recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, with breast cosmesis recorded as per the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) cosmetic rating system for breast cancer. These standardized criteria have been used in a recent Canadian breast radiation randomized trial, RAPID, and the investigators will use a similar template to record any radiation toxicities at different points of time.</description>

    <description>To measure the patient quality of life using the validated FACT-B questionnaire. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer (FACT-B) is a questionnaire that measures multidimensional quality of life in patients with breast cancer. The FACT-B questionnaire is comprised of 5 sections; physical well-being (7 questions), social/family well-being (7 questions), emotional well-being (6 questions), functional well-being (7 questions) and additional concerns (10 questions). A total of 37 questions are asked that all contain an answer on a scale range of 0-4, with 0 representing the answer 'not at all' and 4 representing the answer 'very much'. Of the 46 questions asked 20/37 have 'very much' representing the worst answer and the remaining 17/37 have 'very much' representing the best answer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (+/- 2 weeks) post final fraction of radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per one quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per one endocrine toxicity case averted) will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire consists of two sections; the descriptive system and the visual analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and has 5 levels associated with it (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). The scale range of 1-5 is used for the 5 dimensions where 1 is the best outcome and 5 is the worst outcome. The Visual Analogue scale records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual scale with endpoints labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; at the top and &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; at the bottom. This ranges 0-100 with 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory analyses on evaluating radiotherapy toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (+/- 2 weeks) post final fraction of radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory analyses will be performed evaluating toxicity in patients receiving different types of radiotherapy (i.e. local versus regional radiotherapy). This will be evaluated using data collected on breast volume, seroma size, dose heterogeneity and the time of stimulation and planning.</description>
