    <textblock>
      This is a non-confirmatory, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, subject- and
      investigator-blinded, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy of LOU064 in patients
      with inadequately controlled asthma. All subjects will be randomized with 3:2 ratio to
      receive LOU064 experimental dose. or LOU064 matching placebo treatment for 12 weeks with
      standard background therapy of budesonide 80µg/formoterol 4.5µg two inhalations b.i.d.. This
      study will enroll approximately 75 subjects. The total duration for each subject in the study
      is approximately 20 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adult patients aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 70 years at screening.

          -  Patients must weigh at least 40 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body
             mass index (BMI) &lt;35 kg/m2. BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2 at screening

          -  Patients with a physician-diagnosed history of asthma (according to GINA 2018) for a
             period of at least 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Patients who have been treated with:

          -  Medium or high dose ICS, or

          -  ICS plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA), or

          -  ICS plus leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), or

          -  ICS plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and long lasting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
             for at least 1 month prior to screening and on the same doses of the above mentioned
             medications over at least 2 weeks prior to start of the run-in period.

          -  Post-bronchodilator reversibility of FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL at screening. If
             reversibility is not demonstrated at screening, then two additional attempts are
             permitted (one at the run-in visit and the last one during the run-in period between
             the run-in visit and baseline visit if needed)

          -  Spirometry with pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 40% of predicted (at screening and baseline)
             and ≤ 85% of predicted at the baseline visit.

          -  ACQ-5 score ≥ 1.5 at baseline visit

          -  ≥ 80% compliance with peak expiratory flow measurement and recording of symptoms in
             the eDiary during the run-in period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had an asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids,
             hospitalization, or emergency room visit within 6 weeks prior to screening or during
             the screening period.

          -  Patients who have smoked or inhaled any substance other than asthma medications within
             the 6 month period prior to screening, or who have a smoking history of greater than
             10 pack years (e.g. 10 pack years = 1 pack/day x 10 years or ½ pack/day x 20 years,
             etc.).

          -  History of life-threatening asthma event such as significant hypercarbia (pCO2 &gt; 45
             mmHg), endotracheal intubation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV),
             respiratory arrest, or seizure as a result of asthma.

          -  Patients with chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not limited to)
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, clinically significant bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome,
             allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis, or clinically significant chronic lung
             diseases related to a history of tuberculosis or asbestosis.

          -  History or current diagnosis of ECG abnormalities indicating significant risk of
             safety for subjects participating in the study such as:

          -  Concomitant clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. sustained ventricular
             tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree AV block without a
             pacemaker

          -  History of familial long QT syndrome or known family history of Torsades de Pointes

          -  Resting heart rate (physical exam or 12 lead ECG) &lt; 50 bpm at screening

          -  Resting QTcF ≥ 450 msec (male) or ≥ 460 msec (female) at screening or inability to
             determine the QTcF interval

          -  Use of agents known to prolong the QT interval unless they can be permanently
             discontinued for the duration of study

          -  At screening and/or run-in period, any severe, progressive or uncontrolled, acute or
             chronic, medical or psychiatric condition, or other factors such as abnormal vital
             signs, ECG or physical findings, or clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values,
             that in the judgment of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study
             participation/treatment or may interfere with interpretation of study results, and
             thus would make the patient inappropriate for entry into or continuing the study.

          -  Major surgery within 8 weeks prior to screening or surgery planned prior to end of
             study.

          -  History of live attenuated vaccine within 6 weeks prior to randomization or
             requirement to receive vaccinations at any time during the study.

          -  Hematology parameters at screening:

          -  Hemoglobin: &lt; 10 g/dl

          -  Platelets: &lt; 100 000/mm3

          -  White blood cells: &lt; 3 000/mm3

          -  Neutrophils: &lt; 1 500/mm3

          -  Significant bleeding risk or coagulation disorders.

          -  History of gastrointestinal bleeding, e.g. in association with use of Nonsteroidal
             Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID).

          -  Requirement for anti-platelet or anticoagulant medication (e.g., warfarin, or
             clopidogrel or Novel Oral Anti-Coagulant - NOAC) other than acetylsalicylic acid (up
             to 100 mg/d).

          -  History or presence of thrombotic or thromboembolic event, or increased risk for
             thrombotic or thromborembolic event.
