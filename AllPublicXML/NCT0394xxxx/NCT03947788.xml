  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot assessment of whether practices that implement the One Key Question®
      (OKQ) pregnancy intention screening tool will demonstrate differences in patient-reported
      receipt of preconception and/or contraceptive counseling, compared to practices that provide
      usual care. The study team surveyed patients at six practices within NorthShore University
      HealthSystem to establish baseline rates of counseling. To assess OKQ's effects on patient
      care, this pilot study will expose half of the practices to the OKQ tool. After these
      practices implement OKQ, patients will be surveyed at both intervention and control (usual
      care) practices to measure changes in preconception and contraceptive care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effectively delivered preconception counseling leads to healthier pregnancy behaviors.
      However, many clinicians miss opportunities to provide this counseling due to a lack of
      processes in place to provide this counseling and access to evidence based care once the need
      is identified. The purpose of this study is to build upon baseline data collected on
      pregnancy intention and receipt of contraceptive and preconception counseling.

      Half of the study practices that have already been surveyed will be randomly selected to
      receive comprehensive One Key Question® Training through the nonprofit Power To Decide. These
      practices have already displayed interest in taking part in this intervention.The training
      will act as our intervention, and will be given to help improve the quality of preconception
      and contraceptive counseling in Primary Care and Obstetrics/Gynecology. All of the
      participating practices will then be surveyed again to determine changes in contraception and
      preconception counseling. After patient data collection is complete, the research assistant
      will return to each practice to collect surveys from clinicians and staff (this includes:
      physicians, nurses, medical assistants, patient support associates, or anyone that
      participated in the OKQ training) at the intervention practices to assess the experience of
      implementing OKQ and their perceptions of its utility for patients. Following the second
      round of surveys, the remaining practices will receive Power To Decide training.
