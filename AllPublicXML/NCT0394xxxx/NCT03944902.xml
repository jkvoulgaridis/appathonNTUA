  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the efficacy of the combination of CB-839 with
      Niraparib in platinum resistant BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer patients. The primary and
      secondary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CB-839 in combination
      with Niraparib and to determine the response rate and percentage of participants who remain
      progression free at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the scientific rationale, pre-clinical data, and clinical data available to date,
      and the need for further treatment options in patients that are platinum resistance that are
      specifically BRCA wild-type. Only patients carrying wild type BRCA genes will be enrolled in
      the study. The proposed research tests a new therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer with a
      very novel mechanistic target: metabolic dependency of ovarian cancer. Pre-clinical results
      indicate that both serous and clear cells ovarian cancers have upregulation of Hypoxia
      Inducible Factors (HIF) HIF1a and Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIF) HIF2a regulated genes. In
      addition, cell line models of these tumors display sensitivity to CB-839 in vitro. Ovarian
      cancers resistant to standard platinum chemotherapy may thus respond to treatment with this
      glutaminase inhibitor. The majority of patients do not present mutations in BRCA or any other
      genes of the Fanconi pathway, but their tumors may respond to CB-839, which in turn may lead
      to genomic instabilities due to nucleotide deprivation; therefore, CB-839 could sensitize the
      tumors to treatment with Niraparib.
