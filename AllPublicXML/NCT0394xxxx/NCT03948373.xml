  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to evaluate the effect of CPAP treatment on blood pressure (BP) in
      normotensive patients with dipper circadian pattern with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome
      (SAHS). The secondary objectives are: i) To evaluate the prevalence of the different
      circadian patterns of BP in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) ii) To establish the
      relationship between CPAP compliance and BP response; iii) Identify which ABPM variables and
      biomarkers are related to BP response; iv) Evaluate changes in the biomarkers' profile with
      the CPAP treatment. Methodology: Open-label, parallel, prospective, randomized and controlled
      trial including normotensive patients diagnosed with severe SAHS without significant
      somnolence. 64 patients with dipper circadian pattern will be included and will be randomized
      to receive CPAP (32) or conservative treatment (32). ABPM and blood sample collection will be
      performed at the beginning of the study and at 3 months.

      1. Recruitment: Normotensive subjects referred to the sleep unit of the Hospital Santa
           Maria (Spain) who are diagnosed of severe OSA (AHI≥30) by a sleep study and dipper
           circadian blood pattern confirmed by ABPM and who do not present significant somnolence
           (Epworth≤18) will be included in the study.

        2. Definition of the groups: Patients will be randomized to receive one of the following
           treatments:

             1. CPAP: Patients who will receive CPAP treatment. The CPAP titration will be carried
                out with an automatic or manual CPAP according to usual clinical practice.

             2. Conservative treatment: Patients who will receive conservative treatment based on
                hygienic-dietetic measures.

        3. Randomization: It will be carried out with an automated platform

        4. Duration of the treatment: All patients randomized to CPAP will begin treatment as soon
           as possible after randomization, and will continue treatment until the study ends (3
           months).

           Patients who interrupt treatment will be excluded from the study. ABPM and blood sample
           collection will be performed on all included patients at the beginning of the study and
           at 3 months under treatment (CPAP or conservative care).

        5. Follow-up: All patients will be evaluated at the beginning of the study (T0), at first
           month (T1) and at three months (T2), during the follow-up period.

Learning Phase: complete profile analysis (754 miRNAs) will be carried out in 24 patients Learning Phase: complete profile analysis (754 miRNAs) will be carried out in 24 patients representative of the change in BP in treated patients. The miRNAs associated with the change in BP will be identified from the 754 miRNAs potentially present in serum and plasma.
Validation Phase: Specific primers will be designed for the real-time PCR amplification of the genes for which we have found a significant association The miRNAs found will be analyzed after 3 months of treatment. Analysis of biomarkers. Immunoassay techniques will evaluate the following markers before and after treatment: angiotensin I, II and III, plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and endogenous ouabain.</description>
