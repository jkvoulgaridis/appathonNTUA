  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of abnormal excessive sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits,
      hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused
      by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands.

      Current therapies have limited effectiveness, significant side effects, and can be invasive
      and costly. Sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) is a novel soft-drug in development for the
      topical treatment of hyperhidrosis.

      This Phase 3 study will assess the safety and efficacy of sofpironium bromide, 15% gel versus
      vehicle (2 treatment arms), applied for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of topically applied sofpironium bromide, 15% gel in subjects with
      axillary hyperhidrosis.

      Safety will be assessed through collection of vital signs, adverse events, local skin
      responses, hematology, serum chemistry laboratory testing and urinalysis.

      A maximum of 450 subjects will be randomized to receive either sofpironium bromide gel, 15%
      or vehicle.

      Adverse events, vital signs, and local tolerability assessments will be collected at visits
      across the study. Urine pregnancy tests will be taken throughout the course of the study for
      women of child bearing potential. Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed for
      routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters at specified visits.
      Patient-reported outcome assessments will be recorded during the study at predefined time
      points.

      The study will be comprised of a total of 13 scheduled visits to take place over
      approximately 11 to 15 weeks.

          -  Diagnosis of primary axillary hyperhidrosis that meets the following criteria: (a)
             symptoms of hyperhydrosis for at least 6 months' duration, (b) HDSM-Ax of 3 - 4 and
