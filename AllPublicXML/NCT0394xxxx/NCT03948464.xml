  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial that will compare slow release oral
      morphine vs methadone as a second line oral treatment for opioid use disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Slow-release oral morphine (SROM) has emerged as a promising yet understudied form of oral
      treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), with preliminary studies suggesting similar efficacy
      rates as methadone with respect to promoting abstinence, and with better improvements in a
      number of patient-reported outcomes, including tolerability, treatment satisfaction, mental
      symptoms, and craving. The proposed study is an open-label, non-inferiority, randomized
      controlled trial evaluating the relative effectiveness, safety and acceptability of SROM vs.
      methadone for the treatment of OUD in outpatient clinical settings. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to SROM or methadone for 24 weeks. Data linkages performed three years after
      randomization will evaluate long term health outcomes. This study aims to provide evidence to
      optimize care for individuals with OUD, and potentially increase access to additional form of
      evidence-based oral treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the overall proportion of opioid-free urine drug screens during the 24 weeks of active treatment (excluding the assigned therapy and it's metabolites), with missing samples defined as being positive for opioids</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment retention will be measured by the proportion of participants on the assigned opioid agonist treatment (OAT) at the end of the study, defined as having both a) an active prescription for the assigned OAT at week 24, and b) a positive urine drug screen result for the assigned OAT at week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events Related to Study Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of each study medication will be evaluated by monitoring and gathering information on adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), including overdoses, from the time of treatment initiation until the Safety Follow-up Visit. AEs and SAEs will be summarized by MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) System Organ Class and Preferred Term, and the frequency and nature of AEs and SAEs will be compared across treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Overdose Events</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Non-fatal overdoses since the previous visit will be assessed at baseline and every 12 weeks during the 24-week active treatment period, through a combination of self-report and participant's medical record. Data on fatal overdoses will be captured using vital statistics, and supplemented with information from contacts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction: Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction with the assigned treatment will be assessed through administration of the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) at weeks 4, 12 and 24 of the study. This single-item patient-completed questionnaire evaluates participant's satisfaction with treatment medication on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;extremely dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;extremely satisfied.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological functioning will be measured by the &quot;PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Emotional Distress -Anxiety-Short Form&quot; and the &quot;PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression-Short Form&quot; measures for anxiety and depression. These instruments will be administered at baseline, as well as at weeks 4, 12 and 24. These measures sum the frequency with which a participant experiences symptoms of depression and anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Drug-Related Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) Self-Report Form will be used to assess changes in drug-related problems between baseline and week 24. The ASI has 34 questions. The answer value of each question is divided by its maximum answer value and the total number of questions, and the individual results are then summed to create a composite value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life: EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between baseline and the end of treatment will be measured by the EuroQol &quot;EQ-5D-5L&quot; tool. The EQ-5D-5L will be administered at baseline and every 4 weeks during the 24-week active treatment period. The EQ-5D-5L includes a 5-level descriptive system and a visual analogue scale.The descriptive system has five categories (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each of which will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the least severe and 5 being the most severe. The visual analogue scale is a vertical scale from 0 to 100, with 0 labelled &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid cravings over time will be measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS will be administered at baseline, week 2, week 4, and every 4 weeks for the remainder of the 24-week active treatment period. The VAS is a horizontal scale with 11 lines labeled from left to right with the numbers &quot;0&quot; to &quot;10&quot;, and word anchors at each end representing the extremes, where &quot;0=no craving&quot; and &quot;100 mm=most intense craving&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Other Substance Use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Use of other substances will be measured using the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) instrument, which will be administered at baseline and every study visit thereafter.</description>
