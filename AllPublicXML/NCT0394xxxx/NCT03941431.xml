  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore intervention time of Chinese medicine and
      specification of a sequential treatment plan for severe psoriasis with Chinese and Western
      medicine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease that seriously affects the quality of
      life of patients. Both Chinese medicine and Western medicine have many methods for treating
      psoriasis, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, but the pursuit of green and
      effective treatment programs is still the focus of the work of specialists and researchers.
      How to combine the existing safe and effective Chinese and Western medicine methods
      organically, and to achieve the purpose of improving efficacy under the premise of ensuring
      safety, is the motivation for carrying out this research.

      The treatments involved in this study include cupping, phototherapy, and Chinese medicine.
      All three methods have sufficient literature to confirm their effectiveness in treating
      plaque psoriasis. The research team hopes to obtain a best combination of three treatments
      for plaque psoriasis by using a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis area and severity index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index involves grading psoriatic plaques based on erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D). Severity is graded from 0-4 for each criteria (0 - none, 1 - slight, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe, and 4 - very severe). The body is divided into 4 regions, head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, and for each region, the surface area involvement is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 - 0% involvement, 1 - &lt;10%, 2 - 10-&lt;30%, 3 - 30-&lt;50%, 4 - 50-&lt;70%, 5 - 70-&lt;90%, 6 - 90-100%).The highest potential PASI score is 72, with higher PASI scores indicating worse psoriasis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of BSA involved in psoriasis is estimated by fingerprinting, where the entire palm of the patient represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints on psoriasis skin in a body part is used to determine the extent to which the body part is affected by psoriasis (%)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D) across all psoriatic lesions. It is calculated as follows: PGA score = (E + I + D) / 3, then the score needs to be rounded to the nearest whole number [PGA scale: Clear (0) - Very Severe (5)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life quality index(DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a participant-reported questionnaire used to measure the health-related quality of life (QOL) of adults suffering from a skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PRQoL is used to assess the impact of psoriasis on individual social life. Scores range from 0-25, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's social life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure lesion pruritus from 0 to 100 mm at eash visit (with 0 being no pruritis and 100 being maximum pruritis).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TCM symptom score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The TCM symptom score is used to assess changes in blood syndrome related symptoms during treatment.</description>
