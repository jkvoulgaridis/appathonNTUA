  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of administering
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) therapy, iAluRil®, intravesically in individuals with acute spinal
      cord injury (SCI), commencing within the first ten days of injury, to prevent early urinary
      tract infections.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      iAluRil®, listed as a medical device on the Australian Therapeutic Goods Registry (ATGR),
      contains both hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate. This trial utilises iAluRil® for the
      same clinical indication as it is listed for on the ATGR, i.e. to re-establish the
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layers of the urothelial vesical tissue in cases in which their loss
      can cause problems, such as recurrent urinary tract infection in neurologically intact
      populations, but in a specific and vulnerable patient population (acute SCI). The trial will
      demonstrate the safety and feasibility of providing a series of iAluRil® treatments in early
      acute SCI, and provide an indication of effectiveness to prevent early urinary tract
      infections (compared to current standard infection control), informing researchers about the
      suitability of conducting a large randomised controlled clinical trial with this
      intervention.

      An 'Intervention post-UTI' arm for eligible patients with SCI who could not be enrolled
      within 10 days of injury, and have significant recurrent UTIs during their inpatient
      admission, will allow equivalent data collection and observations, informing researchers
      about a trial to reduce UTI recurrence during sub-acute/chronic SCI.
