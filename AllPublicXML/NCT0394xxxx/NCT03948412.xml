  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, partially-blinded randomised controlled trial, with site
      stratified block randomisation and partial blinding of outcome assessments. Patients
      undergoing a renal transplant will be allocated to one of two treatment arms, where either a
      Prevena device of appropriate size or standard dressing is applied to the closed incision. In
      the case that a patient requires bilateral incisions, both incisions will be allocated to the
      same treatment arm and counted as a single incision.

      Primary:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the Prevena Incision Management System
      reduces wound complications at the surgical site following renal transplant, when compared to
      standard dressings. Secondary: Secondary objectives of this study include identification of
      risk factors for wound complications at the surgical site, as well as re-operation, prolonged
      hospital stay, allograft survival, delayed graft function. This study will also assess pain,
      scar healing and quality of life in each treatment arm, and aim to complete a cost-benefit
      analysis of the Prevena device in renal transplantation.

    <time_frame>0-90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of patient reported post-operative wound pain scale between groups utilising a generic numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain.
A numeric rating scale is a way a patient can report pain from 0-10, 0 being no pain, 10 being extreme pain. Minimum score is 0, maximum score is 10. It is better to have less pain, therefore 0 is the best score possible.</description>

    <time_frame>0-90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of observer and patient reported scarring utilising the POSAS (The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale: POSAS).
The observer questions are listed below and are each scored from 1 to 10, 1 being normal skin, 10 being worst scar imaginable.
Vascularity
Pigmentation
Thickness
Relief
Pliability
Surface area
Overall opinon of scar The patient scale questions are listed below and are each scored from 1 to 10, 1 being normal skin, 10 being the worst scar imaginable.
1. Has the scar been painful the past few weeks? 2. Has the scar been itching the past few weeks? 3. Skin Colour 4. Skin stiffness 5. Skin Thickness 6. Scar irregularity 7. Overall opinion of scar The total score for patient and observer subscales is out of 70 each, for a combined total of 140 (both subscales added together). The minimum possible score is 14 and the maximum score is 140.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L score)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-90days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of quality of life scores reported by patients in each group using the EQ-5D-5L quality of life scale.
The scale is split into 5 subscales;
mobility
self-care
usual activities
pain/discomfort
anxiety/depression. Each subscale is ranked from 1 to 5, 1 being nil pain/quality of life disturbance, 5 being extreme pain/quality of life disturbance. The subscales are reported separately and are not combined.
The patient also completes an overall health assessment from 0-100, 0 being the worst health imaginable, 100 being the best health imaginable. This is also reported and analysed separately.</description>

    <description>Wound scoring by a wound assessor.
Scored:
0-5 for serous discharge and erythema (each), 0 being nil, 5 being significant. 0-10 for purulent exudate and separation of deep tissues (each), 0 being nil, 10 being significant.
Isolation of bacteria on wound swap, 0 for no bacterial, 10 for bacterial growth.
Further scores of 10 (for antibiotic usage), 5 (for drainage of pus under local anaesthesia), 10 (for debridement under general anaesthesia) and 5 (for prolonged inpatient stay &gt;14 days).
All scores are added together for a total of 70, 0 being the minimum possible (best) score and 70 being the maximum possible (worst) score.</description>
