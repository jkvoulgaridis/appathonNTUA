    <textblock>
      This is a prospective,randomized, cross over study comparing the efficacy and safety of
      nebulizedfurosemide with Intra Venous (IV)furosemide in preterm infants who areventilator-and
      oxygen dependent. Reviewing the patient census on Neo data by the Sub Investigator will
      identify the potential subjects. Subject will be randomized to either A arm or B arm.
      Subjects in the A arm will receive 1 mg/kg of inhaled furosemideQ 24 hours for 3 days. This
      will be followed by a washout period of a day followed by 1mg/kg of intravenous furosemide Q
      24 hours for 3 days. Subjects in the B arm will receive 1 mg/kg of intravenous furosemide Q
      24 hours for 3 days followed by a washout period, which is then followed by 1 mg/kg of
      inhaled furosemide Q 24 hours for 3 days.
