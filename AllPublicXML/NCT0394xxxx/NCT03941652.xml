      The principal aim of the eMOM GDM-project is to evaluate the effect of the eMOM GDM
      -application and the integrated service concept model on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

      In the first phase of the project the investigators evaluate the usability, functionality and
      acceptability of developed eMOM GDM application and used sensors (continuous glucose meter,
      accelerometer, speech-enabled food record, optical pulse, beat-to-beat heart rate).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of the eMOM GDM -project consists of two parts.

      Phase 1.1. the usability of the sensors will be evaluated by asking participants with GDM
      diagnosis (n = up to 10) to use the sensors (Garmin Vivosmart 3, Medtronic Guardian Connect,
      Firstbeat Bodyguard 2, and Exced) and by collecting participants' blood glucose values from
      glucose meter (Contour Next ONE) for one week. Participants fill out a logbook for physical
      activity and sleeping for seven days, and a logbook for diet for three days during the study
      period. For ensuring the quality of food record a researcher will phone interview the
      participant based on her diet recordings.

      Before starting using the sensors, the participants will fill Background questionnaire and
      Technology acceptance questionnaire (UTAUT). After the usage period, the participants will
      fill the same Technology acceptance questionnaire (UTAUT) and take part in semi-structured
      interview. The interview has to parts. In the first part, participants will be interviewed
      about the acceptability of sensors. In the second part, researcher will show a non-functional
      prototype of eMoM GDM application to the participant and will ask predetermined questions.
      Interview will be recorded and data obtained from the interviews will be transcribed for
      analysis.

      Phase 1.2. will define major usability issues with different versions of functional
      prototypes of eMOM GDM application developed in the project before moving to phase 2 of the
      study. General pregnant women (n = up to 30 in total) and GDM women (n=up to 10) will use the
      available version of the application for one week, and afterward the participants with GDM
      will take part in semi-structured interview. Interview will be recorded and data will be
      transcribed for analysis. General pregnant women will fill out a web form of usability of the
      application after application week. Based on the responses of the form, the participants may
      be contacted for further inquiries about the usability issues they have reported. For
      ensuring the quality of food record a researcher will phone interview all participants based
      on her diet recordings.

    <measure>Basic version of the eMOM GDM application has developed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Goal of the eMOM GDM -project is develop an application for gestational diabetes. The basic version of eMOM GDM application is ready to use in Phase 2 when in all sectors of Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) scale have mean of 50 or higher during the same development period (sprint). SUMI is a rigorously tested and proven method of measuring software quality from the end user's point of view. Sectors which SUMI measures are efficiency, affect, helpfulness, control, learnability, and global usability of software.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of sensors assessed by UTAUT questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability of the sensors (Medtronic Guardian Connect, Garmin Vivosmart 3, Firsbeat Bodyguard 2, UKK Exsed, Ascensia Contour Next One) will be assessed by UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology)-questionnaire. UTAUT-questionnaire will be common for each sensor, so UTAUT will not be conducted for each sensor separately. The answers applied quantitative way so investigators are able analyzed change of acceptability of sensors caused by the intervention. Results applied to development of the eMOM GDM application.</description>

    <measure>Usability of sensors and their current applications</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interview of usability of chosen sensors and their current applications (Medtronic Guardian Connect, Garmin Vivosmart 3, Firsbeat Bodyguard 2, UKK Exsed, Ascensia Contour Next One).
General questions related to the usability issues of sensors and their current applications.
Sensors specific questions relate to usage of specific sensor and features of its application.
The answers of participants give for investigators the guideline for development of eMOM GDM application. The answers itself won't be scaled, there isn't wrong or correct answers. Answers which repeat the most commonly in the interviews are the most common issues and they will have a higher priority in the guideline than answers which arises only in one interview.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Usability of the eMOM GDM prototype application will be assessed with a semi-structured interview. The interview has general questions about the usability issues of sensors (Garmin Vivosmart 3, Medtronic Guardian Connect, Ascensia Contour Next One, Speechgrinder Snackchat) and the eMOM GDM prototype application, and tasks which the participants try to solve using the eMOM GDM prototype application.

    <measure>Technical functionality of eMOM GDM application</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Technical functionality of eMOM GDM application will be assessed by a web-based survey. The web-survey asks feedback from the eMOM GDM prototype application, and Garmin Vivosmart 3 bracelet, and there are 20 questions from Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) which the participant answers agree, disagree or not sure. This survey used as a guideline for development of eMOM GDM application. The answers tell how much major problems investigators still have in the eMOM GDM prototype application.</description>
