  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the outcomes of patients
      undergoing Robotic Arm-Assisted TKA (RA-TKA) with the intraoperative use of a tourniquet to
      those undergoing RA-TKA with a short tourniquet time.

      The goal of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the outcomes of patients
      undergoing Robotic Arm-Assisted TKA (RA-TKA) with the intraoperative use of a tourniquet to
      those undergoing RA-TKA with a short tourniquet time. The primary objectives will be to
      compare the total duration of hospital stay, quadriceps function, and the amount of
      postoperative narcotics utilized and VAS pain levels. The secondary objective will be to
      compare variables of patient functionality at five postoperative intervals.

A 10 would represent pain so excruciating as to warrant emergency medical assistance, or as it is described to the patient, &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;. Obviously, the lower the number, the better the outcome. There is no subscale.</description>
