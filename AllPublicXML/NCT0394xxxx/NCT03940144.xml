    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this randomized assessor-blinded controlled trial to evaluate the
      effect of SVV-guided fluid therapy on postoperative morbidity and mortality in comparison
      with conventional fluid therapy after major abdominal surgery. Half of participants will
      receive GDFT perioperatively, and the others will receive conventional fluid therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid management has been recognized as an important factor with an impact on
      postoperative recovery following major abdominal surgery. However, the optimal fluid
      management is difficult to achieve using standard parameters (e.g., heart rate [HR], blood
      pressure [BP], central venous pressure[CVP], or urine output) that poorly estimate preload
      and preload responsiveness. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) was proposed by introducing
      different hemodynamic variables into a dynamic perspective of individual fluid loading with
      or without vasoactive substances to reach predefined goal of optimal preload and/or oxygen
      delivery.There have been increasing numbers of studies evaluating the effect of perioperative
      GDFT on postoperative recovery following major abdominal surgery. However, the evidence for
      the beneficial effect of GDFT on postoperative recovery remains inconsistent.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing major abdominal surgery were
             evaluated. Major abdominal surgery was defined using the Physiological and Operative
             Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pediatric patients, other type-surgical patients, or postoperative patients with
             already established sepsis or organ failure and undergoing late optimization were
             excluded
