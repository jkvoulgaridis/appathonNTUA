  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of SNK01
      (autologous natural killer cell), as a single agent and in combination with avelumab or
      pembrolizumab, for the treatment of subjects with advanced and/or metastatic refractory
      cancer that has failed three or more prior lines of conventional standard of care therapy.
