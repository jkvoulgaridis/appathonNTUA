  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study participants are patients which have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome
      (GBS) and are planned to receive treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg is a
      standard of care treatment for GBS patients. The patients in this study will be treated with
      the study medicine imlifidase on day 1, and with IVIg on days 3-7.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of imlifidase in
      patients diagnosed with GBS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-centre, phase II study of imlifidase in combination
      with standard care IVIg in patients with GBS.

      The study will recruit up to 30 patients who are eligible for IVIg treatment based on current
      practice (i.e. GBS disability score &gt;3 and within 10 days of onset of weakness). All patients
      will receive imlifidase (Day 1) prior to standard care IVIg.

      Data from each patient enrolled in this study will be compared with a control group
      consisting of up to 4 subjects from the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study
      (IGOS) database (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01582763) fulfilling a subset of the
      eligibility criteria in the current imlifidase GBS study protocol. Matching will be done on
      geographical locations, age, presence of diarrhoea, and severity of condition.

      There is growing body of evidence suggesting that GBS is an antibody-mediated disorder. In
      addition to supportive care, IVIg and Plasma Exchange (PE) are the two main immunological
      treatment options aimed at attenuating the autoreactive humoral immune response. Imlifidase
      is an IgG degrading enzyme with strict specificity. The hypothesis is that reduction of
      pathological antibodies may result in aborted progression, quicker recovery and less severe
      disease.

The 6-point Guillain-Barré Syndrome functional score (GBS FS) is a widely accepted and easily obtainable scoring system used to assess functional status of GBS subjects. The score is as follows: 0= Healthy, 1= Minor symptoms and capable of running (subjects must be asked to run), 2= Able to walk independently 10 meters or more but unable to run, 3= Able to walk more than 10 meters across an open space with help, 4= Bedridden or chair bound, 5= Needing mechanical ventilation, 6= Dead</description>

    <description>Efficacy is assessed as proportion of subjects with an increase from baseline in Rasch-built Overall Disability scale (R-ODS) by at least 6 Points on the centile metric score at 4, 8 and 26 weeks
R-ODS is a linearly weighted disease specific scale, which captures activities and social participation limitation in patients with immune-mediated neuropathies, including GBS. The questionnaire comprises 24 items ranging from ability to read a book or newspaper (as the easiest item to accomplish) to ability to run (most difficult item to accomplish). The response options for each item are: 0= Not possible, 1= Possible with effort, 2= Easy to perform. The obtained raw summed score is subsequently translated to a centile metric ranging from 0 (most severe disability) to 100 (no disability at all).</description>

    <measure>Changes in MRC sum score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening until Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy is assessed as change in Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score.
The MRC sum score is widely used to assess the motor impairment in subjects with peripheral neuropathies. It is a sum score of power in 6 muscle groups on each side (abduction of arm, flexion of forearm, extension of the wrist, hip flexion, and extension of knee and dorsal flexion of the foot). The sum of these scores ranges from 0 (total paralysis) to 60 (normal power). It provides valuable information about the muscle strength. Change in MRC sum score helps in identification of GBS patients with treatment related fluctuation or exacerbation. The individual MRC grades are defined as follows: 0= No visible contraction,1= Visible contraction without movement of the limb, 2= Movement of the limb but not against gravity, 3= Movement against gravity (almost full range), 4= Movement against gravity and resistance, 5= Normal</description>

    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 92, Day 180, and Day 360</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using the EurQol group's EurQol - 5 dimension (EQ-5D) Health questionnaire.
The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient indicates health state in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.</description>
