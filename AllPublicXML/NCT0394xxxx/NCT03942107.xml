      The aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the effect of dental post application on
      postoperative pain intensity level in patients with asymptomatic teeth after a
      single-appointment root canal treatment. A total of one hundred patients with asymptomatic
      teeth and with no contradictory medical history who are indicated for non-surgical root canal
      treatment and application of a dental post at the Endodontic Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry,
      Istanbul Medipol University, between April and December of 2019 will be included. All of the
      patients will be recruited from the Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul.
      the patients will be divided in two groups (n=50). Consent will be obtained from all study
      participants before the treatment. After the root canal treatments are completed in
      single-visit, in the first groups dental posts will be applied immediately at the same visit
      and patients will be appointed for pain assessment. In group 2 after the root canal treatment
      a temporary filling be applied in the access cavity and patients will be appointed for pain
      assessment. Dental posts will be applied after the pain assessment is completed at the end of
      1 week. All treatments will be performed by one endodontist. Postoperative pain intensity
      will be assessed at 24, 48, and 72 h; 7 days; after the treatment. The teeth will be examined
      according to postoperative pain intensity levels,

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study is to assess if the application of post and core to restore coronal part of root canal treated teeth may have an additive effect on postoperative pain intensity. Postoperative pain is recorded using vertical Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 24, 48, and 72-h and 7-day follow-up time by one operator. Patients are asked to mark their pain level on a vertical line with the end points &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;Worst possible pain&quot;. The distance of the marked point to &quot;no pain&quot; end point is measured to calculated pain intensity level. The longer the distance the more the pain intensity level is.</description>
