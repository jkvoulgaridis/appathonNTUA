  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor graft function (PGF) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a
      misunderstood complication associated with poor outcome and limited therapeutic options.
      Despite the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, PGF is commonly defined as follows: one
      or several significant cytopenias after allo-HCT persisting or developing after allo-HCT
      despite full donor chimerism and in the absence of relapse or other causes. Not only PGF can
      alter patients' quality of life by leading to recurrent transfusions, bleeding events and
      infections, but it is also associated with poor survival after allo-HCT.

      Although PGF is relatively frequent, there is no well-codified behavior in the literature or
      in the recommendations issued by the various learned societies of transplantation.

      The aim objective of the investigator's study is to demonstrate that eltrombopag improve PGF
      after allo-HCT

    <description>All adverse events will be reported on the adverse events reporting form of the case report file. Each adverse event will be recorded individually.

    <measure>Quality of life evaluation using the European Organisation for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire).</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 consists of thirty items:
05 functional scales to explore the physical (1 to 5), executive (6 to 7), social (26 and 27), cognitive (20 and 25), and emotional (21 to 24) dimensions of the quality of life.
09 symptomatic scales to explore fatigue (10, 12 and 18), nausea symptoms (14 and 15), pain (9 and 19), dyspnea (8), insomnia (11), anorexia (13), diarrhea (17), constipation (16) and financial difficulties (28).
01 scale measuring the overall quality of life of each patient (29 and 30). The results of these different scales allow the calculation of a score that varies from 0 (worst) to 100 (better). A high overall health score reflects good health and a good quality of life. A high score for a symptom scale reflects a high level of symptoms. An average difference of 5 to 10 scores between two visits indicates a minor change, from 10 to 20 a moderate change and a difference of more than 20 points a significant change.</description>
