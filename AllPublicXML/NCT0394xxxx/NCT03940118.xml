  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional catheter suctioning of respiratory tract secretions is a mandatory procedure in
      intubated patients. Poor tolerance, pain and other, sometimes severe, lung and cardiovascular
      complications may occur during suctioning.

      Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE), coupled with hypertonic saline (HS), may improve
      efficacy airway clearance and reduce risk of the maneuver. However, safety of MIE and HS in
      intubated patients have not been studied appropriately, which justifies a randomized
      evaluation compared to conventional secretion suctioning.

    <textblock>
      Secretion suctioning (SS) in patients with artificial airway is a mandatory procedure,
      although occasionally painful, not tolerated and even causing traumatic injury to the
      respiratory mucosa.

      Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) and nebulized hypertonic saline with hyaluronic
      acid (HS-HA) have shown efficacy and safety in patients with chronic neuromuscular and
      pulmonary diseases, achieving aspiration and fluidification of respiratory secretions,
      respectively, as well as good tolerance.

      Only anecdotal experience about the safety of MIE and HS-HA in critically ill patients with
      artificial airway and mechanical ventilation is available.

      Background: Both MIE and HS-HA facilitate the drainage of secretions from the distal airway
      (compared to conventional catheter suctioning, the effect of which is supposed to be limited
      to the trachea) Both measures may prove to be efficacious in the prevention (through airway
      clearance of secretions) and concomitant treatment (reduction of inoculum or &quot;draining the
      lung&quot;) of lower respiratory tract infections (tracheobronchitis and pneumonia).
