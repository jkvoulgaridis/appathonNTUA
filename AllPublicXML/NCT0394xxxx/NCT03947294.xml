  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians need to measure energy expenditure (EE) by indirect calorimetry (IC) to optimize
      nutritional support for a better clinical outcome, especially in patients with chronic
      conditions or with high risk of under- and over- feeding. However, IC is rarely used in
      clinical routine because the devices currently on the market are of tedious use, imprecise
      and expensive. An easy-to-use, accurate and inexpensive IC device (Q-NRG® CE marking n°MED
      9811) has been developed to meet specifications made by and for clinicians. The ease of use
      of this new IC device has been first evaluated in mechanical ventilation mode. This second
      phase aims at evaluating the ease of use, the stability and the feasibility of the
      measurements with this new IC device in canopy and face mask modes for spontaneously
      breathing adult patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the ease of use, the stability and the feasibility of EE
      measurements with the new IC device in spontaneously breathing adult patients with
      malnutrition, cancer, surgery or haemodialysis, using the canopy and face mask modes.

      Patient data will be obtained from the medical records before EE measurement. EE measurement
      will be performed sequentially with the Q-NRG® and the IC device currently used in each study
      center. Patient data input, calibration, installation of face mask or canopy hood on the
      patient, and EE measurement recording will be performed according to the procedure stated in
      their respective user manual. Time needed to perform EE will be calculated afterwards from
      the time the IC device is turned on to EE measurement reaches a steady state with a variation
      ≤10%.

      In a subset of 15 subjects, accuracy of gas composition (O2 and CO2) measurement by the
      Q-NRG® will be assessed by comparison with the reference method consisting in a mass
      spectrometer.
