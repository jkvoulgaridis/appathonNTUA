      This is a Phase IV, prospective, observational, post-marketing study designed to obtain
      additional data on the effect of XADAGO on motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's
      Disease patients newly prescribed XADAGO.

      This Phase IV, multicenter, prospective, observational study to evaluate clinician-reported
      outcomes and patient-reported outcomes related to motor and non-motor symptoms, health
      status, quality of life and treatment satisfaction in PD patients who have been newly
      prescribed XADAGO according to Package Insert indication.

      This study also will gather &quot;real world&quot; data from a PD population in the US regarding their
      overall experience and degree of satisfaction with the use of XADAGO as an add-on treatment
      to their L-dopa regimen. Treatment experience will be captured using patient self-rating
      assessments as well as clinician ratings on assessments.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Movement Disorders Society -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Study Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>MDS-UPDRS is a 4-part assessment of the multiple clinical disabilities of Parkinson's Disease. Part I (13 items) examines non-motor experiences of daily living, Part II (13 items) examines motor experiences of daily living, Part III (33 items) examines the cardinal motor disabilities of PD, and Part IV (6 items) examines motor complications. Each item has 0-4 ratings, where 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) and scores for each part is summed to calculate the total scores. The total score ranges from 0 to 260, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Study Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>PDQ-39 is a patient-reported outcome designed to address aspects of functioning and well-being for those affected by PD. Each of the 39 items is rated using a 5 point Likert scale, with 0 for never having difficulties/problems and 4 for always having difficulties/problems. The sum score of the 39 items will be calculated and used for analysis, with the maximum score of 156. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Study Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>MoCA is a 30-point, 1-page test designed to assess several cognitive domains, including visuospatial abilities (5 points), naming (3 points), attention (6 points), language (3 points), abstraction (2 points), delayed recall (5 points), and orientation to time and place (6 points). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better performances.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Study Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM-9 consists of 9 questions to assess patients' satisfaction with medication using a range of responses from 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to (7 extremely satisfied). This patient reported outcome provides scores on three parts: effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The sum of the 9-questions will be calculated and used for analysis. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better treatment satisfaction.</description>
