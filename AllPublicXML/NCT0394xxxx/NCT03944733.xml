  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the relation between iron status and maternal-child interactions
      as well as maternal depressive symptoms in mothers from central Pennsylvania.

      Investigators aim to follow mothers and their infants from 6 weeks to 6 months in the
      postpartum to understand the relation between iron status and mother-child interactions and
      depressive symptoms. During this period, iron deficient anemic mothers will receive an
      intervention with iron with the scope of improving iron status, reducing their depressive
      symptoms, and in turn, increasing the quality of parenting behaviors during mother-child
      interactions. The control group will be iron sufficient mothers who will receive a placebo.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Mother child-interactions will be measured via the Emotional Availability Scales and microanalytic coding. Scores will be compared between iron deficient and iron sufficient women. Investigators will also examine change in scores within group from baseline to endline.
The Emotional Availability Scales consist of 6 subscales, 4 for the mother and 2 for the child. Maternal subscales include sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, and non-hostility; child subscales include involvement and responsiveness. All are scored on a scale of 1 - 7 with higher scores indicating a more optimal score.</description>
