    <textblock>
      Chronic stroke patients (&gt; 6 months) with severe motor impairment of the upper extremity will
      be enrolled in this single-centre, randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). All patients
      will take part in two blocks of high-intense motor training with concurrent neuromuscular
      stimulation of the paretic upper extremity. In a randomized, cross-over block design,
      patients will receive transcranial stimulation of either the ipsi- or contralesional
      hemisphere.

    <textblock>
      Chronic stroke patients (&gt; 6 months) with severe motor impairment of the upper extremity and
      non-proportional recovery will be enrolled in this single-centre, randomized controlled
      clinical trial (RCT). All patients will take part in two blocks of high-intense motor
      training with concurrent neuromuscular stimulation of the paretic upper extremity. In a
      randomized, cross-over block design, patients will receive transcranial stimulation of either
      the ipsi- or contralesional hemisphere.

      The primary outcome measure is the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FM-UE),
      acquired at baseline, after the intervention period, and at 3 months follow-up. Secondary
      outcome measures consist of further clinical parameters and biomarkers of corticospinal
      connectivity.
