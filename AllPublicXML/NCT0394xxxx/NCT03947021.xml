    <textblock>
      Non-invasive reconstruction of electrical heart activity can yield important scientific and
      clinical insights in cardiac rhythm disorders. In this study, The investigators aim at
      developing methods for reconstructing electrical heart activity non-invasively, and to use
      these methods to investigate cardiac rhythm disorders to answer clinical and scientific
      questions.

    <description>Primary outcome data include reconstructed electrical heart activity such as:
- epicardial potentials (units: millivolts [mV])
These outcome data are obtained at the moment of inclusion.
The primary outcome measures are a comparison of the primary outcome data with invasive outcome data available from clinical records:
- Reconstructed epicardial potentials (mV) will be compared to selected invasive epicardial potentials (mV) obtained from catheter-based recordings or pacemaker-based recordings available as clinical data</description>

    <description>Primary outcome data include reconstructed electrical heart activity such as:
- epicardial electrograms (units: millivolts [mV] over milliseconds [ms])
These outcome data are obtained at the moment of inclusion.
The primary outcome measures are a comparison of the primary outcome data with invasive outcome data available from clinical records:
- Reconstructed electrograms (mV) will be compared to selected invasive epicardial electrograms (mV) obtained from catheter-based recordings or pacemaker-based recordings available as clinical data</description>

    <description>Primary outcome data include reconstructed electrical heart activity such as:
- epicardial activation and recovery isochrones (units: milliseconds [ms])
These outcome data are obtained at the moment of inclusion.
The primary outcome measures are a comparison of the primary outcome data with invasive outcome data available from clinical records:
- Reconstructed activation and recovery sequences (ms) will be compared to recorded catheter-based sequences from clinical data (ms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-specific differences in primary outcome measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one, direct measurement</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary study endpoints include disease-specific differences of the primary outcome measures, which may include abnormal (low-amplitude, fractionated) electrograms and abnormal activation and recovery sequences. Depending on the primary measure, these differences will be expressed in absolute units (mV, ms) or relative differences (%).</description>
