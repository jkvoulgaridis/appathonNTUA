    <textblock>
      The treatment of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) can be unsatisfactory, and that other skin
      diseases such as atopic dermatitis have an increased likelihood of ACD, improved systemic
      treatments are needed.

      This research study explores the effectiveness of Baricitinib in treating Delayed-Type
      Hypersensitivity (allergic) versus Irritant Skin reactions. Subjects for this study need to
      be healthy males between the ages of 18 and 40. This study will evaluate this by injecting
      antigens as well as applying them on top of the skin to the forearm then measure the effects
      of Baricitinib by skin and blood testing.
