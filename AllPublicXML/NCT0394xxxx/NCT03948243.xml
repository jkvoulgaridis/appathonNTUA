  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human safety studies will be carried out to test whether red clover botanical dietary
      supplements used by peri- and post-menopausal women are safe to use with Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. To test this, a red clover dietary supplement
      (previously tested in women at the University of Illinois at Chicago without any harmful
      effects) will be given with four selected FDA-approved drugs to determine if the Licorice
      supplement can increase or decrease how these medications are absorbed, metabolized and
      excreted by the human body. Preclinical studies predict that the licorice supplement might
      affect the metabolism or break down of these probe drugs.

      At the start of a study, subjects will be administered low doses of a mixture of four
      FDA-approved drugs (caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam), and serial
      blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for the concentration of each drug over time.
      Afterwards, participants will take the licorice dietary supplement twice daily for 14 days to
      allow for potential inhibition or induction of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters.
      Thereafter, the same drugs will be taken again to obtain a second measure of drug
      concentrations in blood over time. Changes in the concentration-time curve values for each
      probe drug obtained before and after ingestion of the supplement would indicate that
      metabolism of the probe drugs is impacted by the licorice dietary supplement.
