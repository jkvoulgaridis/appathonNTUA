    <textblock>
      Post-stroke prospective multicenter cohort study. The objectives of the study was to compare
      functioning and health related quality of life in the two study regions, in relation to known
      predictors and to differences in organization of treatment- and rehabilitation. The inclusion
      was of consecutive acute stroke patients with ICD10 diagnosis I.63 and I.61 from a regional
      part of Northern Norway and Jylland Denmark. All were referred to stroke units. At baseline
      national stroke registry data were collected in each country. A questionnaire package was
      mailed to the participants 3- and 12-months post stroke. Telephone interviews at 3 months
      post stroke added information on functioning and rehabilitation.

      package was mailed to the participants 3- and 12-months post stroke. These included validated
      Questionnaires like QOLIBRI-OS, HADS, SS-QOL and EQ5D.

      Validity studies on QOLIBRI-OS and SS-QOL has been published.
