      using iron profile.

      Iron, an essential element for cell growth and proliferation, is a component of fundamental
      processes such as DNA replication and energy production. However, iron can also be toxic when
      present in excess for its capacity to donate electrons to oxygen, thus causing the generation
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals

      Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is roughly 38% of pregnant women, 29% of non-pregnant
      women and 29% of all women of reproductive age have anemia globally

      Human lactoferrin (hLf), an 80-kDa multifunctional iron-binding cationic glycoprotein, is
      constitutively secreted by exocrine glands and by neutrophils during inflammation. hLf is
      recognized as a key element in the host immune defense system

      Bovine Lf (bLf), which shares high sequence homology with the human protein, is also a
      multifunctional glycoprotein with identical antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral,
      antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities of hLf Lactoferrin is
      synthesized by exocrine glands and neutrophils under conditions of inflammation and at site
      of infection through its iron binding and formation of reactive oxygen species physiological
      transport of iron from tissue to circulation, thus curing iron deficiency and iron deficiency
      anemia

      A study done for pregnant women showed an increase of total serum iron in all bovin
      lactoferrin treated women.

      Therefore, the investigators speculated that bLf efficacy in curing AI was presumably not
      linked to direct iron supplementation, but to a more complex mechanism involving this protein
      in iron homeostasis

      Lactoferrin was also proven useful for prevention of iron deficiency anemia special among
      female long distance runner

      Lactoferrin was more effective than ferrous sulphate over a two months period in pregnant
      women with iron deficient anemia Aim of the Work

      This study aims to compare the efficacy of lactoferrin versus iron supplementation versus two
      combined supplementation on iron deficiency anemia in female medical Ain Shams students by
      using iron profile.
