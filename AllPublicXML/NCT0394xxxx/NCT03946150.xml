  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio is same for all the Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) ≥ to 5.
      This P/F ratio misleads the severity of disease without the knowledge of set PEEP. The
      Oxygenation status is actually worse when the patient is using high PEEP.

      P/F Ratio doesn't include PEEP in the calculation.The P/F ratio doesn't show the severity of
      the disease appropriate for the set PEEP.

      PaO2/(FiO2 X PEEP) P/FP Ratio is a new Formula which addresses this gap to appropriately
      calculate the severity of the disease by including PEEP in the formula.

      This formula is used to predict mortality for different severities of ARDS.

      The Main aim of this study is to analyse whether this formula can early diagnose the severity
      of the disease appropriate for the set PEEP, so the Rescue measure can be started early which
      can eventually decreases the mortality.

      Increasing the PEEP Value with the same Fio2 gives a different PaO2 and SpO2. The oxygenation
      improves substantially by increasing only the PEEP. So including the PEEP in calculating the
      severity of Oxygenation is better than the current practice.

      The current Definition of ARDS for Oxygenation is P/F Ratio of 300 to 200 is Mild, 200 to 100
      is Moderate and less than 100 is Severe ARDS with PEEP ≥ 5.

      The New P/FP Ratio of 300 to 200 is mild, 200 to 100 is moderate and less than 100 is severe
      Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) for all the different levels of PEEP values.
