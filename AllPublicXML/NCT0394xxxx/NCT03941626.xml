  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, uni-center, phase I-II study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of CAR-T/TCR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with different malignancies
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-target gene-modified immunotherapy. CAR-T/TCR-T cells include four
      different tumor-specific antibody.They are as following:anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody foresophagus
      cancer;anti-DR5 antibody for hepatoma;;anti-EGFR vIII antibody for hepatoma and
      glioma;anti-Mesothelin antibody for gastric cancer.
