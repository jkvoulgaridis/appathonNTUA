    <textblock>
      The nonoperative management (NOM) protocol with angioembolization (AE) presents a trend in
      dealing with trauma patients with blunt splenic injury (BSI). This study was designed to
      explore the adverse events and associated risk factors before and after protocol-based NOM of
      BSI over a 12-year period.

        A retrospective study was performed on adult trauma patients with BSI who were admitted
        from 2005 to 2016. The patients were divided into before cohort (2005-2010) and after
        cohort (2011-2016).
