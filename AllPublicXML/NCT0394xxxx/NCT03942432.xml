      A prospective, mono-center, interventional study evaluating the effect of one year initial
      care by hygieno-dietary advices with or without Phlebotomy on glycemia after at least 5 years
      in Patients with dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome (DIOS) is defined by a slight iron overload associated to
      features of the metabolic syndrome. This is a frequent condition that parallels the
      increasing prevalence of non alcoholic steato hepatitis. The role of iron overload on insulin
      sensitivity is described in large cohorts study, with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in
      patients with increased serum ferritin, and in vitro where iron load alters key regulators of
      lipid and glucose metabolism.

      In patient with DIOS, improving diet and lifestyle is a major goal, albeit it does not allow
      to lower body iron stores. Therefore the role of bloodletting in this setting was raised.
      Several low quality studies suggested a beneficial effect of bloodletting on insulin
      resistance. Our group demonstrated in a large multicenter randomized trial, the lack of
      beneficial effect of bloodletting over one year. Because this may be a too short period of
      time to demonstrate a positive effect we would like to assess the long term effect of iron
      depletion on insulin resistance and its clinical consequence.
