  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune defense cells in the body attack and destroy
      insulin-producing beta cells leaving affected people with a lifelong need for daily insulin
      injections. Even with insulin injections, blood glucose (sugar) control is imperfect and
      leads to many health complications and a shortened life span. Our pilot study (NCT02117765)
      has informed us that Ustekinumab is safe in the treatment of participants with recent-onset
      T1D. Ustekinumab is currently licensed for use in psoriasis where it has proven to be both
      highly effective and safe. The investigators hope that if the drug can block immune cells
      soon after the development of diabetes, any remaining insulin-producing cells may be
      protected, and regenerate, thus producing more insulin so that individuals may be insulin
      free, or require less insulin. This trial will assess the efficacy of Ustekinumab in
      decreasing C-peptide decline (proxy for endogenous insulin production) in participants with
      recent onset T1D.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-centre phase II/II study to
      assess efficacy and safety of Ustekinumab (STELARA®) in patients with T1D. The investigators
      will perform a phase II/III clinical trial with a total of 66 adult (18-25 years old)
      subjects with recent-onset T1D. There will be two study cohorts, with a drug:placebo ratio of
      2:1. Patients receiving the study drug will receive a loading dose of 6mg/kg Ustekinumab IV
      given at week 0. Thereafter, 90mg Ustekinumab subcutaneously given at weeks 8, 16, 24, 32,
      40, 48 (total of 7 doses). Patients randomized to receive placebo will receive respective
      amounts of a saline-placebo. An additional non-dosing visit at the midpoint (week 28) is
      required to measure 2-hour C-peptide during a MMTT. Patients will be followed for 78 weeks
      following the first dose. There will be a total of 10 study visits over 78 weeks, three of
      which are non-dosing and follow-up visits. Recruitment and screening for the study will be
      completed within the first 24 months. The follow up period is 1 and 1.5 years from the first
      dose.

    <intervention_model_description>There will be a total of 60 patients enrolled in the study. The study participants will be enrolled at 2 centers (Vancouver and Toronto), and will be referred by adult or pediatric endocrinologists. This sample size estimation is based on results from week 52 C-peptide AUC values observed in the pilot UST1D study and the expected 1-year C-peptide decline in adult-onset T1D patients. Using a 2:1 Ustekinumab vs. placebo randomized assignment, a sample size of 60 yields 85% power to detect improvement in C-peptide function (alpha = 0.05) in the Ustekinumab group for an unstratified analysis at 12 months. Sixty-six participants (44 active: 22 placebo) will be recruited to allow for an approximate 10% loss to follow-up.</intervention_model_description>
