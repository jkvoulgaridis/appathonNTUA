  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open, prospective, split-mouth, randomised controlled clinical trial. A
      total of 14 patients searching for oral implant treatment and where a GBR procedure is
      indicated per implant treatment will be enrolled.

      All patients have to fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria. From all patients clinical photos will be taken.

      Two sites within a patient will be randomly allocated to the 'autologous bone chips and DBBM
      or 'DBBM particles alone' group.

      The study will be 1 year follow-up study comprising 9 visits

      A randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) to compare the use of deproteinized bovine bone
      mineral (DBBM) in combination with autogenous bone chips versus a DBBM alone for the
      augmentation of bony dehiscence after dental implant placement

      Objectives: 1. To test whether the use of DBBM is not inferior to the use of a combination of
      DBBM and autogenous bone chips for the filling of bony dehiscence around dental implants

      2. To test whether a digital impression technique can be used to measure guided bone
      regeneration in comparison to conventional measurement with a dental probe and to compare
      these observations with cone beam CT images

      Study Design: Randomized, controlled, single center, split mouth study

      Study Population: Partially edentulous male or female patients in need for oral implants for
      a fixed prosthetic implant supported rehabilitation and where a Guide Bone Regeneration (GBR)
      procedure is indicated during implant treatment

      Patient Number: 14

      Duration of treatment: The time in the study for each patient will be 1 year and 4 months.
      The treatment period includes implant and abutment installation (in a twostage procedure),
      with a healing time of minimum 12 weeks before the start of the prosthetic phase.

      Study devices: Implants: 3.3 / 4.1 / 4.8 mm Straumann Bone level implants Bone Graft: DBB
      (Demineralised Bovine Bone, Bio OSS) Measuring Devices: Cadent iTero &amp; software and Dental
      Probes Prosthetics: Straumann (computer aided design computer aided manufacturing (CAD CAM)
      crowns and abutments

      Outcome variables:

      Primary outcome variable: Difference in bone fill between DBB + bone chips vs. DBB without
      bone chips afer 24 weeks of submerged healing. The &quot;ideal bone volume&quot; as defined at base
      line (= 100%) will be compared to the received bone fill [%] at re-entry measured by a
      digital impression technique (before and after GBR, and at abutment connection, before and
      after raising a flap, and at the 1-year follow-up).

      The method of digital impression will be compared to CBCT immediately after implant placemetn
      and 1 year and periodontal probing during surgery and re-enty

      Secondary Parameters:

      Page 5 of 35 A comparison of 3 different tools (probe, CBCT and digital impression) for
      measuring the bone volume changes in relation to GBR procedures. Implant survival en success
      rates on a patient and implant level Marginal bone level alterations
