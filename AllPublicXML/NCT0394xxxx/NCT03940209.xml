    <textblock>
      This pragmatic randomized trial will test the effectiveness of a basic needs navigation
      intervention compared to usual care among 500 adults (ages 18-75) with Medicaid, type 2
      diabetes, and 1 or more unmet basic needs. Basic needs includes having such things as
      adequate food, housing, personal safety, and money for necessities. The primary study
      hypothesis is that participants who receive navigation to address unmet basic needs will have
      a greater reduction (M=0.5%) in HbA1c pre-post compared with participants receiving usual
      care. Consistent with the study's conceptual model, the effects of unmet basic needs on
      barriers to self-care (e.g., attention, stress, sleep), health behaviors (e.g., glucose
      monitoring, diet, clinical screenings) and health outcomes (e.g., emergency department
      utilization, hospitalization, quality of life) will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes affects over 29 million US adults, with a disproportionate burden of disease
      borne by low-income populations. Effective self-management requires attention, planning,
      follow-through and consistent performance of multiple health behaviors to prevent negative
      health outcomes. For low-income individuals, though, health improvement is often superseded
      by the drive to fulfill basic needs such as food, housing, personal safety, and money for
      necessities. Having unmet basic needs can overwhelm a person's ability to maintain health
      behaviors. Prior research has demonstrated that with more unmet basic needs, low-income
      individuals are less likely to even remember or act on a referral for needed health services.
      However, when unmet needs are resolved and/or people have a personal navigator to help, the
      likelihood of acting on a health referral significantly increases. Traditionally, patient
      navigators help coordinate care, manage disease or promote screening and preventive
      behaviors. This study will expand the role of navigators to include identifying and resolving
      unmet basic needs, which is expected to facilitate behavior change and improve health
      outcomes. This approach will be tested in a pragmatic randomized trial conducted in
      partnership with Louisiana Healthcare Connections, the largest Medicaid managed care plan in
      Louisiana. This study will test the effectiveness of a basic needs navigation intervention
      compared to usual care among 500 adults (ages 18-75) with Medicaid, type 2 diabetes, and 1 or
      more unmet basic needs. The primary hypothesis is that intervention participants will have a
      greater reduction (M=0.5%) in HbA1c pre-post compared with usual care participants.
      Consistent with the study's conceptual model, the effects of unmet basic needs on barriers to
      self-care (e.g., attention, stress, sleep), health behaviors (e.g., glucose monitoring, diet,
      clinical screenings) and health outcomes (e.g., emergency department utilization,
      hospitalization, quality of life) will be examined. Louisiana Healthcare Connections will
      identify eligible members for study recruitment and provide basic needs navigation for 6
      months. The research team will recruit, enroll, randomize, and survey study participants by
      phone at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-month follow up. HbA1c data will be obtained from
      electronic medical records to assess change.

    <description>Physical and mental summary (subscale) scores from the Short Form-12 item (SF-12) self-report survey instrument will be created following standard scoring guides. Responses are weighted (using regression weights from a general United States population) then summed then standardized to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 (Range 0-100). Higher scores indicate better health status and better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Navigators will help participants address unmet basic needs for 6 months by telephone. Either party can initiate a call. On every call, navigators will: (1) review unmet needs previously reported (baseline survey for first call) and ask participants to report new needs; (2) jointly prioritize among multiple needs based on severity and resource availability; (3) identify community resources that could help solve the problem; (4) evaluate eligibility for those resources; and (5) prepare participants to interact with service agencies and/or act as an advocate on their behalf. On each subsequent call, navigators will review progress toward resolving those needs, assess emergent needs, and adapt priorities accordingly. Navigators will provide instrumental and emotional social support through regular friendly contact, and will attempt to reduce barriers to needs resolution to improve stability and security for participants longer-term.</description>
