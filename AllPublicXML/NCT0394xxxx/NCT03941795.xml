  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase II clinical study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of toripalimab injection combined with axitinib in the first-line
      treatment of patients with advanced mucosal melanoma. The target population is the patients
      with previously untreated, histopathologically confirmed, unresectable or metastatic mucosal
      melanoma. At the randomization, patients are randomized 1:1:1 into three groups with
      approximately 33 subjects in each group to receive toripalimab injection plus axitinib,
      toripalimab injection monotherapy (subjects who meet the criteria after disease progression
      may cross over to receive toripalimab plus axitinib), or axitinib monotherapy (subjects who
      meet the criteria after disease progression may cross over to receive toripalimab plus
      axitinib); when the patient has disease progression or intolerable toxicity, the treatment is
      terminated, and the survival follow-up will be initiated.

    <measure>INV-ORR</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>INV-ORR in crossover subjects is the number of subjects with DOR of CR or PR based on INV assessment divided by the number of crossover subjects. DOR is defined as the best response recorded as measured by INV from the date of the first crossover dose to the date of objective documentation of progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery, whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent treatment, all available response designations will be assigned to the DOR evaluation. Baseline tumor assessments for crossover subjects are based on the last tumor assessment for monotherapy prior to the combination crossover. Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed at the time of primary endpoint analysis if data are available.</description>
