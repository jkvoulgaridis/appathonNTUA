  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children in resource-limited settings who develop illness at night are often isolated from
      pre-emergency care, resulting in progression to an emergency because families are forced to
      wait until morning to seek care. This is especially true in Haiti based on needs assessments
      (INACT Part 1; INACT1) surrounding access to healthcare. This study (INACT Part 2; INACT2)
      seeks to improve access to care by establishing a health hotline (healthline) and mobile
      pharmacy for families with children who become ill at nighttime. The healthline will be
      staffed by medical professionals and will provide phone based assessment and treatment
      recommendations based on standard of care practices according to Haitian and WHO guidelines.
      The healthline will focus on pre-emergency patients (those without danger signs as defined by
      WHO guidelines). Emergent patients will be advised to bypass the healthline and seek
      immediate care at the nearest medical facility. In the event that a non-emergent patient
      requires access to basic medications or fluids and is logistically accessible, the mobile
      pharmacy service will be offered.

      The specific aims of the study are as follows: Aim I. Evaluate congruence between healthline
      assessment over the phone and in-person assessment of participants (patients using the
      healthline) 10 years of age and younger. The investigators hypothesize that in-person
      assessments based on WHO guidelines will be discordant with those made by the healthline
      because the physical aspects of the call-center assessment will be performed by an untrained
      parent/ guardian. The study focuses on acute diarrheal disease (ADD) and acute respiratory
      illness (ARI) but is not exclusive to these two chief complaints. Aim II: Identify
      determinants that correlate with seeking care at a medical facility over the 8-12 day follow
      up period after the initial call. The findings from this study will determine if a healthline
      model is a safe and accurate method of providing high quality access to nighttime healthcare,
      averting the progression of non-emergent cases to emergencies.

    <description>Families who call the healthline service about a sick child (no danger signs) and live within the mobile pharmacy delivery area will receive illness assessments and treatment recommendations over the phone. Immediately following calls a nurse will conduct household visits to complete in-person assessments of the children. Illness progression will be tracked with a 8-12 day follow up call. The phone and in-person assessments will be compared to evaluate safety and accuracy of the healthline.</description>
