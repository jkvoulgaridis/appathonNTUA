  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the LEP-F1 + GLA-SE investigational
      vaccine compared to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will establish an initial safety profile for the vaccine in a
      region endemic for leprosy. The trial will enroll both healthy participants and
      paucibacillary leprosy patients receiving standard-of-care therapy. Safety at the lower
      vaccine dose will be demonstrated in healthy participants prior to antigen dose-escalation.
      Further, safety in all healthy participants will be demonstrated prior to enrolling leprosy
      patients.

      Participants will be randomized within each Group to receive three doses of vaccine or
      placebo administered IM on Days 0, 28, and 56. Participants will be monitored for one year
      following the last study injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females ≥ 18 years and ≤ 55 years of age.

          2. For Cohort 1, participants must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical
             history and physical exam. For Cohort 2, patients must have confirmed diagnosis of
             paucibacillary leprosy.

          3. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of each study
             vaccination, must not be breast-feeding, and are required to use one of the following
             methods of contraception from enrollment in study until 30 days after last injection
             (only if in sexual relationships with men): hormonal (e.g. oral, transdermal,
             intravaginal, implant, or injection); double barrier (i.e., condom, diaphragm, or
             cervical cap with spermicide); intrauterine device (IUD) or system (IUS); vasectomized
             partner (6 months minimum); or abstinence; bilateral tubal ligation (if no conception
             post-procedure); tubal occlusion; or bilateral salpingectomy. These precautions are
             necessary due to unknown effects that LEP-F1 + GLA-SE might cause in a fetus or
             newborn infant. Women are considered non-child-bearing potential if they are
             post-menopausal (menopause defined as at least 12 months spontaneous amenorrhea) or
             have had documented hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy.

          4. Screening laboratory values within the normal ranges or not clinically significant as
             determined by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor: sodium, potassium,
             ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, fasting glucose, total
             WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Abnormal results may be repeated once for
             confirmation at Investigator discretion.

          5. Negative HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) antibody, and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT).

          6. Normal or not clinically significant urinalysis as determined by the study clinician
             or designee. Abnormal results may be repeated at Investigator discretion.

          7. Subject is capable of completing a study memory aid.

          8. Subject gave informed consent, is able and willing to make all evaluation visits, is
             reachable by telephone or personal contact by the study site personnel, and is willing
             to remain in the study area for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For Cohort 1, history of infection with M. leprae.

          2. Previous exposure to M. leprae vaccines or experimental products containing GLA-SE.

          3. History of active or documented latent TB.

          4. History of previous infection with other non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

          5. Participation in another experimental protocol and/or receipt of any investigational
             products within the past 3 months prior to Enrollment.

          6. Received any vaccine within 30 days prior to Enrollment or plan to have any
             immunizations between Days 0-63 due to the washout period prior to immunology blood
             draws.

          7. Received a blood transfusion within 3 months prior to Enrollment.

          8. Donated blood products (platelets, whole blood, plasma, etc.) within 30 days prior to
             Enrollment.

          9. Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., oral or injected steroids, such as
             prednisone; high dose inhaled steroids) or cytotoxic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy
             drugs or radiation) in the past 6 months prior to Enrollment.

         10. History of autoimmune disease or other causes of immunosuppressive states.

         11. History of any other acute or chronic illness (including cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             neurological, hepatic, rheumatic, hematological, metabolic or renal disorders,
             uncontrolled hypertension), or use of medication that, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the
             vaccine.

         12. Rash, tattoos, or any other dermatological condition that could adversely affect the
             vaccine injection site or interfere with its evaluation.

         13. BMI ≥ 32.

         14. Hypertension (systolic &gt; 150 or diastolic &gt; 95).

         15. History of significant psychiatric illness with current use of medication.

         16. Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months prior to Screening.

         17. Smokes 1 pack or more of cigarettes per day.

             allergens.

         19. Participants who are unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study
             protocol.
