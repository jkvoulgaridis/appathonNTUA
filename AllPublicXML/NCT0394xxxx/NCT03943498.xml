  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well fingolimod works in treating patients with
      chemotherapy-induced nerve pain (neuropathy). Fingolimod acts by suppressing immune reactions
      in the brain. This study is being done to see if fingolimod can reduce neuropathy caused by
      chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether fingolimod markedly improves symptoms in patients with established
      (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy) CIPN.

      II. To evaluate the tolerability of fingolimod in these treated patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fingolimod orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 3 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serially measured total sensory neuropathy scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be obtained from the 6 individual Quality of Life Questionnaire - Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 (QLQ-CIPN20) questions that quantify numbness, tingling, and pain in the fingers (or hands) and toes (or feet). The hypothesis will be tested with the two-sided one-sample t-test at a significance level of 10% reduction. In the event that the distribution of the within-patients change from baseline in total sensory neuropathy scores is not approximately normally distributed, then variable transformation or a nonparametric one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be considered as alternative approaches.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs) of fingolimod</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The constellation of AEs as scored using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) will be summarized by reporting the number and percentage of patients. Specifically, to evaluate the AE profiles, the maximum grade for each type of AE are recorded for each patient and data listings and frequency tables are clinically reviewed to determine overall patterns, including AE attribution (possible, probable, and definite) to fingolimod. Sensory neuropathy will be graded as none, mild, moderate, and severe. The percentage of patients experiencing an improvement in sensory neuropathy from baseline using NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be calculated with the exact 90% confidence interval.</description>
