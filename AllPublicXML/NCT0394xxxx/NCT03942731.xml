  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penicillin is one of the earliest discovered antibiotics and a drug of choice for several
      infections. Up to 10 to 20% of all patients in clinical trial are labeled as penicillin
      allergic. Most of these patients do not have a true allergy but few have had it verified.
      Approximately 80% of patients with IgE-mediated penicillin allergy lose their sensitivity
      after 10 years. Several studies have been conducted denying the risk of sensitization
      following negative testing of penicillin allergy. Investigators have not had the same
      experience and have therefore decided to conduct a retrospective study review of 83 adult
      outpatients with a distant penicillin allergy label and evaluate outcomes of skin retesting
      six weeks following Drug Provocation Test and challenge.

    <description>verified efficacy of repeated skin testing 4 weeks or more after drug provocation test and challenge in distant penicillin allergic patients. The reagents used for skin testing were as follow: Penicillin G, Clamoxyl, Augmentin,Tienam, Histamine and Normal saline (negative control). A skin test producing a papule with a diameter greater then 3 mm is considered as positive.</description>

    <description>efficacy of allergy testing in identifying penicillin hypersensitivity reactions. Patients were called to perform, once again skin testing because skin tests sooner could result in false negatives due to the temporary desensitized state.</description>

        Patients were recruited during the clinical evaluation of labelled penicillin allergy at
        the regional hospital of Metz, France (Mercy, Centre Hospitalier Régional CHR de Metz -
        Thioville). All patients were well and had no need of penicillin treatment at the time of
        evaluation and testing. A detailed history of the probable implicated molecule, the type of
        the reaction, the age at onset and the received treatment were obtained by Dr SL.
