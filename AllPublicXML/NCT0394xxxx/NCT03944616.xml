  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet beverages sweetened with artificial sweeteners occupy a unique category in the food
      environment as they are a source of intensely sweet taste with no calories. Diet beverages
      are the single largest contributor to artificial sweetener intake in the U.S. diet, and
      people with diabetes are the highest consumers of diet beverages, tending to consume them as
      a replacement for dietary sources of sugar, especially in place of sugar-sweetened beverages.
      This behavior has been endorsed by dietetic and scientific organizations, and diet beverages
      are marketed as being synonymous with better health, suitable for weight loss, and thus
      advantageous for diabetes control. The underlying public health concern is that there are few
      data to support or refute the benefit or harm of habitual diet beverage consumption by people
      with diabetes; therefore randomized trials with relevant outcomes must be conducted because
      they would address many limitations of previous research and have major implications for
      dietary recommendations on diet beverage intake and primary and secondary prevention of
      chronic disease. To begin addressing this important scientific gap the investigators are
      testing the effect of diet beverage intake on diabetes control parameters in free-living
      adults with type 2 diabetes in a randomized, two arm parallel trial with a run-in period of
      2-weeks and an active intervention period of 24-weeks. This study will recruit 200 patients
      with type 2 diabetes who are usual consumers of commercial diet beverages and randomize them
      to receive and consume either: 1) A commercial diet beverage of choice (3 servings or 24 oz.
      daily); or 2) Unflavored bottled water of choice (sparkling or plain) (3 servings or 24 oz.
      daily). The primary outcome will be a central measure of clinical diabetes control in
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The study will also measure the nature and magnitude of glycemic
      excursions via continuous glucose monitors, as well as clinical markers of cardiometabolic
      risk and kidney function. Lastly, investigators will measure plausible mechanisms whereby
      diet beverage intake may alter risk by assessing the effect of diet beverage intake on the
      functional composition of the gut microbiome via stool samples and comprehensive
      metabolomics, satiety hormones, as well as usual dietary intake, and upstream behavioral
      pathways which may inform dietary intake patterns.
