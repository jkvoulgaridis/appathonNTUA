  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study (superiority trial) is to compare the Supera® Peripheral Stent
      System with a standard nitinol self-expanding stent for treatment of femoro-popliteal
      arterial occlusive disease.

      Hypothesis:

      The Supera® stent is superior to a standard nitinol self-expanding stent, for treatment of
      femoro-popliteal artery disease in terms of (1) primary patency rate and (2) need for
      revascularization up to 24 months after stent insertion.
