  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rectoceles may present a variety of symptoms such as pelvic pressure,
      obstructive defecation or discomfort during sexual intercourse. The main symptom of the
      patient probably ends up conditioning if the patient is referred to a gynaecologist or a
      colorectal surgeon.

      Different surgical techniques have been described to repair the rectocele. The posterior
      colporrhaphy is the preferred approach for most gynaecologists, while the transanal repair is
      the most common approach for the majority of colorectal surgeons. However, the small number
      of prospective studies, the inconsistent inclusion criteria and the variability of the
      outcome measures make difficult to know what the ideal surgical approach for a rectocele
      repair would be. Gynaecologists usually do not assess defecatory function before a rectocele
      repair, and studies focused on obstructive defecation include patients with other co-existing
      pathologies (rectal prolapse, rectal intussusception, enterocele) that may influence the
      success of the repair. Moreover, functional disorders such as the paradoxical contraction of
      the external anal sphincter or the puborectalis muscle are not systematically reported. On
      the other hand, many surgeons have questioned the transvaginal approach because it has been
      reported that patients may present dyspareunia after the surgery, although it is not
      systematically evaluated.

      The hypothesis of the investigators is that the transvaginal approach for rectocele repair is
      an effective treatment for symptoms of obstructive defecation and is not associated with
      sexual dysfunction when the plication of the puborectalis muscle is not performed.

    <description>Assessment of the efficacy of the transvaginal approach for rectocele repair to improve symptoms of obstructive defecation according to the Altomare ODS score. The Altomare ODS score is a validated questionnaire to assess the severity of the obstructed defecation syndrome, consisting of eight 3- o 4-point Likert-scaled symptom items. Each of the items has four or five possible answers with scores ranging from zero (symptom free) to three or four points (more severe symptom). The ODS score is the sum of all points, with a maximum possible of 31 points.</description>

    <description>Assessment of the efficacy of the transvaginal approach for rectocele repair to improve symptoms of obstructive defecation according to the KESS score. The KESS (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom) score is a validated questionnaire to assist in diagnosing constipation and in discriminating among pathophysiologic subgroups, consisting of eleven questions. Each question has four to five possible answers which are scored on an unweighted linear integer scale to produce a range between zero and three, or zero and four points. Lower scores represent symptom-free states and higher scores, increased symptom severity. The KESS score is the sum of all points, with a maximum possible of 39 points.</description>

    <description>To assess changes in the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. The FSFI score is a validated 19-item questionnaire to measure the sexual functioning in women, including six domains: desire, subjective arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. Domain scoring is as follows: desire 2-10, arousal 0-20, lubrication 0-20, orgasm 0-15, satisfaction 2-15, pain 0-15. Lower scores represent worse sexual functioning.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women

          -  Older than 18 year old

          -  Symptoms of obstructed defecation associated to a rectocele with an indication for
             surgery according to the following criteria:

               1. Symptoms of obstructed defecation according to Rome III criteria: straining,
                  sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage,
                  and/or manual manoeuvres to facilitate defecation at least in 25% of defecations
                  for the last 3 months

               2. Incomplete emptying of the rectocele on a defecography

               3. Failure of conservative treatment including dietary advice and laxatives, with
                  persisting symptoms of obstructive defecation

               4. Recto-rectal intussusception may coexist on defecography (grade I and II of
                  Oxford Prolapse Grading System)

               5. Non-obstructive enterocele may coexist on defecography (type A enterocele: the
                  small bowel descends to puboccoccygeal line (PCL) during straining and returns to
                  PCL at the end of the straining attempt without compressing the rectal ampulla or
                  compressing it from above with no obstruction)

               6. Absence of anal sphincter dyssynergia on anorectal manometry, or successful
                  rehabilitation after biofeedback in the case of previous dyssynergia

          -  Ability to understand the surgical procedure and the questionnaires of the study

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anal sphincter dyssynergia

          -  Coexisting recto-anal intussusception on defecography or external rectal prolapse
             (grades III, IV and V Oxford Prolapse Grading System)

          -  Coexisting enterocele compressing/obstructing the rectum on defecography (type B
             enterocele: the enterocele descends beyond the PCL to the perineum through the
             rectovaginal space to compress the rectal ampulla at the end of the evacuation
             process; type C enterocele (obstructive): the enterocele descends beyond the PCL to
             the perineum through the rectovaginal space to compress the rectal ampulla at the
             beginning of the evacuation process)

          -  Slow transit constipation associated to obstructed defecation

          -  Severe psychiatric disorder

          -  Refusal to provide written informed consent
