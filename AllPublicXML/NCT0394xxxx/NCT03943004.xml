  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single-arm, dose escalation study of DFP-14927 intravenous
      infusion administered to patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of DFP-14927 in patients with refractory or
      relapsed advanced solid tumors. The study will be guided by a standard &quot;3+3&quot;dose escalation
      by observing the drug-related toxicities and dose-limiting toxicities following weekly IV
      infusion of DFP-14927 for each 28-day cycle (4 doses per cycle). In addition, the
      maximum-tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose for DFP-14927 will be determined.

      Furthermore, the study will determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of DFP-14927
      during the first cycle of treatment using the weekly dosing schedule.

                  acceptable where patient's medical history, e.g. bundle branch block, is known to
