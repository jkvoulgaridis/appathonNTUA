    <textblock>
      Long-term cognitive dysfunction greatly influences patient's quality of life after critical
      illness. However,its neurophysiological basis remains unknown.This is a one year fMRI study
      conducted at the Jiangyin people's Hospital. This study utilize resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) to investigate the regional alterations in survivors with
      cognitive impairment.Further, the investigators hypothesize that these regional changes in
      fMRI activity are predictive of cognitive impairment.

      Critically ill patients who had hospitalized in ICU at least 2 days and who consented to
      participate will take the examination of brain fMRI and cognitive assessment before ICU
      discharge. Individuals of healthy control group are recruited from the community will be made
      to match them on age,sex and education to individuals recruited for groups of ICU
      Survivors.Those healthy people will also take the examination of brain fMRI and cognitive
      assessment.

    <description>cognitive impairment assessed with help of MMSE(Mini-mental State Examination).The MMSE has 5 scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. The 5 sections and their range of score are listed below:Orientation 0-10;Registration 0-3;Attention and calculation 0-5;Recall 0-3;Language 0-9.Total score range from 0-30. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability.</description>
