  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment or dementia is their last degree in one of the main concerns at a social
      level in these ages. To this day, there are different pharmacological and non-pharmacological
      therapies that can help prevent deterioration, as in this case, physical exercise.

      In the existing scientific literature, you can find a lot of information about the effect of
      aerobic exercise on cognition, but little is known about the effect of force exercise and its
      effect on general cognition and executive functions.

      Therefore, in this research the investigators will investigate the effect of strength
      training in people over 60 with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in executive
      functions. For this, a controlled and randomized clinical trial will be developed in the city
      of Seville
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The training program will last 20 weeks and a frequency of 3 times / week.

      During the week 0 the initial evaluation will be developed. Between weeks 1-20, the training
      program will be addressed. In week 21, all the changes made in all the measured variables
      will be evaluated.

      Finally, in week 33 the variables will be measured again to see if the possible improvements
      given in the training program last over time.

      The experimental group will perform a planned and individualized training with guided
      machines and training loads will be adjusted at the beginning of each week.

      The control group will perform breathing and relaxation exercises to avoid a sample death.

      After the intervention, there will be a follow-up phase for 3 months.

    <description>To measure the inhibitory control, the &quot;Stroop test&quot; will be used. It is a short test and consists of 3 parts. In the first part they must read the greatest number of words in a sheet with a total of 100 words that appear in 5 columns. For 45 seconds they should read the largest number of words. At the end of the time the number will be written down of words read. Next, they should identify colors from a list of symbols without meaning, but colored in different colors. The subject will have to identify and name the greatest number of colors.
Finally, the subject is given a list of words with the name of colors, but written with a different color from the one the word refers to.This test aims to assess the inhibitory control.</description>

    <description>Global cognition is evaluated through the mini-mental test (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975). It is a brief and quick test to apply and is frequently used to diagnose the degree of cognitive decline. It should be noted how various variables such as the socio-educational level, and age among others, can affect the result. In addition, the mini-mental test is low cost and can be applied by any professional with a minimum of knowledge and training towards their development. The diagnostic values for mild cognitive impairment are between 24 and 28.</description>

This battery can develop in ages from 60 to 94 years, encompassing various levels of physical and functional capacity (Rikli &amp; Jones, 1999).Due to its easy application, no specific material is required for its development, so it can be developed outside the laboratory.
This test battery consists of 7 tests: The tests described here are quantified by the distance achieved.
Test of flexibility of the lower extremities, Put your hands behind your back, Get up and walk and sit down again.
In all the tests, the distance or number of repetitions made will be noted to later make comparisons with reference tables already established according to the ages.</description>

    <description>For that, wi will used the Verbal digit span forward and backward tests.This test is an excellent tool to evaluate working memory. The examiner reads a sequence of numbers and the participant must repeat it. It is composed of two parts, direct or indirect. In the first the subject must say the sequence of numbers in the order they appear. On the other hand, the indirect must name the numbers that appeared in reverse order. The length of the sequences of numbers increases progressively and two sequences with the same number are always administered. The task is suspended when the subject fails twice in the same sequence. This test gives us a measure of the attention capacity and working memory.</description>

In addition, each subject is subject to an individualized training program according to the workload in order to progressively increase the intensity of work. The workload will be modified progressively by influencing both the total volume of repetitions and the intensity of the exercises. The exercises will be controlled movements and not harmful, as guided machines will be used to facilitate the execution of actions. In addition, the largest amount of muscle groups to be able to generate strength gains in all muscle groups.
