  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, randomized, cross-over clinical study comparing the acute effect of high versus
      low protein meals during dialysis on intradialytic blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure and arterial stiffness indices on maintenance hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A series of demographic, anthropometric and clinical data will be collected prior to
      enrollment. The intervention will last 3 consecutive weeks. Eligible subjects will be
      randomised to one group (high or low protein meals during dialysis) for one week (3 dialysis
      sessions). Second week will be a wash out period (patients will not consume meals during
      dialysis) and during the third week randomised subjects will cross over to the other study
      group. Every meal will provide 1/3 of daily recommended energy and protein intake (35 kcal/kg
      body weight/day, 0.7 gr protein/kg body weight/day for low protein meals and 1.5 gr
      protein/kg body weight/day for high protein meals). All the meals will be prepared in the
      hospital's kitchen and will be personalized to each patient's preferences. The meal will be
      given one hour after the start of the session and should be consumed completely during
      dialysis.

      Patients will be evaluated for the following parameters during their midweek dialysis
      session:

        1. Intradialytic blood pressure

        2. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure

        3. Arterial stiffness indices (Central Aortic blood pressure, Pulse Wave Velocity,
           Augmentation Index)

        4. Hemodialysis adequacy

        5. Nutritional status

      Intradialytic blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and arterial stiffness
      indices will be evaluated with the use of the brachial cuff-based oscillometric device
      Mobil-O-Graph NG (IEM, Stolberg, Germany). Urea reduction ratio (URR) and Kt/V (standard and
      equilibrated) will be used as measures for dialysis adequacy. Possible changes in patients
      nutritional status will be assessed using the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS).

    <measure>Effect of high versus low protein meals during dialysis on patients nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional status will be calculated for each group (high versus low protein meals) using the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS). The Malnutrition-Inflamation score (MIS) is composed of 10 components which include: dry weight change over the last 3-6 months, current dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity (nutritionally related functional impairment), co-morbidity (including number of years on dialysis), decreased fat stores or loss of subcutaneous fat on physical examination (below eyes, triceps, biceps, chest), signs of muscle wasting (temple, clavicle, scapula, ribs, quadriceps, knee, interosseous), body mass index calculation, serum albumin levels, and serum total iron binding capacity. Each component of the MIS has 4 levels of severity, from 0 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal). The sum of all 10 MIS components can range from 0 (normal) to 30 (severely malnourished); higher score reflects a more severe degree of malnutrition and inflammation.</description>
