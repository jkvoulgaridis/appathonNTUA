  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      single and multiple oral doses of BIIB091 in healthy participants.This study will also
      determine the effect of food on the single oral dose pharmacokinetic (PK).

      Initial protocol recruitment and follow up was completed by 10 Jan 2020 with an optional
      cohort intended for completion by April 2020. Subsequently, a decision was made not to
      progress this optional cohort in light of COVID-19 which has resulted in a delay in reporting
      the actual completion date.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>

          -  Current enrollment or plan to enroll in any other drug, biological, device, or
             clinical study, or treatment with an investigational drug or approved therapy for
             investigational use within 30 days prior to Check-in, or 5 half-lives of the drug or
             therapy, whichever is longer.
