  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the metabolic system. This study
      investigates reports of metabolic toxicities such as hyperammonemia, including the
      International classification of disease ICD-10 for treatments in the World Health
      Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the metabolic system and are
      responsible of a wide range of metabolical side effects such as hyperammonemia. Those are
      poorly described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of
      several of these adverse events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients
      affected by metabolic side effects imputed to drugs in particular hyperammonemia. A causality
      assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center)
      is systematically applied.
