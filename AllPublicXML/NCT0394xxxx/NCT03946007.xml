  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Tremendous anti-tumor effects have been achieved using immune checkpoint
      inhibitors for melanoma and NSCLC with long lasting responses of more than 2 years in a
      substantial subgroup of patients. However, we are still largely unaware of the health-related
      quality of life of these patients. We should carefully and thoroughly assess the long-term
      burden of disease and treatment toxicity.

      Objective: Primary Objective: to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of
      patients surviving 2 years or more after the first cycle of an immune checkpoint inhibitor
      for melanoma or NSCLC. Secondary Objectives: to assess neurocognitive function, endocrine
      function, cardiovascular risk, physical fitness, mood disorders, sexual problems, work
      participation in patients surviving 2 years or more after the first cycle of immune
      checkpoint inhibitor; to assess quality of life of the caregivers of these patients.

      Study design: Observational cross-sectional study. Study population: Patients (age ≥18 years)
      with melanoma or NSCLC ≥2 years since treatment with at least one cycle of immune checkpoint
      inhibitor (CTLA-4 inhibitor, PD-(L)1 inhibitor, or both).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured using the
      EORTC Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). Secondary study parameters: possible late
      effects (neurocognitive dysfunction, endocrine disorders, dermatologic complaints, sexual
      disorders and infertility, increased cardiovascular risk, and fatigue), physical fitness,
      psychosocial issues related to work/education, mood disorders (anxiety and depression),
      patient and treatment-related factors potentially influencing development of late effects,
      well-being, and quality of life of caregivers.

      Participation in the study will include one study visit of approximately 2.5 hours. If
      possible, the study visit will be combined with a regular follow-up visit. Vena puncture is
      the only invasive procedure, with low risk of adverse effects. Blood will be drawn after an
      overnight fast. To minimize the duration of the visit, patients will be offered to fill out
      the questionnaires at home. Individual adverse test results will be reported to a
      participants' treating physician to enable treatment or follow-up as indicated. The results
      of the full study group will be used to guide future interventions and support for melanoma
      and NSCLC patients.

        An estimated 80 adult patients with advanced melanoma and 250 patients with NSCLC are
        treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the UMCG each year. Around 20% of these
        patients are expected to survive ≥2 years since their first cycle of immune checkpoint
        inhibitor. Patients will be recruited and study measurements will be performed within 3
        year after start of study. We expect to include 25 melanoma and 50 NSCLC patients per
        treatment year.
