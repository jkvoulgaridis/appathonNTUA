  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab combined with
      platinum-based chemotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of potentially resectable esophageal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as an open-lable, single-arm, exploratory clinical study. Sintilimab
      in combination with liposome paclitaxel, cis-platinum and S-1 will be given every 3 weeks to
      our patients for 2 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy. A radical dissection is scheduled within 6
      weeks after last neoadjuvant treatment. This study will be devided for 3 phases: safety
      run-in, efficacy pilot and efficacy confirmation.

    <measure>Rate of R0 Resection</measure>
