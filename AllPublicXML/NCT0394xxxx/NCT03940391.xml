  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-blind prospective study is aimed to investigate the effect of antihistamine as an
      adjunctive sedative for the patients with histories of severe paradoxical reaction to
      midazolam during sedative endoscopy. Participating patients are to receive antihistamine
      intravenously in addition to midazolam. The primary outcome is the reduction of paradoxical
      reaction in the antihistamine combination group. The secondary outcome is to compare sedation
      quality, performance quality, reduction of total midazolam dose will be analyzed between
      antihistamine combination and midazolam only group.

      The present study will be conducted at Seoul National University Hospital Gangnam center
      between May 2019 and April 2020. Participants who have histories of paradoxical reaction to
      sedative endoscopy in medical record gave consent on the day of the endoscopy and were
      assigned to receive the combination of chlorpheniramine (4-6mg) with midazolam(1-10mg)
      Meanwhile, the patients do not want the use of chlorpheniramine and were assigned to
      midazolam alone as routine clinical practice. Research medication (chlorpheniramine) was
      administered 2 to 3 minutes before the administration of midazolam outside of endoscopy room.
      The blinded endoscopist and assistant nurse are going to perform induction for moderate
      sedation using incremental doses of the intravenous midazolam (1-2 mg) given every 2 minutes.
      The endoscopists and assistant nurses will assess the occurrence of severe paradoxical
      reaction (Grade 3) and other major quality outcomes (procedure/intubation time, sedation
      quality, completeness of procedure [10 Key image documentation], the satisfaction of
      procedure, side effects). The endoscopists and nurses will individually rate outcome measure
      using a 5-point Likert scale.
