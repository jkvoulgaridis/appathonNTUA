  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to answer the question, whether in patients with symptomatic and
      medically not sufficiently treatable uterine fibroids (population) the
      &quot;Magnetic-Resonance-Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery&quot; short, MRgFUS-TUF (intervention)
      offers less burdensome therapy and patient-relevant advantages (symptom relief) compared to
      the operative myomectomy (comparison). The study will hence investigate the therapeutic
      benefit of this method.

The co-primary assessment is performed 12 months after the primary treatment and for the evaluation the proportion of patients with at least 25 points improvement in the SSS is determined (0-100 scale, 100 indicating very strong symptoms, 0 no or low symptoms).</description>
