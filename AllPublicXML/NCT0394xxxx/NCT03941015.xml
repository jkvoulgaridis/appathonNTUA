  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the correlation between tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) monitored at different
      locations (forehead, kidney region, and abdominal wall) and patient outcomes (cerebral,
      renal, GI, and composite complication) in pediatric patients undergoing open cardiac surgery.

      Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were monitored by Mostcare. Renal near infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) was continuously measured from the time of anesthesia to the time of
      transfer from the operating room to pediatric cardiac ICU. Baseline renal oximetry was
      determined as the average value for 2 minutes of recording after general anesthesia. Infants
      with a than 20% reduction from baseline for 20 consecutive minutes was defined as low renal
      oximetry events, and infants were divided into low renal oximetry group (LR group) and normal
      renal oximetry group (NR group). Pediatric-corrected RIFLE (pRIFLE) criteria was used to
      diagnose postoperative AKI. The incidence of AKI, lactic acid, duration of mechanical
      ventilation, and hospital length of stay were recorded after surgery.

    <textblock>
      Using near-infrared spectroscopy（NIRS） to monitor intraoperative and postoperative tissue
      oxygen saturation (brain, kidney, intestine) and to investigate the correlation with
      postoperative complications.

      A NIRS sensor(CASMED, Branford, CT, USA) will be placed on forehead to monitor the cerebral
      tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) of frontal cortex; another sensor will be placed on the left
      posterior flank (i.e., T12-L2, thoracolumbar paraspinal region) to monitor renal oximetry
      (SkO2, approximating the renal vascular bed); and the forth sensor will be placed
      subumbilical on either side of the central bladder region to assess intestinal oxygenation
      (SiO2). All the sensors will be connected to FIGHTSIGHT (CASMED, Branford ,CT, USA) to
      collect tissue oximetry data.

      The electronic data streams from the NIRS and other patient monitors will be collected into a
      study computer. Data collection will initiate at pre-induction of anesthesia in the operating
      room. Only the NIRS values will be blinded from clinical use. Blood samples for determining
      biomarkers of ischemic tissue injury will be taken at defined intervals. No other
      modifications to clinical practice will occur while conducting the study and the NIRS
      monitoring is non-invasive.

      Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were monitored by Mostcare(Vytech, Italy).

      Renal near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was continuously measured from the time of anesthesia
      to the time of transfer from the operating room to pediatric cardiac ICU. Baseline renal
      oximetry was determined as the average value for 2 minutes of recording after general
      anesthesia. Infants with a than 20% reduction from baseline for 20 consecutive minutes was
      defined as low renal oximetry events, and infants were divided into low renal oximetry group
      (LR group) and normal renal oximetry group (NR group). Pediatric-corrected RIFLE (pRIFLE)
      criteria was used to diagnose postoperative AKI. The incidence of AKI, lactic acid, duration
      of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay were recorded after surgery.
