    <textblock>
      PropoStatus is a prospective observational study investigating the EEG changes seen in
      neurologically healthy patients during induction of general anesthesia with propofol. EEG
      changes are investigated in different levels of anesthesia from awake state to deep
      anesthesia in which burst suppression pattern (BSP) is seen in the EEG. Furthermore, the
      relation of EEG changes and clinically evaluated depth of anesthesia is studied.

      The study population is comprised of neurologically healthy individuals who come to the
      hospital for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. The patients will not receive any
      pre-medication. They will give a written consent to participate to the study. During
      induction of anesthesia, the vital signs will be monitored using the standard protocol of the
      operating room. EEG will be recorded using a self-adhesive disposable forehead electrode and
      wireless measurement device. The EEG is observed during the recording from a laptop or tablet
      computer. The anesthesia is induced using propofol with a fixed infusion rate of 30 mg/kg/h.
      The patient is asked to squeeze the anesthetist's hand repeatedly every 10 s. The moment at
      which the patients does not respond to the command anymore is considered as the loss of
      consciousness. The infusion is continued until BSP is observed in the EEG. The infusion is
      then continued for 3 min after which the recording of EEG is stopped. The administration of
      anesthesia is then continued as required by the operation.

    <measure>EEG slow-wave activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Induction of anesthesia (approx. 10-30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>EEG slow-wave activity is defined by the low-frequency (&lt;1 Hz) signal power. The study investigates the topographic distribution of the activity as well as the coupling of the activity between the electrodes. The relation of slow-wave activity and loss of consciousness will be investigated as well.</description>

    <measure>EEG activity on other frequency bands</measure>
    <time_frame>Induction of anesthesia (approx. 10-30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to slow wave activity, the study investigates the topographic distribution of the activities on other frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta) as well as the coupling of these activities between the electrodes.The relation of these other activities and loss of consciousness will be investigated as well.</description>
