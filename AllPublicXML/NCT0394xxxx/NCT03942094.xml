  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIIb, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label, prospective study investigating
      the efficacy and safety of nilotinib as the first-line treatment for the adult patients with
      newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) in China. Nilotinib 300 mg
      BID will be provided in this study. The assessment for the primary efficacy endpoint will be
      performed at 18 months and the rate of patients obtaining MR4.5 will be measured at this time
      point. Secondary endpoints include the complete hematologic response(CHR) and the rates of
      major molecular reactions (MMR) by 3, 6, 9,12,18 and 24 months; event free survival (EFS);
      overall survival (OS).
