  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and efficacy of autologous
      bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and allogeneic umbilical cord tissue-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) infusion in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mononuclear cells are collected from autologous bone marrow and allogeneic mesenchymal stem
      cells are isolated and cultured from umbilical cord tissues.

      30 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will be enrolled and received mononuclear cell and
      mesenchymal stem cell by intravenous infusion and followed up for 6 months. The other 30
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will be enrolled and treated by standard medicines,
      which would be used as the control group.

      Safety is to assess the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during either stem cells infusion
      or by physician assessments.

      The primary endpoint is to assess the improvement of patient's C-peptid and HOMA-β, HOMA-IR,
      cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, Blood glucose level, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level.
