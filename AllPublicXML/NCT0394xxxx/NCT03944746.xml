  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient commonly present with orthopedic injuries in the emergency department.
      Musculoskeletal education has not historically been emphasized in American medical schools,
      and the effectiveness of an orthopedic surgery rotation has not been well studied in
      emergency medicine (EM) training. Competency in musculoskeletal education has been tested
      previously with a validated instrument, the basic competency exam (BCE), to assess baseline
      knowledge in primary care and emergency physicians.

      Residents from 2 different EM residency training programs will be given the BCE to determine
      baseline musculoskeletal knowledge prior to their orthopedic surgery rotations. A post-test
      BCE will be given to the residents from both EM training programs upon completion of their
      orthopedic surgery rotation and compared.

    <time_frame>Assessed initially by taking the exam before completing a one month orthopedic rotation. The same exam is taken at the completion of the orthopedic rotation. The two test results are compared to each other between each individual and residency program.</time_frame>
    <description>The orthopedic basic competency exam is a validated scoring system meant to assess the learner's ability to evaluate both emergent and common orthopedic pathology. It is a 25 question test, and the test-taker will receive a score between 0 and 25.</description>
