    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label, extension trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy of
      SCT800 in long term prophylaxis and on-demand treatment in patients with severe hemophilia A
      who have been previously treated with coagulation factor VIII(FVIII) . This study includes
      two phases: the screening period and prophylaxis period.Prophylaxis with 25 - 50 IU/kg of
      SCT800 shall be administered once every other day or three times per week starting from V1,
      on-demand treatment is given when bleeding episodes occur. The study period is 120
      consecutive weeks.
