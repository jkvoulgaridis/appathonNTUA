  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of postsurgery treatment with ASP1128
      in subjects at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) following CABG and/or valve surgery.

      This study will also investigate the safety and tolerability of postsurgery treatment with
      ASP1128, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ASP1128 in subjects at risk for AKI following
      CABG and/or valve surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise a screening visit, followed by CABG and/or valve surgery on Day 1,
      double-blind treatment period and a follow-up period up to Day 90 in subjects with
      moderate/severe risk of AKI (acute kidney injury) at 2-6 hours post-surgery.

      Subjects with low risk of AKI at 2-6 hour post-surgery assessment will be enrolled in the
      observational cohort to evaluate subject characteristics and biomarkers for exploratory
      objectives.
