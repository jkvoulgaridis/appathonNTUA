  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study of ATG-010 (selinexor) plus low-dose Dexamethasone
      (Sd) in patients with multiple myeloma previously treated with lenalidomide and bortezomib
      refractory to prior treatment with immunomodulatory agents and proteasome Inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of ATG-010 (Selinexor) plus low dose
      Dexamethasone dosed twice weekly each week in four-week cycles, in patients with
      triple-refractory MM. The population refractory for the primary efficacy analysis will
      contain only patients with triple-MM enrolled. PK analysis would be performed which would
      contain approximately 30% of the patients enrolled. Safety analyses will be performed on the
      overall population of patients who received at least one dose of study drug among
      triple-refractory patient populations. Patients will receive treatment until progressive
      disease (PD), death, toxicity that cannot be managed by standard care, or withdrawal,
      whichever occurs first.
