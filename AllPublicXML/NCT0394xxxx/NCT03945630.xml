  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no consensus on the optimal peripheral nerve block for Total Hip
      Arthroplasty (THA). Furthermore, there is a gap in the literature in regard to the efficacy
      of Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) for Total Hip Arthroplasty via posterior approach.

      This Randomised Controlled Trial aims to examine the effectiveness of anterior QLB in
      patients undergoing Total Hip Arthroplasty via posterior approach. The investigators
      hypothesise that anterior QLB and spinal anaesthesia is superior to spinal anaesthesia alone
      with reference to analgesic efficacy and functional ability to engage with physiotherapy in
      the first 24 hours postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate analgesic strategies for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) are of paramount importance in
      early rehabilitation and enhanced recovery. Ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blocks emerge
      as the key element of multi-modal analgesia in modern orthopaedic surgery, but in this
      setting, given the complex sensory innervation of the hip joint, the optimal regional
      technique for THA is yet to be elucidated. Many centres incorporate Suprainguinal Fascia
      Iliaca Block in their THA regimen. Although it confers certain benefits, its analgesic
      efficacy may be suboptimal for posterior approach THA, especially with regards to dermatomal
      sensory distribution. The Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) is a relatively novel technique, yet
      its role is already established in providing somatic and visceral analgesia for abdominal and
      pelvic surgery. There are case reports indicating its utility in THA; Adhikary et al. report
      that QLB is non inferior to Lumbar Plexus Block in terms of its analgesic efficacy, while
      being easier to perform and carrying less risks.

      There remains some debate regarding the QLB mechanism of action. Its clinical effect may be
      attributed to the spread to thoracic and lumbar paravertebral spaces, spread within the
      thoracolumbar fascia or even direct spread to the lumbar plexus branches; perhaps all three
      mechanisms are involved. Thus, QLB is biologically plausible to provide analgesia without
      significant motor block for posterior approach THA, but for that purpose, neither the optimal
      volume of local anaesthetic nor the site of injection (anterior vs posterior vs lateral QLB
      or the vertical height of injection endpoint) have been established in the literature. Based
      on the available evidence, as well as experience at our institution, the investigators
      hypothesise, that in patients undergoing THA via posterior approach, anterior QLB at L4 level
      using 30 ml 0,5% ropivacaine, 100mcg dexmedetomidine and 1:200,000 adrenaline will reduce
      movement pain scores within the first 24hours, without clinically significant motor block.

      The participants will be randomised into one of two groups using an internet based
      randomisation tool (https://www.randomizer.org/), and subsequently allocated to either group,
      with the allocation concealed in a sealed opaque envelope.

    <description>Anterior QLB will be performed in the sitting position. This block is also known as TQL- Transmuscular QLB or QLB 3. A convex transducer will be placed in a transverse position, in the posterior axillary line and tilted caudad until the 'shamrock sign' at L4 level will be obtained. An 80-110 mm SonoTAP (PAJUNK Medizintechnologie, Geisingen, Germany) will be inserted in-plane from the lateral end of the transducer and advanced until the needle tip will be inside the interfascial plane between the Quadratus Lumborum and the Psoas muscles. The successful needle placement will be confirmed by observing the spread of 5 mls 0,9%NaCl. Subsequently, 30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine with 100 mcg dexmedetomidine and adrenaline 1:200,000 will be injected. Satisfactory interfascial spread will be assessed by longitudinal probe orientation.
Following QLB, a spinal anaesthetic will be sited and a THA via posterior approach will be performed.</description>
