      The aim of the study was to evaluate the interest of the recourse of a staff dedicated as CRA
      to data collection in clinical research

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives of clinical studies are notably to evaluate new therapies, to improve diagnostic
      techniques, to make medico-economic decisions and to enrich scientific knowledge. Clinical
      studies findings can influence medical practice, or even motivate decisions by public health
      authorities. The rigor in their behavior is therefore an imperative to respect.

      Thus, the quality of the data collected is essential. However, even if the reliability of the
      clinical data is guaranteed by the monitoring, the completeness of the data remains
      exceptional.

      The increase of data required in clinical studies has led to the emergence of a specialized
      staff to assist investigators: the clinical research assistants. With dedicated time and
      specialization in data collection, they facilitate the conduct of clinical studies. However,
      this data collection aid has not been evaluated.
