  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a future randomized controlled
      trial to collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of a previously validated approach
      that takes into account all the pain and disability vectors associated with low back pain -
      the Pain and Disability Drivers Management Model (PDDM).

      The overall objective is to provide data to assess the feasibility of implementing a future
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of the PDDM on the management of
      non-specific LBP in a clinical setting and to explore the short-term effect of using the
      model on patient's clinical outcomes.

      Background: Non-specific mechanical low back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent, recurrent and is
      a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite increased efforts in improving care, the
      self-reported levels of disability in individuals with LBP have not improved in the last
      decade. In order to more effectively manage LBP through non-pharmacological approaches,
      evidence endorses the use of classification systems to support diagnosis and guide
      treatments. However, this approach to care is not without limitations and a more
      comprehensive and broader perspective is needed. Hence, we recently proposed and validated
      the Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model, which aims to identify the
      domains influencing pain and disability to create a profile or phenotype to guide clinical
      decisions. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a trial and
      to gather preliminary effect outcomes of the intervention in clinical setting.

      Methods: The design is a prospective single arm experimental design. Physiotherapists (PTs)
      working with a population suffering from musculoskeletal disorders and patients presenting
      with non-specific mechanical LBP from two different clinical settings will be recruited. The
      intervention consists of a one-day training workshop for PTs on using the PDDM to guide
      management decisions. PTs will then perform a 6-weeks follow-up with their participating
      patients. This feasibility study will assess recruitment and retention rates as well as PTs'
      acceptability and patients' satisfaction outcomes related to the intervention. Preliminary
      effect outcomes will also be gathered.

      Discussion: This study will inform the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and
      gather preliminary outcomes to conduct a future randomized controlled trial to measure the
      effectiveness of the intervention in managing non-specific mechanical LBP.

    <intervention_name>The Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model</intervention_name>
    <description>The Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model aims to identify the domains influencing pain and disability to guide clinical decisions. The model is composed of five domains upon which the clinician can base his assessment and orientate treatment allocation and includes: 1) nociceptive pain drivers (i.e., somatic, inflammatory or mixed pain), 2) nervous system dysfunction (NSD) drivers (i.e., sensitization of the peripheral and/or central nervous system), 3) comorbidity drivers (i.e., physical and/or mental health comorbidities), 4) cognitive-emotional drivers (i.e., maladaptive cognitions and/or behaviors) and 5) contextual drivers (i.e., occupational-related and social environmental contextual drivers). This profiling will inform and lead the clinician's treatment approach based on the combined contribution of each domain driving the experience of pain and disability.</description>
