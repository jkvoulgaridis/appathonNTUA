  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to build an international community of centers of excellence in
      the care for Fragile Hip Fracture Rapid Recovery patients. These centers of excellence will
      benchmark and share their expertise and experiences based on clinical and managerial data. In
      project is designed in five different phase:

      Phase 1: literature review: identifying relevant key interventions and indicators Phase 2:
      expert panel: expert panel for teams, management and policy makers Phase 3: data collection:
      collection managerial data through retrospective patient record analysis on clinical
      indicators Phase 4: statistical data analysis: data input, validation and statistical
      analysis Phase 5: feedback and knowledge sharing: feedback report with anonymous benchmarking
      and knowledge sharing of the results.

    <measure>Performance on quality indicators at patient level (Quality of Care and patient satisfaction) for patients admitted with a fragile hip fracture.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This study evaluates quality indicators at patient level as defined by the expert panel to determine appropriateness of fragile hip fracture indicators. The indicators will cover the pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative care process. The data will be selected out of the patient record. Based on the expert panel quality of care is measured by time to surgery, information on pre-fall cognitive status, information on pre-fall mobility status, fasting time, administration of carbohydrate loading, administration of cortical steriods, use of tranexamic acid, urinary catheterization, administration of pain medication, time to post operative surgeon note for care team, time of drain duration, type of anesthesia, measurement of haemoglobin, mobilisation post-operative, following of pain protocol, plan for discharge, nutrition supplementation. he study is limited to the period in which the patients are hospitalized. No data is gathered before or after hospitalization.</description>
