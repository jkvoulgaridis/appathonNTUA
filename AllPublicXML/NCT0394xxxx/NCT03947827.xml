  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Up to 50% of
      patients experience treatment resistant depression (TRD), which accounts for a vast majority
      of disease burden. Current medications for TRD have limited efficacy and can be associated
      with intolerable side effects. Therefore, there is a need for finding new treatment targets.
      Accumulating evidence suggests some patients with MDD including those with TRD, display brain
      inflammation. Thus, patients with TRD may benefit from medications that can reduce this
      inflammation. Minocycline is an antibiotic which can cross the blood-brain barrier and has
      effects on several systems implicated in depression. The principal investigator led the first
      pilot study of minocycline as an add-on treatment in TRD demonstrating that it led to a
      significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared to placebo and these findings require
      replication in a larger sample to confirm the efficacy and tolerability of this treatment
      approach.

      This study is a 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of minocycline as add-on
      treatment for patients suffering from a major depressive episode who have failed to respond
      to at least two adequate trials of antidepressant treatment. After screening and
      randomization to the two parallel arms of the trial, 50 patients will receive minocycline
      added to treatment as usual (TAU) and 50 patients will receive placebo added to TAU. Clinical
      assessment will include the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Clinical Global
      Impression scale (CGI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety
      Disorder scale (GAD-7) at each study visit (screening, baseline, week 2, 6, and 12). Side
      effects checklists will be undertaken at each visit. Minocycline will be started at 100 mg
      once daily and will be increased to 100 mg twice daily at two weeks. Secondary outcomes
      include inflammatory biomarkers measured at baseline, weeks 6 and 12.

      This trial will provide further evidence of minocycline's efficacy and acceptability as a
      treatment option for patients with TRD and provide insights into its mechanism of action.

Once randomized, CAMH pharmacy will be informed by email and deliver medication to the patient. An independent study psychiatrist will manage any clinical concerns and will be blind to treatment allocation. To assess the integrity of blinding procedures, participants and independent raters will be asked to complete a conventional guess form asking whether they believe participants received Minocycline or placebo as a treatment after the final ratings have been completed.</masking_description>
