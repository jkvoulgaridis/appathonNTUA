  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating PDR001 in two arms
      for concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation in the treatment-naïve patients with locally
      advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (arm A and
      arm B):

        -  Arm A (consolidation only arm) will be treated with standard platinum-based concurrent
           chemoradiotherapy, followed by consolidation with PDR001 regimen.

        -  Arm B (concurrent arm) will be treated with PDR001 concurrent with standard
           platinum-based chemoradiation, followed by consolidation with PDR001 regimen.
