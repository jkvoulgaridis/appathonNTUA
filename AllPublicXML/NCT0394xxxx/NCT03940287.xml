      Background:

      Mechanical sacroiliac joint dysfunction is associated with pain and stiffness which can later
      on gives restriction of overall motion. Total 60% of the body weight is mainly received by
      the sacroiliac joint and it is related with pelvis and lower extremity. Due to Bio-
      mechanical alteration muscles around the joint area get weakened.Muscle energy technique
      helps to improve body's normal function by giving strength as well as decrease pain and
      stiffness and Kinesiotaping also helps to stabilize the joint structure by giving more
      functional benefit.

      Aim:

      The Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Muscle energy technique &amp; Kinesiotaping
      in addition to other physio-therapeutic intervention in patients with Mechanical Sacroiliac
      joint Dysfunction.

      Methods:

      This study is a randomized clinical trial and subjects will recruit on the basis of inclusion
      criteria. Age group between 30 to 50 years of mechanical sacroiliac joint dysfunction
      patients will be taken. Any pathological condition like inflammation of sacroiliac joint and
      fracture of pelvic bone will be excluded. Patient will be randomized on the basis of SNOSE
      method. After randomization in two equal group treatment will be given and data will be
      analyzed separately. One Experimental group will receive Muscle energy technique and
      conventional physiotherapy and another experimental group will receive Kinesiotaping and
      conventional physiotherapy. Modified Oswestry Disability Index helps to evaluate functional
      limitation associated with Mechanical Sacroiliac joint Dysfunction.

      Data Analysis:

      Normality of the collected data will be established by Shapiro wilk test. Based on the
      normality, descriptive statistics data will be expressed as meanÂ± standard deviation or
      median and intra-quartile range. Within group comparison will be calculated by paired-t test
      or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and between group comparison will be done through Independent-t
      test or Mann-Why U test. P value will be set at significance level(0.05).

      1. Introduction:

           Mechanical Sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) is the most common source of low back
           pain and affects 70-85% adults. It is also associated with groin &amp; buttock pain and
           sometime also leg pain. Non discogenic pain can also be occur due to dysfunction around
           Sacroiliac Joint. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction also called as pelvic girdle pain (PGP),
           which arises from several intra-articular structures, anterior sacroiliac ligament,
           posterior sacroiliac ligament, articular cartilages. Sacroiliac joint pain is one of the
           common sources of mechanical low back pain. This may lead to bio-mechanical alteration
           in structure around pelvis.Where as Muscle Energy Technique(MET) involves physiological
           response of the antagonists of a muscle which has been isometrically contracted. Mainly
           MET is a soft tissue manipulation which include force generated by the patient may be
           maximum muscle contraction are twitch of the muscle. Where as functional stability as
           well as mobility can be achieved by Kinesiotape application.

           1.1: Problem statement:

           Mainly sacroiliac joint dysfunction associated with altered arthokinematics due to
           muscle weakness. Kinesiotaping and MET will be helpful if they are used with
           conventional physiotherapy. Thus there is need to find out the efficacy of MET and
           Kinesiotaping in addition to conventional physiotherapy in patients with mechanical
           SIJD.

           1.2:Purpose of the study:

           The purpose of the study is to find out the efficacy of MET and Kinesiotaping in
           addition to conventional physiotherapy in patients with mechanical sacroiliac joint
           dysfunction.

           1.3: Objectives of the study:

           1.3.1:To determine the effect of MET and Kinesiotaping in addition to conventional
           physiotherapy in patients with Mechanical Sacroiliac joint Dysfunction. 1.3.2:To compare
           the effect of MET &amp;Kinesiotaping in patients with Mechanical Sacroiliac joint
           dysfunction.

        2. Procedure:

      The study will be a Two group pre test post test Randomized clinical trial. The study
      protocol has been approved from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Maharishi Markandeshwar
      Deemed to be University.

      MET Application: MET will be used with conventional treatment in Experimental Group 1. MET
      will be applied for posterior and anterior in-nominate and for weakened muscles like
      piriformis.

      Here patient will be asked to apply 20% force against therapist force and hold that
      contraction for 10 seconds with 3-5 repetitions.The treatment will be given for 3 times a
      week and continued for 4 weeks.

      Kinesiotaping will be given with conventional physiotherapy in Experimental Group 2. In this
      group KT will be applied to piriformis muscle and Sacroiliac joint (SIJ).

      For piriformis application patient will be in side lying position where the effected leg will
      be placed uppermost with hip in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation and Y strips will
      be used &amp; treatment will be given for 4 weeks with 3 alternative days in a week.

      Conventional Physiotherapy will be given in both the groups. Before going for intervention
      Hydrocollator pack will be given in both the groups for at least 15 minutes.

    <description>Muscle energy technique will be given in two different position. For anterior in- nominate rotation and posterior in- nominate rotation patient position will be in supine lying position.
For weakened muscle,piriformis application the patient should be side-lying position, close to the edge of the table, affected side uppermost, both legs flexed at hip and knee.
The therapists stand facing the patient at hip level,then patient should be close enough to the edge of the table for the therapist to stabilize the pelvis against his trunk. The angle of hip flexion should not exceed 60Â°, and then places one hand on the contralateral ASIS to prevent pelvic motion, while the other hand is placed against the lateral flexed knee as this is pushed into resisted abduction to contract piriformis.
Isometric contraction should be hold for 3-5 second and that particular method will be repeated for 7-10 times.</description>

    <description>Kinesiotaping will be applied to piriformis muscle and Sacroiliac joint (SIJ). This tape will be applied in I shape to both sides of the spine from sacrum to Anterior Superior Iliac Spine. For SIJ taping same 5 cm KT tape will be used, it will be applied from below posterior sacroiliac spine to opposite side. Here patient should be in standing position.
For Piriformis application patient will be in side lying position where the affected leg will be placed uppermost with hip in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation , then the application will be performed. The base of the tape will be placed over contralateral part of sacrum and then make a Y strip with no tension will be attached over the greater trochanter of femur.</description>
