    <measure>Responder Status at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This end point main evaluation improvement of clinical activity score and proptosis at week 12. A reduction of the CAS 2 point or more, and reduction of the proptosis 2 mm or more was defined as response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Average Continuous Change in CAS From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-item European Group on Graves' Ophthalmopathy (EUGOGO) amended CAS was used to evaluate clinical activity. CAS of 3 point or more on a 7-point scale indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Average Continuous Change in Proptosis From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Proptosis is the amount of protrusion of the eye from the orbital rim. Measurements were recorded with the Hertel exophthalmometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Average Change in Diplopia grading From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Diplopia grading included 01/4no：no diplopia; 11/4intermittent： diplopia in primary position of gaze, when tired or when first awakening; 21/4inconstant： diplopia at extremes of gaze; 31/4constant： continuous diplopia in primary or reading position).
Diplopia change in one grade or more at week 24 was regarded as improvement.</description>

    <measure>Overall Average Change in extra-ocular muscular thickening From Baseline in thickening extra-ocular muscular improvement in Orbital CT to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Observation of extra-ocular muscular thickening is observed on Orbital CT. One or more extra-ocular muscle recovery at week 24 was regarded as improvemed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Average Change in Graves' Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life (GO-QOL) Scale From baseline to Week 24 follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The GO-QOL is a 16-item self-administered questionnaire used to assess the perceived effects of thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) by the participants on their daily physical and psychosocial functioning. Two subscales of the 16-question GO-QOL have been defined: Visual Functioning and Appearance, with 8 questions comprising each subscale.The transformed overall score is the sum of scores from all 16 questions to a scale of 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health). A change of 8 point was defined as improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Average Change in GO-QOLScale - Visual Functioning From baseline to Week 24 follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Transformed Visual Functioning score is the sum of scores from following 8 questions to a scale of 0 (worst health) to 50 (best health): bicycling, driving, moving around the house, walking outdoors, reading, watching television (TV), hobby or pastime, feel hindered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Average Change in GO-QOLScale - Appearance From baseline to Week 24 follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Transformed Appearance score is the sum of scores from the following 8 questions to a scale of 0 (worst health) to 50 (best health): feel appearance has changed, feel being stared at, feel people react unpleasantly, influence on self-confidence, feel socially isolated, influence on making friends, appear less often on photos, try to mask changes in appearance.</description>
