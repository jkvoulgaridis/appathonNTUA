  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in Mali, Africa.

      Pneumonia is a respiratory infection of the lungs caused by bacteria or virus. Some children
      can develop signs of severe pneumonia and as a result, have difficulty breathing and low
      levels of oxygen in the blood. In some cases this can progress to death. Patients with signs
      of severe pneumonia require admission to the hospital for treatment and the treatment
      includes delivery of oxygen. Currently, in the hospital, oxygen is available for delivery by
      nasal cannula to children. In this case, oxygen is given through a small plastic tube which
      delivers oxygen through the nose. However, the amount of oxygen that can be given is limited
      because of the size of the tube and the amount of oxygen that can go through. However, a new
      device known as the bubble CPAP machine delivers oxygen through the nose in a way that helps
      the airways to stay open. This is known to provide better support to children less than 1
      year of age who have difficulty breathing with signs of severe pneumonia. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bubble CPAP in Children up to 5 years of age with
      with signs of severe pneumonia.

      This study includes two cohorts. One cohort will participate in an interventional clinical
      trial and the other cohort will participate in an observational study.

      Interventional Cohort:

      The first cohort will include 600 children with signs of severe pneumonia, 1 year up to 5
      years of age. Signs of severe pneumonia include fast breathing, difficulty breathing and who
      are very sick (not able to drink, vomiting, having seizures, are very sleepy or with severe
      malnutrition). Two out of every three children will receive oxygen with the bubble CPAP and
      one out of every three children will receive treatment with oxygen with regular nasal
      cannula. The treatment assignment will be determined randomly. We will follow up participants
      during their entire hospitalization. During this time we will collect information on the
      child's illness, test results and treatment.

      Observational Cohort:

      The second cohort will include 450 children with signs of severe pneumonia, under 1 year of
      age. In Mali, bubble CPAP is currently given as standard of care (when possible) for children
      with signs of severe pneumonia, under 1 year of age; therefore, children in this cohort will
      already be receiving bubble CPAP as standard of care prior to enrollment. The only research
      activities will be to follow the children during their hospitalization and collect
      information about their clinical condition, test results, treatment and the amount of oxygen
      required during the hospital admission.

      The remainder of the information in this ClinicalTrials.gov registration will refer only to
      the Intervention Cohort.

Severe hypoxemia (Saturation of oxygen SpO2 &lt;85%) after being on one of the study groups treatments for 2 hours
Increased in respiratory rate by any amount or if respiratory rate remains unchanged after initiation of treatment as follow:
≥ 40 breath/min in a child aged 12-23 months
≥ 30 breaths/min in a child aged 2-5 years
Signs of persistent severe respiratory distress defined as head nodding, severe chest indrawing, stridor, apnea, nasal flaring and or grunting.

The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) provide by bCPAP will start at 8cm HO2. The FIO2 will be adjusted to obtain a saturation of oxygen of 90% or greater.</description>
