      This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-center Study conducted in Canada, the
      United States and internationally. Patients with NMIBC CIS with or without resected papillary
      disease (Ta, T1) that are considered bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-Unresponsive or who are
      intolerant to BCG therapy. BCG-Unresponsive is at least one of the following: At least five
      of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of three doses of maintenance
      therapy; OR, At least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of
      six doses of a second induction course. Patients experiencing disease relapse less than 12
      months after finishing the second course of BCG therapy are also considered BCG-Unresponsive.
      The Study will consist of 100 patients who will undergo two (2) PDT treatments employing 0.70
      mg/cm^2 of TLD-1433 at Day 0 and Day 180.

      1. Overall Study Design and Plan: Description

           This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-center Study conducted in Canada, the
           United States and internationally. Patients with NMIBC CIS with or without resected
           papillary disease (Ta, T1) that are considered BCG-Unresponsive or are intolerant to BCG
           therapy that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and treated. The
           Study will consist of 100 patients who will receive PDT employing 0. 70 mg/cm^2
           (Therapeutic Dose).

        2. Screening Period

           Patients will be qualified for Study entry by review of inclusion and exclusion criteria
           during the Screening Period, which will last up to 28 days.

        3. Follow-Up Phase

           All patients enrolled and treated by the treatment procedure will be followed until the
           End of Study defined as completion of all required assessments after 12 months of
           follow-up post treatment or earlier due to early discontinuation or withdrawal of
           informed consent.

           During the Follow-Up Phase, information on efficacy and safety will be collected.
           Assessments will be conducted at Day 0, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, 187, 210, 240, 270 and 360.

        4. Study Drug and PDT Administration

      TLD-1433 for intravesical administration is supplied as a lyophilisate for suspension in
      Sterile Water for Injection into the bladder and is packaged in the dark in amber USP Type
      III glass vials which can be stored at room temperature. Up to 24 hours before
      administration, it is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection to obtain the final
      clinical dilution.

      TLD-1433 will be supplied to each Study site by Theralase. Instillations cannot be done
      immediately following biopsy taken by TURBT. Investigators must wait a minimum of 7 days
      before dosing patients after a TURBT/biopsy, and/or until any bladder wall integrity issues
      have resolved. Dose/volume reductions are not allowed during this Study.

      Upon determination of the bladder volume (during the screening period) through a voiding
      diary or measuring instilled water volume, TLD-1433 to be instilled will be diluted to the
      proper concentration. On day 0 (treatment day), patients will be asked to restrict fluid
      intake 12 hours before Study Drug instillation. Study drug must be instilled into the
      patient's empty bladder. Before instillation, a regular transurethral catheter should be
      inserted and the bladder drained. A single instillation of TLD-1433 will be infused
      intravesically for approximately 60 minutes, followed by 3 washes with sterile water. The
      bladder will be distended using a fourth instillation of sterile water to prevent folds that
      may prevent uniform light illumination. The laser technician worksheet must be completed
      during the procedure and data must be promptly transferred to the corresponding electronic
      Case Report Form (&quot;eCRF&quot;) page.

      Insertion of the optical fiber with spherical diffuser into the bladder will be monitored
      under ultrasonic guidance. The optical fiber with spherical diffuser will be positioned in
      the geometric center of the bladder with the aid of TLC-3200 and will be locked into place
      using an endoscope holder for continuous irradiation for the total exposure time. Exposure
      time will be calculated based on power emitted from the end of the optic fiber. The optic
      fiber is inserted through a liquid-tight lock via a catheter into the urethra. The optical
      power and treatment time will be determined to provide the correct dose of laser light to the
      bladder surface area. Green laser light (wavelength = 532 nm, energy = 90 J/cm2) will be
      irradiated from the emitter optical fiber via the spherical diffuser. The bladder volume may
      be monitored during the procedure and water instilled or drained, as required, to keep the
      bladder volume as consistent as possible.

      4.1 Dosing Schedule

      A single whole bladder intravesical PDT with TLD-1433 and the TLC-3200 System is planned. Two
      treatment procedures will be performed, a primary treatment at Day 0 and a secondary
      treatment at Day 180 post primary treatment.

      4.2 PDT Disruption

      Patients with NMIBC CIS with or without resected papillary disease (Ta, T1) that are
      considered BCG-Unresponsive or who are intolerant to BCG therapy will be treated with this
      Protocol. If one or more papillary tumours are seen at the time of cystoscopy for laser light
      application (maximum 8 weeks after TURBT), a patient will be rescheduled for a TURBT
      procedure to resect the papillary tumour(s) and a new treatment procedure date will be set,
      even though previously instilled with TLD-1433.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this Study is efficacy, evaluated by the Complete Response (&quot;CR&quot;) rate in patients with Carcinoma In-Situ (&quot;CIS&quot;) with or without resected papillary disease at 360 days post primary treatment. CR is defined as at least one of the following:
Negative cystoscopy and negative (including atypical) urine cytology.
Positive cystoscopy with biopsy-proven benign or low-grade NMIBC and negative cytology.
Negative cystoscopy with malignant urine cytology, if cancer is found in the upper tract or prostatic urethra and random bladder biopsies are negative.
For patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw from the Study before recurrence or death, the CR will be censored at last disease assessment; for patients who start new anti- cancer treatment (i.e.: chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy) or undergo a cystectomy, the CR will be censored at the last disease assessment before the start of the new anti-cancer therapy or cystectomy.</description>

    <description>AE summaries will be provided showing the number and percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 AE. These summaries will be presented by body system and preferred term. AEs resulting in discontinuation will be summarized separately. Adverse Events (AEs) will be monitored from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) until End of Study. The relationship of every AEs to the study drug will be determined and documented by the principal investigator whether considered treatment-related, and classified as related, unlikely, possibly, or probably related. All AEs should be treated appropriately. All AEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization or until End of Study (whichever comes first). The severity of each AE will be evaluated as mild, moderate, or severe.</description>
