  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has become the major breakthrough and the most promising treatment, with the
      host of development of tumor biology, molecular biology and immunology. We have developed
      anti-ROBO1 CAR-NK cells that can target tumor cells highly expressing ROBO1. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cell therapy using ROBO1 CAR-NK
      cells to treat solid tumors.
