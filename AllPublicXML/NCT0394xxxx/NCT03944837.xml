  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is predominantly detected before birth. Using echocardiography
      and MRI, this study will determine whether acute exposure to maternal hyperoxygenation (MH)
      leads to measurable increases in fetal cerebral oxygenation from baseline in fetuses with
      CHD. The study aims to determine whether MH could be used as a chronic in-utero treatment
      strategy to promote brain growth/maturation to birth and to improve postnatal
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, and identify the types of CHD most likely to benefit from
      chronic MH.

      This study determines the impact of administering oxygen to mother during the later part of
      pregnancy on cerebral oxygen delivery in fetuses who were identified with severe forms of
      Congenital Heart disease (CHD) including the following groups:

        -  Group 1: Single ventricular (SV) lesions, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome
           (HLHS); pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS); tricuspid atresia
           (TA); unbalanced AV septal defect (AVSD); double inlet ventricle (DILV); and severe form
           of Ebstein's anomaly (EA with pulmonary atresia) of the tricuspid valve; and

        -  Group 2: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF),including TOF-like double outlet right ventricle
           (DORV), pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD)

        -  Group 3: Bi-ventricular lesions with transposition of the great arteries (TGA),
           including DORV with TGA

      Children with severe CHD experience challenges in multiple developmental domains, impacting
      executive function, memory, language, and other aspects of cognitive and motor function. It
      is now well established that brain growth and development are adversely affected by CHD and
      it is increasingly clear that central nervous system changes that occur in the third
      trimester play a particularly important role in the pathogenesis of adverse
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.

      Supplemental maternal oxygen will used in the last trimester for a short period of time
      (acute MH) in pregnant mothers carrying babies with CHD to briefly increase fetal oxygen
      levels to those reached in the newborn with spontaneous breathing. This study will examine
      whether and to what degree acute MH will improve the cerebrovascular oxygenation. The rate
      and duration of MH (10 to 15L/min by mask for up to 30-45 minutes/test) is considered to be
      safe to the mother and her fetus. Both fetal echocardiography and fetal MRI will be used to
      determine the effects of acute MH on the fetal-placental circulation and will determine in
      fetuses with CHD whether acute exposure to MH leads to measurable increases in fetal cerebral
      oxygenation from baseline. Thus it could potentially become useful as a chronic in-utero
      treatment strategy to promote brain growth/maturation to birth and to improve postnatal
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.
