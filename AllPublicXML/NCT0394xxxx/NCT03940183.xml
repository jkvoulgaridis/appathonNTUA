      The trial used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superior-effect design,
      multicenter clinical study.

      The trial was divided into a test group and a placebo group,the two groups were randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio and planned to enroll 240 patients with type 2 diabetes. After 2 weeks of
      screening, all subjects entered the treatment period,which was 24 weeks, and 1 week period of
      follow-up.

      The trial was divided into a test group and a placebo group: the test group was given
      trelagliptin succinate tablets, and the placebo group was given placebo. The test group and
      the placebo group were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and planned to enroll 240 patients with type
      2 diabetes. After 2 weeks of screening, all subjects entered the treatment period,which was
      24 weeks, and 1 week period of follow-up.

      All subjects were asked to continue their current diabetes diet and physical activity
      treatment plan throughout the study period.
