  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Fractional laser has become an important laser modality in management of a number of
           skin conditions and photoaging. Fractional photothermolysis is the fractional emission
           of light into microscopic treatment zones, creating small columns of injury to the skin
           in a pixilated fashion. Epidermal and dermal disruptions occur in these focal zones of
           thermal injury, stimulating dermal collagen production and elastic tissue formation.
           Fractional laser has been used successfully to treat photodamage and overall dyschromia
           in the Caucasian population. However, there is not much improvement in Asian population.

        2. Photoaging refers to the skin caused by intense and chronic exposure to sunlight. The
           visible effects of photoaging are fine wrinkles, mottling, pigmentation and roughness of
           the skin. These changes are usually associated with chronologic aging. However,
           photoaging is not a good indicator of chronologic age. It just makes a person look older
           than his or her chronologic age. Skin ageing may be divided into two processes:
           intrinsic ageing and extrinsic ageing (or photoageing). Both are accompanied by changes
           in the morphological and biomechanical properties of skin.

        3. Profile HaloTM dual-wavelength fusion fractional laser is the first hand tool in the
           world that integrates ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers. It includes a
           non-ablative fractional laser with a wavelength of 1470nm and an ablative fractional
           laser with a wavelength of 2940nm. A day after treatment, new epithelial tissue began to
           appear, and the necrotic epidermis formed microepidermal necrotic debris (MENDs). MENDs
           were surrounded by keratin 2-7 days after treatment, and collagen sequence in MTZs was
           changed 7 days later. The 2940 ablative fractional laser can be added with 20-100 micron
           lattice stripping, ensuring safety while enabling MENDs to be peeled off 2 days earlier
           and reducing the risk of side effects. This makes the laser safe and effective compared
           with the single fractional laser and reduces the downtime.
