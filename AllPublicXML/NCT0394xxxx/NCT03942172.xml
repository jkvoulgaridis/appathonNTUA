  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive 50 question clinical rating scale for the assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. The total cumulative score will range from 0 (no disability) to 199 (total disability).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>TIMED UP AND GO (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test is a physical performance measure in which the ability to rise up from a seated chair position, walk 3m, turn, walk back, and sit down is timed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a widely used clinical test of a person's static and dynamic balance abilities. t is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function.A score of 56 indicates functional balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The non-motor symptoms questionnaire is a 30-point, patient-based questionnaire used to determine the non-motor symptoms experienced by the patient during the past month.Responses quantify symptoms according severity (using a scale of 0-3) and frequency (using a scale of 0-4). Higher scores represent more severe and more frequent symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses how often people affected by Parkinson's experience difficulties across 8 dimensions of daily living. It is scored on a scale of 0-100, with lower scores indicating better health and high scores more severe symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Freeze of gait (FOG) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 16 items assessing freeze of gait. Total score ranges from 0 to 24, higher score corresponds to more severe FOG.</description>
