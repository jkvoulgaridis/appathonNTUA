  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death in US. It is associated with abnormal
      vascular function termed endothelial dysfunction. It is also associated with increased stress
      on the blood vessels and high levels of inflammation. Vagus nerve stimulation can help
      improve inflammation, vascular function and vascular stress. The investigator has recently
      completed a study showing that 1 hour of noninvasive vagus stimulation can improve vascular
      health. However, it is unknown if 4 weeks of stimulation will be beneficial in systolic heart
      failure.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if transcutaneous vagal stimulation (TVS) will lead
      to improvement in the function of the inner lining of participants' arteries, memory, and in
      the levels of certain chemical markers of arterial function in the blood.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either TVS or a sham stimulation and undergo 4
      weeks of stimulation. Vascular function will be assessed by several non-invasive
      measurements, including Flow Mediate Dilation (FMD), Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA), EndoPAT, and
      Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI). Participants' memory will also be measured through
      electronic assessments and blood will be collected and analyzed for arterial function
      chemical markers.

      Visit 1: Following tests(to assess vascular function) will be done: 1. FMD 2) LSCI 3) EndoPAT
      and 4) Pulse wave analysis (PWA). Patients will rest for 10 minutes between each test. They
      will be trained to use PARASYMTM unit for TVS. Blood collected, serum/plasma will be stored
      at -80F. Whole blood will be collected in PAXgene tubes. Patients will be instructed to apply
      TVS to either ear lobule (SHAM) or Tragus(experimental arm). Baseline characteristics will be
      collected including data on ventricular function(LVEF and left ventricular volumes).

      Visit 2 (4 weeks): Follow up tests(FMD,LSCI,EndoPAT,PWA) and repeat blood collection.

      Inflammatory cytokines and vascular function assays will be performed.
