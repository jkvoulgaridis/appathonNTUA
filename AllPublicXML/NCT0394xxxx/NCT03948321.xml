  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination and short Incubation time
      regimen of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy（ALA-PDT) to a conventional regimen for
      treatment of small genital warts. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination approach
      will be less or even no painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.

    <description>The pain will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale（VAS) with a score range of 0-10. The higher the score, the greater the pain, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most unbearable pain. Pain will be measured at different time points during and after every treatment ，including immediately, 1st min, 3rd min, 5th min, 7th min, 10th min , and every 10 min to the end of treatment and 2nd h, 12th h, 24th h and 48th h after treatment.</description>
