      A comparison study was performed between laparoscopic appendectomy and open appendectomy in
      acute setting in tertiary hospital to access the outcome of postoperative pain and hospital
      stay. As the popularity of laparoscopic appendectomy has failed in major tertiary hospital
      due to huge amount of patient load in which open appendectomy was performed.This study was
      performed to prove that outcome of laparoscopic appendectomy are far better than open
      appendectomy and to increase the use of laparoscopic surgery in acute settings

      Introduction:

      Open appendicectomy has been a safe and usually opted mode of operation for acute
      appendicitis for more than a century, but since last 10 years laparoscopic appendicectomy is
      gaining popularity, although still not as popular as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Comparison
      of these two is studied in terms of pain outcome as patient perceives and length of hospital
      stay.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of open appendectomy and laparoscopic
      appendectomy in patients with acute appendicitis.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized control trial

      SETTING:

      Surgical Unit I, Services Hospital, Lahore

      DURATION OF STUDY:

      Duration of my study was six months after the approval of synopsis i.e 21-02-2015 to
      20-08-2015.

      SAMPLE SIZE:

      Was calculated using WHO method of calculating sample size.

      SAMPLING TECHNIQUE:

      Non probability consecutive sampling.

      DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE:

      All patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria was admitted through the emergency after taking
      approval from hospital Ethical committee. A detailed history had been taken including
      demographic data (age, address). Patients was requested to sign an informed consent. They had
      been assured regarding confidentiality and expertise used for the procedure. All procedures
      was done by a single operating surgical team to control bias. All the data/variables was
      recorded on a specially designed Performa attached which are post-op pain at 12hrs and 24
      hrs, post-Op stay and patient satisfaction score.
