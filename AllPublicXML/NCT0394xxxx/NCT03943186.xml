      The goal of this non-interventional study is to investigate the safety, efficacy and
      tolerability of Ectoin Lozenges Honey Lemon (EHT02) compared to lozenges containing
      hyaluronic acid and islandic moss in the treatment of acute viral pharyngitis.

      The current non-interventional study aims to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of
      Ectoin Lozenges Honey Lemon in patients suffering from acute viral pharyngitis. Participants
      receive treatments as part of routine medical care, and participants can choose one of two
      treatment options: a) Ectoin Lozenges Honey Lemon or b) lozenges containing hyaluronic acid
      and icelandic moss.

      Efficacy will be studied by documentation of the following symptoms:

        -  pain on swallowing

        -  hoarseness

        -  urge to cough

        -  dry mouth and throat

        -  redness of oropharynx and larynx

        -  sore throat

        -  impairment of free breathing

        -  general feeling of illness

      In parallel, participating patients will document their symptoms over the entire study
      duration in patient diaries.

      The observation takes place over a period of seven days.
