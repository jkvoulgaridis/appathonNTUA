  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In about 15% of adult concussion cases, symptoms last longer than 2 weeks and can largely
      impact the individual's ability to work, be physically active and participate in everyday
      life. These symptoms are often partially related to unresolved neck muscle tightness and
      other neck-related symptoms. Dry needling is a technique that uses acupuncture needles to
      release muscle knots, decrease neck muscle tightness and decrease neck pain. As far as the
      investigators are aware, there have been no studies looking at the effects of dry needling on
      symptoms of chronic concussion. This study will compare the effects of dry needling to
      traditional hands-on physiotherapy treatment of the neck for concussion-related symptoms.
      Participants with chronic concussion symptoms will receive either dry needling, hands-on
      manual physiotherapy or both. Concussion symptoms, symptom severity, neck range of motion and
      pain with pressure over neck muscles will be compared before and after treatment, and the day
      after treatment. The investigators expect that the greatest improvement in all of these will
      be seen in the group receiving both interventions, both immediately after treatment and the
      following day. If dry needling can immediately improve concussion symptoms, patients may
      better tolerate therapeutic exercise and experience quicker resolution of chronic symptoms.

      All participants will be tested in clinic once, for approximately a half hour. For all
      groups, outcome measures relating to concussion symptoms, cervical range of motion and pain
      pressure thresholds will be taken prior to and after the intervention.

      In the DN group, four muscles (upper fibres trapezius, cervical multifidus, levator scapulae
      and suboccipitals) will be palpated by a physiotherapist trained in dry needling. If a
      palpable trigger point is found, the physiotherapist will perform dry needling until a local
      twitch response is elicited. If a trigger point is not found, no dry needling will take
      place. In this way, up to 8 total muscles will be needled during the session. The participant
      will be in prone for the above procedure.

      In the MT group, soft tissue release will be performed on the above four muscles bilaterally.
      Cervical traction (unilateral grade 3 oscillatory distraction technique, any cervical segment
      between C0/C1 and C7/C7, 3-5 sets of 30 seconds) and mobilization (unilateral
      inferior-medial-posterior or superior-anterior-lateral, grade 3 oscillatory, any cervical
      segment between C0/C1 and C7/C7, 3-5 sets of 30 seconds ) will also be performed if the
      physiotherapist deems it necessary, specific to the spinal level noted to be involved. In the
      DN+MT group, MT interventions will be performed first, followed by DN, of the four above
      muscles. Immediately following intervention, the outcome measures will all be re-tested. The
      participants will also be instructed to fill out the SCAT-5 Step 2 upon waking the next
      morning. Additionally, if one or more of the cervical motions caused pain during initial
      testing, they will be asked to repeat the motion and report the current level of pain on the
      VAS scale.
