  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of a community-based exercise intervention
      (CBEI) for persons with spinal cord injury (PwSCI) on physiological and psychological
      well-being and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injury (PwSCI) are at a greater risk for major health conditions and
      poorer health outcomes than the population without spinal cord injury. For PwSCI, habitual
      exercise is critical for both physiological and psychological well-being. Prior research
      indicates that exercise programs conducted in a controlled setting have positive effects on
      the physical and psychosocial fitness of PwSCI, but the efficacy and feasibility of these
      programs are not well understood in community-based settings. The proposed project aims to
      examine potential health benefits in response to the intervention and identify the barriers
      and facilitators to successful implementation of a CBEI in PwSCI. The long-term goal of this
      research is to improve health outcomes of PwSCI by identifying strategies to promote health
      and support exercise in the community.

      The project research aims are to:

        1. Estimate improvements in physical function, cardio-metabolic health, and psychological
           well-being of participants enrolled in a CBEI compared to an education-only group.

        2. Identify barriers, facilitators, and reasons for positive determinants for PwSCI to
           exercise in a community-based setting.

      A single-blind pilot RCT will be conducted. Forty individuals with SCI will be recruited.
      Each participant will be randomized into either a 12-week CBEI (n=20) or an education control
      group (n=20). Participants' cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, metabolic blood
      chemistries and strength will be assessed pre- (T1) and post- (T2) intervention.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS - Fatigue Short Form 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to 4 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue item banks assess a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue and the impact of fatigue. The fatigue short forms are not disease specific and assess fatigue over the past seven days. PROMIS instruments are scored using item-level calibrations. Each question is answered using a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;not at all (1)&quot; to &quot;very much (5)&quot;. Calculate a summed score and then use the applicable PROMIS score conversion table to translate the total raw score into a T-score.
The seven domains are scored individually, and the single pain intensity item is reported as its raw score.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS - Emotional Distress - Depression - Short Form 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to 4 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression item banks assess self-reported negative mood (sadness, guilt), views of self(self-criticism, worthlessness), and social cognition (loneliness, interpersonal alienation), as well as decreased positive affect and engagement (loss of interest, meaning, and purpose). The depression short forms are not disease specific and assess depression over the past seven days. PROMIS instruments are scored using item-level calibrations. Each question is answered using a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;never (1)&quot; to &quot;always (5)&quot;.

PROMIS instruments are scored using item-level calibrations. Each question is answered using a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;Had no pain (1)&quot; to &quot;very severe (5)&quot;. Calculate a summed score and then use the applicable PROMIS score conversion table to translate the total raw score into a T-score.
The seven domains are scored individually, and the single pain intensity item is reported as its raw score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>PROMIS - Pain Interference - Short Form 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to 4 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Interference item banks assess self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. It also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life. The pain interference short forms are not disease specific and assess pain interference over the past seven days. PROMIS instruments are scored using item-level calibrations. Each question is answered using a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;not at all (1)&quot; to &quot;very much (5)&quot;. Calculate a summed score and then use the applicable PROMIS score conversion table to translate the total raw score into a T-score.

    <measure>PROMIS - Sleep Disturbance - Short Form 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to 4 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Sleep disturbance instruments assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep. The sleep disturbance short forms are not disease specific and assess sleep disturbances over the past seven days. PROMIS instruments are scored using item-level calibrations. Each question is answered using a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;very poor (1)&quot; to &quot;very good (5)&quot;. Calculate a summed score and then use the applicable PROMIS score conversion table to translate the total raw score into a T-score.

    <description>The CBEI group will receive 36 (60-90 minute) one-on-one, formally directed exercise sessions by trained staff over 12 weeks. By the end the goal is to have the participants guiding their own regimens. Personalized sessions will be created for each participant based on their fitness goal(s) and preferences. Each session will include vitals, pain assessment, warm-up, stretching, cardiovascular, and strength exercises and cool-down. The participants will be monitored to ensure they are achieving at least 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise 3 times a week. Activity monitors will also be worn to capture intensity data. At the end of each session, participants will describe their likes and dislike as well as what they gained and what they suggest for improvement. At the end of each session, the trainer will rate the participant's perceived participation during the session (1-6) using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale.</description>

    <description>The EEG group will complete an intervention that consists of a one-on-one, hour-long educational session orienting participants to an online resource center, the National Center on Health, Physical Activity, and Disability (NCHPAD). NCHPAD promotes health and well-being for PwD through resources such as adapted exercise videos, information on accessible fitness equipment, personalized exercise videos tailored to PwD, and an individualized 14-week exercise program. Participants will be given an overview of NCHPAD and asked to identify resources of interest on the website. Each participant will be asked to use resources on NCHPAD to engage in physical activity for 12 weeks. Each participant will receive a weekly phone call to inquire about their physical activity, exercises engaged in, RPE during exercise, and whether any resources were used.</description>
