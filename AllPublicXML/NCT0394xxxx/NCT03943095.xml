  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study will characterize the efficacy profile of an experimental dual active
      5 percent (%) potassium nitrate/0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice, compared to a single
      active 0.454% stannous fluoride desensitizing dentifrice, over an 8-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a single center, 8-week, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, two treatment
      arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum Baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two
      selected test teeth), Phase II, exploratory clinical study in healthy participants with DH.
      It is hypothesized that the combination of two antisensitivity active ingredients with
      complementary modes of action (potassium nitrate: nerve desensitization; stannous fluoride:
      dentin tubule occlusion) will deliver superior anti-sensitivity efficacy, compared to either
      active alone.

    <description>Evaporative air sensitivity will be assessed on the facial surfaces of eligible incisor, canine and pre-molar teeth by directing a one second application of air from a standard dental syringe held perpendicular to the tooth surface, approximately 1-2-millimeter (mm) coronal to the gingival margin, and from a distance of approximately 1 centimeter (cm).

    <measure>Mean Tactile Threshold (Average of the two Selected Test Teeth) at Baseline (Day 0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile sensitivity will be assessed for eligible incisor, canine and pre-molar teeth using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe), starting at 10 gram (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force for that visit is reached. The probe tip is placed perpendicular to the facial surface of the tooth and drawn slowly across the exposed dentine. After each application, the participant is asked to indicate whether they experienced any pain or discomfort (yes/no response). The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses is recorded as the tactile threshold (g). At Baseline, the maximum force is 20g; at all subsequent visits, 80g. If no sensitivity is found at the upper limit, the tactile threshold is recorded as greater than (&gt;) 20 g (Baseline) or &gt;80 g (all other visits). An increase in tactile threshold indicates an improvement.</description>
