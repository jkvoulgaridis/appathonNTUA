  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Directly reinforcing abstinence from alcohol with monetary incentives is an effective
      treatment for alcohol dependence, but barriers in obtaining frequent, verified biochemical
      measures of abstinence limit the dissemination of this treatment approach. As our feasibility
      study demonstrates, remote breathalyzer monitoring drastically improves the practicality of
      delivering an alcohol contingency management intervention. In Experiment 2, we will test
      whether the addition of remote abstinence incentives to treatment as usual improves
      outpatient treatment outcomes and prevents relapse following inpatient detoxification at a
      regional hospital system. We will also assess whether readmission rates are reduced using a
      newly developed smartphone app and breathalyzer.

    <measure>Pattern of abstinence from alcohol during intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 66 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Breathalyzer assessments will be collected during the treatment period. This outcome measure will consist of the percentage of days without alcohol use as detected by the breathalyzers.</description>

    <measure>Treatment acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>A total of 12 assessment sessions spanning over a 66 week period</time_frame>
    <description>Participant ratings of treatment acceptability on a customized Treatment Acceptability questionnaire will be collected during assessment sessions. Each question will be scored from 1 (low) to 4 (high) and will assess distinct components of the treatment. Questions will be interpreted and scored individually and not be summed together.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Active Comparator: Group A (Intensive incentives)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group A will have the opportunity to earn payments based on the results of their breathalyzer screens. Participants will receive a compliance incentive per submitted sample regardless of the results, but will also have the opportunity to earn more incentives for providing negative results. For the first 3 weeks, these additional incentives will scale based on the number of consecutive days of sustained negative samples. For the remaining weeks incentives will be based on a randomized &quot;prize&quot; drawing.</description>
