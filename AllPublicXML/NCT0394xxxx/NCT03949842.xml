  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of TRELEGY ELLIPTA single
      inhaler triple therapy (SITT) (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol
      [FF/UMEC/VI]) relative to non-ELLIPTA multiple inhaler triple therapies (MITT) of inhaled
      corticosteroids/long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists/muscarinic receptor
      antagonists (ICS/LABA/LAMA) within a routine clinical practice setting. This is a
      non-randomized, interventional and self-controlled cohort study conducted to collect data in
      routine practice. This study will have two periods where in retrospective data will be
      collected in pre-switch period and prospective data will be collected in post-switch periods.
      Subjects will be switched from non-ELLIPTA MITT to TRELEGY ELLIPTA. The pre-switch period is
      of 52 weeks and post-switch period will be of 52 weeks. Additionally subjects will receive
      safety follow-up call at 26 weeks and 52 weeks for safety monitoring. Approximately 1300
      subjects will be enrolled for this study. TRELEGY ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies.

    <description>Moderate and severe COPD exacerbations will be defined using an algorithm agreed upon by GlaxoSmithKline and the health plans that identifies these events from health plan medical claims data. Moderate exacerbation is any physician office visit, urgent care visit or emergency room visit for COPD where any oral corticosteroids or antibiotics are prescribed during visit. Severe exacerbations are any COPD related inpatient visit. Exacerbations will be determined in the same fashion in the retrospective pre-switch period and the prospective post switch period.</description>
