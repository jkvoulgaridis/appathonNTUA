  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to explore the effect of artificial lighting on
      affective symptoms, and the secondary aim is to explore the effect of artificial lighting on
      core symptoms of eating disorders (ED).

      Several lines of evidence, albeit from hypothesis generation studies, suggest that artificial
      lighting may have a positive effect on well-being, mental health and affective symptoms in
      ED. The rationale of this study is to investigate the effects of artificial lighting on
      affective symptoms and cores symptoms of ED in inpatients undergoing weight
      restoration/treatment for ED.

      Study design: Single-blind, controlled, pilot intervention study with circadian light (CL)
      comparing two CL regimens effects on mood symptoms.

      Planned number of subjects: 16 patients with a ICD-10 diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa, that
      completes exposure to at least three weeks of the two different CL regimens (L1 and L2) in
      any order.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to explore the effect of artificial lighting on
      affective symptoms, and the secondary aim is to explore the effect of artificial lighting on
      core symptoms of eating disorders (ED).

      If an effect is indicated, the study will provide information on how to improve light
      exposure to ED patients in psychiatric treatment units. In addition, the outcomes may help
      identify a better system for measurement and adjustment of the specific light variables of
      colour temperature and light intensity.
