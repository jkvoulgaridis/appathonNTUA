      habits in women suffering from severe/massive obesity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating rate is associated with BMI and weight gain in various populations and is a factor
      modulating the risk of complications after bariatric surgery. The aim of the present study is
      to determine whether common difficulties to change eating rate in subjects with obesity
      candidate to bariatric surgery could be due to more extensive abnormalities in eating
      behaviour.
