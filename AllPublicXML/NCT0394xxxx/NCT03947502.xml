  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, complex and disabling clinical entity that has an average
      global prevalence of 2.7%. It occurs mainly in women in a 3: 1 ratio. It is characterized by
      persistent generalized pain, fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction and numerous
      systemic symptoms such as dizziness, migraine, digestive alterations or sensory intolerances.
      At present there is no pharmacological treatment with specific indication for fibromyalgia.
      Usually, non-curative treatments are recommended that alleviate the symptoms of the patients
      and improve their quality of life and functionality.

      The investigator's main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness at 1 year of a group
      educational intervention in neurobiology of pain in patients affected by fibromyalgia, in
      comparison with the evolution of a control group that will continue only with its usual
      treatments. This intervention will be carried out in the field of Primary Care and its
      effectiveness will be assessed by reducing or not having diagnostic criteria (reduction of
      areas of pain and of the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms), using the Criteria for the
      Diagnosis of Fibromyalgia of the American College of Rheumatology 2010 (ACR 2010).

      Methodology of the project In group sessions of 14 patients, a health professional explained
      the neurological mechanisms that are behind the perception of pain, fatigue and illness from
      the recent knowledge in neuroscience about brain and pain, as well as the brain's ability to
      change patien´s behaviour thanks to neuroplasticity.

      There will be 5 sessions of 2 hours per week and another one per month. Before the latter, a
      workshop of 2 hours of movement will be given.

      Each week the contents of the class and other complementary materials will be sent to the
      patients.

    <intervention_name>Educational intervention in neurobiology of pain</intervention_name>
    <description>The educational intervention will intend to make the individual aware that in the processes of learning, sensitization, habituation and acquisition of beliefs about pain there are automatic unconscious mechanisms, which can be modulated through conscious behaviors. Based on this the investigators propose the active participation of patients in the process of desensitization of their central nervous system. The investigators will try to encourage attention and weaken the neuronal connections that make up the pain neuromatrix to establish new connections thanks to neuroplasticity.</description>
