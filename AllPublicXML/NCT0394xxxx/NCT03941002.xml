  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of mechanical ventilation is to improve gas exchange and to unload the respiratory
      muscles delivering a form of mechanical support to the ventilation. At the same time, it is
      essential that the support is individually-tailored to avoid the development of muscular
      atrophy, a process called &quot;ventilatory-induced diaphragm dysfunction&quot;

      Aim of the present study is that the continuous ultrasonographic assesment of diaphragm
      function, as obtained by the device under investigation (DiaMon, Respinor AS, Oslo, Norway)
      is related to the degree of effort of inspiratory muscles, as measured by gold-standard
      indices such as esophageal and gastric pressure measurement.

      A secondary aim is that the data assessed by the device are related to a standard
      ultrasonographic examination performed by expert operators.

      In particular, we will enroll a population of critically ill patients undergoing mechanical
      ventilation in assisted mode, and we will perform a decremental pressure support trial, with
      the following aims:

        1. to evaluate the performance of a continuous and automated device for the monitoring of
           diaphragm contractile activity, as compared to standard mechanical indices of
           respiratory effort such as the pressure-time product (PTP)

        2. to evaluate the performance of a continuous and automated device for the monitoring of
           diaphragm contractile activity, as compared to the ultrasonographic assesment of muscle
           function performed by an expert operator.
