  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate if the Connecting People (CP) Programme can be implemented by
      social care practitioners with high fidelity in community mental health teams (CMHTs) and
      improve the resourcefulness of social networks of people with mental health problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with mental health problems require a range of support to help them in their recovery.
      Alongside medical and psychological support, people may need support with engaging in
      meaningful activities and developing relationships. The focus of this study is on advancing
      understanding of how services can improve the support they offer to people around social
      relationships.

      In a previous study, a Connecting People programme was developed which supported people to
      make plans for developing their network of contacts in the community. When delivered fully,
      it helped people feel more included in society and better able to access advice, information
      and practical support from people they know.

      This research project aims to look at how Connecting People can be effectively established
      within community mental health teams by social workers trained as part of the 'Think Ahead'
      initiative. The investigators want to know how to implement the Connecting People programme
      well, assessing whether tools such as manuals, guidance and specific training help or hinder
      this process. The investigators want to know when implemented, compared to standard care,
      whether the programme benefits mental health service users and is cost-effective.

      The study will last 15 months and is organised into two phrases:

        1. Implementation of the programme in community mental health teams in five areas in
           England. Outcome data will be collected from each participating team and results will be
           compared between teams who implemented the programme and those that only offered
           standard care.

        2. Exploration of how successful implementation was across the five areas, using a
           check-list and in-depth individual and group interviews to understand the features that
           supported or hindered the process.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will use multiple methods to answer our research questions. It will consist of:
a natural experiment in the form of a non-randomised wait-list controlled pre-post study to evaluate the outcomes of the CP programme, when implemented in CMHTs, in contrast to standard care; and
an evaluation of the implementation tools using a standardised tool and qualitative approaches to understand the barriers and facilitators of implementation in the different sites.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resource Generator-UK (RG-UK)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire; Measure of access to social capital (knowing people with particular skills or resources within your social network). The name of the scale is the Resource Generator-UK. Example questions include: Do you currently have access to someone who is able to lend you a small amount of money? Do you currently have access to someone who works for the local authority? Answers are 'Yes' or 'No'; though further information is obtained on the relation of the person to the individual. Scale has 27 items and is scored 0-27 with high scores indicating high access to social capital.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire; GAS is a method of scoring the extent to which service users' individual goals are achieved in the course of intervention. In effect, each service user has their own outcome measure but this is scored in a standardised way as to allow statistical analysis. The name of the scale is the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). Importance from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very important). Difficulty: from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very difficult).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire about the process of recovery (QPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire; Measurement of people's perception of their recovery from mental health problems. Items include, for example, 'I feel better abut myself', 'I feel that my life has a purpose'. The scale has 15 items which are answered using a 5-point likert scale from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'. Responses are scored 1-5 and summed, with totals from 15-75. Higher values represent a better recovery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measurement of health related quality of life. The first part comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems and the participant is asked to select the most appropriate for them. The digits for the five dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state. High numbers indicate poor health-related quality of life.
The second part records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale (VAS), where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the participant's own judgement from 0-100. High scores indicate better self-rated health.</description>

    <measure>The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measurement of mental well-being. The scale includes 14 items such as 'I've been feeling optimistic about the future'. 'I've been feeling relaxed', 'I've been feeling confident'. Each item is answered using a 5-point likert scale from 'none of the time' to 'all of the time', with values of 1-5 ascribed to each response. The scale is a sum of item values ranging from 15 to 70 with higher values indicating higher mental well-being</description>
