  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a preliminary MRI study of healthy volunteers's hands investigators showed that the
      suppression of the fat signal obtained by the Dixon sequences is greater than that obtained
      by the &quot;classic&quot; CHESS sequences with a better T1-weighted image quality. The investigators
      goal now is to compare these sequences in the quantification of the inflammatory activity of
      rheumatoid arthritis by the RAMRIS score. To investigators knowledge, only one study compared
      those two types of sequence with many limitations including a limited number of patients
      included.

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory arthropathy and it mostly
      affect young women. The MRI sequences currently validated for the joint inflammation
      assessment are the fat-suppressed sequences produced either by spectral presaturation (CHESS
      sequences) or by inversion-recovery (STIR = short tau inversion recovery sequence). The
      presaturation sequences outweigh the STIR sequence due to higher spatial resolution at the
      expense of sometimes more random saturation of the fat signal. Recently, a third method of
      suppressing the fat signal (Dixon method) has reappeared thanks to advances in computing
      power (post-processing). In a preliminary MRI study of the hands of healthy volunteers, the
      investigators showed that the suppression of the fat signal obtained by the Dixon sequences
      is greater than that obtained by the &quot;classic&quot; CHESS sequences in T1 and T2 weighting with
      better quality. image in T1 weighting. This increased performance, particularly in terms of
      fat suppression, could lead to better detection of PR lesions on MRI.
