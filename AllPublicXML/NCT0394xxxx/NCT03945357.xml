  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if the incidence of infection at the Surgical SitE is impacted
      if with Antibiotic Irrigation is used during Ventral Hernia Repair (RINSE Trial)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is common after open ventral hernia repair. Numerous factors
      contribute, including patient comorbidities, operative technique, and degree of contamination
      of the case. SSI often requires prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission, or
      other procedural intervention. One potential intervention to reduce SSI is the use of
      antibiotic irrigation, which has been shown to reduce SSI in colorectal surgery in a recent
      randomized control trial. We retrospectively evaluated our use of dual antibiotic irrigation
      at the time of mesh placement during open ventral hernia repair (OVHR), demonstrating a
      significant reduction in SSI (16.5 vs 5.4%) using a combination of gentamicin and clindamycin
      irrigation when compared to saline alone.

      We plan to complete a registry-based, randomized clinical trial (RCT) through the Americas
      Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC) to further assess the impact of dual antibiotic
      irrigation on SSI after OVHR with mesh. This will include patients undergoing open
      retromuscular (RM) repair with or without transversus abdominis myofascial advancement flap
      (TAR) with placement of permanent synthetic mesh (mid-weight, large-pore polypropylene).
      Power analysis based on only this subset of patients from our initial study indicates a total
      of 210 patients are needed to demonstrate a significant reduction in SSI using antibiotic
      irrigation vs saline irrigation alone.

    <description>Normal saline is to be placed into the dissected retromuscular space AFTER placement and fixation of mesh. This should fill the cavity completely to the level of the skin. Irrigant is to be left to stand for a total of three minutes and then evacuated. Additional irrigation with saline PRIOR to the randomization is permitted at the surgeons' discretion for hemostasis with no requirement for duration. Additional saline irrigation of the subcutaneous space after fascia closure should be performed prior to skin closure.</description>

    <description>Antibiotic solution is prepared consisting of 240 mg gentamicin and 600 mg clindamycin in 500 ml saline to ensure proper concentration. This solution should be placed into the dissected retromuscular space AFTER placement and fixation of mesh. This should fill the cavity completely to the level of the skin. Irrigant is to be left to stand for a total of three minutes and then evacuated. Additional irrigation with saline PRIOR to the randomization is permitted at the surgeons' discretion for hemostasis with no requirement for duration. Additional antibiotic irrigation of the subcutaneous space after fascia closure should be performed prior to skin closure. This second irrigation is not timed.</description>
