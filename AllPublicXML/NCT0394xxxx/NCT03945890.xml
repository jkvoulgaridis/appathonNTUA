      Importing quality improvement practices and enhances health education to improving quality of
      bowel preparation for health screening colonoscopy

      This is a retrospective data analysis study aimed at obtaining the types of purgative
      treatments used, the results of bowel preparation, and each subject's demographic
      characteristics (Age &amp; Gender).

      This study aimed to check-up the result and the impact of patient education using a medical
      team resource management (TRM) method on the adequacy of bowel preparation.

      Investigators collected a total of 2,104 (884 female, 1,220 male) healthy subjects who
      underwent a health check-up colonoscopy screening were enrolled before and after the
      application of the TRM program intervention. The efficacy of the TRM intervention and the
      factors affecting bowel preparation were estimated using multivariate logistic regression in
      this study.

      Enrollment of study subjects and data collection: The subjects enrolled in this study were
      those who received a health check-up colonoscopy screening in a tertiary center, Far Eastern
      Memorial Hospital (FEMH), in Taiwan from March 2013 to August 2014. A total of 2,104 healthy
      subjects who underwent check-up colonoscopy screening were enrolled during the
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, and validation periods. Investigators need to collect
      each subject's demographic characteristics (Age &amp; Gender) and the types of purgative
      treatments used were collected to analyze. According to the Aronchick Bowel Preparation
      Scale, this study divided the degree of bowel cleansing into four levels, namely,
      &quot;Excellent&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Fair&quot; and &quot;Poor&quot;. Investigators also need to collect the results of
      bowel preparation to calculate of the adequate bowel cleansing rate was defined further as
      the percentage of the participants with &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; cleansing in our analysis.

    <description>The multivariate logistic regression analysis results for adequate bowel preparation after adjustments for age, gender, purgative type, to analyze the adequate bowel preparation rate with different intervention period.
Bowel preparation rate were the Good &amp; Excellent % of the total cases. Each subject's demographic characteristics (Age &amp; Gender), the type of purgative and bowel preparation rate were collected from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) in Taiwan. This study was secondary data analysis, and the data contains no person's details, images, or videos. This is a retrospective data analysis study, investigators collected data enrolled in this study were those who received a health check-up colonoscopy screening.</description>
