      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the efficacy of lanreotide given every 4 weeks in participants with advanced
           or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

        -  To assess the toxicity and safety of lanreotide in participants with advanced or
           metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

        -  To document the effects of lanreotide on markers of biochemical activity in participants
           with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

      Primary endpoints:

      • Assess efficacy by estimating the tumor growth rate while a patient is enrolled on study
      and comparing the growth rates on lanreotide to the pre-enrolment growth rate.

      Secondary endpoints include measurement of:

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST defined as partial response (PR) +
           complete response (CR)

        -  Magnitude of reduction in levels of 24-hour urinary metanephrines, catecholamines and
           magnitude of reduction in serum chromogranin A, evaluated every two months while
           enrolled on study.

    <textblock>
      Lanreotide is FDA approved for certain kinds of neuroendocrine tumors. This study seeks to
      determine if lanreotide is beneficial for patients with paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

      Given the rarity of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma that precludes the conduct of a randomized
      clinical trial in a timely manner, a novel method for assessing efficacy is being proposed.
      Efficacy will be assessed by estimating the tumor growth rate while a patient is enrolled on
      study and comparing the growth rates on lanreotide to the pre-enrollment growth rates. The
      method of analysis that will be used has been previously described. For this assessment a
      minimum of three tumor measurements will be required.

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Responses are based on assessments per RECIST 1.1. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion in the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Male or female at least 18 years of age at the time of first dosing

          2. Patients must give signed informed consent before any study-related activities are
             conducted.

          3. Patients in the United States must have given written authorization for the release of
             protected health information in compliance with HIPAA regulations; patients in other
             countries must provide appropriate authorization as needed by regulatory authorities
             in each country.

          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant paraganglioma or
             pheochromocytoma and either evidence of metastases or unresectability.

          5. Evidence of recent disease progression (radiological, biochemical, symptomatic) while
             the patient was either not receiving any therapy or was receiving a therapy that was
             deemed ineffective.

          6. Measurable disease defined as that which can be measured in at least one dimension
             with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan. The patient must also have at least three
             baseline radiographic studies obtained in the previous twelve months with at least one
             scan obtained within six weeks of enrollment. If a patient being considered for
             enrollment on trial has not had three scans performed in the twelve months prior to
             enrollment and if in the opinion of the investigator a delay of one month will not
             impact the clinical course, then enrollment on protocol and the start of the
             lanreotide therapy can be delayed by one month or longer to obtain the additional time
             point. If in the opinion of the investigator such a delay may have adverse
             consequences then enrollment on the protocol should not be considered as an option

          7. Confirmation of positive somatostatin receptor status (SRS) by Somatostatin Receptor
             Scintigraphy. Either of these studies will need to have been performed in the 6 months
             prior to the screening visit. Only if one has not been performed within the previous 6
             months will a SRS study be required. if an SRS is required, it will be performed
             greater than or equal to 24 hours after a previous injection of subcutaneous
             octreotide).

          8. Patients may not have had prior octreotide, long acting release (LAR)-octreotide,
