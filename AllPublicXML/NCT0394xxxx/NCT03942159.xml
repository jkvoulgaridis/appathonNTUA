  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogenic HSCT brings significant changes in biodiversity and composition of the gut
      microbiome through antibiotic usage, the mucosal damage due to the chemo- and radiotherapy
      toxicity; compromised oral nutritional intake and graft-versus-host disease with gut damage
      as the complication. Aim of the study is to investigate the composition of the microbiota in
      both recipient and nursing relative donor, reveal changes in biodiversity after HSCT via
      3-time points V3V4 16S rRNA and NGS sequencing of the colon and oral swabs, 3-indoxyl-sulfate
      measurement in the urine.
