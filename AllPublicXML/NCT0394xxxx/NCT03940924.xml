  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women, as men, are more prone to central or android obesity than premenopausal
      women. Recently, some studies have shown that obesity is associated with gut microbiota
      dysbiosis and gut microbiota could be responsible of fat mass accumulation. Moreover,
      abdominal fat mass accumulation is associated with an increase of cardiovascular disease
      risks.

      Recent studies suggest that physical activity may positively alter gut microbiota
      composition. Accumulating evidence suggests that high intensity interval training (HIIT) is
      an effective strategy for reducing body fat of overweight individuals, especially at the
      abdominal level. Resistance Training (RT) is associated with increased muscle mass and
      strength gain in main muscle groups. Thus, RT is also an interesting modality to fight
      against deconditioning and autonomy loss with age.

      The aim of the study was to observed the effects of a 12-week high intensity interval
      training (HIIT) combined with resistance training (RT) program on gut microbiota and body
      composition changes in postmenopausal women.

      It is hypothesized that HIIT +RT will improve gut microbiota and body composition (including
      whole body and (intra)-abdominal fat mass) in a concomitant and parallel way.

      The aim of the study was to observed the effects of a 12-week high intensity interval
      training (HIIT) combined with resistance training (RT) program on gut microbiota and body
      composition changes in postmenopausal women.

      30 postmenopausal women will be randomly assigned to HIIT + RT (n= 15) group or Control group
      (n=15).

      HIIT+RT: Each subject performed HIIT protocol consisted of repeated 60 cycles of speeding up
      for 8 s followed by pedalling slowly for 12 s (20min) Then they performed a single set of 10
      exercises with 1 or 2min resting period between exercises. The set consisted of 8-12
      repetitions at about 80% maximum repetition (1RM).

      Control group : (no training program) Subjects will keep their life style.

      Faecal microbiota and body composition will be measured before and after the intervention (3
      months).

      The investigators will examine the effects of HIIT + RT programs on:

      Body composition : total-abdominal and visceral fat mass, total fat free mass and muscle mass
      Faecal concentration of short chain fatty acids Total fat free mass (and appendicular fat
      free mass) (DEXA) Glycemic profile (plasma HbA1c, plasma glucose, plasma insulin) Lipid
      profile (TG, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol) Aerobic capacity (VO2 max) Muscular capacity
      (fatigability, isometric and dynamic strenght)
