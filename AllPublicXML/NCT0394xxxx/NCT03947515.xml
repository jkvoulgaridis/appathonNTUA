  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, the cancer process has been linked to microbial infections, particularly
      in gastric and Helicobacter pylori cancers, but also in cervical cancers promoted by exposure
      to Human papilloma virus (HPV). More recently, it has been shown that bacteria in the
      intestinal microbiota could promote the development of colorectal cancer by modulating the
      inflammatory response within the intestinal mucosa. Among male cancers, prostate cancer is
      the leading cause in France with 54,000 new cases per year. In addition, the dogma that urine
      is sterile has been broken and the notion of the presence of a &quot;urinary microbiota&quot; in
      asymptomatic patients is now accepted.

      While the risk factors associated with this cancer have not yet been clearly elucidated,
      recent evidence in the literature agrees that chronic inflammation associated with prostate
      infection plays a key role as a factor that may promote the development and/or progression of
      prostate cancer. Most recently, a study shows for the first time that a group of 6 bacteria
      is found significantly higher in the urine of patients with prostate cancer than in patients
      with prostate adenoma. Interestingly, clinical microbiology studies conducted at the
      bacteriology laboratory of the University Hospital of Nice on A. schaalii have shown that
      this species is also isolated in the urine of patients with bladder and prostate cancers.

      The investigators wish to study the association of the 6 bacterial species mentioned above
      with prostate cancer by directly analyzing the prostate tissue of patients with this
      condition.

      the staff will carry out a multicenter case-control study by recruiting a total of 260
      patients in 4 centres (Nice coordinating centre, Marseille, Tours and NÃ®mes): 130 in the
      prostate cancer group and 130 in the prostate adenoma control group. This project is a
      research involving the human person of category 2.

      The innovative aspect of the work consists in detecting and quantifying in situ in the
      prostate tissue the presence of these 6 bacterial species per culture and per PCR in real
      time, comparing the prostate microbiota in terms of richness and diversity between cancer
      patients and those without cancer. Ultimately, this study opens up exciting prospects with
      the possibility of determining a microbial origin of prostate cancer and considering
      antibiotic therapy for anti-cancer purposes such as H. pylori and gastric cancer.

    <description>All patients included, will report to the urology department on the date previously agreed with the surgeon. The patient will be seen by the nurse and urologist on duty as part of outpatient care or, more rarely, in ambulatory care. After verification of the patient's identity, the signature of informed consent, the absence of immediate contraindications to biopsy (haemorrhagic and infectious) and the patient's proper preparation (antibiotic prophylaxis and possible enema), the patient will be installed for the taking of samples covered by the protocol (rectal swabbing and prostate biopsies, see paragraph IX). If the patient has not taken the antibiotic prophylaxis or performed the enema, he or she will be reconvened at a later date for the biopsies. After the prostatic biopsies have been performed, the patient's participation in the study ends and his follow-up resumes according to the recommendations adapted to his pathology.</description>
