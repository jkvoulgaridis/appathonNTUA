  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Psoriasis is a common chronic, inflammatory disease characterized by skin changes and
           joint involvement. About 50% of patients with psoriasis have damage to the nail,
           especially in pustular psoriasis in the continuous acromegaly dermatitis. Common damage
           includes pitting, uneven and tarnish of the deck, as well as the occurrence of nail
           ridges, furrows, turbidity, hypertrophy, free ends and nail bed stripping, and even the
           whole deck deformity or absence, etc., seriously affecting patients' social interaction
           and mental health. Pathologically, telangiectasis is associated with the superficial and
           middle layers of the dermis. Previous treatment of psoriasis nail is mainly topical
           drugs (such as glucocorticoid, etc.), but due to its long disease period, topical drugs
           are difficult to transdermal absorption, and the curative effect of skin lesions is
           poor.

        2. Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is effective for vasodilatory diseases, especially for the
           superficial to middle layers of the dermis

        3. It has been reported that PDL is effective in the treatment of psoriasis vulgis by
           blocking the nutrient supply vessels of the lesions, improving the surrounding
           microenvironment, reducing the number of cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells in the
           dermis, and promoting the normalization of epidermal proliferation and differentiation.

        4. Halometasone is a potent halogen - containing topical glucocorticoid. Have stronger
           fight inflammation, fight allergy, contractive hemal, reduce hemal to connect the action
           of permeability and fight hyperplasia Vaseline belongs to a kind of mineral wax, without
           irritant, not easy to deteriorate, can let skin surface form a protective film when used
           on the skin, let the moisture of the skin be evaporated not easily, have better protect
           wet effect.

    <description>Nail matrix score: according to the proportion of nail matrix damage (puncture, meniscus with all white and red spots, and nail fragmentation) to the nail matrix content, 0 means no, 1 means 1/4 nail, 2 means 2/4 nail, 3 means cumulative 3/4 nail, and 4 means total nail.
Nail bed score: the nail bed damage (nail dissection, puncture hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis under the nail, salmon spot) is graded according to the proportion of the nail bed. 0 means no, 1 means 1/4 nail, 2 means 2/4 nail, 3 means cumulative 3/4 nail, and 4 means total nail.
Single nail score is the sum of nail matrix score and nail bed score (0-8 points), The final score is the sum of all single nail scores (0-80), and the nail score can be conducted at any time as required.</description>
