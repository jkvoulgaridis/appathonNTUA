  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two modes of laser (Er:YAG) treatment for snoring will be compared with sham treatment in a
      randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of snoring treatment using
      non-ablative Er:YAG laser in comparison with sham laser treatment. Furthermore, to different
      modes of Er:YAG laser will be compared; a long-pulse mode (LP) and proprietary SMOOTH mode
      (Fotona, Slovenia).
