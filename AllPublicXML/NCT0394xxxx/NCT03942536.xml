      Through a 12-month mixed methods, observational cohort study, investigators from Maseno
      University, University of Minnesota (UMN) and OHR-EKC will assess barriers influencing access
      to emergency pregnancy, obstetrical and neonatal care among patients seeking care at 9 health
      centers on Mfangano Island, as well as the preliminary impact and feasibility/acceptability
      of the HN approach for improving access to MNH services and shortening delays in care.

    <description>At 12-month follow-up, a purposeful, convenience sample of study participants and their significant others, Community Health Workers trained as Health Navigators, and local program staff, will be invited by research staff to participate in focus group discussions to collect qualitative data on pregnancy care, experience of navigating obstetrical emergencies, financial hardships, and Health Navigation program feasibility/acceptability. Particular attention will be paid to recruiting study subjects involved in complex obstetrical emergencies, cases that involved significant delays in transfer of care, cases resulting in significant morbidity/mortality, as well as cases that involved efficient/successful care coordination, referral, and transportation.</description>
