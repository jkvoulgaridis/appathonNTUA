    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Subjects with newly diagnosed
      gestational diabetes will be randomized to either standard of care diabetes education versus
      standard of care plus an interactive educational application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes is a condition diagnosed during pregnancy that causes blood sugars to
      rise. Diet and exercise can effectively control blood sugar levels in 70-85% of women
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association. At the
      investigator's institution, only 50-54% of women with this diagnosis effectively reach the
      target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. This has become a more commonly seen
      problem throughout the US. Those that fail to achieve target blood sugar levels require
      medication and have higher risks of poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Studies have shown
      that an increase in education can increase compliance to diet and education. Specifically,
      media based education that are interactive may more effectively lead to changes in a person's
      behavior.
