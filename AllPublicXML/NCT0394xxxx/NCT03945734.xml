  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility, cultural-sensitivity, and health effects of the
      expressive helping intervention by conducting a single-arm trial with Chinese-speaking cancer
      patients and survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines whether expressive helping is feasible and culturally-sensitive for
      Chinese American cancer patients and survivors. For 20 minutes each week over four weeks,
      participants choose to write or voice-record their thoughts about cancer by following
      specific prompts designed to help them process their cancer experiences. During the last week
      of this reflection exercise, participants write or voice-record an anonymous letter to
      another Chinese cancer patient by sharing their cancer experience and providing advice and
      encouragement. Health outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1-month, and 3-month follow-ups. A
      subset of the participants will be invited to share their experiences with the study through
      qualitative interviews after the last writing/voice-recording session. This research study
      provides an opportunity for Chinese American cancer patients and survivors to express their
      feelings without the fear of burdening others, and give them an opportunity to help others by
      sharing their cancer experiences.

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale (FACT) is a 27-item measure of health-related quality of life (Cella &amp; Tulsky,1993). This scale assesses contains four different subscales, including physical well-being (7 items), social well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), and functional well-being (7 items).</description>

    <description>Participants complete four 20-minute writing/voice-recording sessions spaced one week apart. During the first week, the instructions will explain that cancer patients and survivors benefit from learning about other cancer survivors' experiences. They are told that the first three weeks of writing/voice-recording (writing/talking about their stress and coping at Week 1, deepest emotions about cancer at Week 2, self-affirmation and benefit finding at Week 3) are exercises designed to help them think about their cancer experiences and to prepare them to write/record the narrative they would share on Week 4. During Week 4, they are asked to write/record a narrative as if they are speaking to another Chinese person with cancer, adding advice and encouragements, and reminded that their writing/recording would be shared with other Chinese American cancer patients and survivors.</description>

    <intervention_name>Expressive Helping</intervention_name>
    <description>Expressive helping harnesses the benefits of helping others (e.g., support giving) through writing or voice-recording. Expressive helping integrates two distinct areas of research showing that writing or speaking about ones' negative experiences and engaging in support giving behaviors can improve psychological well-being.</description>
