  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized snack study in normal to obese adults that will test
      whether snack size, choice, or variety has an influence on daily snack intake.

      Aim 1: To validate the in-house packout methodology with 3-day dietary recalls. Aim 2: To
      examine whether snack variety or snack package size will influence free-living snacking
      behavior.

      Aim 3: To identify whether a correlation exists between mindful eating and free-living
      snacking behavior.

      Participants will complete 4 different snack patterns. Each pattern will include 3
      nonconsecutive weekdays (i.e., Monday/Wednesday/Friday; Tuesday/Thursday/Monday, etc.). The
      snack patterns will be performed at home/work.

      The first pattern will simply be a measurement of typical snack habits. For each of the 3
      days, the participant will enter all foods and beverages consumed using the online program,
      Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24).

      For the other 3 patterns, different snack packouts will be provided to the participant for 3
      nonconsecutive weekdays/pattern. The only difference between the packouts is the type of
      foods provided. The packouts contain commercially available foods commonly eaten by people
      who snack. Following lunch, the participant will be permitted to eat as much or as little as
      he/she chooses from the packout until going to bed. Beverages will not be provided and the
      participant could drink whatever he/she typically consumes.

      For all patterns, the participant will be provided with a standardized breakfast, lunch, and
      dinner to consume at home/work for each of the 3 days/pattern.

    <measure>Ad libitum Snack Energy Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>12 testing days across ~4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Free-living energy intake will be assessed on the three testing days of each testing arm. For the control testing days, the participant will be provided with a standardized breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and will be required to log any snacks consumed on the Automated Self-Administered Recall System (ASA24). For each pack-out testing day, the participant will be provided a standardized breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as an excess of snacks to consume, ad libitum, throughout the day. All food items will be initially weighed and recorded. The participants will be instructed to return all uneaten foods as well as all wrappers and containers from consumed food. Any partially eaten, returned items will be weighed accordingly. The snacking and daily energy intake (as well as protein, carbohydrate, sugar, fiber, and fat intake) will be assessed from these pack-outs.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ad libitum Food Category Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>9 testing days across ~3-5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Free-living food category intake will be assessed on the three testing days of each packout. The participant will be provided a standardized breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as an excess of snacks to consume, ad libitum, throughout the day. All food items will be initially weighed and recorded. The participants will be instructed to return all uneaten foods as well as all wrappers and containers from consumed food. Any partially eaten, returned items will be weighed accordingly. The snack intake of different food categories (i.e. desserts and candy, salty, high fat, high sugar, fruits and vegetables) will be assessed from these pack-outs.</description>

    <description>For 3 days during the control snack pattern, the participants will be asked to complete dietary recalls concerning their afternoon and evening snacking behavior. The participants will use the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24) system which was developed by the National Cancer Institute.</description>

    <description>Each packout provided during 3 of the 4 snack patterns will contain a variety of foods to be consumed, ad libitum, throughout the remainder of the day following the standardized lunch. There are 3 different packouts that will be provided for 3 nonconsecutive weekdays (for a total of 9 packouts). Each packout contains the same calories and types of foods. However, they differ in packaging size and variety.</description>
