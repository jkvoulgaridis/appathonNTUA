  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China. Regorafenib is the
      standard multi-kinase inhibitor for refractory advanced colorectal cancer. In mice,
      regorafenib combined with anti-PD-1 was shown superior to regorafenib, which has not yet been
      verified in humans. JS001 is the Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which
      has been approved for melanoma. This study is the first multi-center, open-label, phase I/II
      clinical trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with
      regorafenib tablet in patients with MSS/MSI-L/pMMR, relapsed or metastatic colorectal cancer
      who have failed or can not tolerate fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based systemic
      treatment. The phase I clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of regorafenib tablet in this regimen, and select an acceptable
      safe dose for the phase II clinical trial to further determine safety and efficacy of this
      combination regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China, with incidence and
      mortality ranking the 3rd and 4th among malignancies in China. Regorafenib is the standard
      multi-kinase inhibitor for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, with multiple anti-tumor
      effects by inhibiting targets related to tumor cell proliferation, tumor metastasis, tumor
      angiogenesis and tumor immune escape, howerver, its efficacy is limited. Immunotherapy has
      become standard treatment for mCRC patients with MSI-H/dMMR. Combination of anti-angiogenesis
      treatment and immunotherapy may have a better anti-tumor effect. In mice, regorafenib
      combined with anti-PD-1 was shown superior to regorafenib, which has not yet been verified in
      humans. JS001 is the Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been
      approved for melanoma. This study is the first multi-center, open-label, phase I/II clinical
      trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with regorafenib
      tablet in patients with MSS/MSI-L/pMMR, relapsed or metastatic colorectal cancer who have
      failed or can not tolerate fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based systemic treatment.
      The phase I clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) of regorafenib tablet in this regimen, and select an acceptable safe dose for
      the phase II clinical trial to further determine safety and efficacy of this combination
      regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
