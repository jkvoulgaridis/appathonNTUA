      The purpose of this study is to describe patterns of treatment used for cHL and sALCL in real
      world setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective and retrospective study of participants with cHL
      and sALCL. The study will collect information on therapy and outcome of cHL and sALCL in
      real-life clinical practice.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. Based on the diagnosis of the disease,
      participants will be assigned to one of the following groups:

        -  Newly Diagnosed and RR cHL Participants

        -  Newly Diagnosed and RR sALCL Participants

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Russia. The retrospective data will be collected
      for the participants with RR cHL or RR sALCL at the time of enrollment and for participants
      with RR cHL or RR sALCL within 3 years prior to inclusion in the study at Visit 1 (Baseline).
      The prospective data will be collected for a period of 2 years from Visit 1 (Baseline) to
      Visit 5 (Month 24, Final Visit), both for newly diagnosed participants with cHL or sALCL and
      participants with RR cHL or RR sALCL at the time of enrolment, and participants with RR cHL
      or RR sALCL within 3 years prior to inclusion in the study.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
