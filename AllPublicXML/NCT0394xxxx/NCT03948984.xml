  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noise in the ICU can worsen patient outcomes through factors such as increased cardiovascular
      stress, alteration in sleep, and increased discomfort or pain The purpose of this study is to
      determine the benefit of therapeutic music in the ICU on patients, their families, and ICU
      staff.

      Noise in the ICU can worsen patient outcomes through factors such as increased cardiovascular
      stress, alteration in sleep, and increased discomfort or pain. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the benefit of therapeutic music in the ICU on patients, their families, and ICU
      staff. The results of this study will inform clinicians on best practices for redesigning,
      implementing and evaluating a patient and family focused therapeutic music program in the
      ICU.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived pain visual analog score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes long)</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of patient reported perceived pain visual analog score using an 11-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived anxiety visual analog score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes long)</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of patient reported perceived anxiety visual analog score using an 11-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no anxiety) to 10 (worst possible anxiety).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived relaxation visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and after therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes long)</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of patient reported perceived relaxation visual analog score using an 11-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (not relaxed at all) to 10 (completely relaxed).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>After conclusion of therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of acceptability of therapeutic music session using the AIM which is a 4-item survey where each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Higher total AIM scores indicate greater implementability. This assessment will be completed by patients, family members, and ICU clinical staff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Perceived Impact</measure>
    <time_frame>After conclusion of therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient and family member perceived impact will be assessed using the Patient Music Evaluation Form. Patient and family member participants will complete this 2-item word choice question form to assess how live music made them feel (26 word choices offered eg., happy, sad, hopeful, energized) and whether the music performance made them do anything (20 word choices offered eg., laugh, smile, sing).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Intervention (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>After conclusion of therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>ICU clinical staff perceived feasibility of therapeutic music session intervention will be assessed with the FIM, a 4-item, 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Higher total scores indicate greater feasibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>After conclusion of therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of appropriateness of therapeutic music session using the IAM which is a 4-item survey where each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Higher total AIM scores indicate greater implementability. This assessment will be completed by ICU clinical staff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Barriers</measure>
    <time_frame>After conclusion of therapeutic music session (about 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived barriers will be assessed using qualitative analysis of a 2-item multiple response option and open-ended questions asking for feedback about facilitation and barriers to implementation of therapeutic music in ICU.</description>
