    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, pilot feasibility study to document the effects of
      adventitial delivery of temsirolimus or temsirolimus with dexamethasone sodium phosphate
      injection, USP, after revascularization of femoropopliteal lesions in symptomatic patients
      with moderate to severe claudication (Rutherford 2-3) or critical limb ischemia (CLI) with
      rest pain (Rutherford 4). Subjects will be followed for up to 60 months post index procedure.

      To begin to assess the safety and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device adventitial
      deposition of temsirolimus or temsirolimus with dexamethasone in maintaining luminal patency
      and composite safety endpoints in patients with clinical evidence of moderate to severe
      claudication or critical limb ischemia with rest pain after revascularization of one or more
