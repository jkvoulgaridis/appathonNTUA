  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical study to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy and safety of HLX10 monotherapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable or
      metastatic MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors who have progressed or intolerable after standard
      therapy.This study consists of three periods, screening period (28 days), treatment period
      and follow-up period (including safety follow-up, survival follow-up).Subjects can be
      enrolled into this study only if they meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion
      criteria. The enrolled subjects will receive an intravenous infusion of HLX10 (3 mg/kg) once
      every 2 weeks until the loss of clinical benefit, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of
      informed consent or other reasons as specified in the protocol, or up to the longest
      treatment duration-2 years (52 dosing periods) (whichever occurs earlier).
