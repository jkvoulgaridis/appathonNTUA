      Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of continuous and
      pulsed ultrasound treatments in lateral epicondylitis and to compare the efficacy of these
      two treatments against each other and placebo.

      Patients and Methods: Fifty one patients diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis were included
      to the study. Patients were randomised to continuous ultrasound, pulsed ultrasound and
      placebo groups by using closed envelop method. First group received continuous ultrasound
      treatment. Second group received pulsed ultrasound treatment in proportion as. Third group
      received of placebo treatment. Resting and moving pain levels of the patients were evaluated
      by using visual analog scale. Muscle strength was evaluated by using dynamometer. For
      functional evaluation Duruoz's hand index and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE)
      scales were used. Evaluations were made at baseline, at the end of the therapy, and one month
      after the therapy. In addition, at baseline and at the end of the therapy, the thickness of
      the common extensor tendon was measured by using ultrasonic imaging (USG).

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of continuous and pulsed ultrasound
      treatments in lateral epicondylitis and to compare the efficacy of these two treatments
      against each other and placebo.

      Fifty one patients (33 women, 18 men) diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis were included to
      the study. Patients were randomised to continuous ultrasound (n=17), pulsed ultrasound (n=17)
      and placebo (n=17) groups by using closed envelop method. First group received 10 sessions of
      1 W/cm2 and 1,5 MHz continuous ultrasound treatment. Second group received 10 sessions of 1
      W/cm2 and 1,5 MHz pulsed ultrasound treatment in proportion as 1:4. Third group received 10
      sessions of placebo treatment with the same device seemed to be working but without
      delivering any output. Resting and moving pain levels of the patients were evaluated by using
      visual analog scale. Muscle strength was evaluated by using dynamometer. For functional
      evaluation Duruoz's hand index and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) scales were
      used. Evaluations were made at baseline, at the end of the therapy, and one month after the
      therapy. In addition, at baseline and at the end of the therapy, the thickness of the common
      extensor tendon was measured by using ultrasonic imaging (USG).
