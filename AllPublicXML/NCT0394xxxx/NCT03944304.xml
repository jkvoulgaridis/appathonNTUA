  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of KIT mutation and KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (GlivecTM,
      Novartis), survival of patients with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal
      tumor (GIST) has significantly improved. Recently, sunitinib (SuteneTM, Pfizer) and
      regorafenib (StivargaTM, Bayer) have been proven to be effective as second- and third-line
      treatment, respectively in GIST patients who failed to imatinib treatment.

      However, almost all patients eventually experience disease progression due to the development
      of drug resistance to first-line imatinib, second-line sunitinib treatment, and third-line
      regorafenib.

      Historic data suggest that GISTs do not respond to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but
      systematic unbiased screening has not been performed. A recent large-scaled chemotherapy
      susceptibility screening with GIST cells showed that among a total of 89 chemotherapies, 37
      have anti-cancer effect in at least one type of GIST cells. It was suggested that of these
      agents, transcriptional inhibitors and chemotherapies such as topoisomerase II, paclitaxel,
      and bortezomib would be effective.

      Based on this study result, Asan Medical Center has recently performed a phase II study for
      efficacy and safety evaluation of paclitaxel in patients with advanced and/or metastatic GIST
      after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib. Although paclitaxel showed limited
      anti-tumor efficacy, it was more effective in patients with low P-glycoprotein expression.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel in patients
      with metastatic or advanced GIST with low P-glycoprotein expression after failure of at least
      imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib.

             Disease progression is defined as follows:

               -  Increase of tumor size by more than 20% according to RECIST version 1.1,

               -  Appearance of a definite new lesion (excluding small cystic new lesions in the
                  liver within 6 months of starting TKIs)

               -  A new solid nodule with in a cystic mass, or

               -  Increase of the size (&gt; 20%) of previously existing solid nodule within a cystic
                  mass

             Intolerability to previous TKI is defined as follows:

               -  Less than 75% of medication compliance due to non-hematological toxicity of grade
                  2 or above despite dose reduction to a one-step lower level (300 mg/day for

                  continuous schedule for sunitinib; and 120 mg/day for regorafenib)

               -  Febrile neutropenia, Grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt;6 days, Grade 4

                  described above

          4. P-glycoprotein immunohistochemistry (IHC) H-score ≤250 in tumor tissue obtained after
             failure of previous treatment for GIST, including imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib

               -  H-score is a sum of the multiplications of each intensity score (0-3) measured by
                  the IHC and its corresponding proportion (0-100) of tumor cells (a score of
                  0-300).

               -  Intensity is evaluated as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong).

               -  e.g.) If a proportion with an intensity of 3 is 40%, proportion with an intensity
                  of 2 is 30%, proportion with an intensity of 1 is 20%, and proportion with an
                  intensity of 0 is 10%, H-score is 200 (3x40 + 2x30 + 1x20).

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for this study
