      Cancer is considered to be the leading cause of death among non-infectious diseases and the
      most important obstacle to increase life expectancy for every country in the 21st century.
      However, even if various interventions such as embolization chemotherapy, systemic
      chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and targeted therapy are widely used in clinical
      practice, the improvement of patients' survival is still limited. Our previous study found
      that arginine hydrochloride could significantly promote the apoptosis of liver cancer cells,
      and inhibit the progression of HCC by prompting the urea cycle. Therefore, our research group
      has carried out this study to evaluate the efficacy of arginine in preventing cancers.
