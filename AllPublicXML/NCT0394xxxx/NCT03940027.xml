  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that injecting local anesthetics in areas rich in blood vessels increases
      the risk of drug injection into blood vessels by mistake and increases the systemic
      absorption of drugs, which may increase the incidence of central nervous system and
      cardiovascular system toxic events caused by local anesthetics.EUS-CPN-related complications
      have not been clearly associated with local anesthetic adverse events.However, EUS-CPN local
      anesthetic injection area is located around the beginning of the abdominal trunk with
      abundant large and small blood vessels. The choice of local anesthetics with higher safety
      than bupivacaine, such as ropivacaine, is of great significance to ensure the safety of
      eus-cpn, especially for eus-cpn beginners.At present, there are no reports on the application
      of ropivacaine in eus-cpn.

    <intervention_name>EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis</intervention_name>
    <description>EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUE-CPN) is an endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection of local anesthetics and neurodegenerative agents into the abdominal ganglion area through the gastric wall, so as to achieve irreversible damage of the abdominal nerve and interrupt the pain pathway of pancreatic cancer.EUS-CPN has the advantages of less trauma, higher technical success rate and lower risk of complications compared with traditional ct-guided CPN in vitro puncture.The data showed that eus-cpn was effective in the treatment of pancreatic cancer related persistent abdominal pain up to about 70%, significantly reducing the dosage of analgesics and improving the quality of life of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.</description>
