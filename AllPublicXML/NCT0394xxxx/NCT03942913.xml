      This study is to describe the initial anti-thrombotic treatment strategy prescribed to the AF
      patient population undergoing PCI by using drug class description.

      Coordinator of project has strong expertise in cardiovascular research and especially in ACS,
      PCI and antiplatelet therapy. The group led by pr Bonello has published several articles
      (appendix 3) including the VASP studies which have been presented at major cardiologic
      congresses (late breaking trials ACC 2007, AHA 2008, TCT 2011, EuroPCR 2010) including
      physicians and biologists. The group is composed of international experts in this research
      field (Pr Bonello, Pr Cuisset, Dr Barragan, Pr Lemesle). Additionally, coordinator center has
      a strong expertise in clinical research and a methodological support will be provided by the
      Clinical Research Platform of the AP-HM (responsible: Prof. Pascal Auquier, medical referent:
      Dr Karine Baumstarck).

      The project brings together investigators that have been previously involved in many clinical
      studies in the field of ACS and PCI. In particular they have joined forces on multicenter
      trials leaded by the cardiology department of the Hôpital Universitaire Nord de Marseille
      (the VASP studies, the Early clinical trial) and they have regular meetings to share
      scientific data and research program design and advancement. There is a good capacity and
      ability of recruitment by the partner centers. The procedures to perform in this project are
      very simple and the disease is frequent. These are good criteria for the feasibility.

        The recruiting will be performed in emergency and cardiologic units by using a consecutive
        screening and enrollment strategy. Information obtained as part of routine care will be
        reviewed to determine eligibility for enrollment including 12 lead electrocardiograms and
        medical exam, cardiac biomarker and all means considered necessary for diagnosis of
        intermediate-risk and high-risk ACS. For all patients undergoing an invasive strategy and
        requiring chronic anticoagulant therapy for AF, the site will carefully review the
        inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the protocol to confirm the subject's
        eligibility.
