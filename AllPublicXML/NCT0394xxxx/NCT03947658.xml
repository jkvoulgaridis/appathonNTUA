  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Setting the restorative margins for teeth with short clinical crowns is challenging and crown
      lengthening surgery (CLS) is often necessary. The aim of this study was to assess the
      influence of prosthetic restorative treatment timing on gingival margin location of teeth
      after crown lengthening surgery.

      Eighteen patients requiring CLS were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups
      depending on the timing of prosthetic rehabilitation, at 6 or fourteen weeks after
      CLS.Clinical parameters were recorded around treated and neighboring teeth with adjacent and
      non-adjacent sites at 6 and 14 weeks after surgery as well as three and six months after
      prosthesis delivery. Alveolar ridge changes were assessed via digital X-rays.Soft tissue
      healing and the final treatment outcome were assessed by both patients and prosthodontists.

      Twenty patients selected from those referred to the Department of Periodontics for crown
      lengthening surgery were enrolled in the study (9 females, 11 males, 19-65 years old, mean
      age:45.2) Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups. For the
      first group of patients (A), prosthetic restoration started 6 weeks whereas for the second
      group (B)14 weeks after surgery. After recording of pre-surgical measurements, intrasulcular
      or internal bevel incisions were performed buccally and lingually, and full-thickness
      mucoperiosteal flaps were raised. Buccal flaps were reflected to a level beyond the
      mucogingival junction. The osseous crest and subgingival tooth structure were exposed. The
      osseous resection was performed after considering the amount of additional tooth structure
      required for restorative purpose and the preoperative Supracrestal Tissue Attachment at each
      site with hand and rotary instruments in a manner of establishing positive bone architecture.
      After root planing, suturing of the surgical sites was performed. The flap margins were
      placed at or apical to the anticipated crown margin after suturing and as far from the
      osseous crest as possible and necessary postoperative instructions were given. Patients were
      recalled 1 week post-surgery for suture removal, oral hygiene reinforcement and healing
      assessment. Healing was also evaluated at the end of the second post-operative week. All
      patients were reevaluated at 3 and 6 months after the prosthesis delivery.
