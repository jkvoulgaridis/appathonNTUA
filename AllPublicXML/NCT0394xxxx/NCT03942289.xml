  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research proposal is to provide, for the first time in humans, a wider
      understanding of the role of the noradrenergic system both in health and illness (Parkinson's
      disease) through the use of a newly developed radiotracer (11Carbon [11C]Yohimbine)
      visualizing alpha-2 (Î±2) adrenergic receptors (AR) combined with cutting-edge technology, the
      hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The
      secondary aim of this study will be to determine whether the expected age- and Parkinson's
      disease (PD)-related changes in the noradrenergic system are paralleled by changes in
      neuropsychological performances (such as cognitive, motor and/or olfactory abilities).
