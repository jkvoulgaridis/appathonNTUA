  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Port wine stain (PWS) is a congenital, progressive vascular malformation of human skin
           involving the superficial vascular plexus that occurs in estimated 3-5 children per
           1,000 live births. In childhood, PWS are flat red macules, but lesions tend to darken
           progressively to purple and, by middle age, often become raised as a result of the
           development of vascular nodules. Because most malformations occur on the face, PWS is a
           clinically significant problem in the majority of patients.

        2. The late-stage cobblestoning appearance of PWS subjects is comprised by not only
           pronounced vascular ectasia with proliferation of thin and/or thick-walled vessels and
           their stroma, but also numerous epithelial, neural and mesenchymal hamartomatous
           abnormalities. Despite these histologic observations, the specific mechanisms involved
           in PWS nodular formation remains unclear.

        3. In one nodular PWS subject, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein
           kinase B (AKT) and phosphoinositide phospholipase C g subunit (PLC-g) were activated in
           both hypertrophic areas and nodules within the lesion. These observations led us to
           hypothesize that the PI3K pathway may play an important role in nodular formation.
