  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label phase II clinical trial. Adult patients with hematological
      malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSCT from matched-related or unrelated donor are eligible
      for the study if they meet the standard criteria defined in the investigator's institutional
      standard operation procedures (SOPs), meet all inclusion criteria, and do not satisfy any
      exclusion criteria. Patients will receive reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning
      regimen of fludarabine, busulfan, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG). Patients will
      receive PTCyBor as GvHD prophylaxis.

    <description>The first day of acute GvHD of any grade will be recorded for that grade. This end point will be evaluated through day +120 post-transplant. The diagnosis of acute GvHD is based on clinical and pathological evaluation by the principal investigator in collaboration with the treating physician. Cumulative incidence curves will be provided along with 95% confidence intervals for the 120 day cumulative incidence.</description>

    <time_frame>Day +45</time_frame>
    <description>The first day of chronic GvHD will be recorded.

          -  Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included in
