      Following the serious adverse events that occurred in January 2016 during the BIA 10 2474
      First-in-Human study, the French Ministry of Health asked the Regional Health Agencies to
      inspect operations at all research sites conducting phase I/II clinical trials of
      experimental drugs.

      All 30 sites of Île-de-France region fully authorized to perform phase I/II trials will be
      inspected by a physician and a public health pharmacist. Their reported list of observations
      will be submitted to three physicians with longstanding experience of early pharmacology
      studies performed in academic or private research facilities. These physicians will be asked
      to adjudicate each observation according to their perceived medical importance regarding
      safety. Adjudications will be first performed separately and disagreements will be later
      settled during a final adjudication meeting.
