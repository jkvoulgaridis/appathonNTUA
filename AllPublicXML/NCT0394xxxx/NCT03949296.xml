      Purpose To determine whether Mindfulness-Based Treatment for Insomnia (MBTI) is more
      effective in the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder (CID) in patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) when compared with standard sleep hygiene counseling.

      Specific Aims / Hypotheses

      Our specific aims are to determine:

        -  Whether MBTI is more effective than standard sleep hygiene counseling in improving
           objectively-measured sleep quality among this group of MS patients with CID, as measured
           by the Fitbit Charge 2 activity tracker.

        -  Whether MBTI is more effective than standard sleep hygiene counseling in improving
           self-reported sleep quality among this group of MS patients with CID, as measured by the
           Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

        -  Whether MTBI is more effective than standard sleep hygiene counseling in reducing
           self-reported severity of insomnia among this group of MS patients with CID, as measured
           by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

        -  Whether MBTI is more effective than standard sleep hygiene counseling in improving
           self-reported quality of life among this group of MS patients with CID, as measured by
           the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI).

      We hypothesize that among study participants with MS and CID:

        -  MBTI will improve their objectively-measured sleep quality, as measured by the Fitbit
           Charge 2 activity tracker.

        -  MBTI will improve their self-reported sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI.

        -  MBTI will reduce their self-reported severity of insomnia, as measured by the ISI.

        -  Improvement in sleep quality and reduction in insomnia severity will result in
           improvement in self-reported quality of life, as measured by MSQLI scores.

        -  MBTI will be superior to sleep hygiene counseling in improving sleep quality, reducing
           insomnia severity, and improving quality of life.

      BACKGROUND:

      An estimated 25 to 40 percent of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from chronic
      insomnia, and the prevalence of sleep disorders is often unrecognized. Chronic insomnia
      disorder (CID) is defined as persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration,
      consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for
      sleep, leading to daytime impairment, and ongoing for at least three consecutive months.

      Common causes of CID in MS include motor disorders such as cramps, spasms, restless leg
      syndrome and periodic limb movements, neuropathic pain, bladder dysfunction (such as
      nocturia), and obstructive sleep apnea. Depression, anxiety, daytime fatigue, and cognitive
      dysfunction are also associated with sleep disorders in MS. Moreover, treatments for the
      underlying disease, such as interferon therapy, as well as treatments for various symptoms of
      MS, such as stimulant medications used to treat fatigue, may also contribute to insomnia.

      Many patients manage their insomnia using benzodiazepines and other medications, which may be
      associated with a number of adverse effects, including dependence and tolerance, cognitive
      dysfunction, and depression. Furthermore, other adverse effects of benzodiazepines arise from
      their use in combination with other drugs such as opioid narcotics for pain. Therefore, it is
      desirable to find effective nonpharmacological treatments for insomnia in patients with
      multiple sclerosis.

      Psychologically-based and behavioral treatments have been widely tested in various cohorts of
      patients with CID with and without co-morbid conditions. These methods include cognitive
      behavioral therapies (CBT), sleep hygiene programs, mindfulness meditation, and others. In a
      randomized controlled clinical trial of 72 women with CID and MS in Iran, CBT treatment was
      associated with improved sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI). A case series of 11 patients with chronic insomnia and MS who were treated with CBT
      at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center improved on measures of insomnia, fatigue and
      depression, as well as an increase in total sleep time of 1.5 hours.

      Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is an empirically-supported intervention designed
      to decrease stress, chronic and acute pain and anxiety in adults. Mindfulness is the practice
      of focusing full attention on the present moment intentionally and without judgment. The
      practice of mindfulness is hypothesized to reduce feelings of distress and stress reactivity
      by increasing one's awareness of and ability to tolerate thoughts and emotions. Mindfulness
      may help individuals decrease distress and over-reactivity to events and increase the ability
      to respond to events in ways that one consciously chooses (rather than through automatic
      'mindless&quot; behaviors). Mindfulness-based interventions such as MBSR teach mindfulness through
      meditation, yoga, present-minded awareness in everyday life, and discussions of stress
      physiology and coping.

      Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of MBSR interventions in the treatment of
      insomnia. Long-term meditators have been shown to have increased parietal-occipital gamma
      (25-40 Hz) during NREM (non-rapid eye movement sleep), showing that MBSR can induce objective
      changes in sleep architecture. MBSR and MBTI (mindfulness based treatment of insomnia) have
      been shown in randomized, controlled studies to decrease sleep latency and total waking time
      and increase sleep time.These effects, moreover, have been durable. However, a meta-analysis
      of 6 randomized controlled trials involving 330 participants showed that mindfulness
      meditation significantly improved total wake time and sleep quality, but had no significant
      effects on sleep onset latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency,
      total wake time, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), PSQI, or Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes
      Sleep Scale (DBAS).

      Mindfulness training has been shown to be beneficial in improving several symptoms of MS,
      including those that have been shown to impact sleep. A randomized, controlled study of 150
      patients undergoing mindfulness training showed improvements in quality of life and
      well-being, including fatigue and depression. Furthermore, there is Class 1 evidence that
      stress reduction in MS can affect the underlying inflammatory biology of MS, as evidenced by
      a reduction in new MRI lesions. However, many other studies showing benefits of stress
      reduction in MS are limited by their descriptive nature and non-controlled design.

      The significance of this study is that while there are data showing the effectiveness of
      mindfulness-based techniques in treating insomnia in general, and some data showing the
      benefits of using non-mindfulness stress reduction techniques in the management of MS-related
      insomnia, there have been no studies to date on the efficacy of mindfulness techniques in
      treating MS-related insomnia.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective sleep quality will be measured using a Fitbit Charge activity monitor to be worn daily during the 10-week intervention, and daily during a 4-month post-intervention period. For the purpose of assessing the impact of the intervention on objective sleep quality, the first week of Fitbit sleep data collected during the 10-week intervention (i.e., during the week of the mindfulness orientation session) will count as baseline data; the last week of the 10-week intervention will count as post-intervention data; and the last week of the 4-month post-intervention period will be used to assess the sustainability of the intervention. Data from the remaining weeks of the 10-week intervention and 4-month post-intervention periods will be used to examine whether participants experience an upward trend in sleep quality during the course of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported sleep quality will be measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline, at the end of the 10-week intervention, and at 4 months post-intervention. The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire to assess perceived sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. This 19-item instrument uses a Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 3) to assess 7 clinically derived domains of sleep: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these 7 components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;poor&quot; sleepers. A global score &gt; 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001) in distinguishing good vs. poor sleepers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported quality of life will be measured at baseline, the end of the 10-week intervention, and 4 months post-intervention using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Index (MSQLI). The MSQLI includes a set of 10 questionnaires to provide a quality of life measure that is both generic and MS-specific. The questionnaires assess health status, fatigue, pain, sexual satisfaction, bladder control, bowel control, visual impairment, perceived deficits, mental health, and social support. Each individual scale generates a separate score. There is no global composite combining all the scales into a single score. There is good internal consistency reliability for the subscales of the MSQLI, with the lowest alpha being 0.67 (for social functioning on SF-36). Other coefficients range from 0.78 (BWCS) to 0.97 (MSSS). Test-retest reliability on the SF-36 ranges from 0.60 (social functioning) to 0.81 (physical functioning).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse events, including relapse of MS, experienced by study participants will be noted at the end of the 10-week intervention, and at 4-months post-intervention. In addition, if participants report any adverse events by contacting the research staff and/or study PI at any other time points during the study, these will be noted as well. The study team will address the handling of adverse events on a case-by-case basis.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Progression of MS</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression of MS will be measured by administering the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at baseline (clinical screening), the end of the 10-week intervention, and 4 months post-intervention. The EDSS is a method of quantifying the degree of neurologic impairment in MS patients. It quantifies disability in 8 Functional Systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and &quot;other&quot;), and allows neurologists or other trained examiners to assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each FS. Each FSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6. The EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Since muscle spasticity is a frequent cause of insomnia in MS patients, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) will be used to characterize the degree of spasticity at baseline (clinical screening), the end of the 10-week intervention and 4 months post-intervention among members of our study population. The MAS is a clinician-administered measure of muscle spasticity in patients with MS or other conditions such as stroke or spinal cord injury. It involves a subjective clinical assessment, without the use of specialized equipment, of muscle resistance to passive range of motion (ROM) about a single joint, while a patient is in a supine position. It uses a nominal scale ranging from 0 (no resistance) to 4 (rigidity), with a 1+ scoring category added to indicate resistance through less than half of the movement.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Restless Leg</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Since restless leg syndrome can impact insomnia in MS patients, self-reported restless legs syndrome severity will be measured using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) at baseline, at the end of the 10-week intervention, and 4 months post-intervention to characterize the extent of this condition in our study population. The IRLS was developed by the International RLS Study Group to measure perceived severity of restless legs syndrome in the past week prior to administration. It includes 10 questions addressing respondents' perceptions of RLS-related discomfort, need to move around, relief from moving around, severity of sleep disturbance and tiredness from RLS symptoms, severity of RLS as a whole, frequency and severity of symptoms, severity of impact on daily living, and severity of mood disturbance. Response options are based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 being very severe.</description>

It is adapted from the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Curriculum developed by the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It introduces the concept of mindfulness and provides the opportunity to practice it within sessions and during home practice. Participants learn about stress, and explore habitual behavioral, physical, emotional and cognitive patterns, as well as more effective responses to challenges and demands of everyday life. Each class includes mindfulness practice, group discussions, and practices and exercises related to the class topics. Participants receive home assignments with guided meditation and yoga practices.</description>
