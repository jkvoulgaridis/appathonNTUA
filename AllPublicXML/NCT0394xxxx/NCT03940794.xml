  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate which verbal instruction will lead to the most
      efficient contraction of pelvic floor muscles (PFM) in patients with urinary incontinence.

      and to examine whether correct PFM contraction can be taught by transabdominal ultrasound,
      which is used as biofeedback.

      Pelvic floor muscle contraction will be evaluated via transabdominal ultrasound.

      A self-controlled clinical trial is planned for patients who receive physiotherapy for pelvic
      floor rehabilitation at one of the Meuhedet Institutes' physiotherapy clinics.

      Each participant will be asked to contract the pelvic floor muscles using three different
      verbal instructions: (1) &quot;contract your pelvic floor - all sphincters&quot;; (2) &quot;contract your
      anus&quot;; (3) &quot;contract your pelvic floor as if you're trying to stop urinating&quot;. Those who will
      not be able to contract will be taught by the ultrasound as biofeedback.

      The assessment of pelvic floor contraction will be measured by measuring bladder displacement
      via abdominal ultrasound. A curved linear array transducer will be placed in the transverse
      plane immediately suprapubically over the lower abdomen angled at 15-30 degrees from the
      vertical. An on-screen caliper and measurement tool will be used to measure bladder
      displacement.
