      Participants will be followed for 6 months post-study procedure. This study will be conducted
      at up to 12 clinical sites in the United States. A total of one-hundred and fifty (150)
      participants will be enrolled and randomized.

    <description>The transseptal approach entails obtaining femoral venous access, and, guided by fluoroscopy and intra-cardiac ultrasound, starting with a transseptal needle or RF device inside the dilator of a long sheath; pulling down until the fossa ovalis in the interatrial septum is engaged on both fluoroscopy and intracardiac echo imaging; once on the left side, the long sheath is advanced over the transseptal needle, the needle and dilator are removed, and the ablation catheter can then be advanced across the mitral valve into the left ventricle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Retrograde Aortic Approach Catheter Ablation Procedure</intervention_name>
    <description>The retrograde aortic approach entails obtaining femoral arterial access and leaving a sheath in the femoral artery. Under fluoroscopy, an ablation catheter is then advanced up the ascending aorta where the catheter tip is curved using an internal mechanism controlled on the handle of the catheter to form a large loop (to prevent the tip from traveling down a coronary artery and causing trauma such as a dissection); the curved loop is advanced around the aortic arch and down the ascending aorta. To cross the aortic valve with this loop, the catheter is typically torqued in various directions until it falls through the aortic valve and into the left ventricle.</description>

             contraction (PVC) catheter ablation procedure

          3. For this patient, the current plan of the operator must be to pursue a catheter
             ablation target in the left ventricular endocardium that can be accessed by either a

               2. Mechanical Mitral valve

               3. ASD or PFO closure device that would preclude a transseptal puncture

               4. Mitraclip or Alfieri mitral valve repair that would preclude a transseptal
                  puncture

          5. Planned or known need to perform either a retrograde aortic approach or transseptal
             approach (such as to target another site during the same procedure)

          6. Inability to speak, read, and write in the English language at a 6th grade level
             (required for the Neurocognitive Function Testing)

          7. Current mental impairment or other diagnosis which precludes accurate assessment of
             neurocognitive function or which may not allow patient to understand the nature,
             significance and scope of the study

          8. Inability to perform neurocognitive function testing after &gt; 24 hours free of sedating
             medications
