  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare two types of snacks (almonds or a cereal-based snack),
      eaten between meals, on measures of appetite, including appetitive hormones, self-reported
      feelings of hunger and fullness, and food intake at a buffet meal or in the home environment.
      The investigators hypothesize that the acute responses of appetitive hormones to a meal
      challenge protocol will differ between almond and cereal-based snacks based on multivariate
      models of satiety that will be predictive of ad libitum food intake at a dinner meal as part
      of the meal challenge protocol. Further, the investigators will estimate if, under
      free-living conditions, self-selected and self-reported food intake will show appropriate
      energy compensation for the added calories of the snacks, and determine if one type of snack
      is superior to the other in this regard.

      This study will use a randomized, parallel design that includes an almond snack intervention
      and a cereal-based snack intervention group. The almond intervention will be roasted,
      unsalted almonds at a level of 56 grams per day for 4 weeks. The cereal-based intervention
      will be isocaloric snacks provided in the form of a mixture of dry cereal, pretzels, and
      bread sticks for 4 weeks. A satiety test protocol will be done at the beginning and the end
      of the intervention period. Each test day will include measures of satiety responses to two
      standard meals, two snacks (either almonds or cereal-based snacks), and a dinner buffet. The
      protocol to evaluate satiety signals include tonic measures that may signal homeostasis to
      the brain and evaluation of episodic signals that may drive food intake In addition, other
      modulators of satiety will be tested including evaluation of preferences for palatable foods,
      self-reports of cravings and satiety using questionnaires, and perceived hunger, fullness,
      desire to eat.
