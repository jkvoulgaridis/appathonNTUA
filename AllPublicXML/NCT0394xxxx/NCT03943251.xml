      There have set up seven dose group(2.5、5、10、20、40、60、80mg）.The first group(2.5mg)contains 8
      health subjects(6 health subjects take experimental drugs,2 health subjects take the
      placebo). Other groups contains 10 health subjects(8 health subjects take experimental
      drugs,2 health subjects take the placebo).Within 30min before taking the medicine and after
      0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 24h, 36h, 48h,72h to take blood samples
      for pharmacokinetics(PK) detection.
