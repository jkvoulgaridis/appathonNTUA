  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the aspects related to the intake of food and nutrients, physical
      activity and sedentary behavior of Spanish children from 1 to 9 years. Furthermore, the
      investigators will know if the consumption of dairy products is associated with a better
      dietary pattern.

      Hypothesis: The habitual consumption of dairy products as part of a regular diet is
      associated with a better dietary pattern and a higher global diet quality.

      A prospective cross-sectional observational study in 1500 Spanish children (1 to 9 years) in
      urban areas &gt;50,0000 inhabitants, distributed in eight regions (according to Nielsen Spanish
      areas) aiming to evaluate the food habits, dietary patterns, and nutrient intake, as well as
      physical activity behaviors.
