      The purpose of this study is prove the need to selection of a extremely severe ulcerative
      colitis, to identify predictors of colectomy, which will reduce the optimal time for surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute severe ulcerative colitis is a life threatening disease,total mortality rate can reach
      17%, and the frequency of surgical treatment approximately 40%. Standard conservative therapy
      in these patients is often ineffective and the optimal timing of the surgical treatment has
      not yet been established.

      In the Russian clinical guidelines for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, the extremely
      severe ulcerative colitis is added to the classification of the severity.

      The extremely severe ulcerative colitis is a severe, according to the criteria of Truelove,
      Witts and the endoscopic picture of deep, extensive ulcerative defects of the mucosa, up to
      the muscular layer with the formation of mucosal islets including albumin reduction.

      Conservative treatment of patients with extremely severe ulcerative colitis worsens treatment
      outcomes only. The authors of the study want to prove that patients with a extremely severe
      ulcerative colitis need a colectomy in a short time.

      Is there a need for long-term follow-up, conservative treatment of high-risk patients? Is it
      safe to perform early surgical treatment without long-term conservative treatment? This study
      will allow to answer these questions and help doctors in the treatment of such patients
      anywhere in Russia and not only.
