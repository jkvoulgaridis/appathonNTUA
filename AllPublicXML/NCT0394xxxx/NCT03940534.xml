  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel device, TAD, has been developed to aid adherence to prescribed regimens and may have
      a roll in hospice pain management. This study aims to assess medication adherence relating to
      missed doses or improperly timed doses with and without the aid of a mobile device as a
      primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints will be patient, nursing, and provider satisfaction.

      This study is a randomized crossover study in which patients will be randomized to start with
      or without a mobile device assisting the patient or caregiver in using the device. The
      investigators aim to enroll 20 patients across 3 sites. Each patient is expected to
      participate in the study for 12 weeks. After the first 2 weeks of participation, the patient
      will either begin using the mobile device to assist or will stop using the mobile device for
      the next 2 weeks. after the initial 4 weeks, the patient will choose to continue with or
      without using the mobile device.

    <description>The patient's satisfaction will be measured on a scale of 1 to 5 (from 1 being extremely dissatisfied to 5 being extremely satisfied). Satisfaction will be assessed with the follow questions:
Using the mail order pharmacy to receive your pain medication?
Ease of using the TAD device to dispense your pain medication?
Ease of using the mobile device application with the TAD device? (ONLY when using the mobile application)
The ability of the device to provide you the dose of pain medication at the correct time?
The overall experience of using the TAD device?</description>

Your patient's ability to use the TAD device to dispense their pain medication?
Your patient's ability to use the mobile device application with the TAD device? (ONLY when using the mobile application)
The ability of the device to increase compliance of the pain medication?
