  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basal measurements are taken in relation to the study variables. Immediately subjects perform
      eccentric exercise on right hamstrings to develop delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).

      Measurements of the study variables are taken in the same conditions 48, 96 and 168 hours
      after the exercise to study the evolution of the variables while recovering from DOMS.

      Basal measurements are taken in relation to the study variables.

      The variables are:

        -  pressure pain thresholds

        -  electromyography values

        -  static and dynamic plantar pressure measurement

        -  active knee extensibility

        -  maximal strength of knee flexors

        -  thermography

        -  scales of pain perception

      Immediately subjects perform eccentric exercise on right hamstrings to develop DOMS (delay
      onset muscle soreness).

      Measurements of the study variables are taken in the same conditions 48, 96 and 168 hours
      after the exercise to study the evolution of the variables while recovering from DOMS.

    <measure>Changes in Pressure Pain Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 hours, 96 hours, 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pressure pain thresholds (PPT) will be determined with pressure algometry bilaterally over the leg and shoulder. PPT is defined as the exact time point where the pressure is first being perceived at painful.</description>

    <measure>Changes in subjective perception of pain and impairment: Two questionnaire (Modified 7-item Likert Scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours, 96 hours, 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Two questionnaires (Modified 7-item Likert Scales) are filled up by the subject to show subjective perception of pain related to movement along the recovery period.
Scale of pain intensity, from 0 (no pain) to 6 (higher pain intensity). Scale of functional impairment, from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (higher impairment).</description>
