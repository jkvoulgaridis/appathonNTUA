  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of ibuprofen or nifedipine on post-seizure hypoperfusion
      and neurological deficits in patients with epilepsy. One group will receive ibuprofen,
      another will receive nifedipine, and anther placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immediately following seizures, brain blood flow is significantly reduced for approximately
      one hour and is located to the brain area where the seizure originated. This may contribute
      to symptoms that patients experience immediately following seizures and in between seizures.

      Animal studies have shown that that giving anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen) and
      blood pressure medications (e.g., nifedipine) prevents the hypoperfusion and behavioural
      impairments seen in animals immediately following seizures. Thus, two classes of inexpensive
      and well-tolerated drugs - already in clinical use - have been identified that can be tested
      in humans to prevent the serious consequences that follow seizures.

      The investigators will study 90 subjects admitted to hospital for epilepsy investigations.
      The investigators will randomly divide the patients into three treatment groups (30 patients
      each). Patients will receive either placebo, ibuprofen, or nifedipine while in hospital. The
      effect of each of these treatments on the severity of hypoperfusion and neurological deficits
      that follows seizures will then be assessed.

    <description>For all Cognition Domain tests, three standardized scores are provided:
An uncorrected score comparing the test-taker to all individuals in the NIH Toolbox normative sample (mean = 100, SD = 15);
An age-corrected score that compares the test-taker to NIH Toolbox age-matched individuals (mean = 100, standard deviation = 15); and
A fully-corrected T-score that adjusts for key demographic variables including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10).

    <measure>Psychological well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>5 - 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Psychological Well-Being measure assesses a subjective and experiential aspect of pleasure and positive affect, as well as fulfillment and purpose. Psychological Well-being composite scores are generated as the weighted average of the uncorrected standardized score (T scores; mean = 50, SD = 10) obtained from each subdomain:
Positive Affect Construct = This portion assesses positive affect, or feelings of a pleasurable engagement with the environment, using a positive affect survey.
Higher scores = more positive affect.
Life Satisfaction Construct = This portion assesses how the participant evaluates their life, in terms of whether they like it or not, using a life satisfaction survey.
Higher scores = greater life satisfaction.
Meaning and Purpose Construct = This portion evaluates the degree to which the participant feels their life matters or makes sense.
Higher scores = greater sense of meaning and purpose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Relationships</measure>
    <time_frame>5 - 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Relationships measure assesses the participants social network structure, extent, and quality. Composite social satisfaction composite scores are generated as the weighted average of the T-scores (mean = 50, SD = 10) from the subdomains, with loneliness and perceived rejection reverse-coded.
Perceived Social Support Construct = This portion evaluates the degree to which the participant feels their life matters or makes sense.
Higher scores = greater sense of meaning and purpose.
Companionship Construct = This portion assesses self-reported perceptions of the participant has companions to interact with and perceptions of being alone or lonely.
Higher scores = higher perceived friendship or more loneliness.
Social Distress Construct = This portion evaluates the degree to which the participant feels their life matters or makes sense.
Higher scores = greater perceived hostility and rejection.</description>

Stress and self-efficacy composite scores are generated as the weighted average of the T-scores (mean = 50, SD = 10) from the subdomains
Perceived Stress Construct = This portion evaluates the participants perceived stress. Higher scores = greater perceived stress.
Self-Efficacy Construct = This portion assesses self-efficacy, or the participants belief in their capacity to manage and have control over events.
Higher scores = more general self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>5 - 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>composite scores are generated as the weighted average of the T-scores from the subdomains. Negative affect includes the following subdomains:
Anger Construct = This portion assesses attitudes of hostility and cynicism. Higher scores = higher levels of anger.
Fear Construct = This portion assesses the participants perception of threat and autonomic arousal associated with fear.
Higher scores = higher levels of fear.
Sadness Construct = This portion assesses the participants feelings of sadness, or their low levels of positive affect or low mood.
Higher scores = more sadness.</description>
