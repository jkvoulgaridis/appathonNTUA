  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on in-center hemodialysis (HD)
      require several hours to recover from fatigue after an HD session. Evidence for practical
      interventions to improve this recovery time from conventional in-center HD is lacking. This
      study investigates the effects of reducing HD blood flow rates on patients' self-reported
      post-dialysis fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-dialysis fatigue reduces patients' quality of life and is also associated with
      cardiovascular events and mortality. Dialysis recovery time (DRT) is a measure of
      post-dialysis fatigue. Internationally, it has been found that more than a quarter of
      maintenance HD patients report &gt;6 hours of DRT. The interventions showing the most
      improvement in DRT involve increases in treatment time, suggesting that post-dialysis fatigue
      may be in part related to the rate of solute clearance. Solute clearance rate is just one
      part of extending dialysis time, and its effect on DRT in patients undergoing typical-length
      dialysis sessions is not known. There is scant evidence to guide blood flow rate
      prescriptions aside from meeting clearance targets. Blood flow rate reductions are
      easily-implementable interventions that would slow solute clearance rates and may have an
      effect on post-dialysis fatigue.
