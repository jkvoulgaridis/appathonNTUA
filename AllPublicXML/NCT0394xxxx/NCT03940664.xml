      The aims of this study were

        -  to analyze CD160 expression in both normal and pathological eyes from human adults

        -  to evaluate association between CD160 presence on endothelial cells from blood vessels
           and retinal vascular disease

      Anti-angiogenic agents stand first in the treatment of neovascular diseases of the retina.
      Intravitreal injections of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) agents have emerged
      over the past decade as the first line of treatment in some neovascular diseases of the
      retina. Nevertheless, anti-VEGF therapies suffer some limitations, among which a short time
      to recurrence (1 week to 3 months) of retinal neovascularization and an eroding biological
      effect after prolonged use and.

      CD160 appeared in several experimental studies as a marker of activated endothelial cells,
      suggesting it could represent a promising target for novel anti-angiogenic.

    <description>Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded blocks were used for immunohistochemistry using CD160.
The immunolabelling was evaluated independently by 2 observers (CBR, AH) blinded to clinical data. The staining intensity (0: absent, 1: faint, 2: moderate, 3: strong) was assessed for CD160 immunolabelling.</description>
