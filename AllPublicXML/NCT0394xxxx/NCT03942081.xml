  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All study procedures will occur during one appointment. The research team will measure the
      size of the foot ulcer and multiple photos will be taken with a smart phone camera and
      thermal camera. Demographic information will be obtained from the medical record.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research procedures consist of a) a research assistant measuring the size of the foot
      ulcer, b) patients having pictures of their feet taken with a smart phone under 4 conditions-
      1) photos taken by researchers, 2) photos taken by the patient by hand, 3) photos taken by
      the patient with a selfie stick, and 4) photos taken by a 3rd party (e.g., friend/family
      member of patient). If the patient is not able to take photographs under any of the
      conditions, that condition will be excluded. In addition to photos being taken with a smart
      phone, additional photos will be taken with a thermal camera by the research team to
      determine if there is a difference in ulcer size depending on type of camera used. It is
      anticipated that procedures will last between 15 and 45 minutes. There is no long-term
      follow-up. If a patient returns to the clinic they will be asked if they wish to complete all
      study procedures again. Once the patient has left the clinic, the research team will check
      the medical record for: age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, co-morbidities, and zip code (to
      determine if patient lives in an urban or rural location).
