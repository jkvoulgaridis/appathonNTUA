      This is a prospective observational study. Eligible women undergo ART treatment in our centre
      will be recruited for the study and each woman will only be included in the study once.
      Informed written consent will be obtained. Blood serum for hCG level is performed 14 days
      after the embryo transfer i.e. week 4. If the serum hCG level is &gt;10IU/L, the women are
      considered pregnant and blood will be saved and checked for kisspeptin level, Another blood
      test is repeated 1 week later i.e. week 5. A transvaginal ultrasound and blood test will be
      performed 1 week later i.e. week 6 to confirm the fetal viability and the number of
      gestational sacs and locate the pregnancy.

      Blood for hCG and kisspeptin levels are checked at weeks, 4, 5 and 6. Ultrasound will be
      performed at gestational 8 weeks and 11 weeks. They will be referred for antenatal care when
      the pregnancy is confirmed on-going at 11 weeks.

      The purpose is to determine whether serum kisspeptin level in women who conceive in IVF is
      associated with an increased risk in first trimester miscarriage and compare with serum hCG
      level in the prediction of the first trimester miscarriage.
