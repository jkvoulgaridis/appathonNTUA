  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, open, two-cycle crossover, clopidogrel control,
      multiple dosing study. The aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic behavior
      of different metabolites of CYP2C19 in healthy subjects. The study enrolled 48 patients,
      divided into three groups of CYP2C19 fast metabolite, middle metabolite, and slow metabolism,
      16 cases in each group. All groups of subjects were administered for 7 days in the first
      cycle, once a day (loading dose on the first day, maintenance dose on other days), and
      entering the 14-day washout period after the end of the first cycle. The second cycle was
      entered, and the second cycle was administered for 7 days, once a day (the first day was
      given a loading dose, and the other days were given a maintenance dose). Blood was collected
      before and after administration of D1, D7, D22, and D28, and PK/PD was measured.
