  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC) ,a kind of Hepatocellular carcinoma, is the sixth most
      common cancer and thesecond leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world.Currently,
      Surgical resection is still the main treatment methods of early the ICC, but that is high
      recurrent . Levamisole Hcl is a broad spectrum of intestinal worm medicine, our previous
      study have found levamisole could significantly promote the apoptosis of bile duct cancer
      cells, restrain the progress of the bile duct carcinoma in clinic and prolong survival
      time.This drug is applicable to a variety of reasons caused by intrahepatic bile duct
      carcinoma and extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma,so we carry out the study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Levamisole Hcl in the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.
