  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of this study is the methodological development and optimisation of sodium MRI
      (23Na-MRI) protocols for breast cancer imaging. The study further proposes to utilise
      biomarkers obtained from 23Na-imaging (cell integrity), FDG-PET (metabolism),
      multi-parametric MRI (perfusion, vascularity, cellularity, morphology) to generate parameter
      maps specific for physiological processes in breast cancer.

      This is a prospective, non-randomised, exploratory study on ≤20 healthy female volunteers
      (&gt;18 years), and ≤45 female patients (&gt;18 years) diagnosed with primary breast cancer.
      Healthy volunteers (n≤20) will be scheduled to undergo an 23Na-MR examination. Patients
      scheduled for primary surgery (n≤30) will undergo a single MR examination, involving
      23Na-imaging prior to their planned surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis will be performed
      on surgical tissue specimens to determine tissue markers of interest for correlation with the
      imaging findings. Patients undergoing neo-adjuvant therapy (n≤15) will undertake up to two
      (2) combined PET/MR examinations with FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) and 23Na-MRI.
      Patient imaging will occur at two time points prior to their planned surgery: (i) baseline
      (prior to initiation of treatment) and (ii) mid-treatment (after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy).
      Histopathological analysis will be performed on pre-treatment biopsies for histological
      markers of interest for correlation with the imaging findings.

      Histopathological analysis will be performed on diagnostic biopsies and tumour specimens from
      participating breast cancer patients. Immunohistochemical staining will be performed on
      histological samples to assess tumour vascularity, metabolism, and other markers of interest
      for correlation with imaging findings.
