  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The declination on cognitive and motor functions in older adults increases the difficulty to
      achieve successful aging. Previous studies had reported that contrast to the traditional
      cognitive training methods, computer cognitive training (CCT) is comparable or has better
      effect on the cognitive function improvement with elders.On the other hand, some researchers
      claimed motor-cognitive dual-task training may possess greater effects than single cognitive
      training on cognitive functions. However, it is still on debate. Therefore, the research aims
      to investigate cognitive and motor benefits to healthy older adults over 65s trained by our
      computer-based cognitive game with high and low level of motor engagements.The research
      questions include: (1) Is CCT beneficial of cognitive functions? (2) Does CCT with high level
      of motor engagements (i.e. motor-cognitive dual-task training) have greater effects than
      single cognitive training on cognitive functions? (3) Can the training effect remain?

      Quasi-experimental design was adapted in our research.There are four time-series assessments
      during the experiment: baseline, pretest, posttest, and follow-up. After the baseline
      assessment, participants were randomized to two groups: gross-motor group (GMG) and
      fine-motor group (FMG). The intervals between baseline and pretest as well as between pretest
      and posttest were both 4 weeks, while the interval between posttest and follow-up was 8
      weeks.

      The investigators developed a computer-based cognitive game and compared the efficacy of
      cognitive and motor functions between computer-based cognitive game combining two different
      demands on motor control. Investigators hypothesized: All participants who take part in the
      computer-based cognitive game training don't have learning effects on pretest and are able to
      improve cognitive functions including short-term memory, divided attention and inhibitory
      function after intervention; Gross-motor group make more progress than fine-motor group on
      cognitive and motor functions after intervention. Furthermore, gross-motor group maintained
      more training effect over cognitive and motor functions at follow-up than fine-motor group.

    <description>The participants of GMG received motor-cognitive dual-task training. The sensors used by the participants were four different colored buttons. The participants wear a suit with two buttons on the shoulders and the other two fasten on the knees by velcros. To accomplish the tasks, the participants had to slap the correct colored buttons. The stretching of upper or lower limbs was demanding while slapping, so the participants of GMG received a training which required cognitive and motor functions at the same time.
The participants attended 2 sessions per week and lasted for 4 weeks. Each session lasted 75 minutes, mainly including 30 minutes for game introduction and warm-up, 30 minutes for game training, and 15 minutes for rest during the training. Each task lasted 10 minutes, and each session contained 3 tasks. The game difficulty could be adjusted automatically according to the performance of participants.</description>

    <description>First task was short-term memory training. Participants were instructed to memorize different colored circles with ordinal numbers which would disappear later. They triggered correct colored sensor in sequence according to their memory.
Second task was divided attention training. Different colored circles with ordinal numbers would not disappear this time.The participants should trigger correct colored sensor according to their sequence.
Third task was inhibitory function training. There were red and green lights, just like the traffic light, hung up at the upper left of the scene. Red light represented prohibition of triggering the colored sensor, while green light urged to trigger it. Yellow, red, blue and green circles showed up randomly and moved toward the beige region. When the circle came extremely closer to the beige region, the traffic light was randomized to lighten up red or green.The participants should judge and trigger the correct colored sensor.</description>
