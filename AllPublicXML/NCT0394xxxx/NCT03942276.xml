  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare different exercise training protocols on health parameters of
      postmenopausal women. The hypothesis is that short duration high intensity interval training
      will promote different effects of long duration moderate intensity training.

    <textblock>
      Exercise load control still not a consensus as to the most effective strategy for improving
      health parameters in postmenopausal women. In this way, the volunteers will perform
      anthropometric and body composition assessments, climacteric symptoms and sleep quality
      evaluations, blood pressure reactivity, resting blood pressure and heart rate and
      ambulatorial blood pressure monitoring, before and after 12 weeks of training.

    <measure>Changes in Ambulatorial Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and within 72 hours after 12 weeks of exercise training/control</time_frame>
    <description>All volunteers were submitted to a 24-hour Blood Pressure (BP) assessment by Ambulatorial Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) before and after 10 weeks of combined exercise training, with a minimum of 48 hours after the last training session. A device was used associated with a diary of examination to self-report of activities of daily living (sleep, work, food) or any event that could interfere abnormally with BP or device measurements. The device was always placed 7am and the measurements were made every 15 minutes from 7h to 23h and every 30 minutes from 23h to 7h. The monitoring was considered valid when it happened for a period of 24 hours. The following results were evaluated: systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure in awake, sleep and 24-hour periods, and shall be expressed in mmHg.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Resting Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and within 72 hours after 12 weeks of exercise training/control</time_frame>
    <description>Before the use ABPM during daily activities, resting blood pressure were measured using the same equipment after 15 min of rest in siting position. The following results were evaluated: systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure, they shall be expressed in mmHg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and within 72 hours after 12 weeks of exercise training/control</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate (HR) was recorded using a heart rate monitor in a beat-by-beat basis. HR was registered in a seat position for 20 min of rest. Prior to the HR Variability (HRV) analysis, the RR intervals (RRi) were visually inspected and filtered using a moving average filter. The HRV was analyzed in both time-, frequency- and nonlinear-domain. Being that for frequency-domain analysis, firstly the RRi series were interpolated at 4 Hz and then the signal linear trend component removal was performed using the smooth priors approach.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Ambulatorial Blood Pressure Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and within 72 hours after 12 weeks of exercise training/control</time_frame>
    <description>Based on Ambulatorial Blood Pressure data, were calculated Blood Pressure Variability by: 24-hour standard deviation weighted by the time interval between consecutive readings; the mean diurnal and nocturnal deviations weighted for the duration of the daytime and nighttime interval; the average real variability weighted for the time interval between consecutive readings; the ambulatory arterial stiffness index calculated by the slope of the trend curve of the dispersion of pressure data; the morning surge that represents the dynamic daytime variation in morning pressure that tends to increase, being assessed from the point of least pressure during sleep in relation to the first two hours after waking; and nocturnal dipping, that represents the average percentage drop of sleep pressure in relation to wakefulness, and individuals with falls of 10% or more are considered dippers and below that are considered nom-dippers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Blood pressure reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and within 72 hours after 12 weeks of exercise training/control</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate blood pressure reactivity under mental stress, it will be used the 3 minutes Stroop protocol of words and colors. The test consists of a video on a computer screen facing the volunteer that changes the image every 2 seconds. The volunteer should then speak as quickly as possible the color of the letters present on the screen, being that in each image there is dissonance between the background color, the color of the letters and the word formed (which is always the name of another color ). At the end of the test, the volunteer demonstrates on a scale her difficulty in the test, according to the following classification: 0 = not stressful; 1 = slightly stressful; 3 = very stressful; and 4 = extremely stressful. Each minute of the test the blood pressure will be measured by auscultatory method, with stethoscope and mercury column, and the following results were evaluated: systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.</description>
