        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, medical
             history, and vital signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the
             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be
             not clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population
             under study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents
             and initialed by the investigator

          -  Must not use nicotine-containing substances including tobacco products for at least 3
             months prior to screening and during the study

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) at screening and a negative urine
             pregnancy test at Day -1 of the first treatment period

          -  Body mass index (weight kilogram [kg]/height^2 meter [m]^2) between 18.0 and 30.0
             kg/m^2 (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50.0 kg

          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140
             millimeters of Mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg
             diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are
             permitted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiac arrhythmias (example [e.g.], tachycardia at rest), history of risk
             factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (e.g., hypokalemia, family history of long QT
             Syndrome) at screening

          -  Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  Any current, or history of, clinically significant skin disease at screening requiring
             intermittent or chronic treatment (at the investigator's discretion) such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, and urticaria

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-56136379 or itraconazole or
             its excipients at screening

          -  History of clinically significant drug allergy at screening such as, but not limited
             to, sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy witnessed in previous studies with
             experimental drugs
