  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the BPZE1 live attenuated pertussis
      vaccine, intended to prevent nasopharyngeal colonization and pertussis disease, and compares
      a single (prime) BPZE1 dose or 2-dose (prime + boost) to a single (prime) Boostrix or BPZE1
      prime + Boostrix boost. This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observer
      blinded trial in healthy adults with a 6 month safety follow-up after the last vaccination.

         25. Toxicity grading &gt;1 for screening laboratory test results for kidney, hepatic, and
             hematologic values (may be repeated once during the screening period to allow for
             inclusion and the most recent measurement taken at baseline). See Table 13 2 for
             specifically designated parameters.

         26. Body mass index &lt;17 kg/m2 or &gt;40 kg/m2.

         27. Frequent contact with children less than 1 year of age (parent, childcare worker,
             nurse, etc.) or residence in the same household as persons with known immunodeficiency
             including persons on immunosuppressant therapy.

         28. Study team member or first-degree relative of study team member.
