  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to assess the impact of treatment with dietary supplement containing
      Saccharomyces boulardii (used as an addition to standard therapy), on quality of life of
      patients with mild forms of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, as well as those in
      remission fulfilling criteria for irritable bowel syndrome.

      Patients included will be randomly assigned in two groups and subsequently administered with
      formulation containing Saccharomyces boulardii or placebo for 4 weeks. Patient's quality of
      life will be assessed by questionnaire at the enrolment and 4 weeks after initiating the
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Saccharomyces boulardii has been reported to have positive impact on intestinal epithelial
      barrier as well as immune system. It has been proven to be efficient in treatment and
      prophylaxis of travellers diarrhoea, HIV associated diarrhoea, antibiotics associated
      diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection. However there is a limited data available on
      effect of therapy with Saccharomyces boulardii (as add-on to standard therapy) in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease. Nevertheless, knowing the effect Saccharomyces boulardii has
      on intestinal flora, intestinal epithelium and immune system it can be hypothesised that
      Saccharomyces boulardii used as add-on to standard therapy in IBD patients can lead to
      improvement in symptoms and therefore in quality of life.

    <description>Quality of life measured will be measured by questionnaire at day 1, 4 weeks after enrolment and 8 weeks after enrolment.
Questionnaire comprises 10 questions considering presence of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease as well as their effect on well-being. Each question can be answered with one of seven answers contributing 1 to 7 points to final score. Final score ranges between 10 and 70 with higher values corresponding with higher quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Disease clinical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease clinical activity will be measured by Mayo score for ulcerative colitis and Harvey-Bardshaw index for Crohn disease at day 1, 4 weeks after enrolment and 8 weeks after enrollment. The Mayo Score evaluates ulcerative colitis activity based on four clinical parameters. Each parameter of the Mayo score ranges from zero (normal or inactive disease) to 3 (severe activity). The Harvey-Bradshaw index for assessing clinical activity in patients with Crohn disease consists of 5 clinical parameters. Calculation formula for both scores considered the sum of the scores of all the parameters included. Higher values of the score are associated with increased clinical activity of the disease.</description>
