      This research study involves Niraparib as a possible treatment for triple negative breast
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks DNA (the genetic material
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer
      cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage from occurring.

      This trial is studying people who have triple negative breast cancer because this cancer type
      is shown to have DNA repair mechanisms that may benefit from combined PARP inhibitor and
      radiation, and may help prevent recurrence of cancers in the chest wall and lymph nodes of
      the affected side.
