  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhotic in intensive care unit have a very specific haemodynamic status. Cardiovascular
      abnormalities in advanced liver cirrhosis are characterized by a hyperdynamic circulation
      featuring increased heart rate and high cardiac output, concomitant with decreased systemic
      vascular resistance. As liver cirrhosis progresses, cardiac dysfunction, known as cirrhotic
      cardiomyopathy, is associated with prognosis of these patients.

      Specifically, diastolic dysfunction has been more emphasized for estimating clinical outcome
      in cirrhotic patients, whereas systolic dysfunction has limited prognostic implications in
      hepatorenal syndrome patients.

      However, in most cirrhotic patients, cardiac dysfunction is latent and only manifests under
      stressful conditions because reduced ventricular contractility in these patients is masked by
      pronounced arterial vasodilation and increased arterial compliance. Therefore, a
      load-dependent index such as left ventricular ejection fraction is insensitive to detect
      systolic cardiac impairment in the resting state in cirrhotic patients. Hence, a more
      appropriate index is required to evaluate the integration of the ventricular and arterial
      systems in cirrhotic cardiovascular disorders.

      Interaction between the left ventricle and the arterial system has been explained on the
      basis of end-systolic pressure-volume relation. Left ventricular end-systolic elastance
      (Ees), as quantified by the ratio of end-systolic pressure to end-systolic volume, is an
      index of the load-independent ventricular contractile state. Given this pressure-volume
      relationship, effective arterial elastance (Ea) can be calculated by the ratio of
      end-systolic pressure to stroke volume, indicating a net measure of arterial load. The ratio
      of these values (Ea/Ees), designated ventriculo-arterial coupling (VAC), represents the
      integrated interaction of the ventricular and arterial systems.

      We can evaluate it with non-invasive echocardiographic method.

      We analyse VAC among cirrhotic patients admitted in intensive care unit, with non-invasive
      echographic method thanks to records made from August 2018 to April 2019.

      Hypothesis: VAC decrease from the baseline value when mean arterial pressure is improved.
