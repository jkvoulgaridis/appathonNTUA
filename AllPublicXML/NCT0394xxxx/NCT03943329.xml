  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, case - control trial looking at the use of a previously FDA
      approved device made by Stryker, a distal targeting system that eases the distal targeting of
      screws in cephalomedullary nails in hip and femoral shaft fractures. Patients who consent to
      participate in the study will either be in the control or device arm of the study depending
      on their surgeon.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgeries conducted by Dr. Konda or Dr. Leucht will be done using the device technique,
      surgeries completed by Dr. Egol or Dr. Tejwani will be done without the device, &quot;free hand&quot;
      technique. Each arm of the study will contain 29 patients. Patients who consent to
      participation will be enrolled in the study and placed in the correct arm based on who their
      surgeon is. Demographic and injury data will be collected. Intra-operatively, control
      patients will receive the SOC procedure. Device arm patients will have the distal targeting
      device used in their procedure, but the implant, will not be different than SOC.
