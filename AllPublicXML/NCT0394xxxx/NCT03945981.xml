  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces morbidity and mortality for
      individuals infected with HIV. Suppressing viral replication with ART also reduces the
      potential for transmission of HIV. Hence, ART is recommended for all persons with HIV viremia
      regardless of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count. This is an open-label single arm
      which will evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety using a fixed dose combination (FDC)
      of Dolutegravir (DTG) plus Lamivudine (3TC) as a first line regimen of a rapid Test and Treat
      model of care over 48 weeks. Participants with new and confirmed diagnosed HIV-1 who are
      willing to start study treatment immediately following diagnosis will receive 50 milligram
      (mg) DTG + 300 (mg) 3TC FDC as first line therapy without waiting for screening laboratory
      results, at the Screening/Day 1 Visit. The total duration for the study will be 52 weeks and
      4 weeks of follow up period if required. This study will be conducted in United States (US)
      with approximately 120 participants.
