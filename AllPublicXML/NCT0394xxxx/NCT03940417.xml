  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators prospectively collected the clinical data of Da Vinci robot-assisted
      radical gastrectomy patients conducted by the same group of physicians from October 2017 to
      October 2018. The learning curve of the surgery was analyzed with the moving average method
      and the cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM). The short-term efficacy was then validated by
      comparing the perioperative and pathologic outcomes of patients in the two stages of the
      learning curve.
