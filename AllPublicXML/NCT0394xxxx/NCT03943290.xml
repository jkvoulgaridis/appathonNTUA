  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 extension study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of ACE-083 in subjects with FSHD previously enrolled in
      Study A083-02 and subjects with CMT1 and CMTX previously enrolled in Study A083-03. This
      study will be conducted in two Parts: Part 1, which is a loading phase of 6 months' duration,
      and Part 2, the maintenance phase, which will last up to 24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (6-month, non-randomized, open-label, loading phase for subjects from A083-02 Part 1
      and A083-03 Part 1) Part 1 will consist of 3 cohorts of up to 18 subjects each. Subjects
      enrolled in Cohorts 1a and 1b will have completed Part 1 of Study A083-02; subjects enrolled
      in Cohort 1c will have completed Part 1 of Study A083-03. In this loading phase, 240
      mg/muscle ACE-083 will be administered bilaterally every 4 weeks (q4w) for 6 doses (6 months)
      into either the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle or the biceps brachii (BB) muscle, depending on
      the muscle injected in the previous study; subjects may not switch muscle cohort upon
      enrollment in this study. Subjects will participate in a screening period of up to 4 weeks
      before receiving the first dose of ACE-083.

      Part 2 (24-month, randomized, open-label rollover maintenance phase for subjects from A083-02
      Part 2, A083-03 Part 2, and A083-04 Part 1) Subjects who complete Part 1 of this study (the
      loading phase), Part 2 of A083-02, or Part 2 of A083-03 will enroll directly into the Part 2
      open-label maintenance phase of treatment with ACE-083 and will consist of 6 cohorts of up to
      23 FSHD or 29 CMT subjects each. These subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive ACE-083,
      240 mg/muscle bilaterally, either q4w or q8w. Thus, subjects enrolled in Cohorts 2a, 2b, and
      2c will be FSHD TA, FSHD BB, and CMT TA treated q4w, and subjects enrolled in Cohorts 3a, 3b,
      and 3c will be FSHD TA, FSHD BB, and CMT TA treated q8w.

      Study duration for a subject initially enrolled in Part 1 and then extended to Part 2 will be
      approximately 33 months, including a 1-month screening period, 6-month Part 1 loading phase,
      24-month Part 2 maintenance phase, and 2-month follow-up period.

      For subjects who enrolled directly into Part 2 of this study from Part 2 of Studies A083-02
      and A083-03, the duration of the study will be approximately 26 months, including a 24-month
      maintenance phase and a 2-month follow-up period.

             anticoagulation/platelet modifying therapies up to 2 weeks prior to Study Day 1 and
             for duration of study; single agent low dose aspirin [≤ 100 mg daily] is permitted)

             is permitted

         12. Any change in medications potentially affecting muscle strength or function within 4

             beta-adrenergic agonists)

         13. Previous exposure to any other investigational agent (not including ACE-083)

             prior to Study Day 1 if half-life is unknown)

         14. Significant change in physical activity or exercise (e.g., significant increase or
             decrease in intensity or frequency) within 8 weeks before Study Day 1 or inability to
             maintain the baseline level of physical activity throughout the study

         15. Any condition that would prevent MRI scanning or compromise the ability to obtain a
             clear and interpretable scan of the treated muscles (e.g., knee/hip replacement
             metallic implants)

         16. Known active substance abuse, including alcohol
