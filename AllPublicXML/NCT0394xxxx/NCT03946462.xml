  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to
      investigate whether supplemental Nitric Oxide (NO) gas delivered during cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) reduces the incidence and impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) in
      neonates undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD), when compared to placebo gas

      Screening: All patients undergoing either elective or emergency cardiac surgery will be
      screened against the eligibility criteria.

      Research Sample Collection: Blood and urine will be collected for the first 48 hours
      admission and analyzed. The specific time points for these parameters will be: 2 hours, 6
      hours, 12 hours 24 hours, and 48 hours post admission. Blood and urine parameters will also
      be collected as a baseline pre-operative. Patient outcomes will be captured for 30 days post
      operatively.

      Research Data Collection: Baseline information will be collected. Other research related
      variables collected during the surgical intervention and bypass. Additional information will
      be collected 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after admission as well as
      outcomes 30 days after the procedure.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to the NO or control group in a 1:1 ratio.

      This study is investigating a possible protective role for NO gas administration during
      bypass on the subsequent development of AKI. NO is typically delivered via large, stand-alone
      cylinders that are placed at the bedside (or adjacent to the patient) and is set up by
      respiratory therapists. In this research study, the study gas (NO or placebo) will be
      delivered directly into the bypass circuit at a constant gas flow. The placebo gas in this
      study will be 21% (or atmospheric) oxygen, and will appear to all members of the clinical and
      research teams (with the exception of the respiratory therapist responsible for setting it
      up) indistinguishable from NO, rendering this a double-blind study for the patient (or
      caregiver) and the investigators. This minimizes any possibility of bias in the study.
