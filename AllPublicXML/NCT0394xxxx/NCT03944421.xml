  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of substituting red and processed meat in the diet with
      Quorn; a meat replacement product, on biomarkers of gut health. This will be a crossover
      design where participants will take part in 2 study periods where they will consume a diet
      containing red and processed meat during one of the study periods, whereas in the other study
      period, they will consume a diet containing Quorn.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong association between a diet which is high in red and processed meat, while
      low in fibre, and the incidence of colorectal cancer. This study aims to evaluate the effects
      of replacing red and processed meat in the diet with an alternative meat product such as
      Quorn, on biomarkers of gut health that may be associated with colorectal cancer.

      Quorn is a product which has a considerable fibre component; thus, the replacement of red and
      processed meat with Quorn, will not only reduce the amount of compounds implicated to have
      deleterious effects in the gastrointestinal tract (E.G. haem, nitroso compounds, heterocyclic
      amines), but will also increase the delivery of fibre into the gastrointestinal system, that
      may well have an overall positive impact on gut health.

      In this study, the participants will consume 240 grams (raw weight) of either red and
      processed meat, or Quorn each day for a 2 week period, this will be followed by a 4 week
      period where they will return to their usual dietary habits; before swapping to consume the
      alternative food (red/processed meat or Quorn) for another 2 week period.
