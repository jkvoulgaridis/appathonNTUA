  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some severe ocular burns or other rare ocular pathologies can be associated with a total loss
      of corneal epithelial stem cells (i.e. Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency - LSCD), which leads to
      cornea invasion by the conjunctiva and a subsequent opacification. When LSCD is total and
      bilateral, both eyes are affected leading to full blindness and a poor quality of life, with
      a paradoxical photophobia that may be painful. Fewer than 100 patients bear this rare
      condition in France.

      When patients suffer from total and bilateral LSCD, no treatment has been proven to provide
      clinical benefits: contralateral limbus is unavailable for autologous limbus graft or
      autologous limbal stem cells culture; allogeneic limbus graft requires immunosuppressive
      treatment leading to too important serious adverse effects compared to the expected benefit,
      and does not last long (&lt; 2 years); and allogenic cornea transplantation is impossible since
      always rejected due to neovascularization.

      A new way to treat these patients is to cultivate autologous corneal-like epithelium, and to
      graft it in order to restore transparency and to allow, if needed, a complementary corneal
      graft. Such an epithelium can be produced from autologous jugal mucosa cells. Epithelial
      jugal mucosa sheets transplantation has been assessed in a phase I/II clinical trial on 26
      patients which showed that it is well-tolerated and effective but the culture technology used
      in this clinical trial is no longer available. A new enzymatic detachment process has been
      developed by the Hospices Civils de Lyon. Proof of concept was obtained from both in vitro
      and ex vivo studies: detachment with Collagenase at 0.5 mg/mL doesn't damage basement
      membrane proteins, so collagenase 0.5mg/mL-detached FEMJA were found to adhere, continue to
      ensure renewal of the differentiated epithelium 15 days after grafting onto an ex vivo
      porcine de-epitheliazed stroma model.

      Considering these results, we aim to perform a clinical trial in order to evaluate tolerance
      and efficacy of the autologous jugal mucosa cell sheet (Feuillets Epithéliaux de Muqueuse
      Jugale Autologue - FEMJA) cultured with this innovative process.

    <description>FEMJA epithelium is obtained by culturing oral mucosal epithelial cells without any need of support substrates, or carriers, and the transparent fabricated sheets show strong, rapid adhesion on corneal stroma in vivo, without any need for suturing.
The cultivated oral mucosal epithelium will be directly grafted onto the corneal stroma. The sheet is grafted without suture onto the exposed stromal bed after removal of the conjunctiva and fibrosis from the cornea. The grafted corneal surface is then covered with a soft permanent contact lens for protection during healing (between 3 to 15 days, according to tolerance) If the stroma appears opaque because of deep stromal scars a corneal allograft will be performed 12 months after FEMJA transplantation.</description>
