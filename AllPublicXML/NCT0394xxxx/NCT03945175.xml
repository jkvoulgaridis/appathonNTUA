  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized
      by problems with sustaining attention, organization, planning, procrastination, daydreaming,
      restlessness, impulsivity and hyperactivity.This is an outpatient study for subjects between
      the ages of 18-60, who have an Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis
      meeting all inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One purpose of this trial is to extend the evidence basis for Mydayis in adult ADHD to
      include efficacy with a clinical ADHD symptom measure validated for DSM-5 adult ADHD. Another
      purpose of this trial is to re-examine the clinical efficacy of Mydayis later in the day on
      ADHD symptoms; the data on ADHD symptoms via the TASS 1 (Spencer et al. 2008) is a decade old
      and has not been examined in subsequent trials.

    <measure>total score on the AISRS Adult ADHD Investigator symptom rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of MYDAYIS on ADHD symptoms and Executive Function throughout the day into the early evening, as in later in the day (early evening -14-15 hours after first morning dosing). Items are scored as follows: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe). The maximum total score for the scale is 54 points, with 27 points for each subscale. The total score is the sum of the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive subscales.</description>

    <measure>Overall impairment via the clinical global impression-severity (CGI-S) scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Hours Post Dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Possible ratings are:[1]
Normal, not at all ill Borderline mentally ill Mildly ill Moderately ill Markedly ill Severely ill Among the most extremely ill patients</description>

    <time_frame>15 Hours Post Dose</time_frame>

    <measure>Neuropsychological measurement of Executive Function in the early evening as measured by the Stroop Color Word Test.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Hours Post Dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. Word, color, and color-word T-Scores of 40 or less are considered &quot;low.&quot; Word, color, and color-word T-Scores above 40 or are considered &quot;normal.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical symptoms of Executive Function, as measured by the The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Hours Post Dose</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of equivalent Self-Report and Informant Report Forms, each having 75 items in nine nonoverlapping scales, as well as two summary index scales and a scale reflecting overall functioning (Global Executive Composite [GEC]) based on theoretical and statistical considerations. The Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) is composed of four scales: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, and Self-Monitor. The Metacognition Index (MI) is composed of five scales: Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials. There also are three validity scales: Negativity, Infrequency, and Inconsistency. T scores at or above 65 are considered clinically significant.</description>
