  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, one
      of the ways to treat or prevent high blood pressure is to prescribe aerobic exercise training
      (i.e.brisk walking). Previous studies have shown that stretching is also very effective for
      reducing blood pressure. This is an exciting possibility because if stretching is more
      effective, it would change the way exercise is prescribed to people with elevated blood
      pressure. This study will now assess 20 individuals in a supervised stretching or walking
      program five days per week for 8 weeks to determine for certain whether stretching is
      superior for reducing blood pressure. This research will contribute to recommendations about
      the most effective exercise programs for reducing blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular
      disease.

      The study hypothesis is that stretching (flexibility training) will be superior to brisk
      walking for reducing blood pressure.

      This is a parallel-group randomised trial. Twenty participants (aged 18 and older) with
      borderline or stage-1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure between 130 and 159 mmHg OR
      diastolic blood pressure between 85 and 99 mmHg) will be randomised to walking or stretching
      groups. Each group will do 30 minutes of exercise, five days per week. Exercise sessions will
      be supervised three days per week with participants doing exercise sessions on their own two
      days per week. Exercise sessions involve either brisk walking or stretching. The stretching
      exercises will involve stretching all major muscle groups. The main outcome is 24-hour blood
      pressure which will be assessed at baseline, after four weeks, and after eight weeks. Other
      outcomes will be assessed at baseline and eight weeks and include: Body weight, height, waist
      circumference, resting heart rate, physical activity levels (questionnaire), diet
      (questionnaire), maximal distance walked in six minutes. All participants will be counselled
      on how to follow the DASH eating plan, which involves reducing dietary salt intake.

      Statistical analyses: All outcomes will be assessed with a group x time ANOVA with alpha
      level of 0.05. LSD post-hoc tests will be done when necessary to identify differences between
      pairs of means.
