  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aimed to estimate the effect of showing and handling a three-dimensional
      modelization of a patient's kidney presenting with tumor the day before his nephron-sparing
      surgery. The main outcome measure was the effect on anxiety assessed via the STAI score. 2
      types kidney models (virtual and printed) will be evaluated as compared to usual information,
      using a randomization.

    <textblock>
      Announcement of serious illnesses and especially cancerous diseases has major impacts on
      one's psychological field. Need of surgery can create even other fears due to its unknown
      nature. Use of tools to decrease anxiety and enhance understanding prior to surgery is a key
      point in comprehensive care that is way not enough promoted for now. In the field of surgery,
      available methods to deal with pre-operative anxiety are massively represented by anxiolytics
      drugs, only few other devices were evaluated.

      Technological development in healthcare has seen the rising of three-dimensional media,
      especially in surgery, for procedure planning. There is no doubt that this tool is effective
      in helping surgeons regarding the studies published within the past few years but there is no
      such evidence concerning the benefit for patients. Some authors report improvement of
      patients understanding and great satisfaction referring to the usefulness of this tool. But
      none of these papers evaluated anxiety.

      The goal of our research is to measure the effect of a personalized three-dimensional model
      of patients' kidney on pre-operative anxiety.

      For this purpose investigators will randomly assign a total of 66 patients planned to have a
      nephron-sparing surgery for kidney tumor in 3 different groups. Inside the 2 interventional
      groups, patients' kidneys will be modelized in three dimensions, one group will then be
      3D-printed.

      The third group will be control with usual preoperative information. The day before surgery,
      3D models will be presented to their respective owner. All patients will have to complete a
      survey evaluating their anxiety level and also their understanding of renal anatomy and
      surgical procedure.

    <description>The day before surgery, all the patients will be visited by a member of the investigator team for preoperative consultation and will be given a questionnaire evaluating their anxiety based on STAI and VAS scores. The two experimental groups will be offered their renal modelization to be manipulated (virtually or physically) before the questionnaire.
A second survey assessing basic renal anatomy and surgery understanding will also be completed by the patients.
Anxiolytics prescription prior to surgery will be collected inside the medical file.</description>
