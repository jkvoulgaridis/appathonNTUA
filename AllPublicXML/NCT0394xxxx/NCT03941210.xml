  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of miRNAs in HIV disease is yet to be completely defined. Host miRNAs target certain
      HIV genes, thus can affect HIV replication and participate in viral control. miRNAs can also
      block HIV production through disruption of Gag assembly on cell membranes. miRNA expression
      can characterize HIV disease phenotype, as has been shown in HIV elite controllers who have a
      well-defined miRNA expression profile. However, the studies of miRNA in acute infection and
      co-infections like tuberculosis are lacking. The investigators showed that during immune
      reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) in HIV/TB coinfected patients, innate immune response play a
      role as through NK cell degranulation, therefore testing for this could be used as a
      predictive marker of IRIS.

      One of the limitations of miRNA detection is the technique, which is time-consuming, and
      needs laboratories that are specialized and equipped for molecular biology techniques. In
      contrast, flow cytometry has been developed in routine labs and has well-standardized
      techniques. For the routine detection of miRNA, flow cytometry could be the best way to
      perform high throughput screening for clinical applications.

      Flow cytometry is a simple and effective way to evaluate miRNAs expression. In this project
      the investigators propose to evaluate, using flow cytometry, whether circulating miRNA
      pattern might be applicable as potential biomarkers in prediction and prognosis of IRIS in
      HIV/TB co-infected patients. The investigators propose to study the miRNA expression profile
      in a cohort of patients with a HIV infection and Tuberculosis and correlate it with their
      clinical evolution. As controls, the investigators propose to analyze expression of miRNAs in
      healthy controls as well as TB and HIV mono-infected patients.

      AIMS OF THE PROPOSAL

        1. Identify miRNA expression profile as potential novel predictive and prognostic
           biomarkers for IRIS.

        2. Identify the miRNA expression profile in HIV patients, in TB patients and in HIV/TB
           co-infected patients.
