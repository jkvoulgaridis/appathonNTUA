        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female ages 40-70 years

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             receiving the study drug and will agree use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year
             following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential
             are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for
             fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the
             administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy
             test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be
             confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a
             central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by
             qualified personnel using kit.

          -  Females becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring
             will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will
             be recorded. Radiographic assessment will be deferred if the patient becomes pregnant.

          -  Radiographic medial and/or lateral femorotibial knee OA Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3
             accompanied by definite joint space narrowing as agreed upon by two study
             coinvestigators. If no agreement, a musculoskeletal radiologist not associated with
             the study will make the final grading.

          -  Previous 3 month or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments:
             activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or
             injection therapy (e.g. cortisone, hyaluronic acid/viscosupplement).

          -  Able to routinely walk without assistance (e.g. cane, walker).

          -  Clinically stable target knee.

          -  Completed general physical evaluation with primary care provider within 12 months of
             enrollment.

          -  Fully understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with
             the treatment plan, including fat harvesting, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging,
             repeated knee injections/aspirations, arthroscopic examination and follow-up visits
             and assessments.

          -  Can provide written informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation after the nature
             of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure.

          -  Subjects taking medications for symptomatic relief of OA under the supervision of
             their primary caregiver, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g.
             COX-2 inhibitors) may continue to take these medications unless they are otherwise
             excluded by the protocol and as long as the dosing has been stable for 4 weeks before
             baseline and is anticipated to remain stable until at least 30 days following
             completion of the subject's treatment cycle.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Pregnant or nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant during the study period.

          -  Congenital or acquired malformation of the target knee resulting in significant
             deformity or leading to problems with the study treatment or analysis of the results.

          -  Significant clinical malalignment requiring follow-up full length, standing X-rays.

          -  Orthopedic hardware or implantable devices anywhere in the body, other than dental.

          -  Surgery on the index knee within 1 year of study enrollment.

          -  Injections of any into the index knee within 3 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Locking, catching, give-away or another major mechanical symptom of the target knee.

          -  Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 1 or-4 arthritis in the index knee.

          -  History of intra-articular infection in the index knee.

          -  History of superficial infection in the index knee within 6 months of study
             enrollment, or evidence of current superficial infection affecting the index knee.

          -  History of falls requiring medical attention, or gait instability.

          -  Abnormal hematology (complete blood count with differential), blood chemistry
             (Glucose, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Bicarbonate, Chloride, BUN, Creatinine, Anion
             Gap), or urinalysis screening laboratory results, including aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), , and CRP.. If the
             laboratory reports a single, non-clinically relevant, non-life-threatening result for
             any of these studies and is the only excluding factor it may be repeated 1 week later
             if the patient wishes. Normalization of that laboratory study will then be considered
             nonexclusionary. See Section 14.3, Appendix 3.

             sulfate, diacerein, n-glucosamine, piascledine, and capsaicin).

          -  Taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. COX-2 inhibitors) without a
             stable dosing regimen for at least 4 weeks before baseline evaluation, or anticipating

             study drug treatment cycle.

          -  Use of electrotherapy or acupuncture for OA, unless there is a stable regimen for at
             least 4 weeks before baseline assessment.

          -  Taking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other
             antimetabolites) within 3 months prior to study enrollment.

             immunosuppressive state, including use of systemic steroids/corticosteroids.
