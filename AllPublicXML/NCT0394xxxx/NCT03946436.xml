  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developing movement capabilities and efficiently acquiring and assimilating movement
      information and knowledge in middle childhood stages is of great importance for performing
      complex movement structures in later stages of life. Our study is directed to researching the
      influence of active video games (AVG) on assessment of tennis motor skills and visual
      capabilities in middle childhood, as a part of two separate sub-researches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first sub-research, which included a sample of 55 children aged between 7 and 9, the
      investigators measured the physiological responses of bodies after acute and chronic exposure
      to playing AVG. The investigators established a significant difference in skin conductance
      before beginning the intervention between the virtual and actual game. After the
      intervention, the experimental group had a significantly higher average value of heart rate
      frequency and breathing frequency while playing AVG in comparison to the control group.

      In the second sub-research the investigators measured progress in tennis technique (TRSC
      test), development of gross motor skills and change in reaction time on the same group of
      children. In the TRSC test, the control group improved in all sub-groups with both strokes.
      The experimental group made no improvements in sub-group 3d with the ''forehand'', 1d and 3d
      with the ''backhand''. In the gross motor skill development test the investigators have not
      established a significant interaction effect. In the analogue reaction time measurement test,
      the investigators recorded a significant interaction between time x group. The same goes for
      Simon's test with incongruent stimuli, with congruent the interaction was of no relevance.

      The investigators established that the use of AVG can represent a new strategy for combining
      movement/sports activities and cognitively directed tasks aiming at effective assessment of
      tennis skills.

    <measure>TGMD-3 scale (Test of Gross Motor Development-Third Edition)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 3-months intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The TGMD-3 has two subtests. The first subtest, Locomotor, measures the gross motor skills that require fluid coordinated movements of the body as the child moves in one direction or another. The second subtest, Ball Skills, measure the gross motor skills that demonstrate efficient throwing, striking, and catching movements. The TGMD-3 provides an overall composite score (Gross Motor). The two subtest scaled scores are combined to form the Gross Motor composite. The Examiner's Manual discusses the test's theoretical and research-based foundation, item development, standardization, administration and scoring procedures, normative tables, and guidelines for using and interpreting the test's results. The TGMD-3 scale is used to measure the fundamental motor skills in 3-10 year-old children with typical development. The raw score for locomotor subtest is between 0 and 46, while the raw score for ball skills is between 0 and 54. The overall raw score for the test is between 0 and 100.</description>
