  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with glial brain tumors have increasingly improved outcomes, with median survival of
      5-15 years. However, the treatments, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, often
      lead to impaired attention, working memory, and other cognitive functions. These cognitive
      deficits frequently have significant impact on patient quality of life. Although currently,
      there is no established standard of care to treat cognitive deficits in brain tumor patients,
      standard cognitive rehabilitative treatments have been developed for those with traumatic
      brain injury and stroke. However, the feasibility and efficacy of these cognitive treatments
      in individuals with brain tumors remains unclear.

      Determine the feasibility of standard and innovative cognitive rehabilitation in lower grade
      gliomas (LrGG) patients. Feasibility will be the percentage of subjects who complete all of
      the intervention exercises. The intervention will be considered feasible for a larger-scale
      efficacy study if greater than 80% of the subjects complete the intervention. Cognitive and
      HRQOL will be assessed pre-intervention and compared to post-intervention (3 months from
      baseline) and 6-month (9 months from baseline) follow-up. Changes in cognition and HRQOL will
      be correlated with serial imaging at pre-intervention compared to short and intermediate-term
      follow-up e.g. in T2 tumor volume, Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scalar quantification,
      resting-state Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity.

      Participants will first be offered the in-person cognitive rehabilitation option (Cohort 1).
      If they are unable to participate because of logistic challenges, they will randomly be
      assigned to the iPad based intervention (Cohort 2), or automated texting program (Cohort 3).
      Participants will complete standardized cognitive testing and quality of life assessments at
      baseline, immediately post intervention and 6 months after intervention. Clinical data will
      be collected at the time of each assessment. This will include changes in serial imaging e.g.
      in T2 tumor volume, DTI scalar quantification, resting-state fMRI connectivity.

      Predict optimal time for cognitive rehabilitation to abrogate tumor and treatment-related
      effects on cognition and HRQOL in adult LrGG. Enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with a goal
      of enrolling 50 who will receive radiation treatment after surgery (Cohort 4) and 50 who will
      not receive radiation after surgery (Cohort 5). Patients in both groups will undergo
      longitudinal global cognitive and HRQOL assessments at baseline prior to surgery, after
      surgery, 3 months after surgery and every 6 months for 3 years. Clinical data will be
      collected at the time of each assessment. This will include changes in serial imaging e.g. in
      T2 tumor volume, DTI scalar quantification, resting-state fMRI connectivity.

      Participants will also complete a post-intervention questionnaire on the usefulness,
      attractiveness, difficulty and burden of the intervention

    <description>The in-person cognitive rehabilitation will focus on the application of evidenced based strategies recommended as practice guidelines by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Cognitive Rehabilitation Task Force (ACRM-CR). The treatment occurs in two stages 1) comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation planning and 2) implementation of treatment planning.

    <description>The ReMind iPad-based cognitive rehabilitation was developed with collaborators at Tilburg University, The Netherlands, and is an evidence-based program to improve attention and memory through (1) cognitive training and (2) teaching compensatory skills in patients with brain tumors. Brain plasticity-based computerized cognitive training is a newly developing field of therapeutics for neurological and psychiatric disorders that uses frequent game-like training sessions to drive improvements in cognitive functions.

    <description>The mobile phone texting intervention was developed with collaborators at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and is currently being studied in individuals with depression and traumatic brain injury. Participants receive a daily message sent at a random time (within their chosen timeframe(s); e.g. 9am-9pm). Messages will focus on patient-based education-focused health-related quality of life and cognitive education such as internal and external cognitive compensatory strategy training, fatigue management, and coping skills.
