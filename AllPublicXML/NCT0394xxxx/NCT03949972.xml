  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a monocentric, later multicentric prospective approach the FOrMe registry (The German
      Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis and Minimal Change Disease Registry) aims to generate a
      longitudinal cohort of 150 pediatric cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and 350 adult
      cases of biopsy-proven Minimal Change Disease (MCD) or Focal and Segmental Glomerular
      Sclerosis (FSGS) over 10 years. The registry will provide a repository for biomaterials such
      as blood samples, DNA, urine, feces, and tissue biopsies that will be accessible to
      collaborators to facilitate future research on pathogenesis, diagnostics, and treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, volume retention,
      hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia. As Minimal Change Disease (MCD) represents by far the most
      prevalent underlying diagnosis in children older than 1 year, a kidney biopsy is usually
      deferred in these cases. In adolescence and adults, a kidney biopsy is crucial for the
      diagnosis because MCD and FSGS account for only 10-15 and 12-35 percent of all cases of
      nephrotic syndrome respectively. Pathomechanisms as well as optimal treatment remain elusive
      as systematic trials are scarce and hampered by low incidence and heterogenicity of the
      clinical presentation. To bridge this informational gap, the investigators identified the
      need for a German registry of pediatric and adult patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome
      (in children) and biopsy-proven MCD/FSGS (in adults).

      The registry will record clinical data of participants regarding basic demographics, initial
      presentation, hereditary traits, disease course and treatment modalities as well as quality
      of life, concomitant diseases, and comedication. During the initial visit and to a lesser
      intent on follow-up visits, biomaterials (blood, urine, DNA, feces, tissue) will be collected
      and stored in a state-of-the art biobank. This material will be available to collaborators to
      support research on idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and MCD/FSGS. By the time of completion,
      the registry will provide data on clinical courses and outcome of approximately 500 patients
      that can easily be correlated with biomaterials giving insight into risk factors, prognostic
      parameters, and association with comorbidities.

      Tissue sections of all patients that undergo kidney biopsy (all adult and some pediatric
      patients) will be digitalized, annotated, and analyzed by a panel of nephropathologists.
      Histopathologic features will be individually assessed and scored according to a set of
      descriptors that was developed and is used by the American NEPTUNE (Nephrotic Syndrome Study
      Network).

    <description>Patient-reported outcome will be assessed using Quality of Life questionnaires at regular intervals using the SF-36 questionnaire.
For reference see https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html The SF-36 questionnaire measures eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. Lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.

    <description>Patient-reported outcome will be assessed using Quality of Life questionnaires at regular intervals using the PedsQL questionnaire.
For reference see https://www.pedsql.org/score.html The PedSQL questionnaire measures four health concepts: Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL (Health-Related Quality of Life). To create Scale Scores, the mean is computed as the sum of the items over the number of items answered (this accounts for missing data). To create the Total Scale Score, the mean is computed as the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales.</description>
