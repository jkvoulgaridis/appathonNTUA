    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to infuse BCMA CAR-NK 92 cells to the patients with relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM), to assess the safety and feasibility of this strategy. The
      CAR enables the NK-92 cells to recognize and kill the MM cells by targeting of BCMA, a
      protein expressed of the surface of the malignant plasma cells in MM patients.
