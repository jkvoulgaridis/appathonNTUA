  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathological features of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney disease (ADPKD) include
      enlarged kidney volume, a higher frequency of digestive diverticulitis and abdominal wall
      hernias. Therefore, many nephrologists have concerns about the use of peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) in ADPKD patients. We aimed to analyze survival and technique failure in ADPKD patients
      treated with PD.

      Pathological features of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney disease (ADPKD) include
      enlarged kidney volume, a higher frequency of digestive diverticulitis and abdominal wall
      hernias. Therefore, many nephrologists have concerns about the use of peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) in ADPKD patients. We aimed to analyze survival and technique failure in ADPKD patients
      treated with PD. We conducted two retrospective studies on patients starting dialysis between
      2000 and 2010, and based on two French registries: The French Renal Epidemiology and
      Information Network (REIN) and The French Language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry (RDPLF).
