  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of eosinophilic sinusitis with nasal polyps is difficult and challenging. After
      endoscopic sinus surgery(ESS), complications such as edema, scar formation, adhesions, sinus
      stenosis and recurrence of polyps are prone to occur. Investigators aim to assess the
      efficacy and safety of Steroid-eluting stent when implanted in sinus in patients following
      ESS with eosinophilic sinusitis and nasal polyps.The randomized, double-blind, controlled
      clinical trial enrolled patients with eosinophilic sinusitis and nasal polyps. After
      endoscopic bilateral sinus surgery, the Steroid-eluting stents were randomly implanted in one
      side of the sinus and the other side as a control.

      Primary outcomes are change in the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score.The primary outcomes will be
      measured in baseline, week4,week 8 and week 12. Secondary outcomes include the changes in
      symptoms measured by Visual analog score and nasal patency (nasal airway resistance and nasal
      cavity volume), exhaled nasal nitric oxide. The investigators also evaluate change in
      inflammatory cytokines (interleukin(IL)-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-17, IL-22, IL-25, interferon-γ,
      tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, Leukotriene,Eotaxin) in nasal
      secretions. The secondary outcomes will be measured in baseline, week4, week8 and week12.
      Mucosal pathology assessment will be performed at 4 weeks postoperatively.Sinus CT scan will
      be conducted at 8 weeks after surgery. Changes in serum cortisol are monitored at
      baseline,week4 and week12 postoperatively. All adverse events are recorded throughout the
      experiment

    <description>Measure exhaled nasal nitric oxide (nNO). Briefly, NO-free air was aspirated through the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 50 ml/s. The subject exhaled against the air-resistance, resulting in an intraoral pressure to close the velum and prevent mixture of oral and nasal gas. Nasal gas from this circuit was continuously routed in part directly into the analyser for determination of nNO, and the level of nNO(ppb) was calculated from a plateau lasting for at least 3s.</description>

Nasal secretions were obtained by inserting a postoperative sinus pack in the nasal cavity (acupuncture side) for five minutes. The quantity of secretions was determined by comparing the weight of the sponges before and after insertion and 2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution was added to each sponge. The sponges were stored at 4°C for two hours and the nasal secretions were recovered from the sponges by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were separated and stored in aliquots at -20°C until further analysis. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (pg/g) were analysed using the Luminex System.</description>
