  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for rectal cancer has diminished local recurrence and enhanced
      survival. Quality of life, however, remains poor for many patients and the probability of
      distant recurrence is high. In this study, we will attempt to reduce the distant recurrence
      rate and improve quality of life by making changes in the timing and administration of
      chemotherapy and radiation and doing less invasive rectal surgery when indicated.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if neo-adjuvant FOLFOX therapy and lengthening the
      time interval between neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and transanal local excision will increase
      the percentage of patients with pathologic complete remission.

      This is a prospective pilot study to examine the impact of two variables: 1) addition of
      neo-adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy, and 2) increasing the time interval between completion of
      chemo-radiotherapy and subsequent surgery, on the rate of achieving pathologic complete
      remission with avoidance of radical resection while maintaining an excellent local control
      with improvement of quality of life.

      All procedures in this study are standard of care, the study question relates to the use of
      neo-adjuvant FOLFOX and the timing between the end of radiation and surgery.
