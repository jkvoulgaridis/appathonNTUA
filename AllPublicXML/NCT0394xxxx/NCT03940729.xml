  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWID) have increased risk of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)
      colonization, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), and systemic infections like
      septicaemia and endocarditis. International research and data from Malmö needle exchange
      program (NEP) show a 60 - 70% lifetime SSTI prevalence. Longitudinal colonization pattern of
      S. aureus and its association with infection frequency among PWID is unknown. Cultures from
      the anterior nares, throat and perineum are used to indirectly assess S. aureus skin
      colonization. In PWID 28 - 45% are colonized in the nares, which increases risk of
      infections. Clinical significance of extra-nasal colonization, and persistent/intermittent
      colonization is uncertain.

      The S. aureus genome can be characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Certain types are
      associated with abscesses and systemic infections. The infection pattern among PWID is
      unknown.

      S. aureus skin colonization level is decreased by chlorhexidine body wash and nasal mupirocin
      used as surgical prophylaxis and treatment of furunculosis. To our knowledge, disinfection
      effect on infections in PWID is not studied. However, the clinical impression is that severe
      infections have somewhat diminished since the NEP started distributing skin disinfectant
      tissues.

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS

        1. Can repeated skin wash with chlorhexidine decrease infection frequency among PWID?

        2. Is the longitudinal S. aureus colonization pattern associated with infection prevalence
           among PWID?

        3. Can the risk of S. aureus-infections be predicted by quantification of bacterial level
           in anterior nares, throat, perineum or skin lesions/eczema?

        4. Can different types of S. aureus be identified, that are associated with colonization or
           infection among PWID (by WGS)?

      METHODS AND TIME PHRAME Malmö NEP was established in 1986, and several studies assessing HIV,
      hepatitis and sociological questions have been conducted in this setting. In December 2016
      continuous inclusion of 100 PWID for the actual study started at Malmö NEP. The study period
      is estimated to two years, with scientific papers expected for publication.

      During the first year of the study, mapping of S. aureus colonization pattern among all study
      participants is conducted by repeated sampling, clinical evaluation of eczemas, and
      interviews regarding infections. Every third month samples are collected from nares, throat,
      perineum and skin lesions. Semi quantification of S. aureus takes place at the
      microbiological research laboratory at Lund University. BBL CHROMagar Staph aureus-plates are
      used and incubated in 35oC air for 48h. S. aureus-colonies are identified and quantified
      manually by pink colour change and Pastorex. MALDI-TOF will be used in unclear cases.
      Disk-diffusion will be used for resistance determination. Bacterial isolates will be frozen
      to -70oC for later WGS.

      Intervention with chlorhexidine wash starts one year after inclusion for each study subject,
      and will continue for one additional year. Study participants with S aureus colonization will
      undergo regular showers with chlorhexidine (intervention group) at the needle exchange. In
      order to avoid bacterial resistance, muporicin will not be used. During the intervention,
      cultures, interviews and clinical evaluation will continue.

    <description>In the Malmö needle exchange program, people who inject drugs (PWID) are repeatedly screened for S aureus colonization during one year. Those colonized will repeatedly shower with chlorhexidine during the following year. The infection frequency will be compared between the two periods.</description>
