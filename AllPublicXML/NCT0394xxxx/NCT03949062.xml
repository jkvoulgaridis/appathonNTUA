  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib，
      lenalidomide, rituximab (iR2) in previously untreated and unfit elderly subjects with diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma. Subjects will receive 6 cycles of ibrutinib 560mg, day 1-21, orally
      (PO) , lenalidomide 25mg, day 1-10, rituximab 375mg/m2, intravenously, every 21 days.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
