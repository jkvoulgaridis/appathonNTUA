  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin injections are the treatment of choice for cervical dystonia. Even if this
      treatment is successful for most of the patients, partials or completes failures still
      remained.

      Usually, botulinum toxin injections are realized by clinical localization techniques
      (observation and palpation of target muscles). The use of Ultrasonography to guide injections
      of Botulinum toxin has theoretical benefits (as an improved precision, an improved
      reproducibility, the targeting of deep-seated muscles, and a lower risk of adverse events)
      but its interest has never been demonstrated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label non-randomised controlled clinical trial comparing clinical localization
      techniques and ultrasonography to guide injections of Botulinum toxin A.

      The primary outcome is to compare both techniques of injection regarding to the health impact
      of cervical dystonia (CDIP-58) measured 1 month after injection.

      The results of this clinical trial will help the clinician to decide which strategy of
      injection is the most effective in terms of benefit/risk ratio to treat the cervical
      dystonia.
