      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone with or without
      bortezomib work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as ixazomib, dexamethasone, and bortezomib, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving daratumumab, ixazomib,
      and dexamethasone with or without bortezomib may work better in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the ≥ very good partial response (VGPR) rate after 8 cycles in subjects
      treated with daratumumab, ixazomib and dexamethasone (DId) versus (vs) daratumumab,
      bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) followed by DId among newly diagnosed myeloma patients
      (NDMM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of subjects with successful stem cell mobilization after
      receiving 3 cycles of treatment in both arms (DId x 8 vs DVd x 3 then DId x 5).

      II. To establish safety among patients receiving the combination of DId and DVd then DId.

      III. To obtain anti-tumor activity (best response rates: overall response rate [ORR], VGPR,
      complete response [CR], stringent complete response [sCR] and minimal residual of disease
      [MRD] negativity) in patients treated with these combinations.

      IV. Progression free survival (PFS), progression free survival 2 (PFS2), duration of response
      (DOR), time to progression (TTP), determine the time to next therapy (TTNT).

      V. Overall survival (OS).

      VI. Engraftment parameters among the autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) group.

      VII. Determine whether tumor response and PFS may change in subgroups with different
      prognosis according to current prognostic factors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22, daratumumab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2 and on days 1 and 15 of
      cycles 3-8, and ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Eligible patients then
      undergo stem cell transplant per standard of care. Patients who have at least stable disease
      after induction and patients who have undergone transplant continue to Maintenance.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, daratumumab
      IV on day 1, and ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 24
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II:

      INDUCTION CYCLES 1-3: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and PO on days 1, 8, and 15,
      daratumumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15, and bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and
      11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      INDUCTION CYCLES 4-8: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22,
      daratumumab IV on days 1 and 15, and ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Eligible patients then undergo stem cell transplant per standard of care. Patients who have
      at least stable disease after induction and patients who have undergone transplant continue
      to Maintenance.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive dexamethasone IV on day 1, daratumumab IV on day 1, and
      ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual

          -  Known hypersensitivity to acyclovir or similar anti-viral drug

          -  Known intolerance to steroid therapy

          -  Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) involvement

          -  Participants who have undergone major surgery ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug
             or who have not recovered from side effects of the surgery

             staff

          -  Prior exposure to anti-CD38 therapy

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7 days
             will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of the
             ixazomib

          -  Systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first dose of ixazomib, with strong
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inducers (rifampin, rifapentine,
             rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol

             agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of this trial and
