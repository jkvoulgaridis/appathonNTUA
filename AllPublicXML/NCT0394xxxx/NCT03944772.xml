      This is an open-label, multicentre, multi-drug, biomarker-directed Phase 2 platform study in
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring an epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutation whose disease has progressed on first-line
      monotherapy with osimertinib.Treatment options for these patients are limited. Novel
      treatments for these patients are urgently required.

      This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of multiple study treatments.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 2 platform study in patients with advanced Non-Small Lung Cancer harbouring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutation with evidence of radiological progression following first-Line osimertinib therapy. This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of multiple study treatments. The study will be conducted in three groups (Groups A, B and C). Patient allocation to a study treatment within each group will be based on tumour molecular profile. Biomarker positive patients will be allocated to a biomarker-matched study treatment in Group A, patients without a biomarker will be allocated to a study treatment in Group B and patients with histological transformed disease or a biomarker amenable to therapies not currently available in ORCHARD will be allocated to Group C (observational; patients managed in accordance with local practice).</intervention_model_description>
