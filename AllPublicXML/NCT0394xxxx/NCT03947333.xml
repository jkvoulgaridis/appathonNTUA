  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a two-arm, parallel-design, pragmatic randomized
      controlled trial of a patient portal intervention for diabetes, My Diabetes Care, to evaluate
      its effect on patient activation and secondary cognitive, behavioral, and clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      300 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be randomized to one of two arms. 150
      will be assigned to receive access to the intervention (My Diabetes Care) embedded within an
      existing patient web portal (My Health at Vanderbilt) at Vanderbilt University Medical
      Center. 150 will be assigned to a usual care comparison arm with access currently available
      version of My Health at Vanderbilt without the My Diabetes Care. Patients will be invited by
      mail (or email) to be screened for enrollment in the study. Eligible and interested patients
      will be emailed a link to a secure study website where they will complete a web consent form.
      At enrollment, participants will complete a baseline questionnaire and diabetes health data
      will be abstracted from the patients' electronic health record (EHR) before being randomized
      to the intervention or control arm. Participants will receive additional follow-up
      questionnaires and diabetes health data will be abstracted from the EHR at 3-month and
      6-month follow-ups to assess outcomes. In addition, system usage data (My Health at
      Vanderbilt and My Diabetes Dashboard user analytics) will be collected throughout the study
      period.

    <measure>Change in Patient Activation at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The uni-dimensional, 13-item, Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) is a valid measure of patient activation (i.e., the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care). Each item uses a 4-point Likert-type scale of response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. PAM-13 item responses result in total raw scores ranging from 13 to 52, which we converted to the linear interval scale of patient activation scores, ranging from 0 (lowest activation) to 100 (highest activation). The PAM-13 has good psychometric properties including excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.87). The PAM-13 scores have been used to predict healthcare outcomes including medication adherence and emergency room utilization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Activation at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The uni-dimensional, 13-item, Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) is a valid measure of patient activation (i.e., the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care). Each item uses a 4-point Likert-type scale of response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. PAM-13 item responses result in total raw scores ranging from 13 to 52, which we converted to the linear interval scale of patient activation scores, ranging from 0 (lowest activation) to 100 (highest activation). The PAM-13 has good psychometric properties including excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.87). The PAM-13 scores have been used to predict healthcare outcomes including medication adherence and emergency room utilization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow up, 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Diabetes Knowledge Instrument (SDKI) is a valid measure of diabetes knowledge with an emphasis on controlling blood glucose through diet, recognizing symptoms of abnormal blood glucose, and using healthy eating to prevent complications. It also includes items on foot care and the importance of physical activity for preventing cardiovascular complications. The SDKI is a uni-dimensional, 13-item scale with scores ranging from 0 to 13 (number of items answered correctly). SDKI demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.73) in a multi-ethnic sample of older adults suggesting the instrument can be used to measure diabetes knowledge in diverse populations (Quandt et al. Diabetes Educator, 2014).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Self-Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow up, 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activity (SDSCA), developed by Toobert and Glasgow (1994), is a 12-item multidimensional instrument to assess levels of diabetes self-care across five domains: overall diet (2 items), dietary intake of specific foods (3 items), exercise (3 items), medication taking (2 items), and SMBG (2 items). The instrument is based on the self-reported frequency of completing recommended activities during the past 7 days. An example item includes &quot;How often did you follow your recommended diet over the last 7 days?&quot; All responses are converted to percentages. Higher percentages represent better self-care on each subscale. The SDSCA has been used in a number of settings and studies and has been recommended for a standardized evaluation of quality improvement interventions in T2DM in Canada (Majumdar et al., 2005).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow up, 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale-Diabetes (ARMS-D) is a reliable and valid measure of diabetes medication adherence. The 11-item ARMS-D has good internal consistency reliability (Î±=0.86). Responses range from 1=&quot;none of the time&quot; to 4=&quot;all of the time,&quot; and are summed to produce an overall adherence score ranging from 12-48, with higher scores representing more problems with medication adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow up, 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS) is a valid measure of diabetes self-efficacy (i.e., how confident they feel about their ability to carry out multiple self management tasks). The uni-dimensional, 8-item scale is scored on a five-point Likert scale. The total PDSMS score can range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating more confidence in self-managing one's diabetes. PDSMS has excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.83). PDSMS scores were associated with observed percentage of low blood sugars (r = .21), BMI (r = -.22), percentage of high blood sugars (r = -.36), average blood glucose (r = -.27), and A1C (r = -.25). Thus, the PDSMS appears to be validly associated with important self-management behaviors as well as with indicators of health status and diabetes control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow up, 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-5) is a valid measure of diabetes distress. The five-item, uni-dimensional scale has scores that range from 0 to 20, with higher scores suggesting greater diabetes-related emotional distress. The PAID-5 has excellent excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.86) and is associated with measures of depression and hemoglobin A1c.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction/Usability of My Health at Vanderbilt (for control group) and My Diabetes Care (for intervention group)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow up, 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a valid measure of usability and assesses users' perceptions of ease of use, likability of the interface, and overall satisfaction using a 5- point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The ten items are scored on a five-point Likert scale. The item scores are summed and then converted to a score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on prior research, a score above 68 would be above average and a score of 85 or above suggests excellent usability. The SUS has been used in several studies of patient facing health information technology (the article describing its psychometric properties has been cited over 500 times) and has excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.91).</description>
