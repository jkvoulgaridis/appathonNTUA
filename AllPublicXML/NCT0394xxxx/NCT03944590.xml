  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study investigates radiological and clinical outcome after screw osteosynthesis
      of radial head fractures with associated injuries (such as rupture of the interosseous
      membrane and collateral ligaments). Interpretation of radiographs 3 and 9 months post-
      surgery and patient surveys will be analyzed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>elbow status assessed by Mayo Elbow Score (MEPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>single time point, assessment 2 to 7 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-completed scoring system used to evaluate the level of disability in the elbow, assessing pain, functional status (based on number tasks performed), range of motion and joint stability. Clinical information is rated based on a 100 points scale:
&lt;60 - poor 60-74 - fair 75-89 - good 90-100 - excellent</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported outcome of elbow surgery assessed by Oxford Elbow Score (OES)</measure>
    <time_frame>single time point, assessment 2 to 7 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Elbow Score has 12 items (questions) with 5 response options each. Each item response is scored 0 to 4, with 0 representing greater severity. Underlying the 12 items are 3 domains (sub-scales): Elbow pain, Elbow function and Social-psychological domain. Scores for each domain are calculated as the sum of each individual item score within that domain, which is then converted to a metric of 0 — 100 (lower score representing greater severity).</description>

    <measure>Patient reported outcome assessed by Quick Dash</measure>
    <time_frame>single time point, assessment 2 to 7 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quick Dash is a questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to complete tasks, absorb forces, and severity of symptoms. The QuickDASH tool uses a 5-point Likert scale from which the patient can select an appropriate number corresponding to his/her severity level/ function level. Scoring ranges from 1 = no difficulty to 5 = unable to do. A higher score indicates a greater level of disability and severity.</description>
