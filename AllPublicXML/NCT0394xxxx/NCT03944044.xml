    <textblock>
      Background: Among palliative-care patients, subcutaneous route is often an alternative to
      intravenous route yet pharmacological and clinical data are lacking. Many French palliative
      crew are now using empirically paracetamol by subcutaneous route also there is no data to
      support this practice. The aim of the present study is to compare pharmacokinetics parameters
      between intravenous and subcutaneous route for palliative-care patients.

      Methods/design: A randomized, open, crossover, bicenter study in two palliative care centers.
      The aim is to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic equivalence between the two routes of
      administration. Data analysis will be performed by Wilcoxn's signed Rank Test with an alpha
      risk of 5 percent. All adverse events will be reported for a safety analysis.

      Discussion: This trial may permit, if a pharmacokinetic equivalence is established, to build
      randomized controlled trials to then assess the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous
      paracetamol administration.
