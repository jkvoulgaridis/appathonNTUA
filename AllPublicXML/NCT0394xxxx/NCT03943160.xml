      The objective of this study is to evaluate acute clinical results of orbital atherectomy (OA)
      via radial artery access, including complication rates and cost effectiveness.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate acute clinical outcomes of orbital
      atherectomy (OA) via transradial access (TRA) for treatment of peripheral artery disease
      (PAD) in lower extremity lesions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is â‰¥ 18 years

          2. Subject is willing and able to sign the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF)

          3. Subject presents with a Rutherford Classification of 2 to 5

          4. Subject has a positive Allen's Test

          5. Subject to undergo peripheral angiography and/or PVI via TRA approach per physician
             discretion

        Index Procedure Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Physician obtains successful radial artery access (Note: snuffbox access is allowed)

          2. Target lesion appropriate (i.e. location/morphology) for OA treatment via TRA within
             target area

          3. OAS use attempted (defined as ViperWire introduced into the body)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has no palpable radial artery on the planned access arm

          2. Subject has a previous failed radial access attempt on planned access arm

          3. Subject has a dialysis fistula on planned access arm

          4. Subject has a known subclavian stenosis or occlusion

          5. Subject has a previous subclavian stent or previous subclavian intervention

          6. Subject has a shunt in the radial artery on the planned access arm

          7. Subject has evidence of osteomyelitis

          8. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study

          9. Subject is pregnant within the study period

        Index Procedure Exclusion Criteria

          1. Physician unable to obtain radial artery access

          2. Physician determines TRA is not acceptable due to patient anatomy, lesion
             characteristics, and/or disease severity

          3. OAS use not attempted (defined as ViperWire introduced into the body)

             Prior to insertion of ViperWire:

          4. Femoral access is obtained

          5. Unsuccessful peripheral intervention

          6. A reportable adverse event has occurred
