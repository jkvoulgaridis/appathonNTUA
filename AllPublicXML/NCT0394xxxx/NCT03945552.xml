  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public health disasters have disproportionate impacts on low income communities, through
      pathways that add to those of poverty and associated stressors, and act over extended
      periods. Very young children are highly vulnerable to long-term impacts on development and
      mental health in the context of parenting challenges following disasters, yet frequently
      receive the least attention and resources. This study will test the role of universal
      parenting support in enhancing young children's development and mental health in Flint,
      Michigan following the Flint Water Crisis.

      There are three specific aims of this study: Specific Aim 1: Characterize participants'
      experience of the FWC using ecological (neighborhood-level), geocoded STYH data, ecological
      indicators of water quality and parent self-report measures. These metrics will be obtained
      from Speak to Your Health (STYH) survey, a biennial community survey including
      neighborhood-level measures of stress collected before, during and after the FWC. Specific
      Aim 2: Assess impacts of strengths-based parenting support (VIP) after a disaster compounding
      chronic poverty (FWC). Specific Aim 3: Assess variation in VIP impacts in relation to FWC
      experience.

    <ipd_description>Given that the proposed research methodology will take place in a community (Flint, MI) with ongoing institutional mistrust following the onset of a community-level disaster (the Flint Water Crisis), the investigators are committed to developing a plan for data sharing that will meet NIH's data sharing requirements while simultaneously meeting the needs of this community. The investigators will work together with the Michigan State University Pediatric Public Health Initiative and its community partners to develop a plan for data sharing that addresses these diverse and important considerations.</ipd_description>
