  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of 1,550 high-risk women to
      assess whether daily treatment with pravastatin administered early in pregnancy reduces the
      rate of a composite outcome of preeclampsia, fetal loss and maternal death. Women with a
      prior history of preeclampsia with preterm delivery less than 34 weeks will be randomized to
      pravastatin or placebo daily until delivery. Women will have monthly study visits during
      pregnancy, a follow-up visit at 6 weeks postpartum and children will have follow-up visits at
      2 and 5 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia complicates approximately 3% to 5% of pregnancies and remains a major cause of
      maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortality. Women who experience preeclampsia in one
      pregnancy are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy than those
      who have never experienced the condition. There is evidence from laboratory studies and
      clinical trials, as well as biological plausibility, to suggest that statins may prevent the
      development of preeclampsia by reversing various pathways associated with preeclampsia.
      Pravastatin has a favorable safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties.

      The study is a randomized placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trial of 1,550 women with
      a prior history of preeclampsia that required delivery at less than 34 weeks, randomized to
      either 20mg pravastatin or an identical appearing placebo daily until delivery. Women with a
      singleton or twin gestation will be randomized between 12 weeks 0 days and 16 weeks 6 days
      will be followed monthly during pregnancy and then at 6 weeks postpartum. Children will have
      follow-up visits at 2 and 5 years of age to assess growth, cognition, behavior, motor skills,
      vision and hearing.

The CBCL is filled out by the caregiver. Each of the 100 questions indicates a behavior for which the caregiver scores as Not True (0), Sometimes True (1), or Often True (2). The scores for all the questions are then summed and evaluated against the normative data/T-scores. A T-score of less than 60 is considered to be in the normal range. A T-score of 60-63 is a borderline, and a T-score of more than 63 is in the clinical range. Lower scores represent better outcomes.</description>

Designed to assess the abilities of a broad range of children and adolescents, the BRIEF is useful when working with children who have learning disabilities and attention disorders, traumatic brain injuries, lead exposure, pervasive developmental disorders, depression, and other developmental, neurological, psychiatric, and medical conditions.
Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Higher T-scores indicate greater impairment.
For all BRIEF2 clinical scales and indexes, T-scores from 60 to 64 are considered mildly elevated, and T-scores from 65 to 69 are considered potentially clinically elevated. T-scores at or above 70 are considered clinically elevated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 16 years or older at time of consent with ability to give informed consent

          2. Single or twin gestation with cardiac activity in one or both fetuses. Higher order
             multifetal gestations reduced to twins, either spontaneously or therapeutically, are
             not eligible unless the reduction occurred by 13 weeks 6 days project gestational age.

          3. Gestational age at randomization between 12 weeks 0 days and 16 weeks 6 days based on
             clinical information and evaluation of the earliest ultrasound.

          4. Documented history (by chart or delivery/operative note review) of prior preeclampsia
             with delivery less than or equal to 34 weeks 0 days gestation in any previous
             pregnancy. If in the index pregnancy, the woman was induced by 34 weeks 0 days
             gestation and delivered within 48 hours in the same hospitalization, that woman would
             be eligible.

          5. Normal serum transaminase (AST/ALT) concentrations documented in the last 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Monoamniotic gestation because of the risk of fetal demise

          2. Known chromosomal, genetic or major malformations

          3. Fetal demise or planned termination of pregnancy. Selective reduction by 13 weeks 6
             days gestation, from triplets to twins or twins to singleton is not an exclusion.

          4. Contraindications for statin therapy:

               1. Hypersensitivity to pravastatin or any component of the product

               2. Active liver disease: acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis

          5. Statin use in current pregnancy

          6. Patients with any of the following medical conditions:

               1. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism with a TSH level above 10 mIU/L, because of increased
                  risk of myopathy

               2. HIV positive, because of increased risk of myopathy with use of protease
                  inhibitors

               3. Chronic renal disease with baseline serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL, because of
                  association with adverse pregnancy outcomes

          7. Current use of concomitant medication with potential for drug interaction with statins
             (i.e.,, cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin, erythromycin). Patients will not be excluded
             if the drug is discontinued (at least one week) prior to randomization.

          8. Participating in another intervention study that influences the primary outcome in
             this study

          9. Plan to deliver in a non-network site

         10. Participation in this trial in a previous pregnancy. Patients who were screened in a
             previous pregnancy, but not randomized, do not have to be excluded.
