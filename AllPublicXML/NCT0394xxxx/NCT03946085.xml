  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefits in visual function from dietary
      supplementation of the Lumega-Z carotenoid liquid-supplement in participants with drusen and
      at risk of AMD. The effects of Lumega-Z supplementation will be compared to an active
      comparator, the AREDS2 multivitamin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Changes in Visual Acuity (VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Repeated measures were obtained using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart-based acuity exam. The ETDRS chart allows a geometric quantification the participant's visual acuity threshold for images under daylight-conditions of black &amp; white contrast. Participant scores were reported as Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) units; a more accurate, standardized value equated from the similar acuity charts. Per the clinical evaluation protocol, LogMAR scores of 0.00 - 0.20 are considered &quot;good/normal visual acuity scores&quot;; total range of 0.00 - 1.00. Scores are reported as averaged values, according to each respective group of participants and time-point from which the measurements were collected (i.e. baseline, 3-months, etc...).
Exclusion criteria included LogMAR scores greater than, or equal to, 0.30 (equivalent to visual acuity of 20/40 or worse).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Changes in Contrast Sensitivity (CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) was measured using the CSV-1000E device and measurements were analyzed as logCS units (logarithm of Contrast Sensitivity). The device measures both high- and low-contrast sensitivity (participant's ability to discern size and contrast) within a detection task, and reported as a response-curve. The curve compares the lowest contrast-level for a specific-sized target (across four spatial frequencies; per the manufacturer). Thus, the logCS unit of Contrast Sensitivity, is inversely related to the target's contrast level (displayed by the device). All measurements are reported as averaged values within each group, according to their respective time-frame within the study.
Normal LogCS scores for adults aged 50-75 years old, in ascending order of spatial frequency (3, 6, 12, and 18), are (1.56 +/- 0.15), (1.80 +/- 0.165), (1.50 +/- 0.15), and (0.93 +/- 0.25). Values were utilized for scale, as recommended by the manufacturer/protocol.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Changes in Dark Adaptation Recovery (DAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>DAR measurements were collected using the AdaptDx adaptometer, to identify the participant's impaired dark adaptation threshold value (in response to low-light condition sensitivity). The device's software reported each patient's sensitivity-value over units of time (minutes), and were recorded as units of Rod Intercept Time. Similarly, measurements reported from each group were an averaged value amongst participant groups at each time-point of collection.
According to the manufacturing protocol, a Rod Intercept Time of 6.5 minutes was determined to be the cut-off value for part of the inclusion criteria into treatment groups. Previous studies have demonstrated that scores equal to, or greater than, 6.5 minutes are indicative of early-AMD, and those less than 6.5 minutes are considered normal Rod Intercept values.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Changes in Macular Pigment Optical Density (MPOD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>MPOD levels were measured by heterochromatic flicker photometry, using the MapCatSF device. MPOD (Macular Pigment Optical Density) measurements represent the level of light absorption by the macular pigment within the central retina, and provide measurements related to macular carotenoid densities. Measurements were reported as LogMAR units (total range of 0.00 to 1.00), as determined by the manufacture software program. Averaged values were reported within each group, at each time-point of collection.
MPOD values between 0.22 - 0.44 logMAR units have been determined to be middle-range MPOD levels; average value in the USA approximately 0.35. Measurements between (0.0 - 0.21) were considered low-MPOD levels, and those between (0.45 - 1.0) were considered high-MPOD levels. All ranged-scores were obtained by recommendation from the manufacturer.</description>
