  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) testing, performed on self-collected vaginal swabs, is acceptable, feasible, and
      sensitive and specific in detection of high-grade cervical lesions among Kenyan women,
      compared to the current standard of care.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that effective cervical cancer screening
      can be performed in a high percentage of women, using HPV DNA of self-collected vaginal
      samples, provided by women attending either chamas (community groups) or in their own homes.
      HPV DNA testing will be used to triage women for a secondary screen by visual inspection with
      acetic acid (VIA) in a local clinic. The investigators will determine if HPV DNA testing,
      performed on self-collected vaginal swabs, is acceptable, feasible, and sensitive and
      specific in detection of high-grade cervical lesions among Kenyan women, compared to the
      current standard of care. In addition, women will bring their children to be vaccinated
      against HPV in these community meetings, using the standard of care for the approved HPV
      vaccine available in Kenya.

      The investigators will test this approach by completing the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the percentage of women attending community meetings who will
      provide self-collected vaginal swabs for HPV DNA testing.

      Specific Aim 2. Following HPV DNA screening using self-collected swabs, determine the
      percentage of these women who will attend the local clinic.

      Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the statistical correlation between HPV DNA testing of
      self-collected vaginal swabs and VIA (as all women in this pilot study will undergo VIA).

    <description>Women living in western Kenya will be asked to complete a self collected vaginal sample for HPV DNA screening and asked to undergo a second screening by VIA. As per Kenyan standard of care, vaccination against HPV will be offered to children/grandchildren (boys and girls) of women, and to the women themselves if age 26 or younger. The second vaccine dose (for children ages 9 through 14) and third doses (for children and adult women ages 15 through 26) will be administered at subsequent visits. There will be no requirement for HPV vaccination (of children or mothers up to 26 years of age) for participation in the study. Results of the screening will be returned to participants and they will be referred to receive standard care as applicable.</description>
