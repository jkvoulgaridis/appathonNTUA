  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) is the modality of choice to characterize pulmonary arteriovenous
      malformations (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The
      objective of this study was to determine if CT findings were associated with frequency of
      brain abscess and ischaemic stroke.

      This retrospective study included patients with HHT-related PAVMs. CT results, PAVM
      presentation (unique, multiple, disseminated or diffuse), the number of PAVMs and the largest
      feeding artery size, were correlated to prevalence of ischaemic stroke and brain abscess.

    <description>The presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) (unique, multiple, disseminated or diffuse, the number of PAVMs and the largest feeding artery size) upon examination by CT could be correlated to the frequency of brain abscess and ischemic stroke in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). These patients underwent a yearly CT scan to check for PAVM presence.</description>

    <description>Patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations (PAVMs). For all patients, the final diagnosis of certain HHT the diagnosis can be made depending on the presence of four criteria known as the Curaçao criteria: 1) Spontaneous recurrent epistaxis 2) Multiple telangiectasias in typical locations 3) Proven visceral Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) (lung, liver, brain, spine) 4) First-degree family member with HHT. If conditions three or four are met, a patient has &quot;definite HHT&quot;, while condition two is considered as &quot;possible HHT&quot;. All patients had a molecular diagnosis and all follow-up clinical assessments were available in the database.</description>
