      This study is a pragmatic assessor blinded randomized and prospective clinical trial in which
      standard intramedullary nailing is compared with external ring fixator for patients with
      tibial shaft fractures.

      The primary aim of the project is to compare the one-year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score - Sport (KOOS-Sport) after standard intramedullary nailing with external ring
      fixation for patients with tibial shaft fractures.

      The explorative aim is to report the effect of the two surgical procedures on the development
      of complications, time to bone union, pain reactions, muscle strength, activity of daily
      living and time to return to work.

    <description>Intramedullary Nailing: Alignment will be obtained by closed or limited open reduction of the fracture. A standard reamed intramedullary nail is inserted. Access through the patella tendon or parapatellar access is used according to surgeon preferences. One or more cortical screws may be used if deemed appropriate due to fracture pattern. Patients are administered preoperative antibiotics (Dicloxacillin) 15 minutes before surgery commences. Postoperative antibiotics is administered by discretion of the surgeon based on individual patient considerations.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>External Ring fixation: Closed or limited open reduction of the fracture is performed. A circular frame is attached on both sides of the fracture. Connection to the bone is obtained by hydroxyapatite coated half pins and/or k-wires with olives as needed according to surgeon preferences. One or more cortical screws may be used if deemed appropriate due to fracture pattern. After applying the ring fixator alignment is assessed radiologically and corrected both peri- and postoperatively. Patients are administered preoperative antibiotics (Dicloxacillin) preoperatively 15 minutes before surgery commences. Following surgery antibiotics are continued until wounds, pin- and wire perforations are dry.</description>
