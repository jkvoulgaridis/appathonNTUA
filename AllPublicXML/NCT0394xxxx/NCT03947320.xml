  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter phase III uncontrolled open-label trial to evaluate the
      efficacy,safety and pharmacokinetics of SCT800 in regular prophylaxis and perioperative
      treatment in patients (＜12 years old) with severe hemophilia A who have been previously
      treated with coagulation factor VIII(FVIII) . This study includes two phases: the screening
      period and prophylaxis period.Prophylaxis with 25 - 50 IU/kg of SCT800 shall be administered
      once every other day or three times per week starting from Visit 1 and prophylaxis with
      SCT800 shall continue for 24 consecutive weeks.
