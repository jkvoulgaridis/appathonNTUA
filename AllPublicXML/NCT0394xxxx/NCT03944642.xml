    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to design and pilot the effect of a complex intervention to support
      mothers' breastfeeding self-efficacy and professional self-efficacy to support breastfeeding
      families, considering breastfeeding as a health promoting behavior. Specific objectives are
      the evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and estimate the
      preliminary effect on maternal and professional self-efficacy.

    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is the optimal feeding during early childhood. However, the prevalence of
      exclusive breastfeeding is not as expected. The evidence of effectiveness of interventions
      designed to support breastfeeding is not conclusive. Breastfeeding is a complex experience,
      influenced by numerous factors, as self-efficacy, that require interdisciplinary
      approaches.The aim of the study is to design and pilot the effect of a complex intervention
      to support mothers' breastfeeding self-efficacy and professional self-efficacy to support
      breastfeeding families, considering breastfeeding as a health promoting behavior. The project
      will be done in two stages a) design of the intervention and b) experimental pilot trial with
      control and intervention groups, for evaluation of feasibility, acceptability of the
      intervention and preliminary estimate of its effect on maternal and professional
      self-efficacy. The project will be carry out in two public outpatient clinics (Centro de
      Salud Familiar Alberto Hurtado y Centro de Salud Familiar Juan Pablo II) in Santiago, Chile.
      Participants will be breastfeeding women and their partner/family member; and health
      professionals who provide care to mother and child. Intervention group will receive a
      breastfeeding workshop during the third trimester of pregnancy and on-line breastfeeding
      support during the first 6 months postpartum. Health professionals will be train to deliver
      the intervention.Control group will receive the standard care as provided in the outpatient
      clinic.

    <measure>Mothers self-efficacy: spanish validated version of Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>At five points: week 28 - 40 pregnancy (T1); and 10 days (T2); 2 months (T3); 4 months (T4); and 6 months (T5) after birth</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy using the Spanish validated version of Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF). BSES-SF is a 14 item, unidimensional, self-report instrument developed to measure a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed. All items are presented with a 5-point Likert-type scale where 1 indicates &quot;not at all confident&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;always confident&quot; (scores: minimum 14 and maximum 70). Higher scores indicate higher levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Professionals self-efficacy in relation to their ability to support breastfeeding mothers: APCLA Scale (Professional Self Efficacy for Breastfeeding Care Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>At three points: before professional training (the same day that the intervention begins) (T1); 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) after the beginning of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on professional self-efficacy in relation to their ability to support breastfeeding mothers using the Professional Self Efficacy for Breastfeeding Care Scale (Autoeficacia Profesional para los Cuidados en Lactancia, APCLA). APCLA scale is a 14 item, unidimensional, self-report instrument developed to measure a professional's confidence in her/his ability to support a breastfeeding mother. All items are presented with a 5-point Likert-type scale where 1 indicates &quot;not at all confident&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;always confident&quot; (scores: minimum 14 and maximum 70). Higher scores indicate higher levels of breastfeeding support self-efficacy. This scale was constructed and validated in Spanish based on the Spanish version of BSES-SF</description>

    <description>Changes on perceived participation in decision making related to the child's type of feeding, using the Spanish validated version of CollaboRate. It is a short and self-applying generic instrument that allows measuring user participation in a particular health decision (Cronbach's alpha&gt; 0.89). It consists of three questions with alternative answers with a likert scale of 1 to 7. In this project, both the mothers and the partner /relative will be asked about their participation in the decision to feed the child. The version that will be used is validated in Chilean population (CollaboRate Chile)</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the standard prenatal care and invited to participate of a breastfeeding workshop during the third trimester of pregnancy, with active and intentional participation of the pregnant woman and her partner/relative; based on adult education methodology. In addition, women participants will have continuous support during their breastfeeding process, up to 6 months of the child's life, through a virtual support group (whats-app), where they will receive messages that promote their self-efficacy in relation to their ability to breastfeed and may ask questions that are related to breastfeeding. Professionals in this group will be train before delivering the intervention.</description>
