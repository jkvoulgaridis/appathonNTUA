  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two versions of an intervention focused on teaching
      10-14-year-old Latina/o adolescent's skills that will decrease the likelihood that they will
      use tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. We are also interested in determining how cultural
      context is related to substance use and whether additional information about other tobacco
      products should be added to the GMIT intervention.

      All adolescents will receive the Group Motivational Interviewing for Teens (GMIT)
      intervention. GMIT is an evidence-based group intervention that has been shown to prevent
      substance use among adolescents. In this project, GMIT will be delivered virtually in a group
      setting to multiple Latina/o adolescents. In addition, some parents will virtually
      participate in a parent-only support group; the other parents will not participate in any
      group.

      In this study, participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive one
      of two versions of an alcohol, drug, and tobacco program. As part of the program teen
      participants will virtually attend six 30-min intervention sessions with other teens. Parents
      may also participate in virtual group sessions. Participants will be asked on three separate
      occasions (before, immediately after, and 3 months after the sessions) to complete forms
      (phone/online) that ask questions about teens behavior at home, school, and in the community.
