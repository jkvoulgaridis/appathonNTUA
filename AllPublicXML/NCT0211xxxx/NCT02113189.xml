      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a specifically designed leg brace
      on walking endurance in individuals with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, repeated measures, matched group study. There will be three groups of
      participants, 20 participants per group, 60 participants total. Group one (G1) will receive
      custom-fabricated bilateral braces and a standardized home walking/exercise program. Group
      two (G2) will receive an off-the shelf ankle support and standardized home walking/exercise
      program. Group three (G3) will receive the standardized walking/exercise program without any
      brace or AFO. Subjects will be randomized upon enrollment in the study. Subjects will be
      followed for one year during this study and outcome measures will be collected 3 times over
      the course of the study. Subjects will be seen every 6 months for the duration of the study
      for testing as well as for other visits as noted in the table below.
