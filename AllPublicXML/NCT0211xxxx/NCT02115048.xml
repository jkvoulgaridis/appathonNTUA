      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of treatment with afatinib plus letrozole
      to treatment with letrozole alone in women diagnosed with a specific type of breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, international, randomized, Phase II clinical trial that
      will assess the efficacy and safety of letrozole in combination with afatinib(oral epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR ) inhibitor) versus letrozole monotherapy for the first-line
      treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)
      negative advanced breast cancer with low ER expression.

      In order to assess the level of estrogen receptor (ER) expression we will use a
      semi-quantitative scoring system (McClelland, 1990) defined as :

      H-score = (% of cells stained at intensity category 1x1) + (% of cells stained at intensity
      category 2x2) + (% of cells stained at intensity category 3x3).

      This formula results in an H-score in the range of 0-300 where 300 equals 100% of tumor cells
      stained strongly (i.e., 3+). Low ER expression will be defined as tumor sample with H-score
      below 160 (Finn, 2009).

      All subjects who consented for the study must submit a tumor sample to the designated central
      laboratory for central confirmation of ER / Progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 statuses and
      determination of the H-score. This will be assessed prior to randomization.

      Subjects with HER2 negative, ER+ advanced breast cancer with low ER expression defined as
      H-score between 1 and 159 will enter screening phase and perform the required screening
      assessments.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to sites
      of disease (bone only disease vs. other) and prior administration of hormonal therapy in
      neo/adjuvant setting (Yes vs. No) to either:

      Arm A : Continuous regimen of oral letrozole 2.5 mg until progression of disease or any other
      study treatment discontinuation criteria.

      or Arm B : Continuous regimen of oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral afatinib 30 mg daily
      until progression of disease or any other study treatment discontinuation criteria.

      IN ADDITION the following applies whichever comes first:

        -  If the patients treated with the combination of afatinib and letrozole (arm B)
           discontinue the trial treatment (whatever the reason) before 30 November 2018, the
           patients from the other arm (arm A, letrozole alone) still on treatment will also be
           discontinued from the trial at the same time. They may continue receiving letrozole
           using commercial drug as standard of care according to their treating physician
           discretion.

        -  If the patients treated with afatinib and letrozole (arm B) have not discontinued the
           trial treatment by 30 November 2018, all patients currently on treatment in the trial
           (including the ones only treated by letrozole alone (arm A)) will be discontinued from
           the trial at that time. They may continue receiving their treatment if in alignment with
           their treating physician judgment as follows:

        -  Patients in arm A: may continue receiving letrozole using commercial drug as standard of
           care according to their treating physician discretion.

        -  Patients in arm B: may continue receiving afatinib in the context of alternative drug
           supply outside the clinical trial as appropriate according to local legislation.
           Additionally, they may continue receiving letrozole using commercial drug as standard of
           care according to their treating physician discretion.

      Once the patient is discontinued from trial treatment and has undergone the End of Treatment
      Visit, she will be permanently discontinued from the trial and treated as per local clinical
      practice.

    <time_frame>Tumor assessments were every 12 weeks up to 9 months (average) for subjects in Arm A or up to 14 months (average) for subjects in Arm B.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization until date of progression (assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors - RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For evaluation of PFS, the randomization date for each patient was the &quot;start date&quot;. If the status at the last assessment date was &quot;Non-complete response/ Non-progressive disease&quot; or &quot;Complete response&quot;, then the patient was considered &quot;censored&quot;. If the status at the last assessment for any tumor was &quot;Progressive disease&quot;, then the patient was considered as having an event.
Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1 .1 as a â‰¥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest-sum longest diameter recorded or the appearance of one or more target or non-target new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Under treatment: every 4 wks up to 9 months (average) for subject in the Arm A or up to 14 months (average) for subjects in Arm B. After documentation of disease progression up to the end of the study: every 6 months up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival is defined as the time from randomization until death to any cause.
For subjects in which treatment is discontinued for reasons different than Progression Disease: after treatment and up to documentation of disease progression: Overall Survival is assessed every 12 weeks</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor assessment: every 12 weeks up to 9 months (average) for subjects in Arm A or up to 14 months (average) for subjects in Arm B.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of randomized subjects achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). As per RECIST (version 1.1):
CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non target lesions - lymph node (LN) &lt;10mm.
PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the Sum of Diameters, taking as reference the Baseline Sum of Diameters</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Under treatment: every 4 wks up to 9 months (average) for subjects in Arm A or up to 14 months (average) for subjects in Arm B. After documentation of disease progression up to the end of the study: every 6 months up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who experienced at least one Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) are presented. Participants with at least one serious TEAE, those who had at least one TEAE related to letrozole or afatinib (serious/non-serious), including participants who experienced a grade 3/4 TEAE, or who discontinued/died as a result of their TEAE are listed by treatment arm. Adverse events were tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and toxicity grade by treatment arm. For subjects in which treatment was discontinued for reasons different than progression of disease, the assessment was conducted every 12 weeks following treatment, and up to documentation of disease progression.
** Enrollment was closed prematurely due to low recruitment (only 44 participants enrolled) compared to what was initially planned (150 participants), therefore no statistical evaluations were completed. Adverse event data collected are described per arm but no statistical comparison was made.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>For all patients consented on the trial, a tumor sample was sent to the central lab for testing of ER/PR and HER2 and determination of the H-score. This was assessed prior to randomization. Patients with HER2 negative, ER+ advanced breast cancer with low ER expression defined as H-score between 1 and 159 entered screening phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>ECOG Performance Status</title>
          <description>The ECOG Scale of Performance Status is a measurement used to describe a patientâ€™s level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.).
Patients with ECOG 0 are in better general condition than patients with ECOG 1:
0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction.
1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization until date of progression (assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors - RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For evaluation of PFS, the randomization date for each patient was the &quot;start date&quot;. If the status at the last assessment date was &quot;Non-complete response/ Non-progressive disease&quot; or &quot;Complete response&quot;, then the patient was considered &quot;censored&quot;. If the status at the last assessment for any tumor was &quot;Progressive disease&quot;, then the patient was considered as having an event.
Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1 .1 as a â‰¥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest-sum longest diameter recorded or the appearance of one or more target or non-target new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Tumor assessments were every 12 weeks up to 9 months (average) for subjects in Arm A or up to 14 months (average) for subjects in Arm B.</time_frame>
        <population>The timeframe specifies when tumor assessments were performed. Enrollment was closed prematurely due to low recruitment (only 44 participants enrolled) compared to what was initially planned (150 participants), therefore no statistical evaluations were completed (including PFS).</population>

Participants with at least one serious TEAE, those who had at least one TEAE related to letrozole or afatinib (serious/non-serious), including participants who experienced a grade 3/4 TEAE, or who discontinued/died as a result of their TEAE are listed by treatment arm. Adverse events were tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and toxicity grade by treatment arm. For subjects in which treatment was discontinued for reasons different than progression of disease, the assessment was conducted every 12 weeks following treatment, and up to documentation of disease progression.

          <description>Participants who experienced at least one Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) are presented. Participants with at least one serious TEAE, those who had at least one TEAE related to letrozole or afatinib (serious/non-serious), including participants who experienced a grade 3/4 TEAE, or who discontinued/died as a result of their TEAE are listed by treatment arm. Adverse events were tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and toxicity grade by treatment arm. For subjects in which treatment was discontinued for reasons different than progression of disease, the assessment was conducted every 12 weeks following treatment, and up to documentation of disease progression.
