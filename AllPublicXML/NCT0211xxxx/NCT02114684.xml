    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial comparing two regimens for
      treatment of smear-positive pulmonary TB, among patients previously treated for TB. The
      primary objective is to determine if a moxifloxacin-containing regimen, substituting
      moxifloxacin for ethambutol, of 24 weeks duration is superior to a control regimen of 24
      weeks duration in improving treatment outcomes in patients with recurrent TB and shortens the
      duration of TB treatment.

Participants in the moxifloxacin arm received daily 400 mg of moxifloxacin (Avelox®, Bayer Healthcare), weight-based rifampicin at 450 or 600 mg, and 225 or 300 mg of isoniazid, for participants 38–54 and ≥55 kg, respectively, during the 2-month intensive phase and 4-month continuation phase of TB treatment. During the intensive phase of treatment, pyrazinamide was used at 1500 and 2000mg in participants between 38–54 and ≥55 kg, respectively.</description>
