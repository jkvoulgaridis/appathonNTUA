  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the Hospital for Special Surgery are trying to learn more about post-operative
      rheumatoid arthritis flare (RA). This study hopes to understand RA flare after total joint
      replacement surgery and what the result of flaring is for patients over the 6 weeks post
      operation.

      Through this study we aim to describe rates, characteristics, and risk factors of RA flare
      within 6 weeks of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The condition to be studied is worsening (flare) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who
      have undergone arthroplasty. RA patients were recruited prior to elective THA and TKA and
      prospectively followed. Clinicians evaluated RA clinical characteristics 0-2 weeks before and
      6 weeks post surgery. Patients answered questions regarding disease activity including
      self-reported joint counts and flare status weekly for 6 weeks.

      During surgery, the subjects' surgeon will take samples of the tissue removed as part of
      their surgery from their joint. Specifically for Total Hip Replacement (THR), the femoral
      head will be collected intraoperatively from standardized anatomic sites, (fovea and capsular
      reflection). For Total Knee replacement (TKR), tissue samples of the patella cartilage,
      distal femur and proximal tibia, and synovium from the suprapatellar pouch will be collected
      intraoperatively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;18

          2. Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis undergoing total joint replacement surgery

          3. Satisfy American College of Rheumatology(ACR)/European League Against
             Rheumatism(EULAR) 2010 classification criteria and/or the 1987 RA criteria (see below)
             and be diagnosed with RA

          4. For control subjects: Have OA(Osteoarthritis), SLE(Systemic lupus erythematosus) or
             other inflammatory arthritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of any other systemic rheumatic disease

          2. Diagnosis of or crystalline arthropathy.

          3. Unable to understand or read English.

          4. Unable to follow the study protocol in a reliable manner.

          5. Age &lt; 18 or &gt;75.

        EXPLANATION OF CRITERIA:

        Rheumatoid arthritis 1987 criteria:

          1. morning stiffness in and around joints lasting at least 1 hour before maximal
             improvement;

          2. soft tissue swelling (arthritis) of 3 or more joint areas observed by a physician;

          3. swelling (arthritis) of the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, or wrist
             joints;

          4. symmetric swelling (arthritis);

          5. rheumatoid nodules;

          6. the presence of rheumatoid factor; and

          7. radiographic erosions and/or periarticular osteopenia in hand and/or wrist joints.

               -  Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6 weeks. Rheumatoid
                  arthritis is defined by the presence of 4 or more criteria, and no further
                  qualifications (classic, definite, or probable) or list of exclusions are
                  required.

        ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria for the classification of RA:

        Table 3. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism
        classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis

        Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who

          1. have at least 1 joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)*

          2. with the synovitis not better explained by another disease

        Classification criteria for RA (score-based algorithm: add score of categories A-D;

        a score of â‰¥6/10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite RA

        Score

        A. Joint involvement

        1 large joint 0

        2-10 large joints 1

        1-3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 2

        4-10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 3

        &gt;10 joints (at least 1 small joint) 5

        B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)

        Negative RF and negative ACPA 0

        Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA 2

        High-positive RF or high-positive ACPA 3

        C. Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)

        Normal CRP and normal ESR 0

        Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR 1

        D. Duration of symptoms

        &lt; 6 weeks 0

          -  6 weeks 1

               -  The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In
                  addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with
                  a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be
                  classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those
                  whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on
                  retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria
                  should be classified as having RA.
