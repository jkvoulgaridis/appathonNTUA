  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Scrambler Therapy with the Calmare MC5-A machine will
      relieve chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      Scrambler Therapy is a method of pain relief given with common electrocardiography (ECG) skin
      electrodes. The electrodes are placed on the body in pairs, and the Scrambler Therapy machine
      directs electrical signals across the field to simulate non-pain information.

      Based on other studies, we think that we relieve pain with the Scrambler therapy device, but
      it has not been tested in a setting such as this one. This means that some of the pain relief
      could be due to placebo effect, or the CIPN pain going away on its own. In this study we want
      to compare the Scrambler Therapy with the sham therapy (the therapy that does not use the
      electrical signals). We hope that this study will help us determine if the Scrambler device
      really helps patients with CIPN.

      Cancer patients with chronic, chemotherapy-related pain of 4 or more (on a 0-10 scale) for at
      least 3 months may be eligible to join this study.

    <description>To determine the change in pain from day 0 to day 28 (as measured by the Modified Brief Pain Index (BPI), question #3) with scrambler therapy in patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and pain (CIPN). The BPI short form is a pain assessment tool used with cancer patients to measure both severity of pain and interference caused by pain on 0-10 scales with higher scores indicating more pain. A negative score for the change in pain indicates improvement.</description>

          -  Currently receiving anti-convulsants (such as gabapentinoids, e.g. gabapentin
             (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica). Because of data that support that patients do not
             do as well when on gabapentin or pregabalin, all patients on these medications will be
             weaned off them prior to study initiation. The study team will provide instructions on

          <description>The device is a cutaneous electrical stimulator that uses electrodes placed on the skin similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine, feeling similar to a tingling or bee-sting like sensation during the therapy. The electrodes are placed in areas thought to help relieve pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

        <title>Changes in Patient Reported Motor Outcomes at 3 Months</title>
        <description>This will be assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CIPN20, a CIPN-specific questionnaire which includes two scales assessing sensory and motor symptoms and functioning with each question measured on a 0-3 scale. For motor there are 8 questions with a total score range from 0-24 with higher scores indicating more bothersome symptoms. A negative change in score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

            <description>The device is a cutaneous electrical stimulator that uses electrodes placed on the skin similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine, feeling similar to a tingling or bee-sting like sensation during the therapy. The electrodes are placed in areas thought to help relieve pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
