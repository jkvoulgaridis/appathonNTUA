  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pharmacodynamic study with mandatory metastatic tumor biopsies in men
      with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      The trial will evaluate the effect of vismodegib on tumor tissue in men with metastatic CRPC
      by obtaining tumor biopsies at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with vismodegib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 10 evaluable patients. Patients will receive a 30-day supply of 150 mg
      of vismodegib on day one of each cycle daily by mouth, beginning on Day 1, and continuously
      until one of the following occurs: Disease progression, intolerable toxicity most probably
      attributable to vismodegib or withdrawal from the study.

      Tumor biopsies (nodal or visceral), skin biopsies, and CTCs will be obtained at baseline and
      after 4 weeks of treatment. PSA evaluations will be conducted every 4 weeks, imaging
      assessments (CT and Bone scan) will be conducted every 12 weeks and routine labs (blood
      counts and chemistry panel) will be conducted every 4 weeks.

      The investigator's intent is to examine the fold change in GLI1 expression in each man
      following exposure to drug (comparing pre-treatment and on-treatment core biopsy samples). As
      secondary endpoints, the investigator will also explore clinical response (PSA responses,
      progression-free survival [PFS], radiographic responses), safety, and will examine changes
      from baseline in Gli2, PTCH1, and AKT1 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR, in situ GLI1 expression in
      tissue sections by mRNA in situ hybridization, and GLI1 expression in isolated circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs).

    <description>The primary endpoint is the proportion of mCRPC patients treated with vismodegib who achieve a pharmacodynamic (PD) response in tumor biopsies, defined as both a decrease in GLI1 mRNA greater than 1.2 times the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline values and a ≥50% (≥2-fold) reduction in GLI1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in metastatic tumor biopsies after 4 weeks of treatment when comparing post-treatment biopsy to pre-treatment biopsy in the same patient.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria using RECIST 1.1 criteria for each patient. PFS is defined as the time of first dose (a) until prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression (by 25% increase in PSA from nadir) or death and (b) until any evidence of progression (by 25% increase in PSA from nadir, a new lesion on bone or CT scan, or physical examination) or death. PFS will be assigned to the earliest observed time.</description>
