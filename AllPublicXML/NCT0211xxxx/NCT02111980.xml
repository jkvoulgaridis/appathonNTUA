  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If a surgical sponge is mistakenly left inside a patient's body after a surgical procedure,
      it can cause a serious infection. To prevent this from happening, a new device has been
      developed that uses radiofrequency (RF) signals to detect the presence of surgical sponges
      inside the body. The device is now being used routinely to make sure that no sponges are left
      inside a patient at the end of an operation. However, the RF device has not been implemented
      in procedures for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). While the
      device is FDA approved for use, there is a theoretical concern that the radiofrequency
      signals used to detect the sponges will change the settings on the pacemaker or the
      defibrillator. Changing the settings on a pacemaker might make it pace the heart too quickly
      or too slowly, while changing the settings on a defibrillator might cause unnecessary shocks
      or prevent it from shocking the heart if the patient were to have cardiac arrest.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether the radiofrequency device used to detect sponges
      can cause a clinically significant change to the settings on pacemakers and defibrillators.
      To minimize potential risk, the device will be tested only on patients who are having the
      pacemaker or defibrillator removed or replaced as part of their regular medical care, either
      because it is infected or because the battery has worn out. Before the pacemaker or
      defibrillator is removed, the settings will be carefully and completely recorded and the
      radiofrequency device will be used to scan the body for sponges as it would be done during
      normal operation.

      After the pacemaker or defibrillator is taken out, the settings will again be recorded and
      compared to the settings before the scan. In a standard device removal procedure, no
      clinically significant change in CIED settings would be expected. If a new pacemaker or
      defibrillator is implanted in the patient, it will not be exposed to the detection device at
      all. We will also test whether the RF device has any effect on temporary pacemakers that
      patients may receive after open heart surgery. We plan to perform testing in a total of 50
      patients, 40 with permanent pacemakers or defibrillators and 10 with temporary pacemakers.

      Retained surgical items (e.g., sponges, needles, and instruments) are among the most
      frequently reported medical errors and occur in an estimated 1 in 5000 operations. A retained
      surgical item frequently causes a serious negative outcome, including re-operation (70-80% of
      cases), readmission or prolonged hospital stay (30-60% of cases), sepsis (43% of cases), or
      death (2% of cases). Retained surgical items are classed as &quot;never events&quot; by the Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and CMS does not reimburse for additional medical care
      related to the treatment for such a complication.

      Sponges are by far the most common retained items and are estimated to account for 50-70% of
      cases. The standard method to ensure that no sponge is left inside the body is manual
      counting. Manual counting, however, carries a sensitivity and specificity of only about 77%
      and 99%, respectively. In one study 62% of retained items were detected after the count was
      reported as normal. If the manual count suggests that a sponge has been retained, the
      standard method to detect it is by taking a radiograph. Radiographs, however, are
      time-consuming and in one large retrospective study failed to detect retained items in 33% of
      cases. The standard methods of detecting retained surgical sponges are clearly suboptimal.

      Radiofrequency (RF) technology has recently been employed to improve the detection of
      retained surgical sponges. A radiofrequency chip is sewn into the fabric of the sponge, and a
      circular wand that emits a radiofrequency signal is passed over the patient. The wand also
      serves as an antenna that detects a return signal from the chip in the sponge. If a chip is
      detected it triggers an audio and a visual alarm on a console attached to the wand. In a
      study involving 210 patients, RF detection systems had 100% sensitivity and specificity for
      detecting retained sponges, even in morbidly obese patients. To minimize human error during
      the scanning process, a new system has been developed where the patient lies on a mat that
      emits the RF signal and serves as the antenna. In a separate study involving 203 patients,
      the system using the RF mat had a sensitivity and specificity of 98.5% and 100% respectively.
      To carry out these studies, sponges were placed underneath patients in a blinded manner.
      Although it would seem that RF detection systems are superior to manual counting, it should
      be emphasized that an RF detection system is not a substitute for manual counting, but rather
      an adjunct to manual counting. The RF Assure ® Detection System manufactured by RF Surgical
      System Inc. is now routinely used to detect retained sponges in the operating rooms at the
      University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and at ~200 other hospitals.

      There has been some concern that the radio frequency signals emitted by the RF Assure® device
      might reprogram the settings on CIED such as pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators
      (ICDs), since CIEDs are commonly programmed remotely using RF signals. For this reason, the
      technology is not commonly used in surgeries with patients with CIEDs. In vitro testing was
      done in a controlled setting to assess the compatibility of the RF Surgical Detection
      Technology with permanent pacemakers and ICDs as well as temporary pacemakers, specifically
      the Boston Scientific Cognis, St. Jude Medical Promote, and Medtronic Virtuoso devices,
      finding no interference between the RF Assure® system and these devices. Although anecdotal
      experience and in vitro testing has indicated that the RF Assure® system does not affect
      CIEDs, it has not been established whether the RF Assure® system is suitable to use in
      patients with CIEDs in a clinical setting. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      the RF Assure® device actually can reprogram CIEDs or cause them to malfunction when used in
      routine clinical practice. This question is of particular importance because of the rising
      number of surgical patients, especially cardiac patients, that have an implanted CIED.

        <title>Pacing Mode Changes Between Permanent Pacemakers (PPMs)/Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators (ICDs) Scanned With RF Assure</title>
        <description>The Pacing Mode on the CIED was measured prior to RF scanning (with sponge) and after the scanning (after sponge removal) in order to evaluate if any significant changes in the pacing mode setting resulted. The following CIED modes were evaluated: DDD (dual chamber pacing, sensing, triggered and inhibited mode), VVI (ventricular pacing, sensing, and inhibited mode), DDI (dual pacing, sensing, and inhibited mode), AAI (atrial pacing, sensing, and inhibited mode). The number of patients' device mode switched between these settings was tabulated and is shown in the below table. Multiple post-scan assessments were not made.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 15 minutes</time_frame>
        <population>The PTE participants were not included in this analysis because temporary devices do not have capabilities for interrogation (ie: recording pacing mode changes).</population>

            <description>The patient's CIED was interrogated prior to the study to obtain a baseline reading. The patient was asked to lie down on the RF Assure® Detection Mat with a sponge placed underneath his or her shoulder. The RF Assure® mat and wand were activated to detect the sponge. The sponge was removed, and the RF system was re-activated to obtain a clear reading. The patient's CIED was re-interrogated to determine if the RF Assure system caused any changes to the CIED parameters or function.
RF Assure Scanning: CIED and temporary pacemaker patients were scanned with RF surgical sponge detection wand and mat as well as with and without the RF sponge. The scanning was be conducted on the device scheduled for removal. Patients had device interrogated before and after scanning (for CIEDs) to determine if there were any clinically significant changes in programming or settings due to scanning with RF technology. Vitals were monitored and recorded before, during, and after scanning.</description>

The patient was asked to lie down on the RF Assure® Detection Mat with a sponge placed underneath his or her shoulder. The RF Assure® mat and wand were activated to detect the sponge. The sponge was removed, and the RF system was re-activated to obtain a clear reading. The patient's CIED was re-interrogated to determine if the RF Assure system caused any changes to the CIED parameters or function.
RF Assure Scanning: CIED and temporary pacemaker patients were scanned with RF surgical sponge detection wand and mat as well as with and without the RF sponge. The scanning was be conducted on the device scheduled for removal. Patients had device interrogated before and after scanning (for CIEDs) to determine if there were any clinically significant changes in programming or settings due to scanning with RF technology. Vitals were monitored and recorded before, during, and after scanning.</description>
