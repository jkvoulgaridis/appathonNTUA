      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a new telephone counseling
      program for employed Veterans with depression called the Veterans Work and Health Initiative
      (V-WHI) using the Be Well at Work (BWAW) intervention. 250 participants will be recruited and
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: the V-WHI experimental group or usual mental health
      care. The V-WHI counselors will address mental health and job-related issues that interfere
      with working. This counseling is provided solely over the phone with sessions every 2 weeks
      for 4 months (eight sessions total). At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI group is provided
      with a booster session. Participants in both groups are administered follow-up questionnaires
      at two time-points: month four and month nine.

      With the goal of helping employed Veterans with depression to participate fully in the labor
      market, this randomized controlled trial has two objectives: 1) test the effectiveness of a
      new evidence-based, vocationally-focused telephonic counseling program for employed Veterans
      with depression, the Veterans Work and Health Initiative (V-WHI), which was developed by this
      study's research partners from the Tufts Medical Center; and 2) if the V-WHI is effective,
      quantify its return on investment. This study will test the impact of the BWAW intervention
      in combination with the Philadelphia VA's Primary Care Mental Health Integration program, the
      Behavioral Health Lab (BHL).

      For the main hypothesis, concerning the effect of BWAW, the primary endpoint is the
      post-intervention at-work mean productivity loss score based on the validated Work Limitation
      Questionnaire (WLQ) adjusted for baseline score. For Hypothesis 2, concerning maintenance of
      post-intervention effects at nine months, the primary outcome is the mean difference of the
      change in productivity loss score. For hypothesis 3, the primary outcome was the return on
      investment (ROI) from BWAW.

      After informed consent and eligibility screening, subjects are randomized to one of two
      groups: the V-WHI intervention group or to the usual care group (BHL). 250 employed Veterans
      with depression and work limitations will be enrolled (half per group). The &quot;usual care&quot;
      group participants are assigned to standard behavioral health care. The second group,
      assigned to BWAW intervention, is the experimental group. Participants in this group are
      assigned to an innovative program designed explicitly to address mental health and vocational
      issues that interfere with working in addition to standard care. V-WHI counselors offer work
      coaching and modification strategies and work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
      This counseling is provided solely over the phone with sessions every 2 weeks for 4 months
      (eight sessions total). At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI group is provided with a booster
      session. Participants in both groups are administered follow-up questionnaires at two
      time-points: month four (post-intervention) and month nine.

    <measure>The Outcome is the Return on Investment (ROI) Obtained From Implementing the V-WHI Experimental Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is defined as: [marginal benefit on patient work productivity attributable to the V-WHI intervention] - [marginal cost of supplementing IC with V-WHI) / [marginal cost of supplementing IC with V-WHI]. The comparison assessed the monetized value of the difference in pre to post treatment changes in at-work productivity loss (presenteeism) + the monetized value of the difference in the changes in productivity loss due to work absences. Because both productivity loss components were measured at baseline and two follow-ups, the changes between time points (baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 8/9) were first averaged before computing their difference.
The marginal costs attributable to V-WHI included the full costs of the providing the counseling treatment and supervision of the counselors.</description>

        <description>This variable is defined as: [marginal benefit on patient work productivity attributable to the V-WHI intervention] - [marginal cost of supplementing IC with V-WHI) / [marginal cost of supplementing IC with V-WHI]. The comparison assessed the monetized value of the difference in pre to post treatment changes in at-work productivity loss (presenteeism) + the monetized value of the difference in the changes in productivity loss due to work absences. Because both productivity loss components were measured at baseline and two follow-ups, the changes between time points (baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 8/9) were first averaged before computing their difference.
The marginal costs attributable to V-WHI included the full costs of the providing the counseling treatment and supervision of the counselors.</description>
