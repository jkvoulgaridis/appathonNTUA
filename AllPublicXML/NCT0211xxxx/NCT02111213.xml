      The primary aim of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based
      'virtual lay advisor' intervention relative to a proven human lay advisor/promotore
      intervention to promote regular walking among inactive midlife and older Latino adults. The
      primary analysis is a non-inferiority analysis comparing these two interventions.

      COMPASS (Computerized Physical Activity Support for Seniors) was a single-blind,
      cluster-randomized noninferiority parallel trial conducted by investigators from Stanford
      University School of Medicine and Northeastern University. Participants were recruited from
      community centers in Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties, CA which had been randomized in
      pairs based on locale to either Virtual or Human advisors. Allocation concealment was
      accomplished by utilizing staff not directly involved in study enrollment, assessment, or
      intervention procedures. Both arms received a similar 12-month behavioral PA
      instruction/support program at their designated community center based on Active Choices—an
      individually-tailored PA intervention with demonstrated effectiveness and translatability
      across diverse adult populations. The primary outcome was change in 12-month weekly walking
      minutes.

      In addition to the major trial and primary investigation described above, an exploratory
      Substudy was conducted separately to begin to evaluate the initial &quot;proof of concept&quot; of a
      food literacy curriculum in 2 separate community centers that were not part of the major
      trial. This first-generation exploratory Substudy is not part of the major trial and
      therefore is not included in this protocol and trial description.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spanish or English-speaking primarily Latino men or women

          -  Aged greater than or equal to 50 years

          -  No plans to move within the next year

          -  Inactive (have not engaged in moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity

          -  &gt; 3 days per week for at least 20 min per day) within last 6 months

          -  Able to participate in study intervention and assessments at their local neighborhood
             senior center

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical condition or disorder that would limit participation in moderate intensity
             physical activity (such as sustained walking), including life-threatening disorders,
             myocardial ischemia, major functional disabilities in the orthopedic area, or
             inability to complete baseline assessments for any reason (including psychological,
             cognitive);

          2. Not stable on their medications, including hormone replacement therapy, for ≥ 3 months
             (given that changes in medications can create additional stress and burden over and
             above attempts to change lifestyle behaviors);

          3. Inability to complete a face-to-face training session with a computer-based program
