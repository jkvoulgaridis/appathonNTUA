  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, extension study of LUM001 in children diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome
      who have completed participation in a core LUM001 treatment protocol. The primary objective
      is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of LUM001. Efficacy will be assessed by
      evaluating the effect of LUM001 on the biochemical markers and pruritus associated with
      Alagille Syndrome.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Xanthomas as Measured by Clinician Xanthoma Scale Associated with ALGS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, EOT/Week 216</time_frame>
    <description>The clinician's assessment of the participant's xanthomatosis is focused on the number of lesions present and the degree to which the participant's lesions interfere or limit his or her activities. The clinician xanthoma scale uses a 5-point scale, in which 0 represents no evidence of xanthomatosis, 1 represents fewer than 20 scattered individual lesions, 2 represents more than 20 lesions that do not interfere with or limit activities, 3 represents large numbers of lesions that by their large numbers or size cause distortion of the face or extremities, and 4 represents xanthomas that interfere with function (such as hand use or ability to walk) because of excess size or number.</description>

    <description>Participant will receive LUM001 as oral solution once daily based on participant's weight. The dose will be escalated from 14, 35, 70, 140 and 280 microgram per kilogram per day (mcg/kg/day) for 4-week dose escalation period. During 8-weeks of dose optimization period, drug will be adjusted in titrated manner and will continue dosing to complete the stable dosing and safety monitoring periods for up to 96 weeks of cumulative LUM001 exposure in this study. Dosing during, long-term optional follow-up treatment periods 1 and 2 will be maintained at the same dose levels as at weeks 96 and 144 for participants rolling over into these treatment periods respectively.</description>
