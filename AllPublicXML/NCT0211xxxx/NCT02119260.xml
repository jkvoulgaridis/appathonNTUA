  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2798745 in humans. This will be a sponsor
      un-blinded, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK2798745, given as single and repeat
      oral doses to healthy subjects and stable heart failure (HF) subjects. Approximately 28
      healthy subjects will be enrolled in the study cohorts (Cohort 1-3) involving single and
      repeat dose escalations of GSK2798745, while up to 24 stable heart failure subjects will be
      enrolled in Cohort 4 involving single and repeat dose administration of GSK2798745, with the
      dose selected based on data from healthy subject cohorts. This would be followed by
      enrollment of up to 8 subjects with heart failure in Cohort 5 involving repeat dose
      administration of GSK2798745. The study duration, including screening and follow-up, is not
      expected to exceed 17 weeks for subjects in the study (in any cohort).

    <description>Eight subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 placebo-controlled dose sequences with 2 subjects in each sequence and each subject having four dose periods (3 active dose of GSK2798745 + 1 placebo dose). GSK2798745 will be administered in a liquid form (suspension or solution) in this cohort. In each treatment period, the subjects will be fasting from the prior midnight to four hours post-dose (Day 1).</description>

The actual dose-selected will be determined based on review of emerging safety and exposure data from Cohort 1. The dosing will be done in 3 study periods for investigating bioavailability and food effects. In Period 1, subjects will be fasting from midnight to four hours post-dose and will receive GSK2798745 in a liquid form (suspension or solution). In Period 2, subjects will be fasting from midnight to four hours post-dose and will receive a capsule formulation of GSK2798745. In Period 3, subjects will receive GSK2798745 capsule following a standard high fat/high calorie meal.</description>

Food intake timing will be determined based on data from Cohorts 1 and 2 (if Cohort 2 is conducted before Cohort 3). Doses will be administered once daily from Day 1 through Day14. Based on data from Cohort 1, the second dose in the repeat-dose period may be skipped to estimate the time invariance in PK. Dosing may be altered to twice daily based on the results obtained in the initial study cohort. Subjects will be fasted from midnight to 4 hours after dosing on Day 1 and Day 14 that entail serial PK sampling. Meal timings on other days will be based on previous cohort data.</description>

An additional separate dose group of approximately 18 to 24 subjects may be randomized to GSK2798745 or placebo to gain additional safety, tolerability,pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information, if needed. The subjects will receive GSK2798745 in a single dose (at least the first 6 subjects) followed by a 7 -days repeat dose.

Subjects will receive GSK2798745 or placebo (based on randomization) for 7 days. The dose will be 2.4 mg utilizing the capsule formulation administered with or without food. Subjects will remain in house from Day -1 until Day 4 and be fitted with a remote monitoring device; Day 5, 6 and 8 visits will be in home (on Days 5 and 6, they will receive study medication, collect samples for pharmacokinetic analysis, and assess vital signs); and subjects will return to the clinic for Day 7 visit.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study is a placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single dose (SD) and repeat, ascending doses (RD) of GSK2798745 in healthy participants (par.) and stable heart failure par. This study was conducted at two centers in the United Kingdom</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Sixty one par. entered this 5-cohort study where Cohorts 1-3 were healthy par. and Cohorts 4 and 5 were par. with stable heart failure. Of those,1 par. was withdrawn pre-dose due to issues with ECG values. In Cohort 1 and 2, par. were randomized to sequence and in Cohorts 3, 4 and 5 par. were randomized to drug or placebo</pre_assignment_details>
