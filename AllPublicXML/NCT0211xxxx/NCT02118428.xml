    <time_frame>immediately post-blood product collection &amp; within 7 days before transfusion, post-Mirasol treatment (within 24 hours post-blood product collection) &amp; within 7 days before transfusion</time_frame>
    <description>Bacterial culture on blood products - products were collected within 7 days before transfusion to the study subject.
Control products were only sampled post-collection, so no results for post-Mirasol treatment.
All samples in Mirasol group that were positive post-collection became negative post-Mirasol treatment.
All samples in Mirasol group that were positive post-Mirasol treatment were negative post-collection. These samples were likely contaminated in the clinical laboratory after Mirasol treatment during sampling for culture.</description>

Sufficient power was nevertheless maintained.</limitations_and_caveats>
