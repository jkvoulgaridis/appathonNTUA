  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively investigate the longitudinal change of the
      components of the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) and the components (index
      scores) of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in
      asymptomatic at risk for Alzheimer's disease (ARAD) individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional study that will enroll participants without
      dementia who are considered at high, medium, and low risk for developing AD from a community
      based register (referred to as the CHARIOT registry) in the United Kingdom. Participants will
      undergo a series of neuropsychological evaluations to characterize the patterns of cognitive
      change and their inter-relationship in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. In
      addition, how such changes relate to the clinical presentation of cognitive impairment of the
      Alzheimer's type may be evaluated over time. The SubStudy will investigate the longitudinal
      change of components of the PACC and RBANS in ARAD individuals who have demonstrable amyloid
      in the brain by either PET or CSF compared with individuals not classified as ARAD. SubStudy
      participants will be followed every 6 months throughout the SubStudy and will alternate
      between completing the alternative forms of the PACC and RBANS for a period of up to 4.5
      years (54 months). Blood, urine, and saliva samples will be collected from participants
      during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk factors for dementia, Alzheimer's
      disease or confounding factors of dementia risk. Adverse events experienced by the
      participants during their participation in the study will be monitored.

    <measure>Main Study: Change From Baseline Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition will be evaluated at baseline and longitudinally with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB)-Executive Function module, NAB-Memory module, CogState Brief Battery (CBB), Clinical Drug Research Assessment System (CDR-AS), and Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS), as well as the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale.</description>

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline on Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) Component Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 42 (Year 3.5)</time_frame>
    <description>The PACC is a retrospectively validated measure that is weighted towards episodic memory, and also includes a timed executive function test and a global cognitive screening test. The PACC includes: 1. Total Recall score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test - Immediate Recall [FCSRT-IR] (0-48 words); 2. Delayed Paragraph Recall total score on single administration of the Logical Memory story from the Wechsler Memory Scale [WMS]-Revised (0-25 story units); 3. Digit Symbol Substitution Test score from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS]-Revised (0-135 symbols), and 4. MMSE score (0-30 points). The component scores are transformed using an established normalization method into z-scores. Each of the 4 component change scores is divided by the baseline sample standard deviation of that component. Z-score implies how many standard deviations higher or lower the score is compared with the baseline score.</description>

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline in RBANS Index Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 42 (Year 3.5)</time_frame>
    <description>This brief test is for cognitive assessment, detection, and characterization of dementia in the elderly as well as neuropsychological screening for younger patients. The RBANS Index scores include Immediate Memory Index, Visuospatial/Construction Index, Language Index, Attention Index and the Delayed Memory Index. The sum of these 5 Index scores is converted to a Total Scale value via a mapping table. The Total Scale is a norm-based t score based on a distribution with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.</description>

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline on the RBANS Total Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 42 (Year 3.5)</time_frame>
    <description>RBANS is a battery developed for cognitive assessment, detection, and characterization of dementia in the elderly as well as neuropsychological screening for younger patients. The RBANS includes 12 subtests that measure 5 indices: the Attention Index is composed of Digit Span and Coding, the Language Index consists of Picture Naming and Semantic Fluency subtests, the Visuospatial/Construction Index is made up of Figure Copy and Line Orientation subtests, the Immediate Memory Index is composed of List Learning and Story Memory subtests, and the Delayed Memory Index consists of List Recall, List Recognition, Story Recall, and Figure Recall subtests. The sum of these 5 Index scores is converted to a Total Scale value via a mapping table. The Total Scale is a norm-based t score based on a distribution with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.</description>

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline on the PACC Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 42 (Year 3.5)</time_frame>
    <description>The PACC is retrospectively validated measure that is weighted towards episodic memory, timed executive function test and global cognitive screening test. The PACC includes: 1. Total Recall score from FCSRT-IR (0-48 words); 2. Delayed Paragraph Recall total score on single administration of Logical Memory story from the WMS-Revised (0-25 story units); 3. Digit Symbol Substitution Test score from WAIS-Revised (0-135 symbols), and 4. MMSE score (0-30 points). The composite score is determined from its components using an established normalization method. Each of the 4 component change scores is divided by the baseline sample standard deviation of that component, to form standardized z-scores. Z-score implies how many standard deviations higher or lower the score is compared with baseline score. The composite score is sum of z-scores for component scores. Thus, a change of 1 baseline standard deviation on each component would correspond to a 4-point change on the composite.</description>

    <description>Enrolled participants will be randomized in a balanced manner to CogState brief battery in both the Main Study and the SubStudy. CogState consists of four tasks that respectively measure the functions of attention, processing speed, visual learning, and working memory. The CogState Brief Battery is an approximately 15 minute computerized battery with demonstrated reliability, validity, and short term stability, that was developed expressly for maximal sensitivity to detect change. CogState can be administered via the internet or on a stand-alone computer and is available in over 50 languages.</description>

    <description>Enrolled participants will be randomized in a balanced manner to CDR-AS in both the Main Study and the SubStudy. CDR-AS is fully automated system that targets the core aspects of cognitive function crucial for everyday behavior which are vulnerable to numerous insults including aging, fatigue, disease, pathology, trauma, diet, and pharmaceuticals. CDR-AS is an approximately 20-minute computerized battery designed to reliably measure changes in cognitive function in clinical trial situations.</description>

    <description>Enrolled participants will be randomized in a balanced manner to DKEFS in the Main Study and at one site of the SubStudy. The DKEFS is a paper and pencil measure of verbal and nonverbal executive functions that has been normed and validated for children and adults from 8-89 years of age. The measure consists of nine subtests. For the purposes of this study, the Trail Making Test (TMT) and Verbal Fluency subtests will be used.</description>

    <arm_group_label>COGNITO</arm_group_label>
    <description>Enrolled participants will be randomized in a balanced manner to COGNITO at the other site of the SubStudy. COGNITO is an approximately 45 to 60 minute computerized neuropsychometric examination based on well-known cognitive tests designed for both cognition research and clinical assessment. COGNITO assesses reaction time, primary and working memory, visuospatial and verbal secondary memory, implicit learning, language skills, functional and semantic categorization of visual data, focused and divided attention, and crystallized intelligence. Responses are made via a tactile screen which permits the recording of response latency (deducting reaction time provides an estimation of information processing time).</description>
