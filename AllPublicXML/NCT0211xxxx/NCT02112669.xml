  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi center, randomized, controlled study of the VasQ in
      arteriovenous fistulas. The VasQ constraints and directs the geometrical parameters of the
      fistula as well as the vascular diameter and gradient in the vicinity of the AV shunt. These
      geometrical constraints direct flow and influence hemodynamics, and hence minimize turbulence
      and promote laminar flow. The device is designed to improve short term maturation and long
      term patency of the fistula. The VasQ is a permanent implant intended for use as a
      subcutaneous arteriovenous conduit support for vascular access.
