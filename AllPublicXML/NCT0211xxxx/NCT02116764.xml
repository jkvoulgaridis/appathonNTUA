  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal and cross-sectional evaluation of patients with Chronic
      Granulomatous Disease (CGD) who received or are receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT) for their disease under a variety of protocols used by participating institutions
      compared to a control non-HCT group receiving standard care. Investigators at multiple
      centers caring for patients with CGD in North America and 3 centers in Europe will
      participate. Patients with CGD will have been treated according to institutional practice and
      protocols. Investigators will enroll these patients as subjects in this protocol. This study
      will investigate which patients benefit most from HCT, and what types of transplants are
      optimal for patients with CGD, in the context of overall outcomes in CGD patients with and
      without transplant.
