    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale after training</measure>
    <time_frame>1) up to 7 weeks, 2) 3 months after participants finish the training</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale for upper limb measures the voluntary motor function on the shoulder, the elbow, the wrist and hand. The full score ranges from 0 to 66. It can be further separated into two subscores, i.e., shoulder/elbow (0-42) and wrist/hand (0-24). The higher the score, the better is the related motor function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Ashworth Scale after training</measure>
    <time_frame>1) up to 7 weeks, 2) 3 months after participants finish the training</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale measures the resistance of a joint during passive motion, which indicates the muscle spasticity related to the joint motion, particularly the flexors. The Modified Ashworth Scale has six levels, i.e., 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4. The higher value is related to a higher joint resistance, i.e., higher muscle spasticity.</description>

    <description>The recruited subjects will receive 20-session device assisted upper limb training with an intensity of 3 to 5 sessions/week, which will be finished within 7 consecutive weeks. In each session, the subjects will conduct the system assisted and task-oriented upper limb training for 1.5 hours.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The recruited subjects will

          -  have unilateral ischemic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage at least 6 months
             after the onset of single stroke

          -  have moderate level of motor impairment in the affected upper limb, assessed by
             Fugl-Meyer Assessment (9&lt;shoulder/elbow&lt;27; 6&lt;wrist/hand&lt;18)

          -  have enough cognition to be able to follow the training protocol as assessed by
             Mini-metal State Examination (MMSE&gt;21)

          -  have detectable EMG signals (3 times of the standard deviation above the baseline)
             from the upper limb muscles.
