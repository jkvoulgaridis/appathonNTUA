    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to continue development and commercialization of a
      Wearable Sensory Prosthesis termed Walkasins. The device measures foot pressure through a
      thin sole insert, developed under National Institute on Aging (NIA) Small Business Innovation
      Research (SBIR) Phase I funding, and displays pressure information through a vibrotactile
      feedback array, placed around the lower leg, to help improve balance function. The device can
      replace lost foot pressure sensation in individuals with peripheral neuropathy who have
      balance problems.

      Our specific aims are to:

        1. Revise and finalize design of WalkasinsÂ® based on accomplishments, user input, as well
           as reviewer criticism from our Phase 1 grant and manufacture 200 units of the device for
           clinical testing.

           Milestone 1: 200 units manufactured and ready for clinical testing under Aim 2. This
           goal is accomplished.

        2. Investigate effects of using Walkasins on clinical outcomes related to gait, balance
           function and associated fall risk in a population of patients with sensory peripheral
           neuropathy and balance problems.

      Hypotheses 1A-B: Patients who are trained to use Walkasins programmed to display relevant
      balance cues will attain higher gait speed and Functional Gait Assessment when compared to a
      matched cohort not using Walkasins.

      Milestone 2: Data collection to assess clinical utility and safety of the Walkasins on
      patients briefly trained to use the device has been completed.

    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>During one test session &lt; 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) is a reliable and valid measure of gait function related to postural stability and has been shown to be effective in classifying fall risk in older adults and predicting unexplained falls in community-dwelling older adults (Wrisley, Marchetti et al. 2004; Wrisley and Kumar 2010). It has also been validated in stroke survivors (Lin, Hsu et al. 2010) and patients with Parkinson's disease (Leddy, Crowner et al. 2011) and has less flooring and ceiling effect than the Dynamic Gait Index (Lin, Hsu et al. 2010). The FGA includes a 10-item scale; each item is scored from 0 to 3 (3=normal, 2=mild impairment, 1=moderate impairment, 0=severe impairment). The maximum score is 30; minimum score, 0. Higher scores represent a better outcome. To be included in the count of participants, subjects' FGA scores needed to improve more than 4 points, which is the Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) (Beninato et al. 2014).</description>

    <measure>Four-Stage Balance Test &gt;30s</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment requires holding each stance for 10 seconds for a total of 40 seconds to pass.</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-Stage Balance Test is part of the STEADI protocol recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess fall-risk in elderly individuals. It includes four gradually more challenging postures the subject performs; 1) Stand with feet side by side; 2) Stand with feet in semi-tandem stance; 3) Stand with feet in tandem stance; 4) Stand on one leg. Subjects pass if they can hold the stance for 10 seconds and then move on to the next stance. A fail during tasks 1, 2, or 3 indicates a high risk of falling, i.e., a total performance time of less than 30 seconds.</description>

    <measure>10-Meter (10M) Walk Test (Measure of Gait Speed)--Number of Participants With Improvement to Normal Gait Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>During one test session &lt; 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The 10m-walk is routinely done in rehabilitation and has excellent reliability in chronic stroke patients. In addition, gait speed has been found to be an important predictor of survival in older adults (Hardy, Perera et al. 2006), further emphasizing its importance as a clinical outcomes measure. Gait speed (10-meter walk, timing only the middle 6 meters to allow for acceleration and deceleration) was assessed by instructing subjects to walk at their normal speed. A difference of 0.10m/sec is defined as the Minimally Clinical Important Difference (MCID) (Perera, Mody et al. 2006). Lower scores (# of seconds) on this measure indicate a better outcome. To be included in the count of participants, subjects' times on the 10M Walk Test needed to improve by more than 0.10m/sec, the MCID.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure was administered only at baseline during one test session &lt;3 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Powell and Myers (1995) developed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale to detect levels of balance confidence in elderly persons. The ABC scale is a one-page questionnaire that asks questions about balance confidence when performing 16 different tasks. The items are rated on a scale of 0 to 100; a score of 0 indicates no confidence and a score of 100 indicates complete confidence when performing the task. The overall score is calculated by adding the individual items then dividing by the total number of items (16). The higher the score, the greater the person's balance confidence; thus, higher scores indicate that subjects are more confident of their balance. The ABC Scale was assessed only at baseline to document the level of balance confidence the subjects had before beginning the study intervention.</description>

          <title>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) Score</title>
          <description>The FGA is a reliable and valid measure of gait function related to postural stability and has been shown to be effective in classifying fall risk in older adults and predicting unexplained falls in community-dwelling older adults. The FGA includes a 10-item scale where each item is scored from 0 to 3 (3 = normal, 2 = mild impairment, 1 = moderate impairment, 0 = severe impairment). The maximum score is 30; the minimum score is 0. Higher scores represent a better outcome. An increase &gt;4 is considered the MCID for community-dwelling elderly individuals (Beninato et al. 2014).</description>

It has also been validated in stroke survivors (Lin, Hsu et al. 2010) and patients with Parkinson's disease (Leddy, Crowner et al. 2011) and has less flooring and ceiling effect than the Dynamic Gait Index (Lin, Hsu et al. 2010). The FGA includes a 10-item scale; each item is scored from 0 to 3 (3=normal, 2=mild impairment, 1=moderate impairment, 0=severe impairment). The maximum score is 30; minimum score, 0. Higher scores represent a better outcome. To be included in the count of participants, subjects' FGA scores needed to improve more than 4 points, which is the Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) (Beninato et al. 2014).</description>

        <description>The 4-Stage Balance Test is part of the STEADI protocol recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess fall-risk in elderly individuals. It includes four gradually more challenging postures the subject performs; 1) Stand with feet side by side; 2) Stand with feet in semi-tandem stance; 3) Stand with feet in tandem stance; 4) Stand on one leg. Subjects pass if they can hold the stance for 10 seconds and then move on to the next stance. A fail during tasks 1, 2, or 3 indicates a high risk of falling, i.e., a total performance time of less than 30 seconds.</description>
        <time_frame>The assessment requires holding each stance for 10 seconds for a total of 40 seconds to pass.</time_frame>

        <title>10-Meter (10M) Walk Test (Measure of Gait Speed)--Number of Participants With Improvement to Normal Gait Speed</title>
        <description>The 10m-walk is routinely done in rehabilitation and has excellent reliability in chronic stroke patients. In addition, gait speed has been found to be an important predictor of survival in older adults (Hardy, Perera et al. 2006), further emphasizing its importance as a clinical outcomes measure. Gait speed (10-meter walk, timing only the middle 6 meters to allow for acceleration and deceleration) was assessed by instructing subjects to walk at their normal speed. A difference of 0.10m/sec is defined as the Minimally Clinical Important Difference (MCID) (Perera, Mody et al. 2006). Lower scores (# of seconds) on this measure indicate a better outcome. To be included in the count of participants, subjects' times on the 10M Walk Test needed to improve by more than 0.10m/sec, the MCID.</description>

        <title>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</title>
        <description>Powell and Myers (1995) developed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale to detect levels of balance confidence in elderly persons. The ABC scale is a one-page questionnaire that asks questions about balance confidence when performing 16 different tasks. The items are rated on a scale of 0 to 100; a score of 0 indicates no confidence and a score of 100 indicates complete confidence when performing the task. The overall score is calculated by adding the individual items then dividing by the total number of items (16). The higher the score, the greater the person's balance confidence; thus, higher scores indicate that subjects are more confident of their balance. The ABC Scale was assessed only at baseline to document the level of balance confidence the subjects had before beginning the study intervention.</description>
