          <description>Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) was estimated from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-6 equation. The MDRD-6 equation = 198 × [serum creatinine(mg/dL)]^−0.858 × [age]−0.167 × [0.822 if patient is female] × [1.178 if patient is black] × [serum urea nitrogen concentration (mg/dL)]^−0.293 × [urine urea nitrogen excretion (g/d)]^0.249.</description>
          <population>Due to poor enrollment the study was terminated early; therefore data for secondary outcome measures were not collected, and were not analyzed.</population>
