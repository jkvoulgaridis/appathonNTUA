  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to prevent the onset and progression of food allergy in our
      population. Evidence demonstrates that food allergy and atopic eczema represent the earliest
      manifestations of the atopic march with 50% of infants with food allergy predicted to develop
      respiratory allergic diseases later in life. We report that Australia has the highest
      prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the world, with 10% of infants having
      challenge-proven food allergy in Melbourne. There has been a 5-fold increase in hospital
      admissions for life-threatening anaphylaxis. These changes are most pronounced in children
      less than 5 years, suggesting a causal role for early life determinants. We have primary data
      to inform hypotheses for the rise in food allergy, which appears to result from potentially
      modifiable factors related to the modern lifestyle, particularly Vitamin D insufficiency
      (VDI), and have demonstrated an association between VDI and increased risk of
      challenge-proven food allergy in 12-month old infants, which supports numerous ecological
      studies showing an increased risk of food allergy the further a child resides from the
      equator (associated with decreased UV exposure and Vitamin D levels). Despite Australia's
      sunny climate, population rates of VDI have steadily increased in infants and pregnant women
      in parallel to the apparent rise in food allergic disease. This association is biologically
      plausible, as there is evidence Vitamin D is critical to the healthy development of the
      immune system in early life. We propose an intervention study to assess if infant Vitamin D
      supplementation during the first year of life significantly decreases the risk of early-onset
      food allergy. Australia is ideally placed to answer this important question since, unlike the
      USA, Canada and Europe, there are no population recommendations for routine infant
      supplementation with Vitamin D and we are one of the few developed countries that do not
      supplement the food chain supply with Vitamin D.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each participant must meet the following criteria to be included in this study:

          -  Healthy, term (born no earlier than 2 weeks before estimated date of delivery),
             predominantly breastfeeding infants aged 6 to 12 weeks (inclusive) who are expected to
             be predominantly breastfed for at least 6-months. This will be determined by answering
             yes/no to question 'do you intend/wish to breastfeed until your infant is at least 6
             months of age.' Up to one bottle (approx. 120mL) of formula per 24 hours at the time
             of screening is acceptable, as this will contain &lt;100 IU vitamin D.

          -  Has a parent/legally acceptable representative (LAR) capable of understanding the
             informed consent document and providing consent on the subject's behalf,

          -  The parent must expect to be able to complete 4 online questionnaires over the
             infant's first 12 months of life and for the infant to be available for skin prick
             testing (+/- food challenge) at The Royal Children's Hospital at 12 months of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          -  Infants who are currently receiving vitamin D supplementation

          -  Infants on medication that interferes with vitamin D metabolism

          -  Poor health due to a current or past significant disease state or congenital
             abnormality.

          -  Prematurity &lt;37 weeks/low birth weight &lt;2500 g/SGA

          -  Unable to provide consent without the aid of an interpreter.

          -  Women at high risk of vitamin D deficiency with infants on vitamin D supplementation.
