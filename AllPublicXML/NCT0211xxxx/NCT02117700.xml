  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although weight reduction through physical activity-based interventions is the mainstay
      therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), its maintenance is difficult and
      typically unsuccessful. This affirms the extreme need for alternate and/or adjunct therapies.
      Although convincing data from animal studies and a few adult human studies on the benefits of
      a natural product, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), in a variety of liver conditions including NAFLD
      have emerged, studies in children are scarce. Therefore, the aim of the study is to test the
      use NAC as an innovative approach to attenuate the progression of NAFD in obese children with
      biopsy proven NASH. The central hypothesis is that NAC supplementation will reduce liver fat
      and liver enzymes and ameliorate risk factors of cardiometabolic disease in children with
      NAFLD.

      Physical activity (PA)-induced weight reduction, the suggested therapy for noalcoholic liver
      disease (NAFLD), is difficult and its maintenance is typically unsuccessful in children,
      affirming the acute need for alternative/adjunct therapies. Although few promising approaches
      have been reported, the benefits are incongruent and mostly marginal. N-acetyl cysteine
      (NAC), a derivative of the natural amino acid, cysteine, appears to be promising as an
      adjunct therapy to PA. Animal and a few adult human studies suggest NAC-induced attenuation
      of liver abnormalities, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and inflammation. The primary
      aim of the proposal is to determine in obese children with biopsy proven NASH and elevated
      liver enzymes the effect of NAC at two different doses on liver fat using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), liver enzymes and risk factors of cardiometabolic disease. We hypothesize that
      NAC will produce beneficial effect on these parameters.
