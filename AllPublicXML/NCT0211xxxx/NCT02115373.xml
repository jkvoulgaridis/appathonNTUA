        <description>PFS status was evaluated by the number of participants who were progression-free at 12 weeks according to RECIST Version 1.1. Participants were considered to be progression-free if the participant had a tumor assessment of Complete Response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 millimeter (mm). Partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, or Stable Disease (SD) defined as any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease (an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of target lesions recorded since treatment started)12 weeks after start of treatment or later.</description>
