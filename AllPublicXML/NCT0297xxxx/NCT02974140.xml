  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the refractive predictability (prediction error)
      between the Cataract Refractive Suite (CRS) and standard manual technique at one month

    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) Within 0.5 Diopter (D) of Predicted Postoperative Spherical Equivalent at Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 20-40 from second implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder. The sphere and cylinder values were from the manifest refraction assessment. Manifest refraction was assessed at 4 meters under photopic lighting conditions using a phoropter. Due to early termination of the study and limited sample size, a statistical inference test was not carried out as planned.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE) represents the energy dissipated of the ultrasound tip and infusion sleeve at the incision point during the removal of cataractous lens. CDE was reported on the Vision System interface and measured in percent-seconds. A lower CDE indicates that less energy was expended in the eye. Due to early termination of the study and limited sample size, a statistical inference test was not carried out as planned.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Aspiration Fluid Used During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Aspiration fluid (amount of fluid used during the removal of the cataractous lens) was measured in milliliters (ml). A lower value indicates less fluid used during the procedure. Due to early termination of the study and limited sample size, a statistical inference test was not carried out as planned.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phaco Aspiration Time Spent During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day), each eye</time_frame>
    <description>Phaco aspiration time (the average time the surgeon took to complete the phacoemulsification) was measured in seconds. A lower value indicates that the surgeon spent less time aspirating fluid and material from the eye during surgery. Due to early termination of the study and limited sample size, a statistical inference test was not carried out as planned.</description>

          <description>Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder. The sphere and cylinder values were from the manifest refraction assessment. Manifest refraction was assessed at 4 meters under photopic lighting conditions using a phoropter. Due to early termination of the study and limited sample size, a statistical inference test was not carried out as planned.</description>
