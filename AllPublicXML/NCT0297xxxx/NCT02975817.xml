  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to undertake a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate
      the ability of a simple and low-cost method (Hibler´s method of wrapping the patient in
      multiple insulating layers) to prevent intraoperative heat-loss in children undergoing
      neurosurgery under anesthesia in Malawi. The control group will be heated actively with the
      use of warm-air blankets. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether Hibler´s method can
      provide a cheap and technically simple way of adequately preserving the patients´ core
      temperature in the operating theatre in a resource-poor setting.

    <textblock>
      Hypothermia in the perioperative setting is receiving increasing attention in anaesthetic and
      surgical care. The paediatric age group is arguably at increased risk and thus deserves more
      intensive focus.

      The investigators wish to undertake a randomized controlled non-inferiority study in which
      two different modalities for preventing inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia are compared.
      The trial will be carried out in a paediatric neurosurgical population in a South-East
      African regional tertiary care hospital.

      The primary objective is to determine whether a low cost and simple method can be as
      effective and safe as a more expensive and technically demanding method. The goal is to
      recruit 40 patients in each of the two study arms. Patients younger than 12 years of age
      presenting for scheduled neurosurgery will be approached and given information about the
      study. If informed consent (and assent, where applicable) is obtained, participants will be
      randomized to one of the two different techniques; either passive heat preservation using
      what has become known as Hibler´s method (interventional group) or active warming with
      warm-air blankets (control group). Throughout the study period core temperature will be
      measured continuously, both for purposes of data accuracy and to maintain safety standards.

      Primary study outcomes focus on the comparative ability of the methods in maintaining
      acceptable core temperatures. The trial will also examine a number of secondary end-points
      such as prevalence of shivering, conscious level, analgesia requirements, oxygenation and
      overall cost.

      Upon completion of the study the investigators will seek to publish the findings in a
      relevant medical journal. Presenting the results in abstract form or as a poster in an
      appropriate medical congress may also be desirable.

        general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation for planned cranial procedures; e.g.
        craniotomies, ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placements, endoscopic third ventriculostomies
        and similar procedures with a predominantly cranial access.

        IV. Informed parental/guardian consent given

        Exclusion criteria:

        I. Pts. aged 12 years or older. II. Pts. with a temperature upon arrival at the anaesthetic
        suite lower than 36,0 °C III. Pts. with a temperature upon arrival at the anaesthetic suite
        greater than 37,5°C IV. Pts. judged to be unsuited for the standardized anaesthetic
        technique chosen (due to known allergy, known or suspected difficult airway requiring other

        anaesthetic agents or due to any other condition where the chosen technique is deemed
        unsafe)
