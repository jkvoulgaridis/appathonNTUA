  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with hormone
      receptor positive inflammatory breast cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body,
      who are receiving hormone therapy and did not achieve a pathological complete response to
      chemotherapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the disease free survival (DFS) at 2 years of patients with maintenance
      therapy using pembrolizumab in combination with standard adjuvant hormonal therapy.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of primary inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)
      patients who received combination of pembrolizumab and hormone receptor blockade.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the association between immune related biomarkers in the peripheral blood
      and tumor tissue, such as PD-L1 expression, with safety and efficacy for IBC patients treated
      with pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 24 months.
