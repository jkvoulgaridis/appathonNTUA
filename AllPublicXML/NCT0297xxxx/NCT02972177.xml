  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navigation bronchoscopy guided
      transbronchial ablation for treating inoperable malignant lung tumor. The study is designed
      as a single-center prospective trial. The participating centers are Department of pulmonary
      medicine and endoscopy, Shanghai Chest Hospital,Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.
      Patients are divided into two groups, including radiofrequency ablation group and microwave
      ablation group. Sixty patients are expected to be enrolled into the study with 30 patients in
      each group.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients older than 18 year-old.

          2. Patients meeting one of the following criteria: 1) patients discovered with peripheral
             lung lesions that have demonstrated to be lung cancer by pathology with the clinical
             stage no later than IIA. 2) recurrent or progressive single lesion or solitary
             intrapulmonary metastasis after surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other
             treatment.3) multiple primary lung cancer with the number of tumors no more than 5 and
             no metastasis. 4) pulmonary metastases with effective treatment of primary disease,
             the number of metastases no more than 5 and no other metastasis.
