    <textblock>
      Longitudinal prospective observational study. This is a 24-month study with the possibility
      of extending the data time points. Initially baseline, then 12 and 24 months follow up
      studies will be completed.

      Four cohorts are enrolled in this study. The target population is the cohort of genetically
      confirmed DMD/BMD female carriers (Cohort A). This cohort will consist of 150 DMD/BMD mothers
      who are somatic carriers of a mutation in the DMD gene. The data collected for this cohort
      will be compared to three control groups; Control Group B is a cohort of 50 DMD/BMD mothers
      who are NOT somatic carriers, Control Group C is a cohort of 50 age-matched healthy controls
      and Control Group D is a cohort of 25 genetically confirmed carriers who do not have an
      affected child. The inclusion of a Control Group B allows for a comparison to a group of
      mothers that share the emotional and cognitive burden of caring for an affected male without
      having the physical or cognitive risks of being a female carrier. The Control Group C offers
      robust data from an age-matched healthy cohort for purposes of comparison. Control Group D
      allows for comparison to a group of women that have the same physical or cognitive risks as
      the Cohort A female carriers, but do not have the same burden of care giving.

      The blood sample for genetic testing will be delivered to the Molecular Genetics lab at
      Nationwide Children's Hospital, where genomic DNA will be isolated from peripheral white
      blood cells. DNA will be banked frozen while a portion of the sample will be delivered to the
      Emory Molecular Genetics Laboratories for testing of the DMD gene.
