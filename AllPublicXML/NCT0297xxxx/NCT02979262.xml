  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed stage 1 intervention development study is designed to address two significant
      co-occurring issues for fathers with substance abuse (SA) problems: Intimate partner violence
      (IPV) and child maltreatment (CM). SA treatment programs are an important avenue to reduce
      family violence because SA treatment alone does not result in an end to these behaviors.
      Currently available interventions have had little success in reducing male IPV. Fathers for
      Change, an integrated outpatient intervention, shows promise as an intervention model
      targeting the intersection of SA, IPV, and CM. The intervention uses men's roles as fathers
      as a motivation for change and targets factors that are known to trigger SA, IPV and CM:
      hostile cognitions and poor emotion regulation. An intervention of this sort has not been
      integrated and tested as part of a residential substance abuse program for men. This project
      is a pilot study of 60 fathers randomly assigned to Fathers for Change or a Parent Education
      Program (PE) comparison. The initial feasibility of the Fathers for Change will be assessed
      by comparing it to PE in the areas of: participant completion rates, hostile cognitions,
      emotion regulation, SA relapse, IPV, and CM risk behaviors (negative parenting). Change in
      hostile cognitions and emotion regulation will be examined as the mechanisms through which
      Fathers for Change reduces relapse, IPV and CM risk behaviors.

    <measure>Hostile Thoughts on the Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and intervention completion around 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hostile Thinking coded from audio recorded transcripts. Participants are presented with 4 scenarios in which they are asked to respond verbally their thoughts about a given situation. The scenarios present incidents that could induce feelings of jealousy, anger, abandonment, or disrespect. These are coded for number of hostile cognitions by trained blind coders and summed for a total score. The range of scores is 0 to 28 . Higher scores mean greater hostile cognitions (worse outcome).</description>

    <description>Fathers for Change treatment begins with individual-focused sessions followed by co-parenting focused sessions and ending with restorative parenting sessions. The areas of focus for each of the three phases of Fathers for Change are: 1) abstinence from SA and violence; 2) co-parenting; 3) parenting/father-child relationship. Treatment begins with motivational enhancement by focusing the role of men as fathers to their young children, child development and the impact of violence and SA on parenting, and the father's own childhood experiences of SA and violence to highlight the multigenerational nature of these problems. The program then focuses on skills training in the following areas: reducing automatic hostile cognitions and increasing emotion regulation skills, 2) communication and problem solving around co-parenting, and 3) restorative parenting.</description>

    <description>PE is an individual intervention.PE was developed to represent parent education and support that is typically available to parents with substance use problems who are at high risk for neglecting their children. Fathers enrolled in PE will meet weekly for one hour with a PE counselor who will provide assistance in solving problems related to family basic needs (e.g., health care, child care, housing and education). The PE counselor will provide a choice of pamphlets on age-related parenting topics each week from a series of pamphlets designed for work with substance abusing parents. Sample pamphlet topics include routines and rituals, ages and milestones, alternatives to spanking, and nutrition and fitness.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. meet current DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder of alcohol, cocaine, marijuana,
             amphetamines, or opiates at the time of admission to Westcare; (2) report physical
             violence in an intimate relationship (pushing, slapping, kicking) within 6 months of
             admission to the program (based on court/police records or self- report); and (3) have
             at least one biological child under the age of 12 with whom they lived or had at least
             once per month visitation prior to admission to Westcare. Each will agree to have
             their female co-parents contacted for participation as collateral informants and will
             provide the contact information. If a participant has more than one child in the age
             range, the youngest child will be the target of assessment. Female co-parents (the
             target children's mothers) will be invited to participate as collateral informants on
             research assessments and to participate in a portion (2 -4) of the intervention
             sessions. If a female co-parent does not consent to participate, a male participant
             will still be allowed to enroll in the study if he meets eligibility criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals will be excluded who: 1) Have histories of severe physical violence (e.g.
             strangulation, causing hospitalization) based on police records, self or partner
             reports; 2) Men who have an active FULL/NO CONTACT protective order pertaining to
             their partner or child (Westcare has access to criminal record/court information for
             all of it's residential clients. Participants will sign releases of information during
             informed consent to allow the study team to access this information to determine
             eligibility); 3) Have cognitive impairment (a mini mental state score &lt;25); 4) Have
             major medical complications such as a head injury or HIV dementia that may also be a
             confound in the study interventions; 5) Have current untreated psychotic or bipolar
             disorder (reported by history, as part of the Westcare record, or self-report); or 6)
             Are currently suicidal or homicidal. If potential participants have a prior diagnosis
             of bipolar or psychotic disorder that is currently treated and symptoms are well
             managed based on initial study interview and after collateral contact with the
             Westcare treatment team, they may participate in the study.

        <description>Hostile Thinking coded from audio recorded transcripts. Participants are presented with 4 scenarios in which they are asked to respond verbally their thoughts about a given situation. The scenarios present incidents that could induce feelings of jealousy, anger, abandonment, or disrespect. These are coded for number of hostile cognitions by trained blind coders and summed for a total score. The range of scores is 0 to 28 . Higher scores mean greater hostile cognitions (worse outcome).</description>

            <description>Fathers for Change treatment begins with individual-focused sessions followed by co-parenting focused sessions and ending with restorative parenting sessions. The areas of focus for each of the three phases of Fathers for Change are: 1) abstinence from SA and violence; 2) co-parenting; 3) parenting/father-child relationship. Treatment begins with motivational enhancement by focusing the role of men as fathers to their young children, child development and the impact of violence and SA on parenting, and the father’s own childhood experiences of SA and violence to highlight the multigenerational nature of these problems. The program then focuses on skills training in the following areas: reducing automatic hostile cognitions and increasing emotion regulation skills, 2) communication and problem solving around co-parenting, and 3) restorative parenting.

Fathers enrolled in PE will meet weekly for one hour with a PE counselor who will provide assistance in solving problems related to family basic needs (e.g., health care, child care, housing and education). The PE counselor will provide a choice of pamphlets on age-related parenting topics each week from a series of pamphlets designed for work with substance abusing parents. Sample pamphlet topics include routines and rituals, ages and milestones, alternatives to spanking, and nutrition and fitness.

            <description>PE is an individual intervention.PE was developed to represent parent education and support that is typically available to parents with substance use problems who are at high risk for neglecting their children. Fathers enrolled in PE will meet weekly for one hour with a PE counselor who will provide assistance in solving problems related to family basic needs (e.g., health care, child care, housing and education). The PE counselor will provide a choice of pamphlets on age-related parenting topics each week from a series of pamphlets designed for work with substance abusing parents. Sample pamphlet topics include routines and rituals, ages and milestones, alternatives to spanking, and nutrition and fitness.

            <description>Fathers for Change treatment begins with individual-focused sessions followed by co-parenting focused sessions and ending with restorative parenting sessions. The areas of focus for each of the three phases of Fathers for Change are: 1) abstinence from SA and violence; 2) co-parenting; 3) parenting/father-child relationship. Treatment begins with motivational enhancement by focusing the role of men as fathers to their young children, child development and the impact of violence and SA on parenting, and the father’s own childhood experiences of SA and violence to highlight the multigenerational nature of these problems. The program then focuses on skills training in the following areas: reducing automatic hostile cognitions and increasing emotion regulation skills, 2) communication and problem solving around co-parenting, and 3) restorative parenting.
