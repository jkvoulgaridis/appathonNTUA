      This was a Phase IIa randomised, assessor blinded, parallel group study in which half the
      participants were treated with Nice 'n Clear neem-based conditioning lotion plus combing with
      a head louse detection and removal comb and the remainder were treated with Nice 'n Clear
      plus combing with a normal grooming comb

    <textblock>
      Neem oil has had a long reputation for killing a wide range of insects, including head lice.
      Several products are marketed with this oil as a named active ingredient, e.g. Nice 'n Clear
      neem-based conditioning lotion. This product was developed as an aid to combing out head lice
      for eliminating infestation but it has been considered possible that the neem oil could act
      to kill lice and inhibit their eggs from hatching.

      This study was designed to compare use of Nice 'n Clear neem-based conditioning lotion when
      used with two different types of comb. One arm of the study was planned so that participants
      were combed using a plastic louse detection and removal comb (wet combing with conditioner
      method), in which it was expected the combing process would play a major role in efficacy.
      The other arm was planned so that participants were combed using a regular grooming comb,
      which would normally have little effect for removing head lice from the hair.

      Comparison of the efficacy outcome in the two groups would determine whether the Nice 'n
      Clear neem-based conditioning lotion exhibited any effect to eliminate infestation
      independent of the combing
