  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 3 study is to investigate the efficacy and safety, including
      immunogenicity, thrombogenicity and hypersensitivity reactions, as well as pharmacokinetics
      (PK), health related quality of life (HRQoL) and pharmacoeconomics of prophylactic treatment
      with recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) (vonicog alfa) in adult participants with
      severe von Willebrand disease (VWD).
