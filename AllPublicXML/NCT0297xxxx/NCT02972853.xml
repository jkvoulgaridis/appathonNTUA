  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine whether Mindfulness Training for Primary Care
      (see study &quot;MINDFUL-PC: Integrating Mindfulness Into the Patient-Centered Medical Home - A
      Pilot Study&quot;) engages self-regulation targets such as emotion regulation, attention, and
      interoceptive awareness; and 2) changes brain activation in neuroimaging tasks before
      compared to after the training. Neuroimaging fMRI tasks probe mechanisms related to
      self-regulation, such as attention/inhibition, emotion regulation, self-compassion,
      interoception and pain regulation.

      The study will also look at whether chronic disease self-management and successful engagement
      of self-report and behavioral self-regulation targets (emotion regulation, attention, and
      interoceptive awareness) relates to the observed brain activation changes after compared to
      before the mindfulness intervention.

      This study aims to test brain activation changes related to self-regulation targets of
      attention, emotion regulation, self-compassion, interoception and pain regulation that are
      influenced by mindfulness training within primary care (compare MINDFUL-PC study).

      The study will also look at whether successful chronic disease self-management relates to the
      observed brain activation changes after compared to before the mindfulness intervention.

      The study will examine the relationship between mindfulness training within primary care and
      medical regimen adherence (initiation and maintenance) as well as the underlying neural
      correlates associated with changes in self-regulation.

      This is a single-arm pilot trial, recruiting from a randomized controlled trial (see
      MINDFUL-PC study). .
