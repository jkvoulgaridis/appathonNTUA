  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, single group assignment, safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study to determine the MTD and optimal dosing regimen of Oraxol in
      combination with ramucirumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sequential-group, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      oral Oraxol in combination with intravenous ramucirumab. After a screening period of up to 28
      days subjects will be enrolled into the treatment phase of the study. Each cycle of therapy
      will last 4 weeks. Subjects may continue in the study until they experience disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Three to six subjects will be enrolled at each dose
      level. Once the tolerability of a dose level has been determined, an additional 3-6 subjects
      may be enrolled at a higher dose level, to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Safety will
      be monitored through recording of adverse events, serious adverse events, monitoring of
      laboratory tests including hematology, blood chemistry, urinalyses, physical examinations and
      electrocardiograms. Subjects will undergo radiographic assessments for tumor response at
      specified time points. Blood samples will also be obtained in the first cycle of therapy at
      multiple time points for determination of the amount of paclitaxel and metabolites and
      HM30181 in the circulation. After the treatment period, there will be a follow-up period
      during which the subject or family may be contacted every three months for follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Unresolved toxicity from previous anticancer treatments, including investigational
             products (subjects must have recovered all unacceptable toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] toxicity). This does not extend to

          2. Received investigational products within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the first study
             dosing day, whichever is longer; subjects receiving biologic agents (eg, monoclonal
             antibodies) require a 30-day washout period.

          3. Are currently receiving other medications or radiation intended for the treatment of
             their malignancy

          4. Central nervous system metastases, including leptomeningeal involvement

          5. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          6. Currently taking a concomitant medication, other than a premedication, that is:

               -  A strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor or inducer. Subjects who are taking such
                  medications but who are otherwise eligible may be enrolled if they discontinue
                  the medication ≥1 week before dosing

               -  An oral medication with a narrow therapeutic index known to be a P-gp substrate
                  within 24 hours prior to start of dosing in the study

                  cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 or medications known to be strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
                  (eg, ketoconazole) or inducers (eg, rifampin or St. John's Wort). Subjects who
                  are currently taking such medications but who are otherwise eligible may be
                  enrolled if they discontinue the medication 1 week before dosing and remain off
                  that medication during treatment with Oraxol.

          7. Use of warfarin. Participants receiving warfarin who are otherwise eligible and who
