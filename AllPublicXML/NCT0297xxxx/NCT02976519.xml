    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted in 2 parts. The first part was a multiple rising dose (MRD) trial in healthy participants. The second part followed a cross-over design with respect to placebo and BI 443651 treatment in participants with cystic fibrosis. Both parts were randomised, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Participants attended specialist sites which would then ensure that they (all participants) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were not to be randomized to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria were not met.</pre_assignment_details>
