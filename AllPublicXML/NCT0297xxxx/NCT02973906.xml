    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to advance research on family-based prevention of
      negative child outcomes for reintegrating Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom
      personnel by evaluating different formats of a parenting program, After Deployment, Adaptive
      Parenting Tools (ADAPT). The ADAPT program is based upon the Parent Management
      Training-Oregon Model/PMTO, but adapted for military deployed families. The PI will examine
      which of three delivery formats of ADAPT is most effective at reducing youth risk behaviors
      associated with negative childhood outcomes by improving parenting, child, and parent
      adjustment. There is a clear intent to benefit all subjects in this study (except surveyed
      teachers), including children.

      The overarching goal of this study is to advance research on family-based prevention of
      negative child outcomes for reintegrating Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom
      personnel by evaluating different formats of a parenting program, After Deployment, Adaptive
      Parenting Tools (ADAPT). The ADAPT program is based upon the Parent Management
      Training-Oregon Model/PMTO, but adapted for military deployed families. The investigators
      will examine which of three delivery formats of ADAPT is most effective at reducing youth
      risk behaviors associated with negative childhood outcomes by improving parenting, child, and
      parent adjustment. There is a clear intent to benefit all subjects in this study (except
      surveyed teachers), including children.

      Combat deployment and related challenges are family stressors, associated with more negative
      parent-child interactions, ineffective and coercive parenting practices and lower levels of
      parenting satisfaction. Disrupted parenting practices are well-known predictors of risk for
      child adjustment difficulties that are precursors to youth substance use, including behavior
      problems, school failure, deviant peer association, and depression . These child adjustment
      problems can contribute to continuing parental stress, increasing parental distress, and
      further disrupting parenting.
