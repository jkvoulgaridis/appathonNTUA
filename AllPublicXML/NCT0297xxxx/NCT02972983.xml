  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to examine the effects of a second antibiotic, daptomycin, in
      combination with a beta lactam antibiotic on treating bloodstream infection caused by
      methicillin-susceptible S. aureus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When patients have a blood infection with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, they will all be
      treated with the usual standard of care, including abeta-lactam antibiotic, have their blood
      tested daily for the presence of the infection until they test negative, as well as an
      ultrasound of the heart to rule out an infection of the heart valves, as well as have any
      catheters removed (if possible) to ensure adequate control of the infection.

      This study involves adding a second antibiotic, daptomycin, to the treatment regimen of half
      of the patients enrolled in this study. Daptomycin is approved by Health Canada for treating
      blood infections due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is currently not used in combination with a
      beta-lactam for these infections because there is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify
      the cost.

      The study participants will receive an additional daily iv therapy which will consist of
      either daptomycin or a placebo for a total of five days while admitted to the hospital.
      During this time, the participants will continue to have their blood drawn to assess for the
      presence of bacteria. The participants' liver and muscle enzymes will also be measured on the
      first and fifth day of therapy to test for potential side effects of the daptomycin.
