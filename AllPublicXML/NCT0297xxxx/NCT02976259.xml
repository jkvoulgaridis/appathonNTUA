      Participating country : FRANCE

      Primary objective : Comparing the kinetic of HIV-RNA decay in blood plasma and in seminal
      plasma in patients starting a triple combination regimen with dolutegravir + tenofovir DF
      (TDF) + emtricitabine (FTC) at the time of PHI.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Comparison of HIV-1 RNA level in plasma (threshold 20 and 1 copies/ml) and in seminal
           plasma (threshold 60 copies/ml) at each visit D0, W2, W4, W8, W12, W24, W36, W48

        -  To assess the frequency of intermittent shedding in seminal plasma once virological
           suppression has been achieved and until W48

        -  Evolution of cellular HIV-1 DNA level in PBMC and in non-sperm cells between D0 and W48

        -  Comparison of dolutegravir concentration in blood plasma and seminal plasma

        -  Study of risk factors associated with viral persistence of HIV-RNA in the seminal plasma

        -  Analysis by deep sequencing of the viral population (quasi-species) in both compartments
           (blood plasma and seminal plasma) before virological suppression has been achieved (i.e.
           at D0 and W12)

      Inclusion criteria :

        -  Patients diagnosed at the time of primary HIV infection (PHI) (i) a negative or
           indeterminate HIV ELISA associated with a positive antigenemia or plasma HIV RNA, (ii) a
           western blot profile compatible with ongoing seroconversion (incomplete western blot
           with absence of antibodies to pol proteins (p34, p68)) or (iii) an initially negative
           test for HIV antibodies followed within 3 months by a positive HIV serology

        -  Treatment including dolutegravir (DTG 50mg) + tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC 245
           mg/200 mg) initiated by the referee physician within a maximum of 15 days after
           diagnosis of PHI

        -  Genotypic sensitivity to TDF, FTC and DTG

        -  Patient with medical care insurance

      Exclusion criteria :

        -  Chronic infection

        -  Infection or co-infection with HIV-2

      Study treatment : Dolutegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine Number of subjets : 20 patients
