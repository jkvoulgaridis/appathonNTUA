      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, controlled study was designed to
      investigate the efficacy of electrical muscle simulation (EMS) for treatment of waist
      circumference (WC) reduction in abdominal obese adults.

      60 patients with abdominal obese, man with WC &gt; 90 cm and woman with WC &gt; 80 cm, received EMS
      as experimental group (EG) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as control
      group (CG) 5 times a week for 12 weeks.

          <description>EMS program was consisted of warm-up, warm-down, contraction and relaxation. It was programed to be resemble to actual muscle action of voluntary exercise. To increase energy consumption as high intensity exercise, tripled the contraction duration. EMS group used Program 3 and regulated intensity though channel from 1 to 4.
EMS: Participants were under EMS 5 times a week for 12 weeks. Pads were applied on participants’ abdomen, rectus abdominis and external oblique abdominal muscle areas without any recent wound, infection, scar, and warts while lie on their back.</description>
