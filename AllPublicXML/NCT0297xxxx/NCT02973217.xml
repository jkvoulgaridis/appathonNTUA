    <textblock>
      Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue, for example tumor tissue.
      Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (imILT) is a specific form of
      thermotherapy, which, in addition to destroying tumor tissue, has been optimized to cause a
      tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been
      shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with
      imILT other, untreated, tumors also decrease in size.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficiency when it comes to local tumor destruction
      of the imILT treatment method in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The purpose is
      also to investigate the functionality and safety as well as understanding of the subsequent
      immunological effects.

      This trial is prospective, open and non-randomized. Five patients diagnosed with pancreatic
      cancer will be treated in this trial, which is estimated to be carried out during a time
      period of 36 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytohistological diagnosis of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma .

          -  Stage III disease (see above).

          -  The patient is not a candidate for continued chemotherapy or (chemo)radiotherapy due
             to lack of demonstrable efficiency or to the side effects of the drugs.

          -  Age between 18 and 80 years.

          -  Anticipated compliance with treatment and follow-up.

          -  Double informed consent for both imILT and possible surgery with radical intent (in
             the event of pre-operative overstaging).

          -  At least a part of the tumor can be treated with imILT without damage to surrounding
             vital structures.

          -  Have an ECOG performance status &lt; 1 (l'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not a candidate for laparotomy.

          -  Becoming resectable after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Other simultaneous treatments for the same neoplasm.

          -  Simultaneous other malignancies except for basal cell carcinoma.

          -  HIV positive.

          -  Active autoimmune disease.

          -  Systemic corticosteroid medication.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing.
