  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri operative haemorrhage following cardio Pulmonary Bypass may occur in 5 to 10% of cardiac
      surgical interventions.

      Treatment of such complication often necessitates various combinations therapeutic
      intervention including allogenic blood products administration, drug use and/or surgical
      intervention. All are expensive treatment and decision making is guided by patient clinical
      status and biological tests of the haemostatic function.

      A key point is the time frame of the clinical process. Therapeutic choices have to be done as
      fast as possible to minimize bleeding consequences on patient haemodynamic and physiological
      status. Conventional coagulation test results availability time usually exceed 45' after
      blood drawing. In such situation, the results may not reflect precisely the coagulation
      system current state. This downside is often counterbalanced by clinicians empirical choices
      preceding lab test results knowledge that may conduct to inappropriate treatment, blood
      product overuse and undue expense.

      Viscoelastic point of care test may compensate for the limitations of conventional
      coagulation tests. In perioperative haemorrhage, faster and more precise information about
      haemostatic function may help for more accurate therapeutic choices.

      The IMOTEC study aims to compare haemorrhage management following cardiac surgery using
      conventional blood coagulation tests or thrombo-elastogaphic point of care test.

      Primary endpoint is a cost utility analysis of the technology and secondary endpoints include
      blood component transfusion, postoperative bleeding , thoracic re-intervention, postoperative
      infection (any cause), organ failure, in hospital length of stay and death.

      The research is a real life, prospective, single blinded stepped wedge randomized study.

      Inclusion after informed consent of adult patient having cardio-vascular surgical procedure
      using cardiopulmonary bypass and meeting inclusion criterion &quot;bleeding&quot;.

      After meeting inclusion criterion patients are managed either using conventional blood
      coagulation tests or using thrombo-elastometry POC test and predefined therapeutic
      interventions described in a specific algorithm.

      Other elements of patient clinical management follow usual center standard care .

      Follow up of EQ-5D and clinical evaluations are performed at one , 6 and 12 months after
      inclusion.
