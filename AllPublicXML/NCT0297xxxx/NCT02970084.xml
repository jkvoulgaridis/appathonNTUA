      Clinical study single center, prospective, randomized, controlled (vs. no supplement),
      open-label, blinded assessor (the doctor who will perform the Doppler ultrasound at 6 and 12
      months will not know the treatment given to the patient, because the diagnostic test in
      question is considered operator-dependent), a &quot;parallel group&quot;, which aims is evaluate the
      reduction in the level of calcium in the carotid artery and the carotid atherosclerotic
      plaques, on a sample of 60 subjects presenting subcritical calcified lesions of the carotid
      bifurcation with a range of 40-60%.
