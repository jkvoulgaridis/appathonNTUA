    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of switching to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) versus continuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) in virologically suppressed adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

Did not have on-treatment HBV DNA data available in the Week 48 analysis window and
Discontinued study drug prior to or in the Week 48 analysis window due to lack of efficacy, or

        <title>Change From Baseline in eGFR-CG at Week 48</title>
        <description>Cockcroft-Gault formula is as follows:
For men: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = (140 - age in years) * body weight in kg / 72 * serum creatinine (mg/dL)
For women: GFR = 0.85 * (140 - age in years) * body weight in kg / 72 * serum creatinine (mg/dL)
Change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 48 minus the value at Baseline.</description>
