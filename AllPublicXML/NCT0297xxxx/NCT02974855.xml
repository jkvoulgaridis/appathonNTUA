    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1 to Day 113 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment. Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment. Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.</description>

It measures the number of seconds it takes for a clot to form in a sample of blood after substances (reagents) are added. Blood sample were obtained to evaluate aPTT.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI)</title>
        <description>Total amount of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (bound and unbound) in plasma. TFPI is a protease inhibitor which acts as an antagonist of the extrinsic coagulation pathway via inhibition of tissue factor activated coagulation factor VII (FVIIa) and activated factor X (FXa). Human plasma samples were analyzed for total TFPI concentrations using a validated, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS). Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) was used to analyze the change from baseline on TFPI.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Endogenous Thrombin Generation (TGA) Potential</title>
          <description>An ex vivo pharmacodynamic measure of thrombin generation. The endogenous TGA potential represents the total amount of active thrombin formed during thrombin generation and the peak height the maximal amount of thrombin formed.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had a baseline measurement and at least 1 post-dose measurement for at least 1 pharmacodynamic endpoint.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Prothrombin Fragments 1 + 2</title>
        <description>An in vivo pharmacodynamic measure of thrombin generation (prothrombin cleavage). Prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2) is the amino terminus fragment of the prothrombin molecule. It is a polypeptide with a half-life of approximately 90 minutes. F 1+2 is released from prothrombin when prothrombin is converted to thrombin by the prothrombinase complex.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had a baseline measurement and at least 1 post-dose measurement for at least 1 pharmacodynamic endpoint.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in D-Dimer</title>
        <description>An in vivo pharmacodynamic measure of thrombin generation (fibrin degradation). D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. D-dimer is one of the protein fragments produced when a blood clot gets dissolved in the body. It is normally undetectable or detectable at a very low level unless the body is forming and breaking down blood clots. Then, its level in the blood can significantly rise.</description>

The criterion for positive result of ADA samples was ADA titer &gt;=1.53. Treatment induced are negative prior to dosing and become positive during/after dosing. Treatment boosted are positive prior to dosing but titer increases during/after dosing.</description>
