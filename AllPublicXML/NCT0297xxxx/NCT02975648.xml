    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of an educational model, which included
      cardiac rehabilitation with emphasis on physical activity and telephone follow up, with the
      usual management of individuals undergoing to first percutaneous coronary intervention, in
      relation to physical activity five until seven months after discharge.

      Randomized controlled trial (RCT) at a public teaching hospital, which has specialized care
      for CAD in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, Brazil. The intervention group received usual
      care and an educational programme and the control group received only usual care.

      A researcher (who didn't had contact with the patients) generated the random allocation in
      SPSS software, concealing it from the investigators in sequentially numbered, sealed and
      opaque envelopes.

      Another researcher performed the individual interview with each participant (baseline) and
      aplied the instruments of socialdemographic data, physical activity, ansiety and depression,
      perceived health status and selfefficacy to practice of physical activity. At the end of the
      interviewThe same researcher opened the envelope to allocate the participants to either
      intervention or control group. The participants of intervention group remained with the
      researcher to receive the intervention.

      The educational programme consisted of four booklets entitled 1. Percutaneous Transluminal
      Coronary Angioplasty, 2. Going home after your coronary angioplasty, 3. How to take care of
      your heart and your health, and 4. How to practice physical activities. The educational
      programme included the telephone follow-up that contained three calls to motivate the
      participants to change their lifestyle and clarify doubts. The contents of the booklets were
      explained step by step to the participants by the researcher who conducted the interviews.

    <description>The &quot;Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity&quot; was developed by Baecke, Burema and Frijters (1982) and validated for the Brazilian population by Florindo et al. (2004, 2006). The instrument has three dimensions: occupational physical activity (eight questions), physical activity during leisure time (four questions) and leisure and locomotion activities (four questions), totaling 16 questions. Higher scores indicate a higher level of physical activity. This questionnaire was used to collect the data at baseline and five to seven months after hospital discharge.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&quot; was developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and validated and adapted to Portuguese by Botega et al. (1995). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale contains 14 multiple choice questions, divided into two subscales: anxiety and depression (composed of seven items each). Higher scores indicate more symptoms of anxiety and depression. This questionnaire was used to collect the data at baseline and five to seven months after hospital discharge.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Medical Outcomes Survey 36 - Item Short-Form&quot; developed by Ware and Sherboune (1992). The investigators used the version licensed by Quality Metric Incorporated (MARUISH, 2011) for use in surveys in Brazil. The Medical Outcomes Survey 36 - Item Short-Form is a multidimensional questionnaire composed of 36 items that evaluate eight health concepts: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects, mental health and a comparative question that evaluate the current health conditions with one year ago. Higher values indicate better perceived health status. This questionnaire was used to collect the data at baseline and five to seven months after hospital discharge.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Escala de Autoeficácia Para Prática de Atividade Física&quot; developed by Rech et al. (2011) for Brazilian adults and by Borges et al. (2015) that used in the elderly population. This questionnaire was elaborated from two specific scales of self-efficacy for the practice of physical exercise, proposed by Sallis et al. (1988) and Bandura (2006). We used the Brazilian adult version (RECH et al., 2011) which contains two domains with five items each in which the answers are dichotomous ( &quot;no&quot; versus &quot;yes&quot;). Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy for physical activity. The instrument was used to collect the data at baseline and five to seven months after hospital discharge.</description>
