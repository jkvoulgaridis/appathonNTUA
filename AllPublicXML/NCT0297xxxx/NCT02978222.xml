  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel groups Phase II trial. Patients with
      platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer, defined as a lack of progression by RECIST v1.1
      criteria following completion of standard-of-care chemotherapy, including a minimum of 4
      cycles of a platinum-containing regimen. Patients will be randomized to either the vaccine
      regimen with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF adjuvant alone as a control group. Treatment will be
      administered as a consolidation therapy within one year of the last administration of
      platinum, targeting the first remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter double-blind controlled randomized Phase II study to evaluate the
      activity of folate receptor alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine as a consolidation treatment
      following completion of no less than 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen in patients
      with platinum-sensitive, non-mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      The patients will have demonstrated a tumor response or stable disease upon their last
      regimen (per RECIST v1.1 and/or CA125 GCIG criteria) prior to enrolment in this study.

      Following randomization, patients will be administered TPIV200 with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF
      control alone. Patients will have booster doses and tumor assessments done every 12 weeks ± 1
      week for up to 1.5 years, until objective disease progression or the patient withdraws
      consent. Tumor responses will be assessed at the study sites by evaluating tumor images/scans
      according to RECIST v1.1.

             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results

         12. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis requiring concurrent treatment, inclusive
             of but not limited to surgery, radiation and/or corticosteroids
