    <measure>Change From Pain Free State (Day 3) in Error Adjusted Simple Reaction Time (SRT) in the Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post-treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Error adjusted SRT was one of the main outcomes of the Axon Sports Priming Application. The Axon Sports Priming Application is a computerized test performed on a tablet device that measures cognitive performance, namely psychomotor speed. Axon sports test assessment included 1. Pain-state assessment performed at Visit 2 (Day 2 pre-treatment assessment and post-treatment assessment 1hour [hr] ± 15 minutes [mins] post-dosing) and 2. Pain-free assessment performed at Visit 3 (Day 3).</description>

    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Reaction Time in the Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post-treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The reaction time of five-choice reaction time task (provided by Cambridge Cognition) was measured. In five-choice reaction time task, all the participants hold down a button at the bottom of the screen till a yellow spot appears in one of the five circles at the top of the screen. Participants then released the button and touch inside of the circle where the yellow spot appeared as quickly as they can. The median duration, between the onset of the stimulus and the release of the button, was recorded as reaction time. Calculated for correct, assessed trials where the stimulus appeared in any one of five locations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Number of One Touch Stockings (OTS) of Cambridge Assessment Problems (on Which the First Box Choice Made Was Correct) in the Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>OTS was a measure of executive function and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The participant was shown two displays containing three coloured balls. The displays were presented in such a way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam. There was a row of numbered boxes along the bottom of the screen. The test administrator first demonstrated to the participant how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display, and completed one demonstration problem, where the solution requires one move. The participant then completed three further problems, one each of two moves, three moves, and four moves. Next, the participant was shown further problems, and participants worked out in their head how many moves the solutions to these problems required, and then touch the appropriate box at the bottom of the screen to indicate their response.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Attention Switching Task (AST) Congruency Cost in the Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>AST was a measure of executive attention. The test displayed an arrow which can appear on either side of the screen and can point in either direction. Each trial displayed a cue at the top of the screen that indicates whether to press the right or left button. Some trials displayed congruent stimuli (e.g. arrow on the right side of the screen pointing to the right) whereas other trials display incongruent stimuli which require a higher cognitive demand (e.g. arrow on the right side of the screen pointing to the left). The AST congruency cost was the difference between the median latencies of response (from stimulus appearance to button press) on the trials that were congruent versus the trials that were incongruent. It was calculated by subtracting the median of congruent from incongruent latency. A positive score indicated response was faster on congruent trials and a negative score indicated response was faster on incongruent trials.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Between Errors in the Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>SWM task was a measure of working memory. The task involved number of coloured squares (boxes) being shown on the screen. The aim of this test was to find one blue token in the boxes shown to the participants by process of elimination and used these to fill up an empty column on the right-hand side of the screen. The number of boxes gradually increased up to a maximum of eight boxes to search and the colour and position of the boxes changed from trial to trial. SWM between errors was defined as times the participant revisited a box in which a token has previously been found. This was calculated for trials of four, six and eight tokens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Rapid Visual Information Processing A Prime (RVPA) in the Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>RVP task was measures of attention. A white box appeared in the centre of the computer screen, inside which digits, from 2 to 9, appeared in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants were requested to detect target sequences of digits (for example, 2-4-6, 3-5-7, 4-6-8) and to register responses using the press pad. The RVPA (A prime) was the signal detection measure of sensitivity to the target, regardless of response tendency (the expected range will be 0.00 to 1.00; bad to good). RVP metric was a measure of how good the subject was at detecting target sequences.</description>

    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Grip Force in Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post-treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>This task was a measure of grip strength. The participant held the dynamometer in their dominant hand and the arm was swung from above the head to by the side of the body. If the dominant arm or hand was painful then the non-dominant hand was used. The participant was instructed to assert maximum effort during the squeezing motion and maintain it for about 4 seconds using a metronome. Participant conducted the movement 4-times (1 practice effort and 3 test efforts) and there was a 1-minute recovery period between each effort.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Time to Standing in Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Time to standing provides a simple assessment of physical mobility. From a seated position with arms crossed so that the right hand is placed on the left shoulder and the left hand on the right shoulder, participants stood to a fully erect stature in as short a time as possible. Time to standing recorded which was measured using a stopwatch. Participants conducted the same movement 3-times continuously as a practice effort and 5-times continuously as a test effort at each visit. There was a 1-minute rest between the practice and test effort.</description>

    <measure>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Contact Phase in Pain State (Day 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (pre and post treatment) and Day 3 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Participants performed a walking assessment in comfortable walking shoes to measure gait parameter contact phase. An athletic movement analysis system (Optojump, Microgate) was utilized which set up over a 15 meters (m) length of track with only the 5-10m section measured and analysed. Participants were instructed to walk the 15m length a minimum of 6 times (3 practice and a minimum of 3 test walks) always entering the 15m length with the same foot first. The foot (left or right) entering the 5-10m section first was recorded by visual assessment of the Optojump operator for the test walks. Test walks were repeated until there were 3 walks in which the participants have entered the 5-10m section with the same foot first.</description>

        <description>The reaction time of five-choice reaction time task (provided by Cambridge Cognition) was measured. In five-choice reaction time task, all the participants hold down a button at the bottom of the screen till a yellow spot appears in one of the five circles at the top of the screen. Participants then released the button and touch inside of the circle where the yellow spot appeared as quickly as they can. The median duration, between the onset of the stimulus and the release of the button, was recorded as reaction time. Calculated for correct, assessed trials where the stimulus appeared in any one of five locations.</description>

        <title>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Number of One Touch Stockings (OTS) of Cambridge Assessment Problems (on Which the First Box Choice Made Was Correct) in the Pain State (Day 2)</title>
        <description>OTS was a measure of executive function and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The participant was shown two displays containing three coloured balls. The displays were presented in such a way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam. There was a row of numbered boxes along the bottom of the screen. The test administrator first demonstrated to the participant how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display, and completed one demonstration problem, where the solution requires one move. The participant then completed three further problems, one each of two moves, three moves, and four moves. Next, the participant was shown further problems, and participants worked out in their head how many moves the solutions to these problems required, and then touch the appropriate box at the bottom of the screen to indicate their response.</description>

        <title>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Attention Switching Task (AST) Congruency Cost in the Pain State (Day 2)</title>
        <description>AST was a measure of executive attention. The test displayed an arrow which can appear on either side of the screen and can point in either direction. Each trial displayed a cue at the top of the screen that indicates whether to press the right or left button. Some trials displayed congruent stimuli (e.g. arrow on the right side of the screen pointing to the right) whereas other trials display incongruent stimuli which require a higher cognitive demand (e.g. arrow on the right side of the screen pointing to the left). The AST congruency cost was the difference between the median latencies of response (from stimulus appearance to button press) on the trials that were congruent versus the trials that were incongruent. It was calculated by subtracting the median of congruent from incongruent latency. A positive score indicated response was faster on congruent trials and a negative score indicated response was faster on incongruent trials.</description>

        <description>SWM task was a measure of working memory. The task involved number of coloured squares (boxes) being shown on the screen. The aim of this test was to find one blue token in the boxes shown to the participants by process of elimination and used these to fill up an empty column on the right-hand side of the screen. The number of boxes gradually increased up to a maximum of eight boxes to search and the colour and position of the boxes changed from trial to trial. SWM between errors was defined as times the participant revisited a box in which a token has previously been found. This was calculated for trials of four, six and eight tokens.</description>

        <description>RVP task was measures of attention. A white box appeared in the centre of the computer screen, inside which digits, from 2 to 9, appeared in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants were requested to detect target sequences of digits (for example, 2-4-6, 3-5-7, 4-6-8) and to register responses using the press pad. The RVPA (A prime) was the signal detection measure of sensitivity to the target, regardless of response tendency (the expected range will be 0.00 to 1.00; bad to good). RVP metric was a measure of how good the subject was at detecting target sequences.</description>

        <description>This task was a measure of grip strength. The participant held the dynamometer in their dominant hand and the arm was swung from above the head to by the side of the body. If the dominant arm or hand was painful then the non-dominant hand was used. The participant was instructed to assert maximum effort during the squeezing motion and maintain it for about 4 seconds using a metronome. Participant conducted the movement 4-times (1 practice effort and 3 test efforts) and there was a 1-minute recovery period between each effort.</description>

        <title>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Contact Phase in Pain State (Day 2)</title>
        <description>Participants performed a walking assessment in comfortable walking shoes to measure gait parameter contact phase. An athletic movement analysis system (Optojump, Microgate) was utilized which set up over a 15 meters (m) length of track with only the 5-10m section measured and analysed. Participants were instructed to walk the 15m length a minimum of 6 times (3 practice and a minimum of 3 test walks) always entering the 15m length with the same foot first. The foot (left or right) entering the 5-10m section first was recorded by visual assessment of the Optojump operator for the test walks. Test walks were repeated until there were 3 walks in which the participants have entered the 5-10m section with the same foot first.</description>

        <title>Change From Pain-free State (Day 3) in Walking Speed in Pain State (Day 2)</title>
        <description>Participants performed a walking assessment in comfortable walking shoes to measure gait parameter walking speed over 5-10m for each foot. An athletic movement analysis system (Optojump, Microgate) was utilized which set up over a 15 meters (m) length of track with only the 5-10m section measured and analysed. Participants were instructed to walk the 15m length a minimum of 6 times (3 practice and a minimum of 3 test walks) always entering the 15m length with the same foot first. The foot (left or right) entering the 5-10m section first was recorded by visual assessment of the Optojump operator for the test walks. Test walks were repeated until there were 3 walks in which the participants have entered the 5-10m section with the same foot first.</description>
