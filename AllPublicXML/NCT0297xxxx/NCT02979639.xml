  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals'
      HZ/su vaccine on Quality of Life (QoL) in adults ≥ 50 years of age
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the impact of HZ/su vaccination on the QoL, 400 adults ≥ 50 years of
      age (YOA). Subjects will be asked to respond to a series of SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires
      before and after vaccination following a 2 month schedule. To estimate the impact of
      reactogenicity on an individual's physical functioning (PF) and QoL, the study will compare
      subject questionnaire responses made during two periods, i.e., pre-vaccination and
      post-vaccination. The difference will be considered to be the effect of vaccination and
      reactogenicity on the PF and QoL. To characterize the study population and determine if
      frailty may influence reactogenicity and consequently the impact on QoL scores, the subjects'
      frailty status will be assessed at the first inclusion visit. In addition to the SF-36 and
      EQ-5D questionnaires, a more complete characterization of the reactogenicity of the vaccine
      will be made by including a detailed collection of the use of healthcare resources and the
      occurrence of symptoms through diary card data collection. Impact on days of work loss, both
      for the subject or for a caregiver, as applicable, will also be assessed.

      Note that as a result of internal change in data standards terminology, the study data
      collected was converted to cDISC and the statistical analysis plan was amended accordingly.
      &quot;Day 0&quot; in the study design was replaced by &quot;Day 1&quot;; consequently, &quot;Day n&quot; was replaced by
      &quot;Day n+1&quot;. Thus, the timeframes (Day 0, Day n) of Outcome Measures described in this study
      record are different to that denoted in the full protocol document posted.

        <description>Descriptive analysis of the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the change from baseline of the SF-36 physical functioning (PF) score pre- and post dose 1 overall. Changes in the score were measured as Baseline versus mean score over the period Day 2 to Day 8 after first vaccination. Baseline for dose 1 is defined as the mean of the assessments at Day -7 and Day 1. The post-vaccination completion of SF-36 questionnaires brought home by the subjects were Days 2 to 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site. The SF-36 scale scores are constructed following the summated ratings of the questions and standardized SF-36 scoring algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning.</description>

Changes in the score were measured as Baseline versus mean score over the period Day 2 to Day 8 after second vaccination. For dose 2 baseline is defined as the mean of the three assessments at Day -7, Day 1 and Day 61 (Day 1 for dose 2). The post-vaccination completion of SF-36 questionnaires brought home by the subjects were on Day 2 to Day 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site.

          <title>Change in Mean SF-36 PF Scale Scores From Baseline Score to Mean Score After Second Dose</title>
          <description>Descriptive analysis of the mean and standard deviation of the change from baseline of the SF-36 PF scale score pre and post dose 2 overall. Changes in the score were measured as Baseline versus mean score over the period Day 2 to Day 8 after second vaccination. For dose 2 baseline is defined as the mean of the three assessments at Day -7, Day 1 and Day 61 (Day 1 for dose 2). The post-vaccination completion of SF-36 questionnaires brought home by the subjects were on Day 2 to Day 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site. The SF-36 scale scores are constructed following the summated ratings of the questions and standardized SF-36 scoring algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean SF-36 PF Single Item Scores After First Dose</title>
        <description>Descriptive analysis of the change in mean SF-36 PF single item score from baseline. Changes in the score were measured as Baseline versus mean score over the period Day 2 to Day 8 after the first vaccination. Baseline for dose 1 is defined as the mean of the assessments at Day -7 and Day 1. The post-vaccination completion of SF-36 questionnaires brought home by the subjects were Days 2 to 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site. The SF-36 scale scores are constructed following the summated ratings of the questions and standardized SF-36 scoring algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning. Among items are vigorous activities (running, lifting heavy objects, participating in strenuous sports), moderate activities (moving a table, pushing a vaccum cleaner, bowling, or playing golf) and others, described in the categories below.</description>

          <title>Change in SF-36 Role Physical Scores After First Dose</title>
          <description>Descriptive analysis. SF-36 Role physical scores change was measured from baseline score. Baseline versus mean score on Day 8 after first vaccination. Baseline for dose 1 is defined as the mean of the assessments at Day -7 and Day 1. The post-vaccination completion of SF-36 questionnaires brought home by the subjects were on Day 2 to Day 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site. The SF-36 scale scores are constructed following the summated ratings of the questions and standardized SF-36 scoring algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36 Role Physical Scores After Second Dose</title>
        <description>Descriptive analysis. SF-36 Role Physical scores change was measured from baseline score. Changes in the score were measured as Baseline versus Day 8 score after the second vaccination. For dose 2 baseline is defined as the mean of the three assessments at Day -7, Day 1 and Day 61 (equivalent to Day 1 for dose 2) The post-vaccination completion of SF-36 questionnaires brought home by the subjects were on Day 2 to Day 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site. The SF-36 scale scores are constructed following the summated ratings of the questions and standardized SF-36 scoring algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality-adjusted Life Year (QALY) After First Dose</title>
        <description>Descriptive analysis. QALY estimation is done from baseline score, based on EQ-5D questionnaires. Baseline versus combined score over the period Day 2 to Day 8 after each vaccination. Baseline for dose 1 is defined as the mean of the assessments at Day -7 and Day 1. The post-vaccination completion of EQ-5D questionnaires brought home by the subjects were on Day 2 to Day 7, with Day 8 to be filled in at the site. The EQ-5D is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple description profile based on 5 items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, which are used to generate the EQ-5D index utility score. The EQ-5D index utility score ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state); 1 reflects the best outcome.</description>
