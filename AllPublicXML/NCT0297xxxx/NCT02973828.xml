      In radiotherapy high-tech scans with x-rays (CT scans) are taken before and during treatment
      to locate the tumour and ensure the radiation is hitting the target.

      These x-rays expose patients to additional radiation and the quality of these scans is often
      poor which makes it difficult to distinguish tumour from normal tissue and there may be
      uncertainty in the tumour position due to movement or shrinkage. To allow for these
      uncertainties a large margin around the tumour is also treated, but this means that large
      volumes of normal tissue also receive significant doses of radiation, which can result in
      early and late toxicity.

      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is better than CT scanning at being able to tell the
      difference between tumour and normal tissues and does not expose patients to additional
      radiation. A new machine called an MR Linac (or magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear
      accelerator) integrates high quality MRI with a state-of-the-art radiotherapy machine and the
      Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)/The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) are currently
      installation a prototype, which will be one of the first in the world. This revolutionary
      technology has the potential to change the way radiotherapy is delivered. We hope the
      improved precision and accuracy in hitting the target will mean reductions in margins around
      tumours and that this will lead to higher cure rates with significantly fewer side effects.
      Studies are required to simulate treatment on the MR Linac before it can be used in routine
      clinical practice and to conduct these studies, we need to obtain MRI scans on volunteers and
      patients who are currently undergoing treatment. This study will involve imaging with MRI in
      healthy volunteers as well as in patient volunteers before and during their standard course
      of radiotherapy to allow us to develop MRI sequences derived on the MR Linac for MR
      Linac-based research focusing on clinical application and establishment into a MR-CT and MR
      only workflow, treatment adaptation and quality assurance.

      This is a study protocol for the acquisition of MR Linac derived images with a view to MRIgRT
      for patients undergoing radiotherapy with radical intent at sites predicted to benefit most
      from MRIgRT (namely, for rectum, cervix, lung, prostate, bladder, breast, brain, oesophagus,
      head and neck, hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) and paediatric abdomino-thoracic cancers).
      These will be used to build a database of MR images for MR Linac-based research focusing on
      clinical application and establishment into a MR-CT and MR only workflow, treatment
      adaptation and quality assurance. The primary aims are to 1) develop MR Linac image sequences
      suitable for seeing tumour/target and normal tissue at the time of radiotherapy and 2)
      determine variations in image registrations and tissue contouring using the MR Linac images.
      Four stages of imaging development sub-studies will be included in this protocol for
      optimisation of MR imaging on the MR Linac. Consideration will be given to image quality,
      scan times, and IT requirements for reconstruction, storage and image transfer.

      These imaging sub-studies will be:

      A) Non-patient Volunteer Imaging Studies of Normal Tissue (n = 18 - 54 per centre). The four
      anatomical regions selected to be studied are Head and neck, Thorax (chest wall/breast and
      lung/oesophagus), Abdomen and Pelvis (male and female). Recruitment will continue until
      imaging from a minimum of three consecutive patients using the same 'exam card' are deemed to
      be acceptable for normal tissue visualisation for each anatomical site.

      B) Patient Volunteer Imaging Studies of Normal Tissue (n = 39 - 72 per centre). We will
      further develop the protocols to visualise site specific tumours in 13 target areas (brain,
      oropharynx/larynx/hypopharynx, oesophagus, lung, chest wall _+/- regional lymph nodes),
      paediatric abdomen-thoracic cancers, hepatobiliary tract, bladder, gynaecology, prostate,
      rectum, oligomets bone and oliogmets soft tissue). Patients will be recruited for imaging for
      a minimum of one and maximum of 12 imaging sessions whilst undergoing radiotherapy planning
      and/or radiotherapy treatment. Repeat imaging will allow for the determination of protocol
      robustness. The aim will be to produce images appropriate for tumour and normal tissue
      visualisation with a view to directing radiotherapy. Recruitment will continue until imaging
      from a minimum of three consecutive patients using the same 'exam card' are deemed to be
      acceptable for tumour/target visualisation at each site.

      C) Pathway development studies (n = 39 - 208 per centre). At each centre, it is estimated
      that 16 imaging sessions per tumour site are required for inter and intra registration
      observer variability. To establish library of images to be used to develop adaptive
      radiotherapy workflows, up to 50 imaging sessions may be required depending on the tumour
      site. Images for normal tissue and tumour visualisation will also be used to refine exam
      cards from Stage B.

      This stage requires a minimum of three patient volunteers to be recruited to each tumour site
      which may (or may not) include images acquired in the previous Stage B of the study, and a
      maximum of 16 patient volunteers to reach the desired number of imaging sessions. Each
      volunteer should undergo a minimum of two and not more than twelve imaging sessions (max
      1/day, 3/week). The methodology of image acquisition will follow methodology for Stage B as
      above. The primary aim will be to establish that both online and offline image-matching using
      MR Linac with a view to guiding radiotherapy treatments can be undertaken with minimal intra
      and inter user variability. Development of treatment workflow to help implement radiotherapy
      treatment on the MR Linac can also be carried out. Refined exam cards from Stage B but fine
      tuning as necessary can be used to acquire sets of images and to use this information to plan
      treatment by simulating an on-line treatment whilst not delivering radiation.

      Section D - On-going image development and continuous quality improvement of images n= up to
      150)

      This stage of the study will run in parallel or subsequent to stages B and C. The purpose
      will be to recruit patient or non-patient volunteers to help optimise MR guided radiotherapy
      delivery e.g investigate radiotherapy immobilisation and equipment for patient positioning
      and set up development and/or development of new/novel imaging sequences, optimisation of
      existing sequences and undertaking continuing image quality improvement.
