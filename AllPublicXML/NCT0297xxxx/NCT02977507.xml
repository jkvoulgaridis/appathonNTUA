    <measure>Change From Baseline in Melasma Severity Rating Scale Score to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assessed the participant's facial skin for the severity of symmetrical facial melasma on the left and the right side of the face using the Melasma Severity Rating Scale. The score ranges from 0 to 3, where 0=Cleared: color of melasma lesions approximately equivalent to surrounding normal skin or with minimal residual hyperpigmentation, 1=Mild: color slightly darker than the surrounding normal skin, 2=Moderate: color moderately darker than the surrounding normal skin and 3=Severe: color markedly darker than the surrounding normal skin. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Hyperpigmentation Scale Score to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assessed the participant's left and right facial sides for overall hyperpigmentation using the Overall Hyperpigmentation ten-point scale ranging from 0 to 9, where Score 0=None, skin is normal in color with no evidence of hyperpigmentation; Score 1, 2 or 3=Mild, several brown spots with increased pigmentation, they are small in size and slightly darker than surrounding skin; Score 4, 5 or 6=Moderate, many brown spots with increased pigmentation, they are medium in size and much darker than surrounding skin; Score of 7, 8 or 9=Severe, many large brown spots with increased pigmentation, they are large in size and markedly darker than surrounding skin. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) Score to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assigned a grade for the left and right facial sides for each of the following: A=Total Area Involved (0=No involvement to 6=90 to 100% involvement); D=Darkness of Pigment (0=Normal skin color to 4=Severe hyperpigmentation); and H=Homogeneity (0=Normal skin color without evidence of hyperpigmentation to 4=Uniform skin involvement without any clear areas). Total Half-Face MASI score was calculated as: Half Forehead 0.15(D+H)A + One Malar Side 0.3 (D+H)A + Half Chin 0.05(D+H)A. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's Global Improvement Assessment for Overall Hyperpigmentation Score to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator's global improvement assessment score was used for assessment of overall hyperpigmentation on the left and right facial sides. The score ranged from 0 to 4 where, 0=No change or worsening, 1=Mild improvement (approximately 25% overall improvement), 2=Moderate improvement (approximately 50% overall improvement), 3=Marked improvement (approximately 75% overall improvement), 4=Complete clearing/Dramatic improvement (approximately 95% plus overall improvement). The mean score for overall hyperpigmentation was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mexameter Measurement of Target Hyperpigmentation Lesion to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Two target hyperpigmented lesions were selected from the left and the right malar facial areas and were measured by the mexameter, an instrument that measures melanin content. One target &quot;normal&quot; measurement was also taken from an unaffected skin area on the face representing normal skin. The values from the target hyperpigmented lesions were compared to the normal lesion value. The range of melamin index and erythema is 0 to 999 Arbitrary Units (AU). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Melasma Severity Rating Scale Score to Week 12</title>
        <description>The investigator assessed the participant's facial skin for the severity of symmetrical facial melasma on the left and the right side of the face using the Melasma Severity Rating Scale. The score ranges from 0 to 3, where 0=Cleared: color of melasma lesions approximately equivalent to surrounding normal skin or with minimal residual hyperpigmentation, 1=Mild: color slightly darker than the surrounding normal skin, 2=Moderate: color moderately darker than the surrounding normal skin and 3=Severe: color markedly darker than the surrounding normal skin. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The investigator assigned a grade for the left and right facial sides for each of the following: A=Total Area Involved (0=No involvement to 6=90 to 100% involvement); D=Darkness of Pigment (0=Normal skin color to 4=Severe hyperpigmentation); and H=Homogeneity (0=Normal skin color without evidence of hyperpigmentation to 4=Uniform skin involvement without any clear areas). Total Half-Face MASI score was calculated as: Half Forehead 0.15(D+H)A + One Malar Side 0.3 (D+H)A + Half Chin 0.05(D+H)A. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Investigator's Global Improvement Assessment for Overall Hyperpigmentation Score to Week 12</title>
        <description>Investigator's global improvement assessment score was used for assessment of overall hyperpigmentation on the left and right facial sides. The score ranged from 0 to 4 where, 0=No change or worsening, 1=Mild improvement (approximately 25% overall improvement), 2=Moderate improvement (approximately 50% overall improvement), 3=Marked improvement (approximately 75% overall improvement), 4=Complete clearing/Dramatic improvement (approximately 95% plus overall improvement). The mean score for overall hyperpigmentation was reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mexameter Measurement of Target Hyperpigmentation Lesion to Week 12</title>
        <description>Two target hyperpigmented lesions were selected from the left and the right malar facial areas and were measured by the mexameter, an instrument that measures melanin content. One target &quot;normal&quot; measurement was also taken from an unaffected skin area on the face representing normal skin. The values from the target hyperpigmented lesions were compared to the normal lesion value. The range of melamin index and erythema is 0 to 999 Arbitrary Units (AU). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
