  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of withdrawing amifampridine phosphate treatment from
      patients with LEMS. One half of the patients will continue to receive amifampridine phosphate
      and the other half will receive placebo, during this double-blind study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, withdrawal
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients
      diagnosed with LEMS. The study was planned to include approximately 28 male and female
      patients.

      Prior to the study, patients were receiving unblinded treatment in the expanded access
      program (EAP-001). Patients had to be on a stable dose and frequency of amifampridine
      phosphate for at least 1 week prior to randomization into LMS-003. Screening and
      randomization (Day 0) may have been into a single visit.

      Patients who met eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1 to amifampridine phosphate (at the
      patient's optimal dose) or placebo on Day 0.

      Baseline assessments were obtained on Study Day 0, while the patient has been on open-label
      amifampridine phosphate and in relationship to the usual dosing schedule. Patients took
      blinded study medication on Day 1 through Day 3. On Day 4, a dose of blinded study medication
      was administered by the site study personnel. This was the same medication that the patient
      took on Day 1 through Day 3. The assessments listed below were performed following either the
      second, third, or fourth dose of medication taken on Day 4, and this should be the same dose
      after which Day 0 assessments were performed. For example, if the patient took their second
      dose of amifampridine in the clinic on Day 0 and had assessments started 40 minutes later,
      then on Day 4, that patient should be assessed after taking their second dose of
      investigational product (IP).

      Beginning with the next dose after all Day 0 baseline assessments were completed, the patient
      received IP through Day 4, with a clinic visit on the last day (Day 4) for assessments.

      The planned duration of participation for each patient was up to 12 days, including screening
      (up to 7 days), Day 0 assessments and randomization, and IP administration (Day 1 through Day
      4).

    <measure>Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in QMG score at end of day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The QMG is a physician-rated test including 13 assessments such as facial strength, swallowing, grip strength, and duration of time that limbs can be maintained in outstretched positions. Each assessment is graded as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe), for a total range of 0-39. A higher total score indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Impression (SGI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in SGI score at end of day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The SGI is a 7-point scale on which the patient rates their global impression of the effects of a study treatment (1=terrible to 7=delighted). The SGI was assessed by the patient or the patient's parent/guardian/caregiver if the patient was unable to complete the SGI. The SGI has demonstrated concordance with the physician's assessment of improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinician's Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) at Day 4 Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in CGI-I score at end of day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I captures the Investigator's global impression of the patient's improvement or worsening from baseline status. The 7-point scale is scored by the Investigator based on changes in symptoms, behavior, and functional abilities. Each symptom is rated as 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse), or 7 (very much worse). The total score can range from 0 to 49. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Triple Timed Up and Go Walk Test (3TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in 3TUG at end of day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The 3TUG is a functional mobility test that requires a patient to stand up from a straight-backed armchair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back, and sit down in the chair. A modification of this is where the individual performs the test 3 times without pause, and the measurement is the average time required to complete each of the 3 repetitions. Based upon literature reports that a significant change in gait for a similar walk-test is an increase in time of more than 20%, this has been incorporated into the endpoint.</description>

        <description>The QMG is a physician-rated test including 13 assessments such as facial strength, swallowing, grip strength, and duration of time that limbs can be maintained in outstretched positions. Each assessment is graded as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe), for a total range of 0-39. A higher total score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The CGI-I captures the Investigator's global impression of the patient's improvement or worsening from baseline status. The 7-point scale is scored by the Investigator based on changes in symptoms, behavior, and functional abilities. Each symptom is rated as 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse), or 7 (very much worse). The total score can range from 0 to 49. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Triple Timed Up and Go Walk Test (3TUG)</title>
        <description>The 3TUG is a functional mobility test that requires a patient to stand up from a straight-backed armchair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back, and sit down in the chair. A modification of this is where the individual performs the test 3 times without pause, and the measurement is the average time required to complete each of the 3 repetitions. Based upon literature reports that a significant change in gait for a similar walk-test is an increase in time of more than 20%, this has been incorporated into the endpoint.</description>
