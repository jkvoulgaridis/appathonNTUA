    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of participation in Cancer Clear and Simple
      (CC&amp;S) educational sessions on cancer prevention and screening. The researchers will recruit
      60 community members: 30 will receive CC&amp;S training (intervention group) and 30 will not
      (control group). All 60 will be surveyed about their intent to change their behavior at the
      beginning of the study and their actual behavior changes and their screening behavior 6
      months after enrollment in the study.

    <description>Once participants are randomized, they will be given survey 1. The intervention group in the community will be exposed to the modified CC&amp;S educational sessions in a series of 2 one hour and 15 minute sessions on consecutive Monday nights. A free meal will be provided at both educational sessions. Childcare will be provided for community sessions. Once the final educational session is completed, all participants will be given survey 2.</description>

    <description>Once participants are randomized, they will be given survey 1. The intervention group at ACEC (Adams-Columbia Electric Company) will be exposed to the modified CC&amp;S educational sessions in a series of 6 thirty minute sessions before the work day begins over the course of several weeks. The researchers anticipate that two sessions will occur per week and therefore the delivery of the whole intervention will take 3 weeks. A free meal will be provided at all 6 educational sessions. Once the final educational session is completed, all participants will be given survey 2.</description>
