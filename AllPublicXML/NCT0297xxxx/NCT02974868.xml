    <measure>Change From Baseline in Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week24</time_frame>
    <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. Score range: 0-100%. Higher score indicates more severe disease. Change from baseline is defined as the baseline value minus the value at a specific visit. Positive change from baseline signifies an improvement. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 28 up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An AE (non-serious and serious) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Any such events with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment were counted as treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). Treatment-related TEAE were determined by investigators. Arms end with &quot;withdrawal Segment&quot; and &quot;retreatment segment&quot; described the same population while in different treatment segment .The reason why count on PF-06700841 differ by 1 participant is that 1 responder directly entered the retreatment segment and skipped the withdrawal segment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (All-causality and Treatment-related) - Single-Blind Extension (SBE) Period</title>
        <description>An AE (non-serious and serious) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Any such events with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment were counted as treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). Treatment-related TEAE were determined by investigators. Arms end with &quot;withdrawal Segment&quot; and &quot;retreatment segment&quot; described the same population while in different treatment segment .The reason why count on PF-06700841 differ by 1 participant is that 1 responder directly entered the retreatment segment and skipped the withdrawal segment.</description>

Any such events with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment were counted as treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT 30 at Week 24</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 30 response is a 30% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Across Time (Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100% with higher score indicates more severe disease. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1). Change from baseline is defined as the baseline value minus the value at a specific visit. Positive change from baseline implies an improvement. Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval of Arms (PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) are the Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval for difference from placebo respectively.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Across Time (Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100% with higher score indicates more severe disease. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1). Percent change from baseline is defined as SALT baseline value minus SALT value at a specific visit divided by baseline and multiplying by 100. Positive change from baseline implies an improvement. Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval of Arms (PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) are the Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval for difference from placebo respectively.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT 30 Across Time (Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 30 response is a 30% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 75 response is a 75% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT 100 Across Time (Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 100 response is a 100% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <description>An AE (non-serious and serious) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Any such events with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment were counted as treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). Treatment-related TEAE were determined by investigators.</description>

        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100% with higher score indicates more severe disease. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1). Change from baseline is defined as the baseline value minus the value at a specific visit. Positive change from baseline implies an improvement.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT 30 Across Time (SBE Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 30 response is a 30% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 for non-responders, and AT Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 for retreated responders.(AT=active treatment)</time_frame>
        <population>All participants in the Full analysis set (FAS) was used. FAS consisted of all randomized participants, assigned to the randomized treatment regardless of what treatment, if any, was received.</population>

          <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 30 response is a 30% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT 75 Across Time (SBE Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 75 response is a 75% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT 90 Across Time (SBE Period)</title>
        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 90 response is a 90% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>

        <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 100 response is a 100% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.</description>
