  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation (heterotopic ossification or HO) in muscles, tendons, and
      ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue
      trauma, vaccinations, or influenza infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict
      movement by locking joints leading to cumulative loss of function and disability. Mouse
      models of FOP have demonstrated the ability of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonists
      such as palovarotene (PVO) to prevent HO following injury. Study PVO-1A-201 as well as up to
      two new adult subjects were followed for up to 24 months. Subjects who participated under
      Amendment 1 will be followed for up to an additional 36 months. No new subjects will be
      enrolled.

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this Phase 2, open-label study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of different palovarotene dosing regimens in subjects with FOP in France. Efficacy will be
      assessed based on the ability of palovarotene to prevent the formation of new heterotopic
      ossification (HO) as assessed by low-dose whole body computed tomography (WBCT) scan,
      excluding head.

      All subjects will be treated with 5 mg palovarotene daily (weight adjusted dose for
      skeletally immature subjects) for up to 36 months. Site visits will occur at
      baseline/screening and at Study Months 12, 24 and 36; subjects will also be contacted by
      telephone every 3 months.

      In the event of an eligible flare-up, Adult Cohort subjects will receive 20 mg palovarotene
      daily for 28 days, followed by 10 mg for 56 days. Dosing may be extended if the flare-up is
      not resolved by Flare-up Day 84 and continue until the flare-up resolves (at the
      end-of-treatment (EOT)). Dose reduction, as directed by the Investigator, may occur in the
      event of intolerable side effects.

      The flare-up based dosing regimen for Pediatric Cohort subjects (those under 18 years) will
      be the same as for Adult Cohort subjects except doses will adjusted for weight.

      All weight-based dosing will cease when subjects are 18 years old, but radiographic
      assessment of the growth plate will continue until these subjects achieve 100% skeletal
      maturity at both knee and hand/wrist locations.
