  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy and safety
      of amlodipine besylate on renal and vascular function in subjects with existing hypertension
      requiring antihypertensive therapy.

      Kitov Pharma Ltd. (Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug product
      (FCDP) consisting of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate and the nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib, as a &quot;convenience reformulation&quot; FCDP to facilitate
      and improve patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual
      components, amlodipine and celecoxib.

      The formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a
      single immediate release tablet. However, for this study (KIT-302-03-02), commercial
      celecoxib capsules (Celebrex®) and commercial amlodipine besylate tablets (Norvasc®) were
      separately over-encapsulated (OE) and matched placebos were used to allow for blinding.

      Kitov completed a phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension
      (KIT-302-03-01) demonstrating that the amlodipine + celecoxib combination was statistically
      non-inferior to amlodipine monotherapy with regard to reduction of blood pressure. Further,
      trends towards superior blood pressure lowering effects and improved renal function were
      observed for the combination. This study (KIT-302-03-02) was conducted to quantify the
      beneficial renovascular effects noted in the prior study in subjects with existing
      hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.

      On May 31, 2018, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KIT-302,
      under the brand name Consensi® (amlodipine and celecoxib) tablets [New Drug Application (NDA)
      210045] for the following indication: &quot;patients for whom treatment with amlodipine for
      hypertension and celecoxib for osteoarthritis are appropriate. Lowering blood pressure
      reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and
      myocardial infarctions.&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      effect of celecoxib on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in subjects
      with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. Approximately 105 eligible
      subjects were to be randomized 3:3:1 to one of three treatment arms.

      Arm 1:OE 10 mg Norvasc tablet+OE 200 mg Celebrex capsule (amlodipine+celecoxib arm)

      Arm 2:OE 10 mg Norvasc tablet+matched placebo for OE Celebrex capsule (amlodipine+placebo
      arm)

      Arm 3:Matched placebo for OE Norvasc tablet+matched placebo for OE Celebrex capsule
      (placebo+placebo arm).

      Following an up to 14-day screening phase, eligible subjects were randomized to one of the 3
      treatment arms. All drugs were to be administered orally qd for 14 days for a total of 14
      doses. Visits at the clinic took place at the start and at the end of the screening phase, at
      Study Day 0 (start of treatment), Day 6, Day 7, Day 13 (end of treatment), Day 14 and Day 28
      (end of follow-up).

    <measure>Change in Average Daytime (9:00 to 21:00) Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBPday)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>An ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) fitted to upper arm was used for continuous recording of blood pressure over three 25-hour periods: Days -1 to 0 (Baseline), Days 6 to 7, &amp; Days 13 to 14. The ABPM recorded blood pressure every 20 minutes between 09:00 and 21:59 and every 30 minutes between 22:00 and 08:59. SBPday was calculated by averaging all of the systolic blood pressure measurements between the protocol-defined first &amp; last study measurements of the period that fell between 9:00 and 21:00; measurements during the first hour (white-coat window) were not included. Change in SBPday was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of study value (Day 13 to Day 14 period). If the Day 13 to Day 14 value was not available, the Day 6 to Day 7 value was used [last observation carried forward (LOCF) method]. A negative value for change in SBPday indicates a decrease in systolic blood pressure and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight was measured at the Initial Screening Visit (Day -10 to -14), at Baseline (Day 0), and at Days 7 and 14. The measurements were made using a calibrated scale with the subject wearing underwear and a light gown. Change in body weight was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of treatment value (recorded on Day 14). If the Day 14 value was not available, the Day 7 value was used (LOCF method). A negative value for change in body weight indicates a decrease in body weight and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>An ABPM fitted to upper arm was used for continuous recording of blood pressure over three 25-hour periods: Days -1 to 0 (Baseline), Days 6 to 7, &amp; Days 13 to 14. The ABPM recorded blood pressure every 20 minutes between 09:00 and 21:59 and every 30 minutes between 22:00 and 08:59. SBP24h was calculated by averaging all of the systolic blood pressure measurements between the protocol-defined first &amp; last study measurements of the period; measurements during the first hour (white-coat window) were not included. Change in SBP24h was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of study value (Day 13 to Day 14 period). If the Day 13 to Day 14 value was not available, the Day 6 to Day 7 value was used (LOCF method). A negative value for change in SBP24h indicates a decrease in systolic blood pressure and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>

    <measure>Change in Average 24-hour Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP24h)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>An ABPM fitted to upper arm was used for continuous recording of blood pressure over three 25-hour periods: Days -1 to 0 (Baseline), Days 6 to 7, &amp; Days 13 to 14. The ABPM recorded blood pressure every 20 minutes between 09:00 and 21:59 and every 30 minutes between 22:00 and 08:59. DBP24h was calculated by averaging all of the diastolic blood pressure measurements between the protocol-defined first &amp; last study measurements of the period; measurements during the first hour (white-coat window) were not included. Change in DBP24h was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of study value (Day 13 to Day 14 period). If the Day 13 to Day 14 value was not available, the Day 6 to Day 7 value was used (LOCF method). A negative value for change in DBP24h indicates a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Creatinine Clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects had blood collected for the measurement of creatinine at the Initial Screening Visit (Day -10 to -14), at Baseline (Day 0), and at Days 7 and 14. Estimated creatinine clearance was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation: (140 - age) X body weight (kg)/72 X serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL); multiplied by 0.85 for women. Change in creatinine clearance was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of treatment value (recorded on Day 14). If the Day 14 value was not available, the Day 7 value was used (LOCF method). A negative value for change in creatinine clearance indicates a decrease in creatinine clearance and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>

    <measure>Non-transformed Plasma Concentration of Amlodipine</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post-dose on Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>A venous blood sample was collected 24 hours ± 1 hour after the last dose of study drugs (i.e., on Day 14). The blood sample was processed to plasma and the concentration of amlodipine measured using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The resulting concentrations, without logarithmic transformation, were used for the comparison between the amlodipine+celecoxib and amlodipine+placebo arms to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the mean non-transformed plasma concentrations of amlodipine.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligibility assessments were made at Initial Screening (Day -14 to -10), Final Screening (Day -1), and prior to randomization (Day 0). Subjects who met eligibility criteria at Initial Screening underwent a 10- to 14-day washout from their blood pressure medication and those who continued to meet criteria at the end of the washout were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Average Daytime (9:00 to 21:00) Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBPday)</title>
        <description>An ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) fitted to upper arm was used for continuous recording of blood pressure over three 25-hour periods: Days -1 to 0 (Baseline), Days 6 to 7, &amp; Days 13 to 14. The ABPM recorded blood pressure every 20 minutes between 09:00 and 21:59 and every 30 minutes between 22:00 and 08:59. SBPday was calculated by averaging all of the systolic blood pressure measurements between the protocol-defined first &amp; last study measurements of the period that fell between 9:00 and 21:00; measurements during the first hour (white-coat window) were not included. Change in SBPday was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of study value (Day 13 to Day 14 period). If the Day 13 to Day 14 value was not available, the Day 6 to Day 7 value was used [last observation carried forward (LOCF) method]. A negative value for change in SBPday indicates a decrease in systolic blood pressure and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population = all randomized subjects with a valid Baseline (Day -1 to Day 0) ABPM measurement. The primary endpoint of this trial was a comparison of the mean change in SBPday between the amlodipine+celecoxib and amlodipine+placebo arms (non-inferiority trial). Comparison to placebo+placebo was not part of primary endpoint.</population>

Change in creatinine clearance was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the end of treatment value (recorded on Day 14). If the Day 14 value was not available, the Day 7 value was used (LOCF method). A negative value for change in creatinine clearance indicates a decrease in creatinine clearance and a positive value indicates an increase.</description>
          <population>ITT population [i.e., all randomized subjects with a valid Baseline (Day -1 to Day 0) ABPM measurement]. A secondary endpoint of this trial was the comparison of the mean change in creatinine clearance between the amlodipine+celecoxib and amlodipine+placebo arms (superiority trial). Comparison to placebo+placebo was not part of this endpoint.</population>
