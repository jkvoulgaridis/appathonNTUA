  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sporty performance exhibited by an athlete faces physiological, biomechanical and
      psychological activity of the athlete. It depends on both the psychological state and the
      elevation of the musculoskeletal system to a certain level so that the athlete can perform
      optimally and excellently. For this reason, we aimed to evaluate the musculoskeletal system
      pain of amateur and professional athletes in different disciplines and the psychosocial
      states such as sports confidence, depression and quality of life.

      This study consists of 160 sportsmen who are participating in sports by doing sports in
      soccer, basketball, volleyball, athletics, table tennis, field tennis, kickboxing and archery
      branches between the ages of 15 and 36. The Expanded Scandinavian Muscle Skeleton
      Questionnaire (NMQ) and Visible Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used to identify and assess the
      symptoms of musculoskeletal discomfort as 'pain'. The participant will be evaluated with the
      algometer for identifying their pain threshold, the sporty trust will be questioned with the
      Sporty Trust Continuous Inventory, and the Quality of Life will be assessed with the World
      Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Short Form and Depression will be evaluated with
      Beck Depression Inventory.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Musculoskeletal system pain</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire consists of 11 questions asked from the 9 body regions. The questionnaire firstly questions the pain-pain sensation in the 9 body areas in the form of a yes / no response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>severity of pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); This study will be used to understand how the athlete expresses pain on a 10 cm scale before, during and after training. Using a ruler, the score is about 10-cm in length. It have been recommended: no pain (0 and4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45 mild74 mm), and severe pain (75 :100 mm). the VAS values of the athletes will be questioned for in the resting, before and after the training.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The pain threshold of the right hand and the left hand will be measured in kilograms (kg) with the algometer. A difference of 2 kg between the measured right and left sides, or less than 3 kg of the measured side, indicates that the pain threshold is low and abnormal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sporty confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' sporty confidence will asses by using Continuous Sportive Trust ınventory. This sport-specific inventory consists of a 9-point Likert scale which is engaged in 1 (low) and 9 (high) items from 13 items without sub-components. The level of continuous sporty confidence is obtained by the mean score obtained by collecting the scores of 13 items and dividing them by 13. 1-3 points means low level sporting self-confidence, 4-6 points medium level sporting self-confidence, 7-9 points high level sporting self-confidence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' health Related Quality of Lifequality of life will asses by using World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF). This scale consists of 26 questions that measure overall quality of life and overall health. The other 24 questions are divided into four areas: the physical health title consists of 7 questions, the psychological health title consists of 6 questions, the social relationship title is 3 questions and the environmental health title consists of 8 questions.
Each title is scored independently. Each item is scored on a Likert-type scale from 1 to 5. The scores are then calculated for each quality of life subtitle and converted to 0-100 points. A high score means that the quality of life is high.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' depression will asses by using Beck Depression Inventory. The Beck Depression Inventory was a 21-item self-drawing questionnaire to measure depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations for Beck et al. Its substance has 4 possible answers to a Likert-type scale found between 0 (none) and 3 (irresistible). High scores indicate severe depressive symptoms: 0-13 points or minimal depression, 14-19 mild, 20-28 moderate and 29-63 indicate severe depression level.</description>
