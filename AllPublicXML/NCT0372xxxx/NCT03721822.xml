  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure the extent of lung inflammation between different
      groups of participants using a radioactive tracer called [18F]NOS. A radioactive tracer is a
      type of imaging drug that is labeled with a radioactive tag and injected into the body. This
      study will see how the tracer is taken up in the lungs using an imaging scan called Positron
      Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT). [18F]NOS is an experimental radioactive
      molecule used in PET imaging to measure inflammation in various organs in the body.
      Investigators are interested in studying whether there are differences in lung inflammation
      between E-cigarette users (vapers) cigarette smokers and non-smokers. [18F]NOS has not yet
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use except in a research study.
      The use of [18F]NOS in this study is allowed under an Investigational New Drug Application
      approved by the FDA.

      Investigators are also going to be studying how the information from the PET/CT scan compares
      to other markers of inflammation in the blood. During the PET scan, Investigators will image
      Brain and Lungs in order to see if there is a difference between inflammation seen in the
      brain and the lungs and if these differences change depending on whether a subject is a
      smoker, e-cigarette user or non-smoker.

      Consented participant in this study will undergo one (1) experimental [18F]NOS PET/CT scan.
      During the scan, PET/CT images will be taken of participant chest/torso in order to capture
      their lungs and a short image will be taken of their brain. Blood samples will be taken at
      various time points to test for markers of inflammation and to measure the concentration of
      the tracer in participants blood during the scan and participants will undergo some specific
      psychological questionnaires and tasks.
