  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the small and highly specialized field of TMJ surgical treatments, restriction of the
      mandibular condylar movement outside of the articular eminence is one of the treatment
      choices suggested in TMJ dislocation.

      Limitation of translation of the condyle in TMJ dislocation by inlay autogenous bone graft is
      the classic method to hinder the movement of the condyle beyond the articular eminence.

      Patient specific TMJ prosthesis is very promising nowadays that it will not only build on the
      strengths of the current TMJ systems but will take advantage of digital innovations in custom
      design and three-dimensional(3D) printing of TMJ prosthesis. Moreover, TMJ Titanium
      eminoloplasty was reported to be a predictable and flexible instrument for TMJ dislocation
      treatment.

      Thus, the investigators are conducting this study to compare the effect of both methods on
      the improvement of the maximal incisal opening of patients with chronic mandibular condylar
      dislocation, aiming to solve the problem of increasing the mouth opening of patients in their
      daily mouth opening. Also to reduce the community's fear from such a problem, which sometimes
      prevent patients from seeking treatment at their dentists leading to more serious
      complications that can be avoided. Furthermore, the investigators are trying to provide an
      evidence for oral and maxillofacial surgeons in order to provide the best quality service
      with the least expenses and thus gaining the patients' trust and saving time, money and
      effort.

    <description>The stages of virtual surgical planning and fabrication of patient specific titanium eminoplasty will be designed my Mimics 15 program.
Once designed, the virtual design and surgery will be planned on a computer model where vital anatomical structures could be identified and thus could be avoided during surgery.
After obtaining all the dataset needed from the CT scan, the collected data will be sent to the Egyptian soil, water and environmental institution for manufacturing, packing and sterilization of the patient specific titanium eminence.
The patient specific titanium eminence will be inserted and secured with two to three screws of individual lengths according to the virtual plan.
Functional mandibular movements were reproduced to confirm absence of subluxation and checked for interference and any required adjustments made.
A multilayer closure of the incisions will be accomplished using Vicryl sutures.</description>

    <description>A safety distance of 5 mm will be maintained from the apex of the mandibular incisor and inferior mandibular border, the mental foramen, and permanent canine follicle.
One corticocancellous bone block with a maximum depth of 4 mm will be removed by mallet and chisel based on the recommendation that bone from the chin should be harvested at this maximum depth, compatible with the course of the mandibular incisive nerve canal on CT scans.
After removal of bone from the chin, the intervening bone struts will be removed using rongeur forceps and used as an additional bone graft.
The bone removed will be trimmed and contoured in a wedge form to be used as an inter-positional graft in the previously down fractured articular eminence to act as an obstacle in front of the mandibular condyle to prevent its hyper movement.</description>

    <description>* Steps to harvest the bone graft:
Down-fracture of the articular eminence to be augmented with Inlay bone graft to increase the vertical height of the articular eminence. A green-stick fracture will be created avoiding a possible complete fracture of the lower segment of the eminence
To obtain Inlay bone graft from the chin, anterior mandibular vestibule incision will provide good access to the mandibular symphysis.</description>
