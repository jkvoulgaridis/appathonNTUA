  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-079 in comparison
      with matching placebo, administered once every 3 weeks over a 12-week dosing period in
      participants with active SLE who are receiving stable background therapy for SLE.

      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      TAK-079 is being tested in a study population with moderate to severe SLE. This study will
      evaluate the safety and biologic activity of TAK-079 or matching placebo in combination with
      stable SLE background therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants across 3 sequentially enrolling cohorts.
      Each cohort will enroll 8 participants, where 6 participants will be assigned to TAK-079
      injection, and 2 participants will be assigned to Placebo. Participants will receive TAK-079
      or matching placebo in combination with principal investigator directed background therapy
      for SLE.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be followed up for the safety assessment for the
      additional 12 weeks up to Week 24 after receiving their last dose of study drug. Based on the
      clinical assessments, participants may complete or may advance to long-term safety follow up
      period for an additional 12-week safety monitoring period up to Week 36.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
