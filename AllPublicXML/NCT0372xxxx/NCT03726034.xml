  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between older adults and live-in migrant caregivers is always challenged by
      weak emotional connectedness, ineffective communication, power struggling and unmet needs of
      both, that may lead to poor care quality and negatively influence their well-being. The aim
      of this study is to explore the feasibility to train live-in migrant caregivers to adopt Life
      Story Work for promoting the dyadic relationship with the older adults, through communication
      and negotiation, mutual understanding and expression of needs. This is a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial. The caregivers of the intervention group will receive training on life
      story work. Then they will be asked to create a life storybook of the older adult at home
      individually, with the support from the team. The caregivers in the control group will
      receive training on communication skills only, and will be asked to conduct social activities
      at home. Outcomes such as quality of relationship; well-being, depressive symptoms and level
      of loneliness of the older adults; and job satisfaction of the caregivers will be assessed at
      baseline, post-intervention and 3 months follow up. Focus group interviews will be conducted
      with the caregivers of the intervention group for soliciting their comments regarding to the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 21.5 million live-in migrant workers, and around 41% of them are
      employed in Asia. Among the 352 thousand live-in migrant workers in Hong Kong, at least 21%
      of them are caregivers of older adults. The 2016 Policy Address suggested a pilot scheme for
      training live-in migrant caregivers to take care of the older people in Hong Kong to meet the
      trend of Ageing in Place, and cope with the dreadful shortage of formal long-term care
      services. As such, Social Welfare Department of Hong Kong is now implementing an 18-month
      pilot scheme to train live-in migrant workers to care for older adults in order to improve
      the well-being of the older adults. However, there is no effective evidence-based
      intervention available for such caregiving arrangement, not only locally but also
      internationally. The common training for live-in migrant workers is about instrumental
      training, such as feeding and bathing. According to the Relationship-Centred Care Model,
      relationship is the core for good quality of care. Life story work have been tested effective
      in various settings for promoting the psychological well-being of older adults with/out
      dementia, as well as proven useful in promoting mutual understanding and communication
      between caregivers and care-recipients.

      The project is of value in that:

        -  It is a pioneer study, which aims to promote relationship between live-in migrant
           caregivers and older adults to support good quality of care.

        -  The life story work is a skill that is easily learnt and adopted for promoting and
           sustaining good relationship that may impact on the well-being of caregivers and
           care-recipients.

        -  Reduce the needs of formal long-term care services by retaining the older adults to be
           cared at home.

        -  The life story work has a potential to be adopted by all types of caregivers (including
           formal and informal caregivers; live-in and live-out) for promoting the caregiver-care
           recipient dyadic relationship through communication and negotiation between the dyads,
           mutual understanding and expression of needs.

      Objectives:

        1. Explore the feasibility to train live-in migrant caregivers to adopt life story work;

        2. Explore the feasibility of trained live-in migrant caregivers to produce a life story
           book with the older adult at home; and

        3. Provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of the life story work on improving dyadic
           relationship, psychosocial outcomes of the older adults, and satisfaction of caregivers.

    <description>General closeness, communication, similarity of views about life, and degree of getting along will be captured. Total score of the scale ranges from 4-16. Higher values represent a better quality of relationship. The cronhach's alpha for this scale was 0.85.</description>

    <description>The scale consists of two sub-scales: emotional and social loneliness. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.76. The overall loneliness score ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 means no loneliness and 6 indicates severe loneliness.</description>

    <description>The migrant caregivers who have randomly assigned into the control group will receive communication skills training (two 1.5-hour sessions) offered by another trained interventionist with psychology or social work background with at least three years of working experience working with older people.

    <description>The protocol of life story book creation is validated in Hong Kong. The life story book would contain two elements: (1) the development of the older adults over the course of his/her lifetime (i.e. from childhood to old age); and (2) the psychosocial development and ways of life of the older adults (e.g. education, marriage, career, and hobbies). The product of the intervention will be a written story with pictures or other memorabilia that are meaningful to the older adults. There is no limitation on the number of words, pages, and pictures. Four to six 60-minute scheduled sessions will be needed for the older adult and the live-in migrant caregivers to discuss and produce the lifestory book at home.</description>
