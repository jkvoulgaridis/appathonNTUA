  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research will be assess the impact on Oral Health-Related to Quality of Life
      (OHRQoL) of children and their families affected by Traumatic Dental Injury (TDI) after
      insertion in Dental Trauma Care Program (DTCP). After a sample size calculation, this
      longitudinal clinical study will be composed by a consecutive sample from 2 to 6 year-old
      children registered in the DTCP from a períod of 10 years. Parents/Caregivers were
      interviewed to fill up a OHRQoL questionnaire. The Brazilian version of Early Childhood Oral
      Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS)will be applied (in form of interview) to evaluate the impact
      of TDI on OHRQoL before, and after treatment. The scores of the B-ECOHIS will be calculated
      using the additive method, summing the numeric response codes for each item.The Andreassen
      classification will be used to determine the TDI. The patients will be treated (minimally
      intervention/nvasive intervention) according to TDI severity (uncomplicated/complicated). The
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be performed to evaluate the normality of the data to determine
      the use of parametric or non-parametric test. Mean or median comparisons will be made for
      items in the overall scale and subscale scores to compare B-ECOHIS total
      scale/subscales/domains before and after insertion in DTCP. The responsiveness will be
      assessed by analyzing the change of the scores on the scales and subscales. The changes will
      be calculated by subtracting the post-treatment scores from the before treatment scores.
      Positive change scores will indicate an improvement in OHRQoL, while negative scores will
      indicate deterioration. TDI severity and treatment-associated will be also evaluated.

      It is recognized that measurements OHRQoL are essential strategies of oral health surveys,
      clinical trials, and studies evaluating the outcomes of preventive and therapeutic program.
      In the literature it is observed efficacy on OHRQoL outcomes focused on oral health education
      (OHE) associated to: atraumatic restorative treatment (ART), dental caries, gingivitis.

      In the literature it is also seen that the presence of TDI is associated to negative impact
      on OHRQoL)that affects physical and psychosocial consequences for children and their
      families. The treatment of TDI is a challenge, that it is related to an improvement on famil
      and on children from 8 to 14 years and attended in a center of surveillance for TDI.

      For a broader understanding of the consequences of outcomes of preventive and therapeutic
      program for TDI, it is important to expand the assessment of its performance using an OHRQoL
      measure for other ages of children.

    <description>The B-ECOHIS will be applied (in form of interview). This questionnaire is composed of 13 items distributed between a child impact section (CIS) and family impact section (FIS). The first section has four subscales: symptoms, function, psychology and self-image/social interaction. The FIS has two subscales: parental distress and family function. Response categories of ECOHIS were coded on a five-point scale: 0 = never; 1 = hardly ever; 2 = occasionally; 3 = often; 4 = very often. All 'don't know' responses were recoded to &quot;never&quot;. The score for each domain is calculated through a simple sum of the scores of each item. The total score ranges from 0 to 52. After the TDI treatment a follow-up will be performed. The changes were calculated by subtracting the appointment 2 (follow up) from the appointment 1 (initial exam). Positive change scores indicate an improvement in OHRQoL, while negative scores indicate deterioration.</description>

The first section has four subscales: symptoms, function, psychology and self-image/social interaction. The FIS has two subscales: parental distress and family function.

The total score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting greater oral health impact and poorer OHRQoL.</description>

    <description>The TDI treatment was performed according to its complexity. Uncomplicated TDI received minimally invasive treatment (simple restorations and clinical and radiographic follow-up). Complicated TDI received invasive treatment (more complex restorations, endodontic treatment, confection of aesthetic devices, restraints).
The Oral Health Related to Quality of Life assessment will be conducted before treatment (Baseline) and from between 3 to 6 months after the TDI treatment .</description>
