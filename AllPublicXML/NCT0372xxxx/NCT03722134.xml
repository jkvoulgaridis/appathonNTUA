      Patients with GSV reflux were randomized to undergo either MOCA or thermal ablation with
      laser or radiofrequency. The main outcome measure was the occlusion rate of the GSV at one
      year.Patients with GSV reflux were randomized to undergo either MOCA or thermal ablation with
      laser or radiofrequency. The main outcome measure was the occlusion rate of the GSV at one
      and three years.

      During 2014-2015, all patients referred to our vascular surgery clinic by their general
      practitioners due to varicose veins were screened for GSV insufficiency. We invited all
      patients filling the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.

      Included patients were randomized to receive either thermal ablation (laser ablation or
      radiofrequency ablation) or mechanochemical ablation with the Clarivein device to treat the
      refluxing GSV.

      The patients filled the Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire (AVVQ) at the baseline. We
      recorded the preoperative diameter of the GSV, specifically the diameter at the most proximal
      20 centimetres, and the mean overall diameter at the thigh.

      During the procedure, before discharge, and a week after, the patients reported pain scores
      using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on a scale of 0 to 10. At the one-month follow-up visit, we
      recorded wound healing, haematomas or bruising, nerve injuries, and pigmentation. The status
      of the GSV was examined with duplex Doppler ultrasound. The patients were also asked to
      determine what would have been the optimal sick leave after the procedure.

      At the one-year follow-up, nerve injuries, pigmentation, and clinical status were recorded,
      as well as the status of the GSV with duplex Doppler ultrasound. The patients also filled the
      AVVQ questionnaire.

    <intervention_model_description>Our study aim was to assess the applicability and safety of MOCA in short term as well as occlusion rate and disease specific quality of life one year after the procedure, and compare it with currently used thermal ablation methods of laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in a randomized controlled trial.
Randomization took place by a study nurse after the appointment, using block randomization with sealed envelopes into EVLA, RFA, or MOCA in ratio 1:1:2.</intervention_model_description>
