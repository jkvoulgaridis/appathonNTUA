      There is a gap between research and clinical practice, leading to variability in
      decision-making. Clinical audits are an effective strategy for improving implementation of
      best practices. Quasi-experimental, multicentre, before-and-after. Primary-care and
      hospital-care units and associated socio-healthcare structures, and the patients attended at
      both. Implementation of evidence-based recommendations by application of the Getting Research
      into Practice model (process of improvement by reference to a prior baseline clinical audit.
      Data will be collected at baseline and, during the first year of follow up, at months (3, 6,

      Aim: To assess the effectiveness of a model of implementation of evidence-based
      recommendations, in terms of patient outcomes and healthcare quality. Desing:
      Quasi-experimental, multicentre, before-and-after. Methods Primary-care and hospital-care
      units and associated socio-healthcare structures, and the patients attended at both.
      Intervention: Implementation of evidence-based recommendations by application of the Getting
      Research into Practice model (process of improvement by reference to a prior baseline
      clinical audit). Variables: Process and outcome criteria with respect to pain, urinary
      incontinence and fall prevention. Data will be collected at baseline and, during the first
      year of follow up, at months (3, 6, 9,12), with data on patients and indicators being drawn
      from clinical histories and records. Descriptive analysis, and comparison of the
      effectiveness of the intervention by means of inferential analysis and analysis of trends
      across follow-up. 95% confidence level. This project is funded by Spanish Strategic Health
      Action November 2014. Project duration 2015-2017.

    <description>The intervention will consist of the use of the GRIP (Getting Research into Practice) model and implementation of its strategies in clinical practice, according to the study unit in question and the scope of action.
The GRIP model is a process of improvement by reference to a prior baseline clinical audit. It implies a local situation analysis, identifying the obstacles to improvements in clinical practice, and drawing up and implementing a plan of action for the purpose of improving adherence to pre-established criteria. The goal is to establish interprofessional processes within the teams, in order to: examine the obstacles that hinder the use of evidence in fostering best practices; and contribute to the development of implementation programmes for overcoming such obstacles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unit-inclusion criteria. The study will cover all SNHS units and associated
             socio-healthcare structures which voluntarily adhere to the project and undertake to
             implement recommendations relating to pain, urinary incontinence and prevention falls.

        For the purposes of this study, a &quot;unit&quot; is defined as any service, centre or institution
        that delivers health services to a homogeneous group of patients who share similar
        characteristics.

        Patient-inclusion criteria. The study will include all patients attended at units
        participating in the study, who meet the following criteria, depending on the
        recommendations to be implemented at each unit:

          -  Pain: persons admitted to hospital centres who may potentially suffer from some type
             of pain. Patients will be classified according to whether they are adults or children
             (paediatric patients), and according to whether they experience chronic pain, acute
             postoperative pain, or acute pain due to other causes.

          -  Incontinence: community-dwelling or institutionalised persons prone to present with
             urinary incontinence. Patients will be classified according to whether they are 65
             years of age or over.

          -  Falls: persons aged over 65 years who display one or more fall risk factors according
             to the assessment criteria established by the risk assessment instrument used.
