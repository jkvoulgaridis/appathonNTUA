    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b, open-Label clinical trial to determine the safety and tolerability and to
      establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TTAC-0001 administered in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
