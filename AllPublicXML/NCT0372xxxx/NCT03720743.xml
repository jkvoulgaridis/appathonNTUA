  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a 10 weeks biodanza program on the
      sexual desire and inhibition/arousal of a sample of healthy young adults.

      A randomized clinical study was carried out, involving a total of 86 young adults divided
      into Intervention Group (BG) and Control Group (CG), carrying out biodanza sessions during 10
      weeks. The Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI) and the Sexual Inhibition/Sexual Arousal-Short Form
      Scale (SIS/SES-SF) were completed before and after the intervention.

    <description>Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI) formed by 13 items, divided into dyadic sexual desire (Dyadic SD) (items 1-9) and solitary sexual desire (Solitary SD) (items 10-13), and valued by a Likert scale according to frequency (0 = never, and 7 = more than once a day), and intensity (0 = not desire, and 8 = strong desire), in a total range between 0 and 101 points, being higher the desire the greater the response result.</description>

    <description>Sexual Inhibition/Sexual Excitement Scales - Short Form consists of 14 items with responses assessed using a Likert scale 1-4 (1 = completely agree; 4 = completely disagree) that measure three sub-scales: Sexual Excitation Scale (SES) (items 1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 14) with a score range between 4 and 16; Sexual Inhibition Scale 1 (SIS1) (items 4, 9, 12, 13) related to distraction/concentration in sexual performance, with a range between 4 and 16, and Sexual Inhibition Scale 2 (SIS2) (items 2, 5, 6, 7) related to the fear to be discovered or to contract some type of sexually transmitted infection (STI), with a range between 4 and 16.</description>

    <description>Intervention group received a total of 10 sessions, once a week, over the course of two months. Each session lasted 60 minutes. All sessions began with a 10-minute warm-up period combining music and low-intensity movements as a welcome round, followed individual exercises, in pairs and/or groups, which included dance combined with exercises based on the five lines of Biodanza (vitality, sexuality, creativity, affectivity and transcendence). Finally, a celebration and farewell round of 10 minutes was held. At the end of each session, the participants were asked to share their experiences with the rest of the group.</description>
