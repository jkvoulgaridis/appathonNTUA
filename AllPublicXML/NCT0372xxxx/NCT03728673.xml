    <textblock>
      This pilot study will include grade IV glioma patients treated with SSRIs during
      approximately a 17 week study period. Changes in cognition and evaluation of psychosocial
      factors from baseline to after 17 weeks of treatment with SSRI study drug will be calculated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As many as 85% of glioma patients experience cognitive impairment. This is not only from
      direct tumor involvement, but also worsens with therapy such as cranial radiation and
      chemotherapy, which further degrade neuronal function. Commonly, impairments in visuospatial
      skills and executive function are seen. There is evidence that serotonin selective reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) such as escitalopram improve modulation and function of resting state
      networks, contribute to neuroplastic changes in brain regions subserving these abilities, and
      provide general functional support to neuronal cells. In addition to either improving
      cognition or preventing cognitive decline, treatment with an SSRI may also improve outcomes
      critical to overall survival in this vulnerable population, including functional
      independence, psychosocial stability, and quality of life.

      We hypothesize that following treatment with escitalopram patients will experience improved
      cognitive and mood function over time. We will also correlate changes in mood with EEG and
      structural MRI. The addition of escitalopram has the potential to enhance cognitive function
      and hence functional independence thereby improving quality of life in these patients.
