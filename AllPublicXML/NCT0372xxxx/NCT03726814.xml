          2. Subjects was confirmed cerebral hemorrhagic stroke, included at least one of risk
             factors(Hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood lipid), and
             Satisfied with one of the following conditions:

             A. Significant stenosis (&gt; 50%) of the intracranial and extracranial arteries or their
             branches due to atherosclerosis, or clinical or imaging manifestations of vascular
             blockage B. Head imaging (CT or MRI) : cerebral hemispheric infarct lesion diameter of
