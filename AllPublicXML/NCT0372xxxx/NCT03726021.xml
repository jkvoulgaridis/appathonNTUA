      This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. It will test the efficiency and safety of an
      investigational drug f Irinotecan,Oxaliplatin, and S1, with the goal of determining the OS of
      advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma..

      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer
      and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Treatment consists of treatment with Irinotecan 165mg/m2, Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 on day 1, and
      S1 40mg orally on day 1-14, every 21 days each cycle. Treatment will be administered until
      untolerable toxicities or progression or subject death, or either the subject or sponsor
      discontinues the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Cytologically- or histologically-confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma or poorly
             differentiated pancreatic carcinoma that is metastatic to distant sites.

               -  Other histologies such as neuroendocrine and acinar cell carcinoma are excluded.

               -  No prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

               -  Patients are eligible if they received adjuvant treatment after surgical
                  resection

               -  Participants are required to have measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), defined as at
                  least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension
                  (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;
                  10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11 for the evaluation of measurable
                  disease.

               -  Participants enrolled must have disease that is accessible for tumor biopsies and
                  must agree to a pre-treatment tumor biopsy.

               -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available
                  in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will
                  be eligible for future pediatric trials.

               -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (see Appendix A)

               -  Patients must have completed any major surgery or open biopsy ≥4 weeks from start
                  of treatment.

               -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

                    -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

                    -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL

                    -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

                    -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

                    -  Creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal OR

                    -  Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine
                       levels above 1.5 × upper limit of normal.

               -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Prior chemotherapy or any other investigational agents for the treatment of locally
             advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer

               -  Concurrent use of any other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, targeted
                  therapy, immunotherapy, or biological agents.

               -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
                  trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
                  neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
                  adverse events. Screening for brain metastases with head imaging is not required.

               -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
                  biologic composition to above drugs or other agents used in study.

               -  History of prior or current synchronous malignancy, except:

                  o Malignancy that was treated with curative intent and for which there has been
                  no known active disease for &gt;3 years prior to enrollment

               -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
                  active infection, NYHA class III/IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina
                  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
                  limit compliance with study requirements.
