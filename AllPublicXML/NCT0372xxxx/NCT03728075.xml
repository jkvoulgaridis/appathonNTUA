      The purpose of the study is investigate the effects of NMES in regulation of serum IL-6 and
      IL-15 in chronic heart failure patients who received standard inpatient cardiac
      rehabilitation protocol

    <textblock>
      Majority of chronic heart failure patients became intolerance of physical training that could
      limit activity. Recent studies reported that Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)
      application could increase muscle mass, oxidative enzyme, endothelial function, VO2 peak and
      quality of life in chronic heart failure patient. It was hypothesized that Neuromuscular
      Electrical Stimulation (NMES) assisted muscle contraction in chronic heart failure patients
      will increase the activity of myokine (Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-15), that in turn will
      promote exercise tolerance in this patient. the aim of this study was to investigate the
      effects of NMES in regulation of serum IL-6 and IL-15 in chronic heart failure patients who
      received standard inpatient cardiac rehabilitation protocol. Thirty chronic heart failure
      patients in cardiology ward that fulfilled inclusion criteria were randomized in two groups;
      the control group (standard inpatient cardiac rehabilitation protocol) and the intervention
      group (standard inpatient cardiac rehabilitation protocol and NMES). The intervention was
      done every day for seven days. Measurement of serum IL-6 and IL-15 were done before and after
      study, and analyzed by sandwich immunoassay with monoclonal antibody.
