  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 72 type 2 diabetes who began insulin therapy using a pen injector participated in
      this study. The experimental (n = 36) and control (n = 36) groups received multimedia and
      regular health education program. Four structured questionnaires were used, and videotapes
      were applied to demonstrate injection skills.

    <textblock>
      To explore the effectiveness of two types health education on knowledge in diabetes and
      insulin injection, skills in insulin injection, self-efficacy in insulin injection, injection
      performance rate, satisfaction with health education,nursing hours, and biophysical
      indicators among the type 2 diabetes who began insulin therapy using a pen injector.With a
      repeated measures experimental study design, a total of 72 type 2 diabetes who began insulin
      therapy using a pen injector participated in this study. The experimental (n = 36) and
      control (n = 36) groups received multimedia and regular health education program. Four
      structured questionnaires were used, and videotapes were applied to demonstrate injection
      skills.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>diabetes and insulin injection related knowledge scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline diabetes and insulin injection related knowledge to the thirteenth week after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item diabetes and insulin injection related knowledge scale consists of 4 domains: brief introduction to diabetes, precautions for diabetes medications and insulin injection, management of hyper- and hypoglycemia, and complications of diabetes. Total scores ranged from 0 to 20. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>insulin injection skills scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline insulin injection skills to the thirteenth week after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The insulin injection skills scale was rated by a certified diabetes educator according to each participant's performance on the 12 steps of operating a prefilled pen injector (12 items; scores ranged from 0 to 12) and the 10 steps of operating a disposable pen injector (10 items; scores ranged from 0 to 10 ). Participants scored 1 point for each correct operation and 0 points for each incorrect operation. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>self-efficacy in insulin injection scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline self-efficacy in insulin injection to the thirteenth week after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item self-efficacy in insulin injection scale was modified based on the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Total scores ranged from 10 to 50. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The health education satisfaction scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the day prior to discharge satisfaction with health education to the thirteenth week after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The 10 items health education satisfaction scale consisted of 10 items, with total scores ranging from 10 to 50. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>nursing hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Through intervention to the day prior to discharge from hospital, an average of 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The nursing hours were calculated by adding up the total time spent by the diabetes educator instructing each participant to perform insulin injection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>glycated hemoglobin(HbA1C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HbA1C to the thirteenth week after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Record the concentration of HbA1C (%) from the lab data in medical record</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>blood creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline blood creatinine to the thirteenth week after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Record the concentration of blood creatinine (mg/dl) from the lab data in medical record</description>

    <description>The program (flat touch computer) consisted of knowledge and technology levels. Knowledge: diabetic introduction, treatment, management of hyper- and hypoglycemia, complications, and experience sharing of insulin injection by a patient group. Technology: steps of insulin injection skills and complete technology demonstration . The program contents were organized using a unit-based piecemeal teaching approach. Participants could adjust their learning pace according to individual situations and could practice injection skills using an injection mold during hospitalization. A diabetes educator has assessed the learning outcome of each participant after intervention. At the day of discharge from hospital, each participant would acquire a copy of the multimedia health education compact disc.</description>
