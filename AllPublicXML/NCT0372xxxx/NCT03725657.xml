  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intense exercise is a major challenge to the management of type 1 diabetes. The management is
      even more difficult, during a camp, probably due to increased hypoglycemia maybe from
      increase of intensity of physical activity.

      The investigators want to evaluate steps, energy expenditure, sleep time and glycemic control
      and insulin dosage, through use of a wrist accelerometer, in pediatric type 1 patients
      attending a camp. Finding a correlation between these parameters could be useful not only for
      educational purposes but also in the development of algorithms for artificial pancreas.

      Background and Aims Intense exercise is a major challenge to the management of type 1
      diabetes. The management is even more difficult, during a camp, probably due to increased
      hypoglycemia maybe from increase of intensity of physical activity. Few studies confirm this
      hypothesis but none evaluated the correlation between steps, energy expenditure, sleep time
      and glycemic control and insulin dosage.

      Methods and Materials 60 patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 10 to 12 years, in
      multiinjection insulin therapy observed for 21 days (one week of camp, one week before and
      one after it). Food program was the same both at home and during the camp. They checked
      glycemia almost 5 times a day. A wrist accelerometer was used to evaluate sleep, steps and
      energy expenditure.

      All data were recorded in a daily diary.
