  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The files of hemorrhagic obstetric patients undergoing surgery and followed in the intensive
      care unit and using Fibrinogen and blood products were included in the study between January
      2015- September 2018 at the Anesthesiology and Reanimation Clinic of SBU Kanuni Sultan
      SÃ¼leyman Training and Research Hospital. Patients under 18 years of age were excluded from
      the study. In this study, ages, operation types, number of blood and products, the amount of
      fibrinogen, the results of the hemogram and bleeding parameters, the levels of fibrinogen,
      the duration of hospital stay and the intensive care unit were recorded.

      Bleeding is an important event that threatens the patient's life. Too much blood and blood
      products can be used in massive bleeding. However, unwanted allergic reactions may occur in
      blood and blood product transfusions. Fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor in
      coagulopathy. Some studies have shown that when the fibrinogen level falls to &lt;150-200 mg /
      dl, the bleeding increases dramatically.
