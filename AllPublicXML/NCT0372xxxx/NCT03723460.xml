  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no accurate measurement of dietary intake. All current methodologies of
      assessing dietary intake have inaccuracy rates of 30 -70%. Accurate assessment of dietary
      intake is critical in understanding individual and population nutritional status and
      monitoring the effectiveness of public health interventions to maintain nutritional health.
      Estimating dietary intake in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is remarkably
      challenging, albeit the high presence of malnutrition and the critical need for
      evidence-based data to inform policies and programmes on nutrition and health.

      This study aims to develop and validate a low-cost and robust system for accurate measurement
      of an individual's dietary intake in households in LMICs. This innovative system passively
      recognises food, records intake, and estimates nutrient content of food. The system will be
      validated in field trials in Ghana and Kenya.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes the process of developing and validating a passive dietary monitoring
      system for the assessment of an individual's dietary intake in households in Ghana and Kenya.

      The first phase of the study involves preliminary testing of identified dietary monitoring
      camera/video devices in a lab setting at Imperial College London under conditions similar to
      those anticipated in Ghana and Kenya. These conditions may include low lighting, unique foods
      common to certain regions, communal eating (where more than one person eats from a shared
      plate of cooked food) and placement of the devices on the body. This is important to guide
      the design of a suitable passive dietary monitoring system.

      The second phase of the study involves an in-depth understanding of household set-up,
      composition and eating behaviour and testing the feasibility and acceptability of using
      passive dietary monitoring devices/system in communities in Ghana and Kenya. The data
      gathered in this phase of the study will inform the choice of the passive dietary monitoring
      system and configuration to use in the field validation study.

      Finally, in the validation phase of the study, the passive dietary monitoring system
      developed will be set up to record food intake and estimate nutrient content of food across
      88 households in Ghana and Kenya. In addition, 24h dietary recall (a commonly used method of
      collecting dietary intake data in population studies) and weighed food records will be used
      to estimate food intake in the households. The dietary intake data obtained through the
      passive monitoring system will be compared to 24h dietary recall and weighed food record data
      to validate its accuracy.
