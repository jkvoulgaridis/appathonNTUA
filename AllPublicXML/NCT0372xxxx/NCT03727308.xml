  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether important clinical outcomes differ among women
      who access a combined medical abortion regimen from a pharmacy when compared with those who
      access it from a facility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is
      safe and highly effective. Investigators aim to assess whether self-use of early (&lt;9 weeks)
      medical abortion using mifepristone with misoprostol results in non-inferior rates of
      clinical outcomes when compared with clinic-based provision of medical abortion.

      The investigators will prospectively recruit women who obtain medical abortion medication
      from pharmacies and clinics. Follow-up will occur by telephone during two phone calls within
      30 days following the woman's abortion. A small number of adolescents will be recruited into
      a qualitative substudy.
