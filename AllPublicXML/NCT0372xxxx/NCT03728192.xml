      The present study is an effort to investigate the hypothesis that in-vitro vitality and
      antiapoptotic effect of alcoholic crude extract of mangosteen on Oral cancer( H357) cell
      lines and Cevical cancer (HeLa) cell lines.

      The oral and cervical cells were investigated by MTT (3-4,5-
      dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, DNA fragmentation detection by
      TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP Nick End Labeling) assay and
      Apototic assay using Annexin V/FITC Kit.

    <intervention_model_description>The study comprised of two groups A (Hela) and group B ( H357) . Each group was further subdivided into 3 subgroups- A1 -Untreated cells, A2- mangosteen treated cells and A3- cells treated with standard drug. Group B was divided into B1- Untreated cells, B2- mangosteen treated cells and B3 -cells treated with the standard drug healthy periodontium.

    <measure>apoptotic potential of ethanolic extract of mangosteen pericarp on oral and cervical cancer cell lines via apoptotic assay</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hrs at base line</time_frame>
    <description>Apoptosis assay was performed using Annexin V/FITC Kit (BD Biosciences, Catalog no. 556547), and the fluorescence intensities of FITC-conjugated annexin-V and Propidium iodide (PI) in cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. HeLa and H357 cells (1×106 cells/well) were seeded in a 6-well plate. The cells were allowed to adhere for 12 hrs, cultured in medium containing different concentrations of mangosteen extract for 48hr. The cells were then collected and washed twice with Phosphate buffer Saline, gently resuspended in 100μL annexinV-FITC binding buffer (1x) and incubated with 5μL annexinV-FITC in the dark for 10 min at 25°C. This was followed by centrifugation of cells at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and gently resuspended in 500μL annexinV-FITC binding buffer (1x) and 5μL PI was added in an ice bath, followed by immediate analysis by flow cytometry Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).</description>
