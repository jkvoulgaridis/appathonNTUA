  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major health concern in the U.S. with significant
      impact on mothers, infants, and communities. Investigators at the University of Kentucky/UK
      HealthCare (UK) have developed a comprehensive clinical care model for perinatal OUD (known
      as UK-PATHways) that has demonstrated success in maternal and neonatal outcomes. The
      overreaching goals of the proposed project are to: 1) expand the reach of this successful
      clinical program, 2) to reduce the impact of perinatal OUD in underserved rural areas of our
      state, and 3) to compare the relative effectiveness methods of delivery active elements of
      the PATHways program for rural implementation (local group-support vs. UK specialist
      telemedicine)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK-PATHways program preliminary successes during the first three years are clear:
      enrolled mothers (n&gt;200) have reduced relapse, increased treatment compliance, and improved
      neonatal outcomes when compared to non-enrolled OUD mothers. However, at this
      time,UK-PATHways is only available at our main healthcare campus in Lexington, KY. Many
      eligible patients reside great distances from our clinical home and some current patients
      travel hours to access this valuable resource. While Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) has
      become increasingly available in our region, many of the components of the UK-PATHways
      program are not readily accessible in rural Central and Eastern Kentucky and the quality of
      programming with MAT treatment is not standardized in these locations. Furthermore, rural
      patients continue to face challenges related to stigma of their OUD and transportation
      difficulties if they desire more comprehensive services. The proposed study will evaluate the
      introduction of essential components of the UK-PATHways program into rural communities, and
      identify the optimal intervention strategies for expansion of services and to improve the
      treatment of OUD for rural patients. Specific aims include the following: Aim 1) Conduct a
      randomized cluster trial using a 'hub and spoke' study design, comparing two delivery modes
      (local GROUP care vs TELEMEDICINE) for the delivery of a PATHways based patient education
      curriculum at participating rural regional sites. Each regional site will be randomized to
      support one of two study arms: 1) Prenatal group care led by a Perinatal Nurse Facilitator
      and Peer Support Specialist (GROUP arm); or, 2) Telemedicine consultation with substance
      abuse counselors, perinatal nurse educators, and/or Peer Health Specialists based at the
      'hub' site (TELEMEDICINE arm); and Aim 2) Evaluate the relative effectiveness of each study
      arm on primary and secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes as compared to the established
      PATHways program (UK-PATHways: Hub) at the University of Kentucky.

    <measure>Infant motor development</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>At three months of age, infant mom/caregivers will be asked to complete the Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires®, Third Edition (ASQ®-3), a developmental screening tool designed for use by early educators and health care professionals. The survey collects milestones in infants in five domains; communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal/social. It takes just 10-15 minutes for parents to complete and 2-3 minutes for professionals to score and highlights results that fall in a &quot;monitoring zone&quot;, to make it easier to keep track of children at risk. The Ages and Stages 3 month survey instrument is 38 items filled out by the caregiver and scored by the clinic staff. Scores are calculated at 0, 5, or 10 per question, and lower scores are interpreted to support further professional assessment concerning the infant's development. Scale scores will be presented as the mean +/- standard error per group compared between groups.</description>
