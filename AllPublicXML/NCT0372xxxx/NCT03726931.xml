  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate staging is of great importance in patients with clinically locally advanced primary
      breast cancer (LABC, stage III) or locoregional recurrent (LRR) breast cancer for making a
      correct treatment plan. According to current guidelines, staging is performed with positron
      emission tomography (PET) using the 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET tracer,
      combined with diagnostic computed tomography (CT). However, previous studies have shown that
      this technique (with the current PET tracer) might not be sufficient for accurate staging.
      Specifically in low grade, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer metastases can be
      missed due to the low metabolic activity, leading to low uptake of [18F]FDG. Therefore, there
      is a clinical need to improve staging procedures. 16α-[18F]-fluoro-17β-estradiol ([18F]FES),
      an ER-targeted PET tracer, allows imaging of ER+ tumor lesions regardless of their metabolic
      activity. Patients with clinically LABC and LRR have a 25-50% risk of distant metastases.
      Correct identification of distant metastases allows adaptation of the treatment plan to avoid
      burdensome treatment with surgery, systemic and radiotherapy in order to maintain quality of
      life. In case of oligometastases, correct identification increases the likelihood for cure
      with local treatment. In the current study we will compare disease staging with [18F]FES- and
      [18F]FDG PET in patients with clinically LABC/LRR breast cancer. Objective: To determine
      whether [18F]FES PET/CT improves staging for women with clinically LABC or LRR, ER+/HER2-
      breast cancer as compared to standard [18F]FDG PET/CT. Study design: Multicenter prospective
      study with invasive measurements. Study population: 20 LABC and 20 LRR ER+/HER2- breast
      cancer patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: To determine the percentage of patients
      with a correctly changed treatment plan according to information obtained from [18F]FES
      PET/CT compared to [18F]FDG PET/CT at staging and at 6 months of follow-up; to determine the
      percentage of metastatic lesions detected and missed with [18F]FES PET/CT compared to
      [18F]FDG PET/CT (at staging and during follow-up). Nature and extent of the burden and risks
      associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Patients will receive an
      intravenous cannula for tracer injection and blood sampling, causing potentially transient
      discomfort at the site of the cannula insertion. Tumor biopsy will be performed from an easy
      accessible lesion and the most frequent complications that can occur are discomfort, bleeding
      and (local) infection. The risk of complications from a tumor biopsy is considered low:
      0.24-1.6% and 0.11-0.48% for major complications and mortality, respectively. Radiation
      exposure from a [18F]FES PET and [18F]FDG PET scan usually ranges between 4-11 mSv and 7-8
      mSv, respectively. Radiation exposure from a diagnostic CT scan ranges between 8-14 mSv. The
      total radiation burden is considered justifiable when compared to the information that can be
      obtained from this study, in this patient group with breast cancer. Imaging with [18F]FES PET
      may improve staging for patients with breast cancer as it may show tumor lesions that could
      not be identified with [18F]FDG PET, the current standard for staging. If this is the case,
      the initial treatment goal and intensity can be adjusted which can have beneficial effects
      for the patient.

    <intervention_model_description>In this multicenter observational study with invasive measurements, patients with clinically ER+/HER2- LABC and LRR breast cancer will be included. All patients will undergo the current 'standard' diagnostic procedures including a histological biopsy of the primary tumor, cytology of axillary lymph nodes and imaging procedures with mammography, ultrasound of breast and axilla, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) breast and whole body [18F]FDG PET combined with diagnostic chest/abdominal CT. In addition, all patients will undergo the 'experimental' imaging procedure with [18F]FES PET/CT. After evaluation of the obtained scans (independently for both scans), an 'experimental histological biopsy' of a lymph node metastasis will be obtained and clinically relevant [18F]FDG+ and/or [18F]FES+ lesions and/or suspicious lesions on CT will be biopsied according to standard clinical practice for pathological analyses.</intervention_model_description>
