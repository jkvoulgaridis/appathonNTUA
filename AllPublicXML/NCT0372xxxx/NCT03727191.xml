      30 patients will receive nutritional education and guidelines for the consumption of a
      completed shreded diet including 2 packets of 90 grams every day (One salted packet for
      lunch/dinner and one sweet packet for breakfast/afternoon snack) and recommendations for
      physical activity for one month.
