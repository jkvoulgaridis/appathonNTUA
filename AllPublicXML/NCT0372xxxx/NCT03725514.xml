  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of articles present in literature concerning the enrollment of tissue
      engineering in the field of root canal treatment is concerned with the treatment of affected
      teeth with immature apex, after proper systematic search online, only 4 articles where found
      that are dealing with the treatment of teeth with mature apex. These 4 studies are case
      reports. None of these studies has been a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of
      interventional trials resulting in the highest level of evidence that contributes effectively
      in the clinical decision-making process as to the best intervention for the patient's
      condition providing the most effective clinical outcomes for the satisfaction of the patient.
      Since that the triad of regenerative endodontics are the key of success of any attempt to
      regenerate pulp, 2 different maneuvers shall be done in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preservation of the natural dentition had always been a primary objective in endodontic
      practice. When the pulp is diseased or requires removal for restorative reasons, it is
      replaced with an artificial filling material during conventional root canal treatment. Root
      canal treatment has lots of drawbacks, starting with different iatrogenic errors during
      endodontic procedures, weakening of remaining tooth structure which might affect the tooth
      survival. Also Root canal treated teeth require the placement of a post and core, which
      itself is doubtful whether it increases fracture resistance of the tooth or it weakens it.
      The most important drawback is that the survival of affected pulp is hindered by the
      conventional root canal treatment. Thus a new treatment approach was introduced utilizing the
      body ability to regenerate, called Pulp Regeneration. Regeneration was first introduced in
      the dental field as a solution for immature apex treatment, due to difficulties encountered
      during its conventional root canal treatment. Here the Pulp regeneration shall be used on
      vital mature teeth to increase the survival rate of the affected teeth.
