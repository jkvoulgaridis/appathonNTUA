      The coadyouvant efficacy and safety of a combination of cosmetics ingredients in the form of
      a lipolytic cream with hypocaloric diet and physical activity were assessed and compared with
      with hypocaloric diet and physical activity for overweight and obesity treatment in patients
      of both gender and different age groups. DESIGN: In a monocenter, open-label, randomized,
      parallel-group study of 102 patients that consulted for overweight and obesity treatment were
      analyzed in perimeters and body composition for 12 consecutive weeks that were medically
      prescribed a weekly hypocaloric diet and physical activity for one group of 51 patients, and
      hypocaloric diet, physical activity and the lypolitic cream at least twice per day for the
      other group of 51 patients. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing intial and final of all
      values in both groups. Safety was monitored by the incidence of adverse events. Patients also
      assessed the acceptability of the cream presentation.

    <masking_description>Researchers assessed the efficacy of a lipolytic cream with hypocaloric diet and physical activity in the treatment of overweight and obesity. The control treatment was lypolitic cream with hypocaloric diet and physicial activity and hypocaloric diet and physicial activity alone. In total, 102 patients were recruited and allocated to treatment (51: lypolitic cream with hypocaloric diet and physicial activity and, 51: hypocaloric diet and physicial activity alone.</masking_description>
