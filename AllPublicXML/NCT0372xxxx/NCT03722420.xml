  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multi-center, open-label, parallel, 2-arm, randomized study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of radotinib 300 mg Bis In Die(BID) versus imatinib 400 mg Quaque
      Die(QD).

      This study will be conducted in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ Chronic Myelogenous
      Leukemia(CML)-Chronic Phase(CP) who are previously untreated for Chronic Myelogenous
      Leukemia(CML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the radotinib arms will receive 300 mg of radotinib BID at
      approximately 12-hour intervals. Patients randomized to the imatinib 400 mg arm will receive
      imatinib once a day throughout the study.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of Major Molecular Response(MMR) at 12 months (1
      month = 4 weeks = 28 days), defined as BCR ABL1/ABL% ≤ 0.1% by international scale. The
      Molecular Response(MR) rate will be measured every 3 months by Real-time
      Quantitative(RQ)-Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) in a central laboratory. All patients will be
      treated and/or followed for 12 months (48 weeks) after randomization.
