  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      profiles of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-TTR-LRx administered subcutaneously to healthy
      volunteers and patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis (hATTR ).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1/2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study
      conducted at a single center for the healthy volunteer cohorts in up to 56 participants. It
      will consist of 1 single-dose cohort and 3 multiple-dose cohorts (n = 12 per cohort, 10
      active:2 placebo). The open-label, hATTR patient cohort portion of the study will be
      conducted at multiple centers.

          3. Other causes of sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathy (e.g., autoimmune disease),
             including uncontrolled diabetes

          4. Prior liver transplant or anticipated liver transplant within 1-yr of Screening
