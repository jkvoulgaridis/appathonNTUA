      To examine the differential effect of camel and cow milk on the physiological response, to a
      liquid mixed-meal challenge, in people with normal glucose tolerance
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Camel milk is used as a traditional remedy throughout the Middle East and Indian Subcontinent
      for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. It is currently unclear how such an
      effect could be mediated in vivo and studies are limited. We performed this study as a pilot
      experiment to assess the effects of camel milk on Insulin, Glucose, GLP-1, C-peptide and
      Lipid profile.
