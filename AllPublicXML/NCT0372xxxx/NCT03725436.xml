    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of ALRN-6924 when given together
      with paclitaxel in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in
      the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ALRN-6924 and
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924 (ALRN-6924) in combination with paclitaxel in adult patients
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with wild-type (WT) TP53.

      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in
      patients with advanced or metastatic WT TP53 solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in solid
      tumors (in dose escalation) and hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (in expansion).

      II. Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel in plasma following single
      and multiple intravenous (IV) infusions (cycle 1 day 1, day [D]2, D15 and cycle 2 D1).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess predictive and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of response. II. Assess the effects of
      ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel on cell proliferation and apoptosis.

      III. Assess the effects of ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel on cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      (cfDNA) dynamics and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924
      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year and
      then every 3 months thereafter.
