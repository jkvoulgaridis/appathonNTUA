    <textblock>
      Nemaline myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy. Respiratory failure is the main cause of
      death in these patients. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of a
      8-week inspiratory muscle training program on respiratory muscle function in nemaline
      myopathy patients. The secondary objective is to determine respiratory muscle function in
      nemaline myopathy patients and its correlation with clinical severity and general
      neuromuscular function. The nemaline myopathy patients will be included in the first phase
      for a clinical characterization. From this phase patients will be selected for the second
      phase, which is a controlled before-after trial of inspiratory muscle training. The primary
      outcome is the change in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) after active inspiratory muscle
      training

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Nemaline myopathy is a group of congenital, hereditary neuromuscular disorders
      with variable symptoms such as muscle weakness, swallowing dysfunction, and dysarthria.
      Respiratory failure is the main cause of death in nemaline myopathy and occurs even in
      ambulant patients who otherwise appear to be only mildly affected; respiratory muscle
      weakness may even be the presenting feature. Inspiratory muscle training has shown to
      increase inspiratory muscle strength in patients with other neuromuscular disorders. It is
      hypothesized that inspiratory muscle training improves respiratory muscle function in
      nemaline myopathy patients with respiratory muscle weakness.

      Objective: The primary objective is to determine the effect of a 8-week inspiratory muscle
      training program on respiratory muscle function in nemaline myopathy patients. The secondary
      objective is to determine respiratory muscle function in nemaline myopathy patients and its
      correlation with clinical severity and general neuromuscular function.

      Study design: The study consist of two phases. Phase 1: A screening phase with an open design
      from which patients will be selected for the second phase. Phase 2: A controlled before-after
      trial of inspiratory muscle training. The 2 conditions tested are sham IMT and active IMT.

      Study population: Nemaline myopathy patients from the local neuromuscular database will be
      recruited. Furthermore, other centres in the Netherlands will be contacted to expand the
      database of nemaline myopathy patients. Phase 2 requires 23 patients.

      Intervention: Active IMT consists of 15 minutes of IMT, twice a day, 5 days per week for 8
      weeks, at a training workload of 30% of MIP using a resistive inspiratory muscle training
      device. Sham IMT consists of similar training regime using a resistive inspiratory muscle
      training device where the resistance has been removed.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome parameter is the change in maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) after active inspiratory muscle training.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The intervention of inspiratory muscle training is not associated with any
      risks, but can be challenging in patients with respiratory muscle weakness to perform. There
      will be three visits to the hospital in 16 weeks. The first visit has a maximal duration of 6
      hours (including breaks) and the other two visits 1.5 hour. During these visits several tests
      and physical examinations will be performed. Some of the tests may cause some physical
      discomfort, but none of them carry any risk. Patients may benefit from participating in this
      study by developing improved respiratory muscle function as a result of the inspiratory
      muscle training.

    <measure>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire addresses eight concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health.
Scoring the RAND 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favourable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.</description>

    <measure>Measurement model for the pediatric quality of life inventory: PedsQL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 8 items on physical functioning, 5 items on emotional functioning, 5 items on social functioning, and 5 items on school functioning. Each item is scored on a 0-4 scale. The items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate a better outcome. To create the Psychosocial Health Summary Score, the mean is computed as the sum of the items over the number of items answered in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Scales. The Physical Health Summary Score is the same as the Physical Functioning Scale Score. To create the Total Scale Score, the mean is computed as the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales.</description>

    <description>Active inspiratory muscle training (IMT) by the threshold IMT provides consistent and specific pressure for inspiratory muscle strength and endurance training, regardless of how quickly or slowly patients breathe. This device incorporates a flow-independent one-way valve to ensure consistent resistance and features an adjustable specific pressure setting (in cmH20) to be set. When patients inhale through the Threshold IMT, a spring-loaded valve provides a resistance that exercises respiratory muscles through conditioning.</description>
