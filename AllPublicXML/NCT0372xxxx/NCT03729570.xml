  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The premise for the study is that a tailored approach for rural young men who have sex with
      men (YMSM), addressing known barriers of transportation, access to providers, and privacy, is
      most likely to yield high levels of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation and
      persistence in care.

      The premise for the study is that a tailored approach for YMSM from rural and small town
      areas, addressing known barriers of transportation, access to providers, and privacy, is most
      likely to yield high levels of PrEP initiation and persistence in care. The study sites are
      Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Mississippi.

      Using a smartphone application (app), participants assigned to the intervention will receive
      and maintain a PrEP prescription without needing to leave their home (excepting pharmacy
      pick-up in some cases) - achieved through app-based surveys/screenings, telemedicine
      consultations, and home specimen self-collection.

    <measure>Difference in tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels between intervention and control arms</measure>
    <time_frame>12-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of TFV-DP levels will be conducted for participants in both arms using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods on self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples. TFV-DP level can be translated to an interpretation that indicates the mean number of days per week PrEP was ingested over a time period of approximately 1 month preceding specimen collection. The cutpoint used for the primary outcome measure will be TFV-DP levels considered to be a surrogate for substantial protection: &gt;700 fmol per DBS punch - a level of drug that corresponds to ingestion of at least 4 emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) tablets per week.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the ePrEP home care system for telemedicine PrEP, permitting initiation and persistence in PrEP care. The ePrEP home care system consists of: a smartphone application (app) for video-based telemedicine PrEP consultations with a clinician; secure messaging; a system to track shipments to &amp; from participants; and behavioral risk surveys that are complemented by home specimen kits. Self-collected specimens will be mailed to laboratories for routine, guideline-based testing for PrEP care. Home specimen collection will be used to determine the primary study outcome of tenofovir-diphosphate levels.</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be referred to a publicly available website that geolocates the nearest PrEP provider. They will receive standard of care, defined as what a member of the general public would be able to access for PrEP services. Home specimen self-collection will be used to determine the primary study outcome of tenofovir-diphosphate levels. Additional research assessments will include quarterly surveys.</description>

    <description>Participants will have a baseline teleconsultation with a site study clinician who will be responsible for prescribing PrEP as indicated. They will be offered a 1-month check-in and telemedicine consultations at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Participants will complete home specimen collection for laboratory tests for each consultation. The virtual study visit consists of surveys, specimen collection, and a telemedicine consultation.</description>
