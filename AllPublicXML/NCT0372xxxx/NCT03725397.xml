      The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of cervical ripening with
      transcervical Foley catheter in inpatient vs outpatient setting in a diverse, urban
      population within the United States. We hypothesize that there will be no differences in
      time-to-delivery, failed induction rates, cesarean section rates, or maternal/neonatal
      morbidity and that there will be no differences in total length of stay (LOS), hours of
      sleep, active labor duration, and perceived satisfaction between groups.
