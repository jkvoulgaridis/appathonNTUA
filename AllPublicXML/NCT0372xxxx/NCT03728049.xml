  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) is an important complication of Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Implantation (TAVI) that is associated with a 2.5-fold increase risk of mortality.
      Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) is considered as the gold standard to assess the
      severity of PVR and guide the physician to perform corrective procedures during TAVI, but it
      requires general anesthesia (GA). With such approach (TEE+GA), the PARTNERII trial has
      demonstrated that very low rate of PVR (3,5%) can be achieved with current devices.
      Registries have demonstrated a strong trend for using a mini-invasive approach in which the
      procedure is performed under conscious sedation (CS) without TEE. However, several studies
      raised concerns on the safety of this mini-invasive approach concerning the PVR rate. Thus,
      the accurate and real-time assessment of the presence and severity of PVR is an unmet
      clinical need to optimize TAVI without TEE guidance. A recent study reported that a blood
      biomarker reflecting the Von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity, i.e. the closure time with
      adenosine diphosphate (CT-ADP), is a valuable non-invasive, highly reproducible, and easy to
      perform alternative to TEE for PVR evaluation.

      The hypothesis is that the measurement of CT-ADP during TAVI performed without TEE guidance
      can improve both the detection of significant PVR and thus the procedural and clinical
      outcomes (primary objective).
