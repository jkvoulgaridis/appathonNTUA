  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic incurable Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes
      (TIL)-negative solid tumors who are not eligible for, declined or failed standard therapy
      will be treated with a combination nivolumab, low-dose ionizing radiation (RT) (0.5-2 Gy),
      aspirin (ASA)(cohorts 1 and 2)/celecoxib (cohorts 3, 4 and Phase Ib), and either ipilimumab
      or low-dose cyclophosphamide. The study comprises 2 phases: The aim of Phase Ia, is to
      determine safety and tolerability of a given combination therapy, as well as the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase Ib dose (RP1bD) of radiotherapy. Phase Ib aims to
      further explore safety and tolerability of this treatment in an expansion cohort.

      In Phase Ia, 4 distinct cohorts will receive the following combination therapy:

      Cohort1: combination therapy for 5 cycles (C0-C4) which includes: RT 0.5 Gy every 2 weeks
      (Q2W), Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W (cycles C0 to C4); ASA (300 mg) daily, with nivolumab 240 mg flat
      dose Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W) will be administered (cycles C1 to C4).

      Cohort2: combination therapy for 5 cycles (C0-C4) which includes: RT 1 Gy every 2 weeks
      (Q2W), Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W (cycles C0 to C4); ASA (300 mg) daily, with nivolumab 240 mg flat
      dose Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Q6W) will be administered (cycles C1 to C4).

      Cohorts 3a and 4a: Patients will receive Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W, celecoxib (2x200mg daily),
      nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) Q2W, and low-dose radiation. Cohort 3a will receive 1 Gy of
      low-radiation dose and cohort 4a will receive 2 Gy.

      Cohorts 3b and 4b: Patients will receive nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) Q2W, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg
      (Q6W), celecoxib (2x200mg daily) and low-dose radiation. Cohort 3b will receive 1 Gy of
      low-radiation dose and cohort 4b will receive 2 Gy.

      In Phase Ia, the safety of combination (nivolumab, celecoxib, low-dose irradiation and
      cyclophosphamide) or (nivolumab, celecoxib, low-dose irradiation and ipilimumab) will be
      evaluated , and MTD or RP1bD will be defined. RP1bD will be the MTD or, in the absence of
      dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the biologically best RT dose based on pharmacodynamics
      parameters.

      In Phase Ib, patients will be treated with the MTD or RP1bD dose of RT and will follow the
      selected schema of treatment used in the Phase Ia cohort 3 or 4. At the end of the 5th cycle,
      patients eligible for nivolumab maintenance, will be treated with nivolumab at 240 mg Q2W
      until progression or excessive toxicity; celecoxib will be maintained according to
      tolerability.

             visit), outside this protocol, for TIL assessment can be also considered for patient
             selection. Fresh tumor biopsies for subsequent translational studies will be used as
             baseline and collected at pre-screening (when biopsy will be performed for TIL status)
             or at screening (when archival biopsy will be used for TIL status). Biopsy from
             metastatic lymph nodes is accepted.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) clinical performance status: 0-1 for all
             patients, independently of the number of previous lines of therapy.

          7. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks

          8. Patients with Glycose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or any other
             hereditary coagulation disorder are excluded, as well as patients with clinical
             history of Reye syndrome

          9. Adequate serology defined by the following laboratory results obtained during
             pre-screening period (day-28 to day-14).

               1. Seronegative for HIV infection (anti-HIV-1/-2)

               2. Seronegative for hepatitis B infection (HBs Ag, total anti-hemoglobin C (HBc),
                  anti-HBs). Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B infection (defined as
                  having a negative hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg test and a positive anti-HBc
                  antibody test) are eligible, if hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA test is negative.

               3. Seronegative for hepatitis C infection (anti-HCV): if a patient has positive
                  anti-HCV antibody, a negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA need to be obtain to
                  register the patient.

        Study registration

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Signed main study Informed Consent Form

          2. Absence of tumor-infiltrating intraepithelial Cluster of differentiation-8 positive T

          4. Number of metastatic lesions viewed on Positron emission tomography-computed
             tomography (PET/CT) scan: for both Phase Ia and Phase Ib, the patient may have any
             number of metastatic lesions. A maximum of 10 metastatic lesions visible by PET/CT
             scan will be irradiated at the investigator's discretion. It is at the discretion of
             the investigator to exclude a metastatic site from the radiation field that, due to
             the radiotherapy volume, dose or location too close to a healthy organ, may put the
             patient at risk of suffering from radiation induced toxicity. If this would be the
             only metastatic site to be irradiated, the concerned patient will be excluded from the
             study.

             pneumonitis on screening chest Computerized Tomography (CT) scan. Exception: history
             of radiation pneumonitis in previous radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted provided
             that this area does not undergo current low dose irradiation as part of this protocol.

         20. Severe infections within 4 weeks prior registration including but not limited to
             hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia

         21. Signs or symptoms of infection within 2 weeks prior registration

         22. Received therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior registration.
             Exception: patients receiving routine antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., to prevent chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or for dental extraction) are eligible.

         23. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplant

         24. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before registration.
             Exception: influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only
             (approximately October to March). Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza
             vaccine within 4 weeks prior registration or at any time during the study.

         25. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

         26. Patients who have received prior treatment with anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD1),
             anti-Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) or anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated
             4 (CTLA-4) may be enrolled, provided at least 5 half-lives (approximately 75 days)
             have elapsed from the last dose to the registration and there was no history of severe
             immune-mediated adverse effects from such therapy (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4).

         27. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to
             interferon-alpha (IFN-a), interleukin-2 (IL-2)) for any reason within 6 weeks or five
             half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior registration

         28. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to
             prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide,
             and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents) within 2 weeks prior registration

               1. Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant
                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) or physiologic
                  replacement doses (i.e., prednisone 5-7.5 mg/day) for adrenal insufficiency may
                  be enrolled in the study.
