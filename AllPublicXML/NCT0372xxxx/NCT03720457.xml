  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of human CD19 targeted T Cells injection for the
      treatment of relapsed and refractory CD19-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and
      follicular lymphoma. Patients will be given a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by a single infusion of CD19 CAR+ T cells.

      Participants with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma and
      Follicular Lymphoma can participate if all eligibility criteria are met.Tests required to
      determine eligibility include disease assessments, a physical exam, Electrocardiograph,
      CT/MRI , and blood draws.Participants receive chemotherapy prior to the infusion of CD19 CAR+
      T cells. After the infusion, participants will be followed for side effects and effect of
      CD19 CAR+ T cells. Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
