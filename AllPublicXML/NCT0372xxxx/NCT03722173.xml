  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 894416
      in plasma when given as oral single dose together with multiple oral doses of itraconazole
      (Test,T) as compared to when given alone as oral single dose (Reference, R).

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG) and including the neurological examination) deviating from
             normal and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial in which investigational drug is administered

          -  Smoker (unless the subject quit smoking for at least 1 year prior to first planned

             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  History of relevant neurological disorder affecting the peripheral or central nervous
             system (this includes, but is not limited to: stroke, epilepsy, inflammatory or

             nervous system). Febrile seizures in childhood or adolescence, recovered carpal tunnel
             syndrome, recovered uncomplicated meningitis, recovered herpes zoster, tension
             headache, occasional benign tics (e.g. due to stress) or minor par- or dysesthesia
             (e.g. as a side effect of prior blood withdrawal) do not constitute a history of
             relevant neurological disorder.

          -  History of immunological disease except allergy not relevant to the trial (such as
             mild hay fever or dust mite allergy) and except asthma in childhood or adolescence

          -  History of cancer (other than successfully treated basal cell carcinoma)

          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of any drug that could
             reasonably inhibit platelet aggregation or coagulation (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid)

             examination

          -  History of drug-induced liver injury
