      This is a multi-center, prospective study evaluating a treatment for obesity using the g-Cath
      EZ and associated devices. The intent is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified
      Snowshoe suture anchor placement pattern called Pose 2 (suture anchors placed in the mid +
      distal body of the stomach, with none placed in the fundus) along with a moderate intensity
      diet and exercise program. The g-Cath EZ and the associated devices (the g-Prox EZ, g-Lix &amp;
      Transport) are known collectively as the Incisionless Operating Platform (IOP). Efficacy of
      the treatment will be evaluated based on changes in weight loss over 12 months, &amp; adverse
      events will be recorded throughout the duration of the study.
