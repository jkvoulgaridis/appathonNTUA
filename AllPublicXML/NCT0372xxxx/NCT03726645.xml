  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients often have subclinical gut wall inflammation. Gut
      dysbiosis has been associated with both AS and Crohn disease, both of which have several
      features in common. Gut dysbiosis is associated with specific microbial profile in AS
      patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proved to be safe and effective
      treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and the change in gut microbiota is
      shown to be long lasting. It has led to interest to study its effect on different
      inflammatory conditions associated with gut dysbiosis.

      We hypothesize that dysbiosis in AS leads to inflammasome overactivation on gut mucosa. We
      aim to study the role of gut inflammation, gut microbiota and inflammasome activation in
      pathogenesis of AS, and the effect of FMT on these factors, as well as clinical activity, in
      AS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo- controlled randomized pilot study with 20 patients with
      active AS from 2 Finnish outpatient clinics. An ileocolonoscopy will be performed to all
      patients. 10 patients will receive FMT with feces of one of two healthy donors, and 10
      patients with their own feces during ileocolonoscopy. Ileal and colonic biopsies will be
      taken to assess gut wall inflammation and mucosal microbiota composition. Ileocolonoscopy
      will be controlled in 6 months in patients with macroscopic inflammatory lesions in the first
      colonoscopy. From mucosal biopsies we will assess intestinal mucosal structure, inflammasome
      activity, cytokine expression, and the mucin layer thickness and the amount of bacterial LPS
      (lipopolysaccharide), which are associated with mucosal integrity. Blood levels of zonulin
      and LPS as indicators of mucosal permeability and bacterial penetrance will be assessed.
      Fecal samples will be collected repeatedly to measure fecal calprotectin, and to assess the
      bacterial profile changes. From mucosal biopsies and fecal samples microbial DNA will be
      segregated and bacterial species sorted by rRNA- based sequence technique. Clinical activity
      of AS will be assessed in follow-up visits as well as repeated BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing
      Spondylitis Disease Activity Index), BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index) and
      MASES (Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score) evaluations, and measurement of
      CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Follow-up time is 12
      months.
