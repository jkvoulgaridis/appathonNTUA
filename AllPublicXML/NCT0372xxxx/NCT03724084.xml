  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pinometostat and how well it
      works with standard chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid
      leukemia and a type of genetic mutation called MLL gene rearrangement. Pinometostat may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in standard chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pinometostat with standard
      chemotherapy may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine a safe and tolerable schedule of pinometostat continuous intravenous infusion in
      combination with daunorubicin hydrochloride (daunorubicin) and cytarabine in patients with
      untreated, newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia harboring MLL rearrangement.

      II. Determine the rate of complete remission (complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete
      hematologic recovery [CRi]) in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia harboring
      MLL rearrangement after treatment with pinometostat in combination with daunorubicin and
      cytarabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Estimate biologic activity of 7 day window
      treatment of pinometostat monotherapy.

      III. Estimate the toxicity profile of pinometostat alone (week 1) and in combination with
      daunorubicin and cytarabine.

      IV. Estimate event free and overall survival of patients with MLL rearranged acute myeloid
      leukemia after combination treatment with pinometostat, daunorubicin, and cytarabine.

      V. Estimate the early death rate (death =&lt; 30 days) of pinometostat, daunorubicin, and
      cytarabine.

      VI. Determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity by clinical flow
      cytometry on post-treatment recovery bone marrow.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pinometostat followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive pinometostat intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-35, daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 10-30 minutes on days 8-10 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 8-14
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who do not achieve CR/CRi after treatment receive pinometostat6 IV continuously on
      days 1-28, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1 and 2 and cytarabine IV
      continuously on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, then every
      3 months for up to 4 years.

             investigational and standard of care drug administration plans, imaging studies,
             laboratory tests (including all biomarkers), procedures, and study- and
             disease-related restrictions

          -  The effects of pinometostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because other small molecule inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used
             in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry for the duration of study participation, and for 4
             weeks after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate barrier contraception prior to the study, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days after completion of pinometostat
             administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             or, for patients with impaired decision-making capacity, the consent of a close legal
             guardian who is readily available

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q22;q12) and/or PML-RARA molecular
             rearrangement, or other atypical RARA translocation partner

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for AML, excluding hydroxyurea for count
             control, or ATRA for APML that was initially suspected but later ruled out

          -  Patients who have received any prior investigational agent for acute myeloid leukemia

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have a cumulative lifetime exposure (prior to study entry) of greater
             than 300 mg/m^2 doxorubicin equivalent anthracycline

          -  Patients who have received chest radiation (unless organ-sparing) and who have a
             cumulative lifetime exposure (prior to study entry) of greater than 240 mg/m^2
             doxorubicin equivalent anthracycline

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia, or
             peripheral neuropathy (up to grade 2 is permitted)

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to pinometostat or other agents used in study

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible unless the offending medication can be safely
             stopped prior to enrollment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection requiring antibiotics (with exception), symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia not controllable with
             medications, electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients receiving an
             anti-microbial agent may be eligible if the patient remains afebrile and
             hemodynamically stable for 72 hours

          -  Patients with an active bleeding diathesis

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pinometostat is a small molecule
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with pinometostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with pinometostat. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study

          -  Subjects with known symptomatic leukemia of the central nervous system including
             leptomeningeal leukemic involvement

          -  History of active other malignancy that limits survival to less than 1 year

          -  Ongoing viral or drug induced liver injury, including active chronic hepatitis C virus
             (HCV), chronic active hepatitis B, clinically known alcoholic liver disease,
             non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, primary biliary
             cirrhosis, other cirrhosis of the liver, history of hepatic encephalopathy, or portal
             hypertension

          -  Any other prior condition that could, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise
             patient safety or evaluation of the primary outcome
