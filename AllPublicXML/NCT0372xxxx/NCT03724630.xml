      unicameral bone cysts (UBCs) are benign, fluid-filled cavities that develop in tubular and
      flat bones (eg,humerus, femur). These cysts tend to expand and weaken the local bone,but they
      are not true neoplasms. In 1876, Virchow1 first described these lesions as cystic structures
      caused by abnormalities in local circulation.

      UBCs are also known as simple or solitary bone cysts. They occur almost exclusively in
      children and adolescents (up to 85% of cases), with a reported peak between ages 3 and14
      years and the average age at diagnosis being 9 years.

      These lesions represent approximately 3% of all bone tumors and occur more commonly in boys
      than in girls (2:1). Several treatment options exist for unicameral bone cysts (UBCs),
      including observation, steroid injection, bone marrow injection, and Surgical procedures have
      ranged from simple curettage with autologous bone graft or allograft to sub periosteal
      resection with internal fixation and grafting

      .Treatment by multiple injection of steroids produce minimal surgical approach, no hospital
      stay, and very low morbidity. Three or four injections over a period of 12 month may be
      enough

    <description>Modified Neer classification
Healed cyst : Cyst filled by new bone, with or without small radiolucent area(s) &lt; 1 cm in size
Healing with defect: Radiolucent area(s) &lt; 50% of the diameter of bone, with enough cortical thickness to prevent fracture
Persistent cyst: Radiolucent area &gt; 50% of diameter of the bone and with a thin cortical rim. No increase in the size of the cyst. Continued restriction of activity or repeated treatment is required
Recurrent cyst: Cyst reappeared in a previously obliterated area, or a residual radiolucent area has increased in size
the cyst index which predict the risk of pathological fracture .The cyst index can be calculated as the area of the cyst divided by the square of the diaphysis diameter cyst index equal to or greater than 3.5 indicates a high fracture risk</description>

        Each patient will receive a maximum of three or four injections, with at least three months
        between injections. The indication for a second or third injection will be based on the
        surgeon's judgment regarding whether the cyst will be healed or not..

        Injections will be performed with the patient under general anesthesia. Under image
        intensifier. The diagnosis of a unicameral bone cyst will be confirmed by needle aspiration
        of clear or straw-colored fluid.

          -  Methylprednisolone acetate, 3 mg/cm3 of cyst volume with amaximum dose of 180 mg will
             be injected into the cyst .

        If the cyst was multilocular, each cavity will be injected separately follow up of patients
        by radiological and clinical outcomes
