  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the best behavioral treatments for obesity only work for 50% of adults, and of
      those who initially succeed, most do not maintain their weight loss. One reason for this
      failure may be due to neurocognitive deficits found among individuals with obesity,
      particularly related to executive function, which make it difficult for these adults to
      adhere to treatment recommendations. The proposed study aims to develop a Novel Executive
      Function Treatment (NEXT), which when administered prior to the behavioral treatment, could
      help improve outcomes by addressing the neurocognitive deficits in adults with overweight or
      obesity.

      First, to assist with treatment development, two groups of approximately 10 participants will
      be enrolled in a 12-week open-label treatment group of NEXT. These participants will then
      provide qualitative feedback to help with treatment development. After the two pilot groups,
      a randomized control trial will evaluate NEXT compared to standard BWL to assess feasibility,
      acceptability and preliminary efficacy. Treatment will be 6 months long and assessments will
      occur at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 6-months after treatment.

    <description>All participants will be instructed on how to consume a balanced deficit diet of conventional foods; individual goals for energy intake will be based on initial body weight. Participants will be instructed in measuring portion sizes, counting calories (with a calorie counter provided or on their phone), and self-monitoring food intake. The physical activity program will focus on increasing both lifestyle activity and structured exercise programs. Behavior change recommendations include stimulus control, self-monitoring, goal setting, managing high-risk situations, meal planning, slowing eating, problem solving, social support, cognitive restructuring, lapse and relapse prevention skills, and maintaining weight loss.</description>
