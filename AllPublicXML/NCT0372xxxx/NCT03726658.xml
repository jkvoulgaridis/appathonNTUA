    <measure>Part A: To evaluate the efficacy at 1 day post the initial single oral dose of AGN-241751 compared with placebo in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be measured by improvement in MADRS total score. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale to assess depressive symptomatology during the preceding week. Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more depression. A negative change score indicates improvement</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Part B: To evaluate the efficacy at Day 7 of AGN-241751 compared with placebo in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) dosed twice daily (BID)</measure>
