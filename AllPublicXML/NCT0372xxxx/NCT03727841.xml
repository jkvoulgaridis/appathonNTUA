  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Ependymomas are rare tumors that arise from the ependyma. That is a tissue of the central
      nervous system. They can develop in the brain or the spine. They are usually treated with
      surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Researchers want to see if the new drug marizomib
      can help people with a certain kind of ependymoma.

      Objective:

      To see if marizomib stops tumor growth and prlongs the time that the tumor is controlled.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 and older who have been diagnosed with ependymomas and have already been
      treated with standard therapies

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with the following tests or recent results from similar tests:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Neurological assessment

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) to evaluate the heart

        -  Review of symptoms and ability to perform normal activities

        -  Computed tomographic scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to produce an image
           of the brain or spine.

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Tests of tumor samples. Participants may have to have new tumor samples taken.

      Participants will get the study drug in cycles. Each cycle is 4 weeks. Participants will have
      up to 24 cycles.

      Participants will get the study drug through a small plastic tube in a vein on days 1, 8, and
      15 of each cycle.

      During each cycle, some screening tests will be repeated.

      Participants will answer questions about their general well-being and functioning.

      About 4 5 weeks after finishing the study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit.
      They will answer questions about their health, get a physical and a neurological exam, and
      have blood tests. They may have an MRI or CT scan.

    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Ependymomas are rare primary brain tumors arising from radial glial stem cells. They
           comprise 5.2% of all pediatric primary brain tumors and 1.9% of all adult primary brain
           tumors.

        -  The standard therapy for newly diagnosed ependymoma is gross total resection followed by
           radiation therapy. For anaplastic ependymoma, recurrence rate is high with a median
           progression free survival (PFS) of 2.3 years.

        -  There are limited chemotherapy options for recurrent ependymomas, which have already
           been irradiated. Therefore, there is an unmet need to target novel pathways for
           treatment of ependymomas.

        -  About 70% of supratentorial ependymomas have a characteristic signature C11orf95-RELA
           fusion which drives tumorigenesis in ependymomas by activating the NF-KB transcription
           pathway.

        -  Marizomib is a second-generation irreversible proteasome inhibitor which penetrates
           across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). It inhibits the activity of 20S proteasome in
           glioma cells, activates caspases, builds up reactive oxygen species and thus induces
           apoptosis. Marizomib blocks the NF-pathway by proteasome inhibition. Thus, it may have
           an additional targeted therapeutic effect in the RELA-fusion molecular subgroup of
           ependymomas.

      Objective:

      -To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with marizomib in RELA-fusion recurrent ependymoma and
      non RELA-fusion recurrent ependymoma as measured by progression-free survival at 6 months
      (PFS6).

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically proven intra-cranial or spinal ependymoma.

        -  Radiographic evidence of tumor progression

        -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.

      Patients must have had prior radiotherapy.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II study to determine the efficacy of marizomib in recurrent ependymoma.

        -  A novel 2-stage sequential design will be employed to conduct the trial for recurrent
           ependymoma.

        -  In the first stage, we will enroll 18 patients with RELA-fusion ependymoma and if 4 or
           more patients in Cohort 1 are progression free at 6 months, we will proceed to stage 2;
           otherwise we will terminate the trial and conclude that marizomib is not effective.

        -  In the second stage, we will enroll 32 patients with non RELA-fusion ependymoma.

        -  Patients will be treated with marizomib in cycles consistent of 28 days until disease
           progression or a maximum of 24 cycles.

                  questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to
                  the NCI Principal Investigator.

             study requirements.

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg
             and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg).

             hospitalization for congestive heart failure diagnosis within 12 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because marizomib s potential
             forteratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with marizomib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with marizomib.

          -  Patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or active anti-viral treatment for Hepatitis A, B or C
             infection. Anti-viral therapy, when combined with marizomib, poses a potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions. Marizomib also increases immunosuppression, placing
             patients at an increased risk of acquiring lethal infections. Appropriate studies will
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
