  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many factors during laparascopic surgery leads to PONV (postoperative nausea and vomiting),
      such as C02 insufflations causing peritoneal stretch and irritation and type of anaesthesia
      given during surgery.

      The two anesthetic techniques used in bariatric surgery are gas anesthesia (Remifentanil TCI
      and Desfluran) and Total Intra Venous Anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol. There are studies
      which have shown a reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting following TIVA, and there
      are publications showing no statistically significant difference.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the best anaesthetic approach for obese subjects,
      evaluating awakening time, postoperative nausea and pain.

      Our hypothesis was based on the fact that Propofol is a lipid-soluble anesthetic and
      therefore might have a prolonged effect in obese patients, leading to a longer awakening time
      along with postoperative nausea and vomiting. This hypothesis is also described earlier by
      obese patients have more depots (bulk fat) and also more fat surface making anaesthetics
      storage more easier, and also that the anesthetic will return into the circulation when the
      administration is stopped [18].
