  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 2 weeks dapagliflozin treatment in
      individuals with a disrupted glucose homeostasis on the switch between carbohydrate and lipid
      oxidation during the night
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if dapagliflozin improves nocturnal substrate oxidation expressed as
      respiration quotient (RQ) during the sleeping period in comparison with placebo after 2-weeks
      double blind treatment in subjects with a disrupted glucose homeostasis.
