          2. Diagnosis of PSC consistent with the guidelines published by the AASLD. All subjects
             must have an elevated serum ALP of at least 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) at
             baseline plus cholangiographic evidence of PSC (MRI, endoscopic retrograde
             cholangiography, or direct cholangiography).

          3. Indirect bilirubin &lt;1.2 times the ULN

          4. An ultrasound (or equivalent imaging modality) that excludes biliary obstruction and
             malignancy within 6 months of study enrollment

          5. PSC with or without inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
             disease

          6. Must agree to comply with the study protocol and provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Active hepatitis A or B infection

          3. Active hepatitis C infection (antibody positive); patients with a history of hepatitis
             C infection will be eligible for this study if they have undetectable levels of HCV
             RNA

          8. Inherited diseases of the liver such as α-1 antitrypsin deficiency

          9. Immunoglobulin G4-related cholangitis

         19. Any other conditions or abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             compromise the safety of the subject or interfere with the subject participating in or
             completing the study

         20. Evidence of, or treatment for, C. difficile infection within 30 days before the
             initiation of the study drug

         21. Evidence of active C. difficile infection during the screening phase confirmed by a
             positive C. difficile toxin B

         22. Subjects who have been treated for intestinal pathogens other than C. difficile
             infection within 30 days prior to study drug initiation

         23. Received or plan to receive live vaccine within 30 days prior to, and through the end
             of the study

         24. Use of methotrexate at dose ≥17.5mg/week

         25. Rosuvastatin exceeding 10 mg daily
