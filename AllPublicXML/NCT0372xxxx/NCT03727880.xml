  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness (anti-tumor activity), safety, and ability to increase
      the body's immune system to fight pancreatic cancer by combining standard chemotherapy before
      and after surgery, with study drug PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, with and without study drug,
      focal adhesion kinase inhibitor (FAK), defactinib, in people with &quot;high risk&quot; resectable
      (surgically removable) pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if
      reprograming the tumor microenvironment by targeting FAK following chemotherapy can
      potentiate anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody.
