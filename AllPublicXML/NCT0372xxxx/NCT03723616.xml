  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us better understand what kinds of waterpipe tobacco
      advertisements appeal to young adults as well as to help evaluate and create health warnings
      that can be placed on waterpipe tobacco advertisements to inform young adults of the risks
      associated with smoking hookah tobacco.

    <description>This arm is identical to the text only intervention except a graphic will be added to the health warning. Thus, each ad will be seen twice; the text + graphic warnings will be seen three times. The 16 control ads will have text disclaimers and logos or other images to control for physical features of ads.</description>
