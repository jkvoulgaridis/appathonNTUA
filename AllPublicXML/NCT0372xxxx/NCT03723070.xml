      Multi-center, open label, prospective clinical study to establish the acute safety and
      performance of the Cryterion Cardiac Cryoablation System
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label clinical study using a cryoablation balloon device to
      isolate pulmonary veins during an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. Cryo is a
      scientifically proven energy source used to create a thermal injury during endocardial
      ablation. The investigational device uses current technology with minor design modifications
      and will be studied to validate similarities in the safety and performance parameters
      compared to literature.
