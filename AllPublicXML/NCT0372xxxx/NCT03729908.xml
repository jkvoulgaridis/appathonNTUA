  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an animal assisted mindfulness
      intervention (AAMI) on patients with acquired brain injuries on their global severity of
      psychological distress.

      In addition, the effects on the patients' symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress,
      mood, coping and mindfulness/self-compassion will be assessed.

      The study experimental condition consists of 6 weeks of intervention, containing 6 different
      modules. In every session, an animal will be present.

      In the control condition, the same program and same exercises will be used without the
      presence of or reference to animals. Sessions take place two times a week for 6 weeks
      (leading up to a total of 12 experimental/control sessions), each lasting for about 60
      minutes.

      24 participants are planned to be included, 12 patients in each group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It was estimated that a total sample of 24 participants (12 patients in each group) would
      provide enough power to detect a medium effect. Since we had several dropouts, two additional
      groups (one intervention and one control) were started. This lead to the inclusion of 31
      participants with a total sample size of 25 participants finishing the program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via BSI (Global Severity Index GSI). The Global Severity Index (GSI) is designed to help quantify a patient's severity-of-illness and provides a single composite score for measuring the outcome of a treatment program based on reducing symptom severity. Minimal total score = 0, maximal total score = 212 (higher values represent a worse outcome)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via BDI-FS (Beck Depression Inventory - Fast Screen for Medical Clients, without somatic items). The BDI-FS is a fast screen assessment of depression for medical patients. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 21, higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via the PSS-10-D (Perceived Stress Scale - 10). The Perceived Stress Scale was developed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The minimal total score is 1, the maximal total score is 40. Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via the FFA-14 (Freiburger Fragebogen zur Achtsamkeit). Minimum total score is 0, maximum total score is 39. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-compassion</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via SCS-D Kurzversion (Self-compassion scale - Deutsch): Minimum total score is 1, maximum total score is 60, higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via Brief COPE-G: The Brief COPE (-G, German version) Inventory is a multidimensional coping inventory to assess the different ways in which people respond to stress. It measures problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and dysfunctional coping. Each subscale ranges between 1 and 8 with higher values representing higher scores in the respective coping strategy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS measuring motivation, emotion, cognition and attitude towards animals. The Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) provide a simple technique for measuring subjective experience and are continuous scales comprised of a horizontal line. Minimum score for each item is 0, maximum score is 160 with higher scores representing better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via the MDBF before and after each session: Mehrdimensionaler Befindlichkeitsfragebogen. The &quot;Mehrdimensionaler Befindlichkeitsfragebogen&quot; (MDBF) is a German-language instrument to assess the 3 mood dimensions pleasant-unpleasant, awake-sleepy, calm-restless and includes 24 items. Minimum score is 4, maximum score is 20.</description>
