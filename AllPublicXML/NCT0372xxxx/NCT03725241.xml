  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of glutathione supplement on the immune
      cell response and symptomatology of upper respiratory health, and antioxidant capacity in
      healthy people in exercise-induced model.

      A minimum of 60 individuals will be recruited and enrolled to complete the entire protocol in
      a randomized, double-blinded, 18 week placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will receive either
      a placebo or glutathione while participating in a stepwise exercise approach that mixes
      periods of high and low training volume to train subjects and improve running efficiency.
      Upper Respiratory Tract Infection-related health conditions will be monitored and assessed
      throughout the study period. Blood and saliva samples will be collected at baseline, and
      before and after timed 15k and half marathon runs at 12 and 16 weeks respectively.
