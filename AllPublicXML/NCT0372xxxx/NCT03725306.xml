      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the endometrial
      ablation device Librata in reducing menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-treatment when
      used in pre‑menopausal women with menorrhagia due to benign causes for whom childbearing is
      complete.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menorrhagia is ovulatory (cyclic), heavy bleeding, that should be treated when it interferes
      with quality of life or causes anemia. It is a common problem and it is estimated that 5% of
      women aged 30 to 49 seek referral for evaluation and treatment. No structural cause is found
      in the majority of women with menorrhagia and treatment intends to reduce blood loss and
      improve quality of life.

      First line treatment is medical therapy with hormonal therapy using either the combined
      contraceptive pill or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. These treatments are
      not suitable for all women and indeed some women may not find them acceptable. For these
      women, surgical management is then offered with either endometrial ablation or hysterectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical success defined as a
      reduction of menstrual bleeding, defined as a score of 75 or less or 50% reduction from
      baseline on the Menstrual Pictogram scoring diary at 12 months post-treatment. Additionally,
      a secondary objective is to determine the primary safety incidence of serious adverse events
      (SAEs) by 12 months.

      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, controlled trial to
      demonstrate that the percentage of subjects with reduction in menstrual bleeding at 12 months
      is significantly greater than 66%. A total of 200 subjects will be enrolled.

      The study population will include pre-menopausal women, aged 25-50 with a history of
      menorrhagia due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.

                  for two baseline cycles within three months prior to treatment OR
