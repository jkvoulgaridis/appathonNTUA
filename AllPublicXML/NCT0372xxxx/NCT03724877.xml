      To assess the effectiveness of maintenance treatment of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) with the Long-acting beta2-agonist - long-acting muscarinic antagonists-inhaled
      corticosteroids (LABA-LAMA-ICS) combination with a LABA-LAMA combination on the risk of COPD

    <description>The primary outcome event for effectiveness was the first COPD exacerbation to occur after cohort entry. The event was defined as a hospitalization with the prescription of an oral corticosteroid, namely prednisolone (moderate exacerbation) is presented.</description>
