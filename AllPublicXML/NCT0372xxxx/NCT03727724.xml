        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer,
             harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation.

          -  18 years or older at time of study entry.

          -  Life expectancy of at least three months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 (see Appendix 1).

          -  Measurable disease, according to RECIST 1.1.

          -  At baseline adequate fresh or archived tissue from a histological biopsy or a
             cellblock obtained by fine needle aspiration of a tumor lesion that is not radiated
             prior to biopsy, must be available. Baseline tissue samples must have been obtained
             after the last line of systemic therapy prior to study entry.

          -  Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Absolute leukocyte count ≥ 3 x 109/L (&gt; 3000 per mm3)

          -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L (&gt;75,000 per mm3)

          -  Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x
             institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case
             it must be ≤ 5x upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Serum creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by 24-hour
             urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential: these subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and agree to use highly
             effective contraception, as defined in section 5.2.2, from 7 days prior to enrollment,
             throughout the treatment period and for seven months after completion of the treatment
             with cetuximab.

          -  Males must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering a child from the
             first dose of study treatment through 3 months after the final administration of
             investigational drugs.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

          -  Ability to give written informed consent before patient registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the
             last 2 weeks.

          -  Prior treatment with EGFR targeting antibodies (prior treatment with EGFR TKI's is
             allowed).

          -  Other active malignancy.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to afatinib or cetuximab.

          -  Major surgery (excluding diagnostic procedures e.g. mediastinoscopy or video assisted
             thoracic surgery (VATS) biopsy) within 28 days of the start of study treatment.

          -  Radiotherapy less than two weeks prior to the start of study treatment.

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases.

          -  Breast feeding is not allowed during study treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, myocardial infarction within 12
             months prior to the study entry, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to
             give written informed consent. Any other concomitant serious illness or organ system
             dysfunction which in the opinion of the investigator would either compromise patient
             safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety and anti-tumor activity of the
             test drugs.
