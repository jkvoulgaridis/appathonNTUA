  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of prospective trial data and consensus guidelines describing the use of
      Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (FSRT) in the treatment of brain metastases.
      There has been no prospective dose escalation study performed to date to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients treated with FSRT. Prescription doses in the series
      described above ranged from 18 Gy to 42 Gy, delivered in 3 to 12 fractions. The results of
      this study will be used to plan future Phase II/III studies to determine the efficacy of
      different dose fractionation schedules of FSRT. We thus propose a phase I study to determine
      the feasibility and safety of FSRT in patients with brain metastases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically proven diagnosis of a non-hematological malignancy other than small
             cell lung cancer within 5 years of registration.

          -  Patients with measurable brain metastases who have a gadolinium contrast enhanced MRI
             obtained within 30 days prior to registration. Patients with CT based diagnostic
             imaging without MRI will not be allowed to enroll on this trial.

          -  No surgical resection of the target lesion, defined as ≥3 cm but ≤6 cm in size on MRI
             of the Brain with contrast

          -  Prior Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) is allowed

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 or ECOG ≤2

          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice adequate
             contraception

          -  History/Physical examination within 30 days prior to registration

          -  Life expectancy&gt;3 months

          -  Patients are allowed to enroll if previously treated to other lesions with SRS

          -  Patients with multiple lesions are allowed, as long there is one dominant lesion that
             will be treated with FSRT. Other lesions may be treated concurrently with SRS or FSRT
             at the discretion of the treating physician but will not contribute to the study
             endpoints.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with definitive leptomeningeal metastases, based on cerebrospinal fluid
             examination (CSF)

          -  Plan for chemotherapy or targeted agents during treatment. All hormonal therapy and
             bone supportive therapy may be continued while patient is on study.

          -  Contraindication to enhanced MRI imaging such as implanted metal devices. However,
             patients with implanted devices which are MRI compatible are allowed.

          -  Patients with measurable brain metastasis resulting from small cell lung cancer and
             germ cell malignancy

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as congestive heart failure, unstable angina,
             cardiac arrhythmia, and uncontrolled seizure activity.

          -  Previous treatment of the target lesions with radiotherapy.
