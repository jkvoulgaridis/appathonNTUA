  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is widespread acceptance that air in intravenous (IV) fluid tubing (lines) can pose a
      significant risk to patients.1 A rigorous literature search regarding sources of this air
      identified only anecdotal and non-clinical work regarding the presence and sources of air in
      IV tubing. Most published case studies have focused on air entrainment from accidental or
      inadvertent sources - empty IV fluid bags, incomplete priming of the tubing prior to
      infusion, and air-detection device failures, as examples.

      The sources (and volume) of air inside IV tubing during common surgical procedures or
      interventions have yet to be studied prospectively. Understanding the frequency and magnitude
      of the presence of unintended air in IV tubing is the first step in devising potential
      avoidance strategies for eliminating unintended air in IV tubing. This study was designed to
      identify both the sources and magnitude of air that occurs in IV tubing during routine
      surgical procedures.

      Methods:

      An observational prospective trial was conducted in operating room settings across multiple
      study sites. 120 surgical patients undergoing a variety of interventional and surgical
      procedures were selected, representing multiple patient populations, case types and
      anesthesia setups. The ClearLine IV, a device that detects and removes air from IV tubing,
      was inserted into the IV circuit. Clinicians followed standard protocols. Blood warmers were
      used at the practitioner's discretion. IV fluid was administered at a constant flow rate or
      through a bolus given over 30-60 seconds per standard of care. The volume and duration of
      fluid administration was recorded, along with the frequency, duration and amount of air
      captured by ClearLine IV.
