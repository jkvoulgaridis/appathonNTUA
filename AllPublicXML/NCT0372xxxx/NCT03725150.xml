  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of anaemia remains unacceptably high during pregnancy. Over a third of women are
      anaemic by their third trimester of pregnancy. The most common cause is iron deficiency. One
      key factor is rising iron requirements throughout pregnancy. There are risks associated with
      anaemia for the mother and infant. Anaemia in the first and second trimester has been
      significantly correlated with low birth weight and pre-term birth, and is associated with
      impaired neurological development of the baby. It also increases the risk of intrauterine
      fetal death, and the likelihood of the mother requiring blood transfusions during or after
      delivery.This study is a prospective cohort study, which aims to better define the natural
      history and understand how to use oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant
      women. This includes documenting the impact of treatment on anaemia symptoms, side effects,
      and the level of success of iron therapy using several haematological tests. Pregnant women
      will be invited to participate in this study and treated using a treatment schedule as
      described in national guidelines. Additional blood samples will be taken for subsequent
      detailed analysis of pathways of iron metabolism to better predict the response to oral iron
      therapy during pregnancy.

             (within 6 weeks postdelivery) with anaemia as defined by World Health Organization
             (WHO) criteria and described in British Society Haematology (BSH)/ British Committee
             for standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines.

               1. First trimester &lt; 110g/l

          -  Age: 18-45 years

          -  Agreement to participate in the study with consenting

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anaemic women presenting at or after 36 weeks as there may be insufficient time to
             delivery to assess responses to oral iron)

          -  Anaemic women affected by a (major) haemoglobinopathy e.g. B thalassaemia major sickle
             cell disease
