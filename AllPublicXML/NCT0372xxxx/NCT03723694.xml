      To test the effect of a cocoa-derived dietary flavanol on brain structures and cognitive
      outcomes in a 12-week randomized controlled trial of 146 healthy participants, age 50-69, who
      will receive this cocoa derivative or a placebo. We also will examine the role of
      inflammation in this relationship.

    <textblock>
      Within 25 years, the US population aged 65 and over will double in size to 80 million
      bringing, with it an epidemic of aging-related cognitive decline, from normal cognitive aging
      to neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's Disease. These conditions impair quality
      of life and functional status, impose an enormous burden on individuals, their families, the
      healthcare system, and require elucidation of mechanisms and development of new treatments to
      prevent or at least slow their progression. The use of plant-based food and drink for health
      purposes has a long and well-documented history. Cocoa beans contain a substance that has
      multiple beneficial health effects. In this study, the investigators will test the effect of
      this substance on brain structures and cognitive outcomes in a 12-week randomized controlled
      trial of 146 healthy participants, age 50-69, who will receive this cocoa derivative or a
      placebo. The investigators also will examine the role of inflammation in this relationship.
      Such a trial has potential for significant clinical impact.
