  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the addition of atezolizumab to
      FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab as first line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer in terms of Progression Free Survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric phase II randomized in a 1:2 ratio trial in
      which patients initially unresectable and previously untreated mCRC will receive induction
      treatment with FOLFOXIRI plus bev up to 8 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus
      bev until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal (arm A) versus
      FOLFOXIRI plus bev plus atezolizumab up to 8 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus
      bev plus atezolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal
      (arm B). If disease progression does not occur during induction, at the treating physician's
      discretion, the reintroduction after progression of the same induction treatment (up to 8
      cycles) according to randomization arm, followed by maintenance until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal, is recommended.

      The third- and subsequent lines of treatment will be at investigators' choice.
