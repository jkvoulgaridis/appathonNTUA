    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if clinically prescribed desipramine is effective at
      improving the symptoms and slowing the progression of Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD)
      in affected children.

      Participants will receive an initial oral dose of study drug once a day. This dose may be
      changed depending on response to study drug Clinically collected data will be recorded for up
      to 5 years. Investigators will also ask for participant permission to obtain a sample of
      child's skin biopsy from unused clinical sample previously collected for standard of care.

    <measure>Change in gross motor function as measured by Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months &amp; 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is a 66 item standardized observational instrument designed and validated to measure change in gross motor function over time in children with cerebral palsy. Items are ordered in terms of difficulty and a unit of change has the same meaning throughout the scale ranging from 0 to 100.

    <measure>Change in motor function as measured by Quick Motor Function Test (QMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months 9 months &amp; 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Motor Function Test (QMFT) is a 16 item, psychometrically robust outcome assessment, validated in children and adults with Pompe disease (a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness). This motor function test observes performance and scores the items separately on a 5-point ordinal scale (ranging from 0 to 4). If items can be performed on both left and right extremities, the right side is taken. A total score is obtained by adding the scores of all items. The total score ranges between 0 and 64 points. A high score correlates with greater motor function.</description>

    <measure>Change in cognitive function as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months &amp; 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland-3 is a standardized measure of adaptive behavior--the things that people do to function in their everyday lives. It is a norm-based instrument that compares the examinee's adaptive functioning in four domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization and Motor Skills to that of others of the same age. A composite score of adaptive behavior is calculated that summarizes the individual's performance across all four domains.</description>
