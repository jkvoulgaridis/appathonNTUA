      Group cognitive behavioral therapy for Gambling Disorder (GD) with a focus on emotion
      regulation - A pilot study This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and possible
      effectiveness of a novel treatment protocol developed within the research group including
      emotion regulation techniques for the treatment of GD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The manual is based on principles from so called third wave cognitive behavioral therapy,
      which differs from current treatment within standard care in that focus is more on emotion
      regulation techniques. The treatment consists of an 8- session program delivered by weekly
      sessions. The study is an open trial in order to evaluate the possible benefit of components
      of emotion regulation in treating gambling disorder (GD). Participants with psychiatric
      comorbidities will be included and symptoms of comorbidities will be measured as secondary
      outcomes.

      Once included in the study the participant will be measured weekly on symptoms of gambling
      disorder.

      By increasing competencies in emotion regulation (such as active problem solving, acceptance
      and reappraisal of events in order to change their emotional impact) the hypothesis is that
      the participants will improve on measures of symptoms of GD as well as gambling expenditure
      in terms of time and money.
