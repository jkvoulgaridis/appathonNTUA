  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly frequent, and patients with advanced CKD are known to
      have a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about
      the cardiovascular risk in patients with mildly reduced kidney function (reduced glomerular
      filtration rate, GFR), affecting up to 10% of the general population; and importantly, also
      affecting living kidney donors. Until recently it has been believed that donating a kidney
      does not represent any health hazard. However, a recent Norwegian epidemiological study
      suggested that kidney donors have an increased risk of CVD. The pathogenesis linking reduced
      kidney function to CVD is not known. Living kidney donors provide a unique model for
      investigating the mechanisms underlying increased risk of CVD in patients with reduced GFR
      because living kidney donors are healthy before donation. Thus, the main purpose of the
      Project is to investigate the mekanismes underlying the development of cardiovascular
      remodelling induced by a reduction in GFR.

        The project is a prospective longitudinal parallel group study including persons selected
        as living kidney donors according to the Norwegian donor criteria and accepted for surgery
        at Rikshospitalet, Norway. The donors will be compared to a control group consisting of
        individuals evaluated for donation, but not found eligible and healthy family members
        related to donors. The control individuals will be age and sex matched to living kidney
        donors. Control individuals who accept to participate will go through the same test battery
        (the Norwegian transplantation protocol for living kidney donors) as living kidney donors
        and must fulfil these criteria before inclusion as controls.

        -  Donor Group: persons selected as living kidney donors according to the Norwegian donor
             criteria and accepted for surgery at Rikshospitalet, Norway

          -  Control Group: persons fulfilling the criteria according to the Norwegian
             transplantation protocol for living kidney donors with one exeption: they do not have
             to be investigated with CT angiography which is not considered necessary.
