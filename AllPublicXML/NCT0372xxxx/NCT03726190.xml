  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of Oblique Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion
      (OLLIF). Specifically, the study seeks to measure outcomes on radiological imaging, outcomes
      reported by the patients on standardized questionnaires, and complication rates.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported disability on the Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index is a commonly used tool to assess disability due to low back pain. The Oswestry is assessed on a standardized questionnaire and the scale ranges from 0% to 100% disability. A lower score is considered less disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion rate</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of bony fusion as determined by independent radiologists on post-operative CT scans. Radiologists will determine whether each level that was operated on was fused, or not fused.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Neuropraxia</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropraxia is defined as lower extremity weakness of 3/5 or below on a standard 5 point strength scale as assessed by the surgeon at one year follow-up. The scale ranges from 5 (full strength) to 0 (no muscle tone). The deficit must have newly appeared just after surgery to be considered a result of the surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Nerve Root Irritation</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Nerve Root Irritation is defined as lower extremity paresthesias or dysesthesias corresponding to dermatome of the level of surgery or weakness of 4/5 or above on a standard 5 point strength scale as assessed by the surgeon at one year follow-up. The scale ranges from 5 (full strength) to 0 (no muscle tone). The deficit must have newly appeared just after surgery to be considered a result of the surgery.</description>

    <measure>Rate of screw fracture</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of all screws placed in the study group that is determined to have fractured on postoperative imaging. Imaging is read by independent radiologists.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infection Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery and immediately after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients that experienced bleeding during surgery or immediately after surgery that required transfusion.</description>

    <time_frame>One year after surgery</time_frame>

    <intervention_name>Oblique Lateral Lumbar Fusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Oblique lateral lumbar interbody fusion (OLLIF) is a lumbar spinal fusion. OLLIF is performed with the patient in the prone position and employs an oblique lateral approach that enables the instrumentation to pass through Kambin's triangle which is defined as the space between the exiting nerve, the superior border of the caudal vertebra, and the superior articulating process of the inferior facet. This approach may be performed without direct visualization, guided by electrophysiological monitoring and biplanar fluoroscopy. During the approach, a blunt probe is used to make contact with the disc, followed by a series of gentle dilations. Discectomy is performed through a 10-mm access portal. The cage is inserted under continued electrophysiological monitoring and fluoroscopy.</description>

        All patients who presented to the study center and required lumbar fusion were eligible to
        participate in this study. The study center draws patients from Minnesota, South Dakota and
        North Dakota. No demographic restrictions were placed on participation in the study.
