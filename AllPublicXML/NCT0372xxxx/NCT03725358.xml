  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators propose to test various supply-side approaches to increase the
      numbers of both SARCs (short-acting reversible contraceptives, i.e. the pill and injectable)
      and especially LARCs (long-acting reversible contraceptives, i.e. the IUD and implant)
      administered by health facilities to reproductive-age females in Cameroon, particularly
      adolescents who may be unmarried and/or nulliparous. The study investigators will do this via
      interventions at primary health facilities, which include training of providers on family
      planning; the introduction of a tablet-based decision support tool for counseling women on
      family planning; and increased subsidies for LARCs within the performance-based financing
      (PBF) system. This approach is expected to benefit the population directly by decreasing
      maternal mortality and undesired pregnancies and indirectly by reducing side effects that
      arise due to current one-size-fits-all FP (family planning) counseling; improving the health
      of children due to improved birth spacing; and increasing human capital accumulation among
      children and young (often school-age) potential mothers.

    <description>Health facilities assigned to this group will receive a two-week training intervention on modern contraceptive methods and counseling techniques - aimed at nurses conducting family planning services. This new curriculum was developed by a large group of experts convened by the Ministry of Health in February 2018. The cascade training that is developed by the national government (cascading down to regions, districts, and finally health facilities) is a 15-day training module that targets family planning nurses, covering theory, practical knowledge (practicing administrations and removals), and counseling of clients.</description>

    <intervention_name>App</intervention_name>
    <description>Health facilities assigned to this group will receive the same programming as the facilities in S1, but they will also be provided with tablets equipped with the &quot;job aid,&quot; which subsumes the basic data collection software used by the remaining facilities. They will also receive additional training on the use of the tablet-based &quot;job aid.&quot;
The &quot;app&quot; is a tablet-based decision-support tool, which is designed for use by the family planning nurse conducting counseling sessions and records the answers to a series of questions that elicit the client's life goals, fertility plans, needs, and preferences regarding contraceptive methods, as well as her medical eligibility (birth history, pregnancy check, breastfeeding status, blood pressure, medications, etc.).</description>
