             topical treatment, before surgery.

          2. Known history of hypersensitivity to macromolecular protein preparation or any
             components of the SHR- 1210 formulation.

             non-hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignant components;

          4. Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease

          5. Uncontrolled clinically significant heart disease, including but not limited to the

          6. Active infection or an unexplained fever &gt; 38.5°C during screening or before the first
             scheduled day of dosing (subjects with tumor fever may be enrolled at the discretion
             of the investigator);

          7. Received a live vaccine within 4 weeks of the first dose of study medication.
