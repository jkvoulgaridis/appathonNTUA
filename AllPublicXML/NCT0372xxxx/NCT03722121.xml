  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project has for objective to demonstrate that the increase of the distance &quot;Patient home
      - center of treatment&quot; may be associated with significant, other noticeable, noted events.
      This distance may also be available in the Rouen University Hospital. The study of the
      association in this distance and the delay in initiating chemotherapy after surgery in
      patients treated at the CHU correspond to a pilot study prior to the completion of the
      analysis at the regional scale.
