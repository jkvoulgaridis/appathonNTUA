  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain de-identified, clinically characterized,
      whole blood specimens to evaluate biomarkers associated with cancer for diagnostic assay
      development.

      Subjects will have been recently diagnosed with untreated melanoma. Subjects will have a
      blood sample collected at enrollment and provide medical history prior to initiation of
      treatment. There will be no further follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Subject has an untreated primary melanoma.

             OR

             Subject has high suspicion of primary malignancy of melanoma based on skin exam or
             imaging.

          3. Subject understands the study procedures and is able to provide informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any previous cancer diagnosis within the past 5 years (with the exceptions of basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancers).

          2. Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 5 years prior to enrollment/sample
             collection.

          3. Any treatment for the primary malignancy or sites of metastases. Subject may not have
             started neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, neo-adjuvant radiation therapy, immunotherapy or
             other treatment and/or surgery prior to blood sample collection.

          4. Less than 3 days between fine needle aspiration (FNA) of target pathology and blood
             collection.

          5. Less than 5 days between biopsy (other than FNA) of target pathology and blood
             collection.

          6. IV contrast (e.g. CT and MRI) within 1 day [or 24 hours] of blood collection.

          7. Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
