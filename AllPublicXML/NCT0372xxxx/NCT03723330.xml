    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to assess the impact of co-consuming plant sterols-enriched
      food product as part of a healthy eating pattern diet on endothelial function (brachial
      artery FMD, vasodilation-related and vasoconstriction-related biomarkers) and blood pressure
      management (24-hour ambulatory and classic blood pressure) in Singapore individuals with
      MetS.

      This is a 13-wk double-blinded, randomized, crossover study design. Following a 1-wk
      pre-intervention baseline period, subjects will be randomly assigned to follow a healthy
      eating pattern diet either contain 2.0 g free plant sterols equivalent of their palmityl
      esters (Plant Sterol Diet) or do not contain plant sterols (Control Diet) for 4 weeks. After
      a 4-week dietary 'washout' period, they will consume the alternative diet for 4 weeks. The
      random assignment will be done with SAS 9.4 software. Body size measurement, dietary
      assessment, brachial artery FMD and blood pressure measurements, and fasting-state blood
      collection will be conducted at week 1, 5, 9, and 13, which correspond to before and during
      the last 1 week of the two 4-week intervention periods.

      During study week 1 and weeks 6-9, all subjects will consume their habitual, unrestricted
      self-chosen diets. During study weeks 2-5 and 10-13, all subject will follow a healthy eating
      pattern diet, referred to as the &quot;My Healthy Plate&quot; designed by HPB. Each subject's energy
      requirement will be estimated using sex-specific equations and Recommended Dietary Allowances
      for healthy Singaporean. One-on-one dietary counselling and written instructions for each
      subject will be provided by a research dietitian and trained research staff to achieve a
      healthy eating pattern diet. Compliance with the plant sterols consumption will be promoted
      by frequent online and in-person contact.
