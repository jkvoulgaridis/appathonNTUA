  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A key factor in determining success of facial plastic plastic surgery is overall patient
      satisfaction. While a number of patient-reported outcomes tools has been developed, there is
      still limited research in how physicians can improve patient satisfaction and post-operative
      outcomes.

      The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of a mindfulness meditation phone
      application on rhinoplasty outcomes. This study will also explore whether mindfulness
      meditation is a feasible adjunct to current pharmacological modalities of postoperative pain
      control as well as its potential impact on patient satisfaction. These questions will be
      answered using a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The field of facial plastic surgery continues to grow as evidenced by the increasing number
      of services sought by both men and women each year. Among these procedures, rhinoplasty
      remains one of the most popular surgeries, ranking in the top three most performed cosmetic
      surgical procedures according to the 2017 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report. A key factor in
      determining the success of rhinoplasty is overall patient satisfaction. Although many
      patient-reported outcomes tools have been developed in this space, there is a paucity of
      research aimed at understanding how physicians can improve patient satisfaction in this
      patient population. Moreover, strategies to address the psychologic and coping ability for
      patients undergoing facial plastic surgery have not been investigated. To better provide
      patient-centered care, physicians should seek to understand the psychosocial impact of
      perceived nasal deformity and identify patients who may benefit from additional support
      interventions to complement current rhinoplasty treatment plans.

      This is a prospective repeated measures study examining psychosocial status as measured by
      validated psychometric instruments. The intervention group will participate in mindfulness
      meditation using a phone application. Assessment of social functioning and quality of life
      will be conducted using survey instruments.
