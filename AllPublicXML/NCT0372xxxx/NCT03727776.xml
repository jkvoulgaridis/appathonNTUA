    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to measure levels of albumin and inflammatory cytokines [including
      Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-β) and Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β)] in the aqueous humor
      of post-operative proliferative vitreoretinopathy patients receiving subcutaneous injections
      of H.P. Acthar®, an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) analog. The study will be conducted at
      the Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital. A total of 15 patients will be enrolled and
      randomized 2:1 to H.P. Acthar® or standard of care. Treatment duration will be 8 weeks and
      study duration will be 12 weeks. There will be a total of 7 study visits (baseline, day of
      surgery, post-operative day 1, week 1, week 4, week 8, and week 12).

      Subjects will self-administer subcutaneous injections of 80 units of H.P. Acthar® starting on
      post-operative day 1 for twice a week until week 8. Subjects in the control arm will be
      managed per the standard of care. Aqueous samples will be obtained at the onset of surgery, 1
      day, 1 week and 8 weeks after surgery. Aqueous levels of albumin and inflammatory cytokines
      (including TGF-β and IL-1β) will be measured at each time point.

    <description>Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a melanocortin peptide hormone that is normally produced in the pituitary gland and acts as a major regulator of adrenal cortex function. It stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce and secrete glucocorticoids. ACTH is available for clinical usage as an injectable gel (H.P. Acthar®).</description>
