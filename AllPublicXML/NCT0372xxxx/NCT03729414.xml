  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease is one of the most common proctological disease affecting the general
      population from the mid-teens onward with considerable implications for the National Health
      Service (NHS) both from an economic point of view and from surgeon's workload.Improved
      understanding of the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids and of the complications associated with
      excisional hemorrhoidectomy led to the invention of newer surgical procedures, including
      Doppler guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DGHAL).

      This technique was introduced in 1995 by Morinaga et al. and consists in the use of a
      proctoscope with a Doppler transducer that detect the arterial structures.

      Since DGHAL does not involve tissue excision, it is expected to be associated with reduced
      postoperative pain if compared with hemorrhoidectomy.

      In the last decade several devices (THD and AMI/ HAL-RAR - Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation and
      Recto Anal Repair) have been developed in order to improve and facilitate the execution of
      the technique, making easier the procedure.

      The hypothesis of the study is that a simple mucopexy procedure by suture-fixation of anal
      cushion without the aim of a Doppler device, could be as effective as DGHAL and mucopexy to
      manage prolapsing grade III hemorrhoids.

      Prospective, multi-centre, parallel-arm randomized controlled equivalence trial. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to either mucopexy without Doppler guided artery ligation or
      mucopexy with doppler guided hemorroidal artery ligation.

      Primary aim of the Hamlet trial is to demonstrate that mucopexy without DGHAL for grade III
      haemorrhoids have equivalent recurrence rate at 1 year follow up of DGHAL with mucopexy

    <description>Doppler guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation and mucopexy: Group of patients with III degree hemorrhoids treated by THD or AMI device is introduced into the anal canal. The terminal branches of the rectal artery are detected by the Doppler 2-3 cm above the dentate line. The tip of the instrument is tilted and arteries ligated with a figure-of-eight suture inserted using a special needle-holder. After the haemorrhoid artery ligation, the suture is continued with 3/5 sutures applied 5 mm apart, making sure that the last is at least 5 mm above the dentate line. The suture is then tied to create a hemorrhoidopexy. The procedure is repeated after all artery ligations (6 ligations</description>
