  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance
      were treated with anlotinib（12mg，po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle） or placebo, the
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Subgroup analysis results suggest that elderly patients may
      get longer mPFS and mOS.

      Therefore, the investigators envisage an open, single-arm, single-center clinical trial using
      anlotinib in elderly patients with EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma who refused
      chemotherapy, to find if anlotinib is a better option in NSCLC second-line therapy.

      It is an open, single-arm, single-center clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to
      Recruiting 38 patients (≥65 years old, ECOG PS 0-2) who were progressed after first line
      systemic therapy and refused/can't tolerate chemotherapy. Patents receive 12mg anlotinib
      orally daily on day 1to 14 of a 21-day cycle until progression of disease, assess safety and
      efficacy of the drug.
