  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To assess how an amino acid based medical food (Enterade®) helps maintain the intestine's
      ability to absorb and retain fluids, leading to a reduction in diarrhea due to Neuroendocrine
      Tumors (NET) and/or Carcinoid Syndrome. This improvement in the absorption will be assessed
      in part by evaluating changes in average daily stool frequency from baseline in patients
      receiving Enterade®. Each subject serves as his or her own control.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess subject reported health-related quality of life in subjects before and after
           compound administration.

        -  To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of Enterade® as measured by the
           number of total 8-oz Enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial, and average drinks
           per day.

        -  To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of Eenterade®.

        -  To assess intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalization for dehydration secondary
           to diarrhea between control observation period and active Enterade® period.

        -  To evaluate difference in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications
           between control observation period and Enterade® period.

        -  To compare subjective feeling of bloating and flatulence before and after administration
           of Enterade®.

        -  To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of Enterade®.

      This prospective, phase 2 study is to assess how Enterade® will affect patient-reported
      quality of life and intestinal absorption in patients with Carcinoid Syndrome and
      Neuroendocrine Tumors. The hypothesis is that Enterade® when combined with standard
      supportive care will improve patient-reported quality of life and help maintain the small
      bowel's ability to absorb and retain fluids, possibly leading to a reduction in diarrhea
      frequency.

        -  This is a non-randomized, supportive-care study.

        -  Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey
           Cancer Center clinics.

        -  During the screening visit, immediately after signing informed consent, the participant
           will be given both flavors of enterade® (original vanilla and refreshing orange) to test
           tolerability and taste.

        -  Eligible subjects will be given a stool diary and will be asked to document daily stool
           output (frequency and consistency of stool), use of anti-diarrheal medication and
           gastrointestinal discomforts (bloating, cramping).

        -  All lab and screening tests should be completed within 2 weeks prior to
           registration/initiation of study.

        -  The study is broken into 3 distinct segments and will apply to all enrolled
           participants: Baseline observation (Weeks 1-4), Enterade® administration period (4
           weeks), Post-Enterade® Period (4 weeks).

        -  After relapse of diarrhea is documented or the 4 weeks of post-Enterade® observation are
           completed (whatever happens first), participants will be given the option to restart
           Enterade® for 1 additional month.
