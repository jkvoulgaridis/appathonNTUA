  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TTR-FAP is a rare disabling inherited disorder that predominantly affects the peripheral
      nervous system and the heart. Due to an important phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, the
      diagnosis is often delayed, preventing therefore early onset treatment. Our project is to
      evaluate the prevalence of TTR-FAP in a series of 130 patients with from chronic neuropathy
      of undetermined aetiology through a systematic screening of TTR mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder,
      highly disabling and life-threatening, resulting of transthyretin (TTR) gene mutation.
      Clinically, TTR FAP is characterized by progressive sensorimotor and dysautonomic neuropathy,
      usually fatal within a few years. The disease prevalence is highly variable, with a large
      genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Early and accurate diagnosis remains essential to
      propose early treatment. New pharmacotherapies have been developed, such as TafamidisÂ®, and
      many patients can avoid liver transplant formerly considered as the only therapeutic option.
      The prevalence of TTR-FAP disease has been previously estimated in series of patients with
      severe and progressive neuropathy, frequently leading to a delayed diagnosis. TTR-FAP is also
      easily suspected when neuropathy is associated with cardiac symptoms or dysautonomia.

      Currently, genetic testing of TTR-FAP is targeted and is only prescribed to patients in whom
      the first-line assessment recommended by the High Authority for Health (HAS) did not identify
      a cause, and on the basis of a worsening of symptoms. An early diagnosis in those cases would
      allow earlier treatment and monitoring. No data are available about the prevalence of TTR-FAP
      in populations of patients with from chronic neuropathy of unknown aetiology, through a
      systematic screening of TTR mutations.

      The diagnosis of TTR-FAP will be performed using standard procedures following international
      recommendations, requiring genetic analysis of the TTR gene.

      The patients with a diagnosis of TTR-FAP confirmed during this study will be seen for an
      additional visit in the Investigating Centre and proposed suitable follow up, treatment and
      care.
