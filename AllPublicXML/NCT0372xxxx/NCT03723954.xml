      Ryder Heart is an exploratory study of the heart rate variations of golf fans during the 2018
      edition of the Ryder Cup. The main objective is to evaluate the impact of stress and strong
      emotions on heart rate variations and the occurrence of rhythmic anomalies in golf fans
      during this high-level golf competition. Such data are actually poorly described in medical
      and scientific literature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 1996, a Dutch research team highlighted, for the first time, a strong statistical
      relationship between the outcome of a football match and cardiovascular mortality in men over
      45 years of age. An excess mortality was reported among football fans on June 22nd 1996, day
      of the elimination of the Dutch by the French team during the penalty shoot-out of the
      European Champions League. A more recent study by Ute Wilbert-Lampen et al., confirmed the
      relationship between football matches of the 2006 World Cup and the occurrence of
      cardiovascular events such as rhythm disorders and coronary syndromes among football fans.
      Two factors favoring increased cardiovascular risk appear to emerge from these different
      studies: high-level football matches (most often played at home) and strong support and
      passion for one's sports team. However, the physiopathological mechanisms involved have not
      been fully understood yet. In addition, very little data exists on sports other than
      football. The investigators research hypothesis is that cardiovascular events induced by the
      passion of a sports fan could not be unique to only one sport. The Ryder Cup, one of the
      biggest sporting events in the world, is the ideal event to collect consolidation elements
      for the investigators hypothesis.

      The main phase of the Ryder Heart study will take place during the Ryder Cup from the 28th
      till the 30th of September 2018.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Record and measure by Spider Flash-t of the increase in the heart rate peak</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of the increase in the heart rate peak (in beats per minute) of study subjects at the days and times of golf matches will be performed with Spider Flash-t.
The algorithms built into SpiderFlash-t detect episodes palpitations, syncope, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in addition to all other arrhythmias such as bradycardia and tachycardia in patients symptomatic and asymptomatic. The integrated SpiderFlash-t software includes a dedicated and specific algorithm for detect atrial fibrillation. This atrial fibrillation algorithm is independent of the algorithm main arrhythmia detection, also incorporated into SpiderFlash-t.
So comparing the data recorded at V0 (baseline) with the data recorded during the golf match, a minimum increase in the heart rate peak of at least 10% (at days and times of golf meetings) will be considered a significant variation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>average hourly variations of parameters related with heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The exploratory nature of the Ryder Heart study does not allow adequate consideration of potential confounding factors that may affect heart rate. Thus, the variations of this heart rate can be described according to several characteristics: the intensity of the physical activity of the fans during the Ryder Cup using an Actigraph GT3Xp and the passion supporter for golf The data recorded by SpiderFlash-t will be analyzed by the analysis program of MicroPort. This program produces an automatic report of a classical and spectral analysis of the variability of the heart rate. The heart rate, its variability as well as the rhythmic events will thus be studied, with the description of the amplitudes, temporal, frequency and rhythmic parameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fan's passion score for golf</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The golf fan's degree of passion will be evaluated by a questionnaire including a series of items, inspired by studies by Vallerand et al. and Wann and Branscombe which help to classify the fans in three categories : little, moderately and very passionate.The scale includes 16 questions with answers choice going from 0 to 3. To whom will obtain a total score 0-16 = little passionate. To whom will obtain a total score 17-32 = moderately passionate. To whom will obtain a total score 33-48 = very passionate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Record and measure fan physical activity by ActiGraph GT3Xp</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity level of study participants will be quantified directly every day of competition, using a physical activity monitor / accelerometer type ActiGraph GT3Xp. This device will collect various information such as mouvements, gross acceleration, caloric flow, energy expenditure, active energy expenditure, the duration of physical activity and the number of steps of the supporter. The number of steps of the supporter is used to take into account a confounding factor (effect of the physical activity of the supporter on his heart rate) and estimate the main judgment criterion reliably.</description>

    <description>Record at visit V0 (day without match) and the competition days (Visit V1, V2 et V3) during the matches the heart rate of the golf fans.
SpiderFlash-tâ„¢ from MicroPort is a long-lasting event recorder set in walking position by the investigator the day of the record and it is activated by detecting rhythm anomalies. This recorder is a Class IIA medical device (according to European Economic Community Directive 93/42). It benefits from European Economic marking.</description>

    <description>Record the study participant's physical activity while we record his heart rate.
The GT3Xp based activity monitors provide objective measurements of human activity and are used in many research and clinical applications. It includes a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based accelerometer and an ambient light sensor. It benefits from CE marking and FDA agreement (Class II medical device).</description>
