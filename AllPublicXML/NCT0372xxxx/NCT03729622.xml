      Title :

      A pilot single blind randomised controlled trial of the effect of a diet low in poorly
      digested carbohydrates on gastrointestinal form and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome
      patients

      Acronym: CRAIGS

      Short title: Carbohydrate reduction and impact on gastrointestinal system Chief Investigator:
      Prof Robin Spiller

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Investigate the proportion of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome who report moderate
           or substantial improvement in their symptoms after 2 weeks of following a diet low in
           Fermentable Oligo-Di-Monosaccharides and Polyols (FODMAPs) compared to patients who are
           on their habitual diet.

        -  Determine the difference in colonic volume of IBS patients receiving immediate low
           FODMAP dietary intervention after 2 weeks compared to patients who are not on the diet
           (delayed dietary intervention).

        -  Investigate the changes in self-reported food intolerance that occurs before dietary
           intervention.

      Trial Configuration:

      2-arm, parallel group, randomised, controlled trial

      TRIAL / STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE

      The trial aims to investigate the effect of a diet low in FODMAPs on colonic morphology as
      well as in improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

      This mechanistic information, along with the clinical data, will allow planning of larger,
      multi-centre studies of the low FODMAP diet in similar patients.

      HYPOTHESES

        -  Patients on a low FODMAP diet for 2 weeks will have a decreased fasting colonic volume
           measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compared to participants who have not
           started the diet.

        -  Patients with IBS are more likely to report a clinically important improvement in
           symptoms following the low FODMAP diet (immediate intervention) compared to those on
           their habitual diet (delayed intervention).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE • To compare the proportion of IBS patients reporting a clinically
      important improvement in symptoms following a low FODMAP diet for 2 weeks against IBS
      patients who are on their habitual diet.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      • Determine the difference in fasting colonic volume of IBS patients receiving low FODMAP
      dietary intervention after 2 weeks compared to those on habitual diet.

      TRIAL DESIGN

      This will be a pilot single-blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). Since some activity
      will take place on the University of Nottingham this will be a multi-centre study.

      All participants will receive advice from a dietitian on the low FODMAP diet. They will be
      randomised to one of two parallel treatment arms:

        1. Low FODMAP dietary advice (immediate intervention)

        2. Habitual diet (control - delayed intervention )
