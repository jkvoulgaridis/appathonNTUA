  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel fluoride varnish (NFV) in
      preventing white spot lesion development in adolescents during and after treatment with fixed
      orthodontic appliances.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled design with two parallel
      groups. The intervention will start at onset of the fixed appliances and will be finalized
      one year after debonding. The primary outcome will be incidence of white spot lesions on the
      labial surfaces of the maxillary incisors, canines and premolars, as assessed from
      high-resolution digital photos. The secondary outcome is the prevalence of WSLs at debonding.

      During the course of the orthodontic treatment, the patients are regularly checked every 6th
      week. At the end of each such occasion, the clinical staff will apply either the test or the
      placebo varnish with a small brush in a thin layer around the base of the braces on the
      maxillary teeth.

      The pre- and post-treatment photos are projected on a screen (Hewlett Packard ProBook 6650b,
      Palo Alto CA, USA) in a dark room and the incidence and severity of enamel demineralization
      will be registered independently by two experienced and calibrated orthodontists according to
      the index of Gorelick et al. (1982).

    <description>During the course of the orthodontic treatment, the patients are regularly checked every 6th week. At the end of each such occasion, the clinical staff will apply the test varnish with a small brush in a thin layer around the base of the braces on the maxillary teeth. The varnish is let to dry and the subjects are instructed not to eat or drink within 60 minutes after the application. The NFV test varnish has mint flavour and the active ingredient is ammonium fluoride dissolved in ethanol, water and an acrylate polymer.</description>

    <description>During the course of the orthodontic treatment, the patients are regularly checked every 6th week. At the end of each such occasion, the clinical staff will apply either the placebo varnish with a small brush in a thin layer around the base of the braces on the maxillary teeth. The varnish is let to dry and the subjects are instructed not to eat or drink within 60 minutes after the application. The placebo varnish has an identical composition as the test varnish except for the ammonium fluoride. Thus, taste, colour and handling properties are the same.</description>
