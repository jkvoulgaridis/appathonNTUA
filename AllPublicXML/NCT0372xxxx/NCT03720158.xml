  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health-related Quality of Life (QoL) is a multidimensional construct that allows us to know
      the patient's perception of well-being, and how this perception is related to their illness
      and treatment. In clinical research, especially clinical trials, the QoL measurement has
      become an important element to evaluate. In patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma (HNSCC), low QoL is associated with Malnutrition (MN), and Cancer Cachexia (CC) is
      a principal component in its multifactorial etiology. The exacerbated hypercatabolic state of
      CC is caused by the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS),
      and other catabolic mediators. The clinical manifestation of CC is a continuous decrease in
      muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass), which is not entirely reversible with
      nutritional support and which leads to the functional deterioration of patients. Due to CC,
      the patients with HNSCC who receive total enteral nutritional support have difficulties in
      maintaining an optimal nutritional status, and this situation is more frequent during
      RadioTherapy (RT). An immune-modulator nutrient, Omega-3 fatty acids (O3) have shown efficacy
      in improving the nutritional and inflammatory parameters of patients with HNSCC; however,
      little is known about their impact on patients' QoL and Functionality (Fx). Therefore, this
      clinical trial is proposed to provide information about the usefulness of O3 for improving
      the Fx and QoL of patients with HNSCC receiving total enteral nutrition during RT.

      -  Objective: To determine the effect of the daily addition of five mL of an O3 highly
           concentrated substance (EicosaPentaenoic Acid - EPA: 2.25 g and DocosaHexaenoic Acid -
           DHA: 1.08 g), to the standard enteral nutrition diet during RT (5-7 weeks), on the
           Quality of Life (QoL) and Functionality (Fx) of patients with HNSCC.

        -  Methods: Randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial. Patients with HNSCC
           (ages ranging from 18-80 years) who will receive total enteral nutrition support through
           percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and RT for the first time will be invited to
           participate in the study. Exclusion criteria are fish allergy, anticoagulant
           consumption, any supplement consumption 6 months prior to the experiment, any
           contraindication to the performance of the body composition analysis using bioelectrical
           impedance (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, BIA) (cardiac pacemaker, any metallic
           prosthesis, inability to stand, severe edema), or the presence of the mal-absorption
           syndrome, two or more cancer types, organ dysfunction, immune diseases, or any
           hospitalization during the 20 days prior to extraction of the blood sample. Patients
           with the consumption of any other nutritional supplement or diagnosed with any other
           cancer during the treatment period, or with insufficient or incorrectly processed
           blood-serum samples will be eliminated. After expressing their willingness to
           participate via the signing of the informed consent document, 86 patients with HNSCC
           will be allocated into two groups: The O3 Group will have the addition of 5 mL of an O3
           highly concentrated substance containing 2.25 g of EPA and 1.08 g of DHA to the standard
           enteral diet during RT (5-7 weeks), and the Placebo or Control Group will have the
           addition of 5 mL of a placebo (pigmented and flavored corn oil) in a similar manner. All
           patients will be seen every 4 weeks at the Nutrition Support Service for nutritional
           assessment and counseling, and to receive the enteral nutrition containers (standard
           polymeric diet). On the same day, a Research Assistant (who will be blinded) will
           provide the supplements or the placebo. The patients' sociodemographic and clinical
           information, body composition, albumin, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, tumor
           cachexia-related cytokines: IL (Interleukin) 1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IFNγ (Interferon
           gamma), TGF-β (transforming growth factor beta), and TNF-α (Tumor necrosis factor
           alpha); and responses for the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
           Quality of Life C-30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) with the Head and Neck Cancer module
           (EORTC-QLQ-H&amp;N35) questionnaires will be collected at the beginning of RT, at the end of
           RT, and 12 weeks after starting RT. Statistical analysis includes descriptive
           statistics, inference statistics (Student t-test, Mann-Whitney test, one-way ANOVA with
           Bonferroni correction, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's non-parametric test), and the Cox
           regression; an intention-to-treat analysis will be performed.

    <description>The QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), a global health status / QoL scale (GHS/QoL), and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and difficulties). Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot; The principle for scoring these scales is the same in all cases: 1. Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score. 2. Use a linear transformation to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, or a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change.</description>
