  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Trident® II project is to introduce a cup system that modernizes and
      streamlines Stryker's acetabular shell portfolio. The Trident® II Clusterhole HA Shell
      combines the history of Stryker's Trident® shells with plasma spray CpTi with HA coating.
      Plasma spray coating and HA is considered to be the gold standard in orthopaedics today. This
      coating will help the cup to achieve early stability and long term fixation.

      One of the causes for implant failure is loosening and osteolysis. Osteolysis can be
      triggered when metal or polyethylene wear particles from the implant or bearing surfaces
      migrate between implant and surrounding host bone tissue. With the development of sequential
      irradiated and annealed highly crosslinked polyethylene (X3) wear rates (mean proximal,
      2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) have been substantially reduced to 0.001 mm/y, calculated
      between 1 year and 5 years.

      The Trident® II Clusterhole HA shells have a plasma sprayed CpTi coating compared to the
      arc-deposition CpTi coating on legacy Trident® shells, both designed to allow bone ongrowth.
      With this study the investigators want to prove equivalent implant fixation of both type of
      cups.

      The primary objective is the assessment of prosthetic fixation and migration results after
      two years of the Trident® II Clusterhole HA shell compared to the legacy Trident® Hemi HA
      shell by means of RSA. It is hypothesized that they will perform equally.

      The secondary outcome measure will be long-term (10-year) survival based on the two-year
      migration patterns combined with clinical factors and radiographic aspects. In order to
      identify other clinical parameters besides the fixation of the prosthesis components,
      clinical scores and radiographic aspects will be correlated with the RSA outcome. The 10-year
      results will be used to verify the predicted long-term survival results.

    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L consists of questions covering five dimensions measuring the patient's mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, each question with three levels of possible answers and a single index value for health status. Health status has a range from 1 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) patient questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FJS consists of 12 questions and focuses on the patients' awareness of their joint replacement during a range of day to day and recreational activities. The FJS uses a 5-grade Likert scale ranging from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Mostly&quot;. The score has a range of 0-100.</description>

    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>HOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related Quality of life (QOL). The HOOS uses a 5-grade Likert scale and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>
