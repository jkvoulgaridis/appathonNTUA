      Anticipated Impact on Veterans Healthcare: Polypharmacy, defined as more than five
      medications, and hyperpolypharmacy, defined as more than 10 medications, are both common in
      older patients discharged to nursing homes for short stays. Several recent studies
      demonstrate the occurrence and potential inappropriateness of polypharmacy among older
      patients in both VA and non-VA healthcare settings. Other studies have shown that
      polypharmacy can lead to many harmful events among older community-dwelling and hospitalized
      populations including decreased medication taking, increased harm due to medications, and
      increased health care use and costs. Polypharmacy and a ways to measure drug burden have
      additionally been found to be associated with the development of the following geriatric
      syndromes: mild dementia, delirium, falls, loss of urine, and unintentional weight loss. The
      investigators' innovative, patient-centered Drug Reduction in Older Patients (DROP) procedure
      has significant potential to impact the health of a large population of older Veterans who
      are vulnerable to poor health outcomes. It is during hospitalization and nursing home care
      that older patients often acquire new geriatric syndromes and medications and, thus, when
      deprescribing actions should be initiated by VA care providers. In addition, the clinical
      care provided during the hospital and SNF stays allows the effects of medication changes to
      be more closely monitored for safety relative to when the Veteran is at home.

      Project Objectives: The proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of
      procedures to reduce medications (DROP) among hospitalized older Veterans discharged to
      nursing homes using an hybrid study design to inform future efforts to spread it across VA.

      Project Background/Rationale: Patients discharged to nursing homes for short stays represent
      the largest group of Medicare beneficiaries discharged to post-hospital services and are a
      particularly high risk group for loss of independence and other poor clinical outcomes. This
      investigative team recently completed a VA-funded Quality Improvement Award and a Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, both of which provide strong results
      related to the occurrence of polypharmacy and the relationship between polypharmacy and
      geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient population.
      Based on these data, the investigators developed and pilot-tested a patient-centered
      deprescribing set of procedures combined with standardized questions for eight geriatric
      syndromes to be implemented in the hospital and monitored during the nursing home stay.

      Project Methods: The investigators propose an innovative hybrid study design that will be
      conducted in one VA hospital. The goal of the proposed DROP intervention is to safely
      deprescribe medications, as defined by reducing doses or stopping medications, based on a
      combination of clinical criteria and Veteran preferences. This randomized, controlled trial
      conducted over three years will evaluate the effects of this hospital-based intervention on
      medication use, geriatric syndromes, and health status across Veterans' care transitions from
      the hospital to nursing home to home to include a 90-day follow-up period after leaving the
      nursing home. The hypothesis is that reducing medications for older Veterans will favorably
      impact geriatric syndromes. Additionally, the investigators aim to understand Veteran, both
      VA and non-VA provider and system-level factors that help or hinder how well the
      deprescribing procedures are implemented to inform future clinical uptake and dissemination
      throughout the VA.

      Overview and Specific Aims Polypharmacy, defined as five or more medications, is common in
      older patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and is associated with adverse
      health outcomes. As part of a recent VA project, the investigators prospectively collected
      medication data for 134 hospitalized, older Veterans. These data showed that, on average,
      14.2 medications were ordered for Veterans discharged to SNF, which included 2.5 medications
      newly prescribed in the hospital that met criteria for being potentially inappropriate
      medications (PIMs). Moreover, 75% of these Veterans had two or more geriatric syndromes.
      Geriatric syndromes are clinical conditions common in older adults such as cognitive
      impairment, unintentional weight loss and falls. The co-occurrence of multiple syndromes is
      associated with loss of independence and higher healthcare utilization.8 All Veterans with
      polypharmacy also had one or more medications associated with geriatric syndromes. The
      prevalence of polypharmacy and multiple geriatric syndromes may partially explain why these
      patients often have poor health outcomes after SNF discharge. Recent data suggests that only
      28% of patients discharged from SNF are living at home 100 days later, and 35% experience an
      adverse drug event.

      There is a dearth of evidence related to the management of multiple co-existing geriatric
      syndromes, and few interventions have been implemented to reduce medications while also
      monitoring health outcomes. The relationship between polypharmacy, adverse drug events and
      geriatric syndromes in the VA population supports the rationale for an intervention focused
      on deprescribing medications before hospital discharge. The investigators have pilot-tested a
      multifaceted intervention (Drug Reduction in Older Patients, DROP) to engage patients and
      providers to reduce the number and/or dose of medications prior to hospital discharge. The
      proposed randomized, controlled trial is powered to evaluate the effect of this intervention
      on a reduction in medications as defined by the total number of prescribed medications, the
      number of PIMs, anticholinergic and sedative drug burden and the number of medications
      associated with geriatric syndromes. In addition, the investigators will collect relevant
      data on the prevalence and severity of geriatric syndromes and other clinical outcomes. The
      investigators also will use a hybrid research design to evaluate both effectiveness and
      implementation issues to better inform future adoption and sustainability. Our overarching
      hypothesis is that a hospital-based intervention to safely reduce the total number of
      medications represents the most feasible way to impact multiple health-related outcomes among
      older Veterans. Our Specific Aims reflect the primary outcomes that are the focus of the
      analyses, although the investigators also will measure secondary outcomes related to VA
      healthcare utilization and patient safety:

      Specific Aim 1: Implement a patient-centered deprescribing intervention (DROP) in the
      hospital to reduce the total number of medications Veterans are prescribed at hospital
      discharge.

      Hypothesis 1a: DROP will result in a significant reduction in total medication exposure due
      to discontinuations and dose reductions at hospital discharge, SNF discharge and 90-days
      after SNF discharge.

      Hypothesis 1b: DROP will result in a significant reduction in the number of potentially
      inappropriate medications (PIMs) at hospital discharge, SNF discharge and 90-days after SNF
      discharge.

      Hypothesis 1c: DROP will result in a significant reduction in the anticholinergic and
      sedative drug burden at hospital discharge, SNF discharge and 90-days after SNF discharge.

      Hypothesis 1d: DROP will result in significantly fewer medications associated with geriatric
      syndromes at hospital discharge, SNF discharge and 90-days after SNF discharge.

      Specific Aim 2: Document the effects of a Veteran-centered deprescribing intervention (DROP)
      on medication adherence, health status, and geriatric syndromes.

      Hypothesis 2a: DROP will result in a significant improvement in medication adherence and
      self-rated health status at 7 and 90 days after SNF discharge.

      Hypothesis 2b: DROP will result in a lower prevalence and severity of geriatric syndromes at
      7 and 90 days after SNF discharge.

      Specific Aim 3: Evaluate intervention implementation to inform future adoption and
      sustainability.

      Aim 3a: Identify patient-level barriers and facilitators of DROP. Aim 3b: Identify VA and
      Non-VA provider-level barriers and facilitators of DROP.

      Aim 3c: Identify system-level factors that influence sustainability after hospital discharge.

      Potential for Impact: The DROP intervention has significant potential to impact the health of
      older hospitalized Veterans vulnerable to poor health outcomes. During hospitalization and
      SNF care, older Veterans often acquire new geriatric syndromes and medications, exactly when
      deprescribing actions should be initiated by care providers in the context of clinical
      oversight. Lastly, the application of an innovative hybrid research design will allow us to
      collect critical data related to both intervention effectiveness and implementation to better
      inform future adoption and sustainability across the VA.

      Innovation: Our study is advancing science in multiple ways:

        1. The proposed study reflects one of the first controlled intervention trials designed to
           improve post discharge outcomes for the high-risk population of older Veterans
           transitioning from hospital to SNF to home. Healthcare costs are increasing for this
           patient population, and they are at high risk for medication-associated complications
           and newly acquired geriatric syndromes.

        2. Although the number of medications is strongly associated with increases in geriatric
           syndromes, it is unknown whether reducing medications will improve geriatric syndromes.
           This trial will generate data to evaluate the impact of medication reduction on Veteran
           health outcomes.

        3. To date, there have been no controlled intervention trials focused on reducing the
           number of medications prescribed for hospitalized patients discharged to SNF, and the
           proposed intervention is one of the first to explicitly incorporate Veteran preferences
           into deprescribing efforts, which is consistent with Veteran-centered care initiatives.
           Moreover, our preliminary data show that incorporating patient preferences in the
           intervention protocol significantly changes these clinical decisions.

        4. The proposed trial will evaluate both clinical effectiveness and implementation to
           inform the potential for DROP to be adopted into VA clinical practice.

      Rationale for VA Study: Dr. Simmons was recently awarded an National Institute on Aging (NIA)
      R01 focused on polypharmacy in hospitalized non-Veterans. The investigators summarize below
      the primary differences between the two studies and our rationale for the importance of the
      proposed VA study:

      The Need for More Evidence: Our NIA study focuses on non-Veterans hospitalized at Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center (VUMC) and discharged to a select group of SNFs that have partnered
      with VUMC for post-acute care services. Unfortunately, the scope of the NIA study does not
      allow us to evaluate the intervention in two separate healthcare systems with two unique
      patient populations and a larger number of SNFs, to include VA Community Living Centers and
      VA contract community nursing homes.

      Uniqueness of the Veteran population: Our preliminary data demonstrates important differences
      in older hospitalized Veterans and non-Veterans discharged to SNF. Beyond being predominately
      male, older Veterans in the investigators' prior study had a higher overall prevalence of
      geriatrics syndromes and were prescribed more medications at hospital discharge than
      non-Veterans, particularly antidepressants and antipsychotics. Data also suggests that
      Veterans may be more willing to reduce their medicines; thus, the magnitude of the
      intervention effects may differ in the VA. Finally, hospitalized Veterans are discharged to a
      diverse group of SNFs, many of which are located in rural communities. Unlike the
      investigators' NIA study, which only includes a select group of partner SNFs predominately
      located in an urban area close to Vanderbilt, the proposed study will follow Veterans from
      hospital to SNF to home, irrespective of which SNF they utilize. The VA study, therefore,
      will more closely mimic real-world practice. The innovative application of an
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid design will further inform unique aspects of the VA
      healthcare system critical to adoption.

      Uniqueness of VA healthcare system: The VA healthcare system differs significantly from other
      hospital systems, to include medication prescribing practices and how patients access and pay
      for medications. Thus, the investigators do not expect the results of the NIA study at VUMC
      to be directly translatable into the VA healthcare system. The proposed study also will yield
      an understanding of Veteran and VA provider attitudes toward deprescribing and other system
      factors unique to the VA that may influence intervention implementation.

    <description>The Brief Confusion Assessment Method (BCAM) is a brief screening tool for delirium and has been validated among hospitalized, elderly patients. However, the BCAM is not conducive to a telephone interview so this assessment will only be conducted prior to hospital discharge. The scoring is either positive or negative and depends on whether symptoms had acute onset or fluctuating course, the presence of inattention, an altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking. Patients are B-CAM positive, i.e. delirium present, if they have an altered mental status or fluctuating course and inattention, and either altered level of consciousness or disorganized thinking. Those not meeting the criteria are B-CAM negative.</description>

    <description>Any unplanned healthcare utilization event (i.e. hospitalization, ER or urgent care visit) will be assessed by research staff for ADWEs. Clinician-adjudicators will determine if an unplanned healthcare utilization is potentially related to medication withdrawal (i.e., ADWE). They will review the patient's medical record for each incident using the 10-question Drug Withdrawal Probability Scale, a scale based on the Naranjo algorithm. ADWE will be coded as definite (&gt;8), probable (5-8), possible (1-4), and doubtful (&lt;1). For all ADWEs, the physicians will then determine whether it was avoidable by any change in management. Severity will be judged using two definitions: 1) &quot;serious,&quot; &quot;life-threatening,&quot; or &quot;fatal,&quot; using established definitions; and, 2) serious ADEs as defined by the FDA (i.e., any event due to a drug that causes death, requires or prolongs hospitalization, is permanently disabling, life-threatening, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage).</description>

    <time_frame>SNF discharge--within approximately 30 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Any unplanned healthcare utilization event (i.e. hospitalization, ER or urgent care visit) will be assessed by research staff for ADWEs. Clinician-adjudicators will determine if an unplanned healthcare utilization is potentially related to medication withdrawal (i.e., ADWE). They will review the patient's medical record for each incident using the 10-question Drug Withdrawal Probability Scale, a scale based on the Naranjo algorithm. ADWE will be coded as definite (&gt;8), probable (5-8), possible (1-4), and doubtful (&lt;1). For all ADWEs, the physicians will then determine whether it was avoidable by any change in management. Severity will be judged using two definitions: 1) &quot;serious,&quot; &quot;life-threatening,&quot; or &quot;fatal,&quot; using established definitions; and, 2) serious ADEs as defined by the FDA (i.e., any event due to a drug that causes death, requires or prolongs hospitalization, is permanently disabling, life-threatening, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage).</description>

    <description>Medication History: All participants / surrogates will receive a structured interview and chart review by the study Pharmacist or Nurse Practitioner at enrollment to determine:
Medications: Medications will include ANY medication with the potential for continuation at the time of hospital discharge to include pre-hospital medications, [OTC medications] and active in-hospital medications. Pre-hospital [and OTC] medications will be confirmed by Veteran/surrogate interview and pharmacy refills. If a Veteran is admitted from SNF (short-term stay), the investigators will request a copy of the Medication Administration Record (MAR) for the past 30 days. Current medications will be defined as those taken within 30 days prior to the index (enrollment) hospitalization event.</description>
