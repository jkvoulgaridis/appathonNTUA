  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators don't know yet how the nose and the brain decode the smells. Scientific
      studies in neuroscience have shown that people who have tumors may have changes in the smell
      of secretions. Dogs are extremely efficient at detecting these changes, even before imaging
      studies. A review of the recent literature shows the different work done on the diagnosis of
      dogs on human pathologies, especially oncology. It is now known that the smell of exhaled
      gases is representative of the intestinal biotope and that a large number of pathologies are
      related to the type of microbial populations that inhabit the intestines.

      Copying the olfactory organs could thus be of major interest for the early diagnosis of
      pathologies. More and more works are interested in the diagnostic power of electronic noses.
      From a technical point of view, these are nano-sensors that mimic the olfactory receptors
      from the breath gas of the subjects. They analyze the molecules present and compare them with
      a database to establish a diagnosis according to a probabilistic algorithm.

      The use of exhaled air for the diagnosis of cancerous pathologies has already been the
      subject of scientific work. A classification using the SVM (support vector machine) method
      using data from 320 sensors made it possible to differentiate patients with lung cancer from
      controls in 98.8% of cases. The differential diagnosis of obstructive bronchopneumopathy was
      also very well done in this same study. Another study shows equally encouraging results,
      highlighting sensitivities and specificities above 80%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have signed the free and informed consent form or their guardian if
             applicable. If the state of health of the patient does not allow him to give and sign
             his consent, it will be sought from the person of trust

          -  The patient must be an affiliate or beneficiary of a health insurance plan

          -  The patient is at least 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient participates or has participated within 3 months in another study that may
             have modified their intestinal biotope

          -  The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study

          -  The patient is under the protection of justice

          -  The patient or guardian or trusted person refuses to sign the consent

          -  The patient does not read the French language fluently

          -  The patient claims to be pregnant
