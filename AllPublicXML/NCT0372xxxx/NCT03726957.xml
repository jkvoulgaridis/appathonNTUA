  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Household air pollution (HAP) is a leading risk factor for global burden of disease.
      Resource-constrained communities of the world especially women and children are significantly
      impacted by this challenge. To address household air pollution, cleaner and more efficient
      improved cookstoves (ICS) have been disseminated to low resource communities. Although there
      has been initial uptake of these stoves, sustained use has been inconsistent adding to the
      challenge of household air pollution. There is limited understanding at the intersections of
      social, ecological, and technical determinants of sustained use of ICS, and how is sustained
      use of ICS associated with exposure and health outcomes in poor communities.

      The overarching goal of this exploratory study is to initiate a comprehensive research
      program that will facilitate the use of ICS and investigate whether they render significant
      health benefits among rural Indian households.

      The investigators installed ICS (model: Eco-Chulla XXL) in select households that primarily
      use biomass for cooking, and evaluate the intervention based on three specific aims:

        1. To generate preliminary emissions data [particulate matter - mass and surface area
           based, carbon monoxide (CO)] from ICS and its effect on respiratory health outcomes that
           will facilitate the development of a pivotal clean cookstove intervention

        2. To generate effect size data that establish the feasibility and inform the sample size
           of a pivotal trial whose primary objective will be sustained improvements in the
           respiratory health of women and children in rural India

        3. To evaluate factors which enable and hinder the sustained use of clean cookstove
           technologies by the rural poor in India so that the investigators can develop a more
           refined pivotal intervention focused on improving respiratory health

      In this study, the investigators undertake a 12-month cluster randomized trial in 96
      households in the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states of India. The
      investigators enrolled women (primary cook) and one child (age 8-15) in each of these 96
      households. The investigators compare the effect of traditional wood burning stoves (the
      control condition) to that of improved wood burning stoves on the respiratory health of women
      and children, and also undertake community-based system dynamics modeling to delineate the
      feedback mechanisms involved in sustained use or abandonment of improved cookstoves. The
      study and research program are aligned with recent international attention to explore
      determinants impacting the sustained use of cleaner cooking systems in poor communities of
      the world. Thus, in achieving the aims of this R21, the investigators will then have: 1)
      necessary preliminary data; 2) pre-emptive strategies for most of these unanticipated but
      preventable challenges. The investigators will leverage these insights to proceed with a
      larger scale intervention: 1) to examine the effect of sustained use of cleaner cooking
      systems and respiratory health outcomes in women and children due to reduced HAP in rural
      India; 2) to explore barriers and enablers of implementation of cleaner cooking systems in
      multiple resource poor settings. Numerous studies have shown that sustained and exclusive use
      of cleaner cooking systems irrespective of their types have been a challenge. Lukewarm
      sustenance of cleaner cooking systems in poor households stems from a limited understanding
      on the grounds of social, technical, economic, and ecological intersections of energy
      security. The investigators intend to address this gap by using a trans-disciplinary approach
      to contribute to our understanding of factors that influence the implementation of cleaner
      cooking systems for rural poor in India.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators adopted a cluster randomized controlled trial with village as the unit of randomization. Villages were randomized to have participating households assigned to either a traditional biomass burning cookstove (control group) or to an improved cookstove (intervention group). A household that was willing to participate was considered eligible: 1) if it had a traditional wood burning cookstove; and 2) if the household included at least one child between the ages of 8-15. If a household had more than one child within the target age range, the oldest child within the age range was selected for study. Study participants within each household were the mother and the selected child.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Villages were randomized to have participating households assigned to either a traditional biomass burning cookstove or to an improved cookstove. Once the participating villages had been selected, the investigators used their list of eligible households within each village to randomly order these households. Within each village, the investigators then approached the eligible households in the order that had been randomly chosen and continued that process until four households within each village had agreed to participate. The selection of villages and households preceded randomization and was pursued with the clear understanding that group assignment would be random, and that participation reflected a willingness to be randomized to either study group.</description>
