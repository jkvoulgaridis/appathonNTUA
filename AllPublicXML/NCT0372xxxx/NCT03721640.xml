  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaline membrane disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in premature
      newborns in industrialized countries. For 30 years, the management of the hyaline membranes
      disease has been transformed by intratracheal administration of exogenous surfactant
      (Curosurf®) at birth or in the following hours. In order to limit the harmful effects in
      terms of barotrauma of mechanical ventilation, several methods have been developed over the
      last decades, aiming at limiting the mechanical ventilation to the profile of non-invasive
      ventilation: Thus the administration of surfactant has become faster (although invasive) and
      if possible followed by immediate extubation following the INSURE (INtubation / SURfactant /
      Extubation) or LISA (Less-Invasive Surfactant Administration) procedure.

      Given the fragility of the children concerned and their low weight, this invasive gesture has
      long been carried out without premedication. However, taking into account the pain induced
      and potential hemodynamic consequences of the gesture, neonatal societies now recommend the
      use of anesthetic before intubation, with a short duration sedative.

      Propofol is a general anesthetic that combines these conditions and is widely used in
      pediatric anesthesia.

      In that way, since 2016, the invetigators have modified the sedation protocol for intubation
      in our department and have recommended Propofol as first-line treatment for term and preterm
      newborn. A lot of study showed its hemodynamic safety in preterms. However, the investigators
      lack data on the autonomic stress really observed during intubation in this population. The
      investigators therefore propose to evaluate these physiological data in a non-randomized
      prospective observational study in premature infants under 33 weeks of gestational amenorrhea
      (GA), during a sedation protocol for intubation and surfactant administration according the
      INSURE or LISA technique, with standardized doses of propofol : 1mg/kg for preterm infants
      with a birthweight less than 1.5kg and 1.5mg/kg for higher birthweight.
