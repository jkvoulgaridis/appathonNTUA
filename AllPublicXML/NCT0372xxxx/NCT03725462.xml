  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the performance of Cardioskin and Neuronaute, two connected medical
      devices CE-marked, manufactured by Bioserenity.

      It's an open monocentric comparative clinical study, where subjects will test the Cardioskin
      device and/or the Neuronaute device.

      With this study evulating the performance of two wireless, connected device of
      electrophysiological signal monitoring. The Cardioskin monitors electrocardiogram signal. The
      Neuronaute monitors electroencephalogram, electromyogram and electrocardiogram.

      This study will permit to optimize the devices performance.

      To the study, subjects of at least 18 years old will test Cardioskin and or Neuronaute
      device, without randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ man or women of at least 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Injuries or wounds on the body and scalp

          -  Participant unable to follow the procedure of use, the judgment of the investigator

          -  Brain surgery that occurred less than a week ago

          -  Known allergy to silver, polyamide, silicone, synthetic materials

          -  Sensory disorders that make the subject insensitive to pain

          -  behavioral problems that make the subject excessively agitated or aggressive;
