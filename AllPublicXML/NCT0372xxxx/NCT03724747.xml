  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study medication (BAY 2315497 Injection) is a thorium-227 labeled immuno-conjugate,
      specific for the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which will be evaluated in
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In this study, this
      investigational medication will be administered to patients for the first time. The primary
      objective of the study is to define the safety and tolerability profile and Maximal Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) of BAY 2315497 Injection. The secondary objectives are to determine the
      recommended dose for further clinical development and to investigate how the study drug is
      distributed and cleared from the body.
