  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, multicenter, 30-day, unsupervised AUS among targeted (at-risk)
      adult and adolescent consumers designed to mimic an OTC-like environment. More specifically,
      &quot;at-risk&quot; consumers, as discussed with the FDA, will comprise elderly consumers (&gt;65 years of
      age), consumers with an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or cardiovascular
      (CV) adverse events, consumers who experience severe pain, low literacy subjects, and
      adolescents (12-17 years of age). The total number of subjects expected to enroll into the
      study is approximately 820. Sites will be pharmacies in diverse geographic locations around
      the US. Prospective adult subjects will be recruited via general population and targeted risk
      condition advertising (although participants will not be informed as to specific health
      conditions for which they are being recruited), while adolescents will be recruited using
      targeted, outbound pre-recruiting telephone calls. Subjects (or the parents/guardians of
      prospective adolescent subjects) responding to the advertisements or recruitment calls will
      be initially screened by telephone, and eligibility will subsequently be verified in-person
      at the pharmacy site.

    <intervention_model_description>The Actual Use Trial (AUT) design utilizes a real world setting to assess the ability of consumers to use an investigational product that will be marketed in an over-the-counter setting according to the proposed product labelling. The primary objective of this AUT is to evaluate compliance with the labeled dosing directions for Advil 12 Hour and to understand why misuse occurred and if it was a conscious decision by the subject. A secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of Advil 12 Hour in unsupervised actual use and how it relates to misuse.</intervention_model_description>

             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

         10. Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; and male and female subjects
             of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method

             investigational product.

         11. 18 years of age or older and classified as normal literacy (REALM Test score ≥61)
             after the normal literacy group quotas (approximately 70% of adult subjects) are full

             reliever user (&lt;30 doses per month on average in the preceding 3 months) after the

         13. Not capable of swallowing a vitamin sized tablet.

         14. Refuses to participate in required assessments (such as urine pregnancy, finger stick
             cholesterol or blood pressure tests, or unable or unwilling to comply with electronic
             diary procedures).

             The following additional exclusion criteria will be applied for adolescent subjects
             only (12-17 years of age):

         15. Has developmental or learning disabilities that, in the judgment of the
             parent/guardian or the investigator, would interfere with study participation.

         16. Another adolescent child from the family is already enrolled into the study, or
             parent/guardian does not agree that only one adolescent child from the family or
