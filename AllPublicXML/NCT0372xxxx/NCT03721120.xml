  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is diagnosed at metastatic stage in 60% of the cases. For these patients,
      first-line treatment is based on histology and molecular characterization of non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thus, quality and quantity of tumor tissue are crucial to
      determine the appropriate treatment (targeted therapies, chemotherapy and immunotherapy).

      However, in routine practice, tissue quality and quantity can be limited (25%), resulting in
      the need for tumor rebiopsy for molecular analysis. Therefore, lung cancer patients often
      experience substantial delays before treatment initiation that may be associated with worse
      patient experience of subsequent cancer care and poorer clinical outcomes.

      &quot;Liquid biopsies&quot; (LB) are used to detect genomic alterations in cell-free circulating DNA
      (cfDNA). Since very recently, they are routinely used in reference centers for the detection
      of EGFR-mutations when tissue is not sufficient for molecular characterization. Importantly,
      the feasibility and clinical relevance of systematic liquid biopsies in routine practice has
      never been evaluated in patients with suspicious advanced lung cancer.

      Investigators hypothesize that using systematic LB in patients with clinical suspicion of
      metastatic lung cancer may reduce time-to-treatment initiation and avoid tissue rebiopsy.

      Investigators performed a retrospective study including 250 NSCLC patients treated in a
      tertiary Cancer Center and in the University Hospital of Lyon, France. The mean
      time-to-appropriate frontline treatment initiation (TTI) was 42+/-22.5 days. With the use of
      LB at the time of first consultation, the investigators believe it is possible to reduce the
      mean TTI down to 33 days (21% reduction in TTI) in the overall population with suspicious
      metastatic lung cancer, including a 50% and 40% reduction in TTI for EGFR/ALK/ROS1/BRAF V600E
      subgroups and KRAS/LKB1/ERBB2/c-MET/BRAF non V600E subgroups, respectively.

      Investigators therefore designed a &quot;real-life&quot; randomized study to evaluate the feasibility
      and clinical relevance of LB to decrease the TTI, which may in turn improve patients'
      outcome. Genomic analyses of circulating cfDNA will be performed using a robust and highly
      sensitive technology (InVision®), that profiles the presence of genomic aberrations in a
      panel of 35 genes including mutations, insertion/deletions and rearrangements, including all
      actionable alterations required to initiate the appropriate first-line therapy (EGFR-, ALK-,
      ROS1 and BRAF V600E).

    <description>It is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of appropriate-treatment initiation (whatever the start date occurs before or after the biopsy results). As all the patients will receive an appropriate-treatment, no censored data are expected, thus the TTI will be analyzed as a continuous outcome. Appropriate treatment is defined as follow:
Based on contributive results on tissue OR liquid biopsy:
EGFR- or BRAF V600E-mutations, ALK- or ROS1- rearrangements: specific targeted therapies
None of the four previous alterations: investigator's choice (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy or targeted therapies based on pathology results, PD-L1 expression and access to therapies in the context of Temporary Used Authorization or clinical trials)
In case of non-contributive results on tissue AND liquid biopsy: any treatment initiated by investigator (chemotherapy or immunotherapy based on pathology results and PD-L1 level of expression).</description>
