    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to monitor and identify the occurrence of neutropenia and
      febrile neutropenia in untreated CD30-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma participants on concomitant
      brentuximab vedotin and doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (AVD)
      in routine clinical practice.

      The drug being tested in this survey is called brentuximab vedotin intravenous infusion 50
      mg. This intravenous infusion is being tested to treat people with untreated CD30-positive
      Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the occurrence of
      neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in untreated CD30-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma patients on
      concomitant brentuximab vedotin and AVD in the routine clinical setting. The planned number
      of observed patients will be approximately 100.

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.

    <description>Severity grades will be evaluated as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI CTCAE). Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to AE.</description>

    <measure>Tumor Response Rate Based on Investigator's Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 2 weeks after the last dose (approximately 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the Revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma by Cheson. CR is defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is defined as regression of measurable disease and no new sites.</description>
