  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure patients sometimes receive tracheostomy due to difficulty weaning from
      mechanical ventilation. Efforts to wean patients with a tracheostomy usually involve the
      administration of oxygen via High Humidity device. There are two major ways of administering
      oxygen to patients which include low flow delivered at less than 10Liters per minute (LPM)
      and high-flow delivered at greater than 10LPM. There is not a currently accepted standard of
      care practice for how to administer oxygen therapy to these patients. Both Low and High Flow
      are accepted practices in the US.

      Many patients with Respiratory Failure undergo tracheostomy due to difficulty weaning from
      mechanical ventilation. A component of weaning a patient with tracheostomy usually involves
      the administration of oxygen via High Humidity device. There are two major ways of
      administering oxygen via High Humidity to patients. They include low flow high humidity;
      delivered at less than or equal to 10LPM or high-flow humidity, delivered at greater than
      10LPM. There is not a currently accepted standard of practice for how to administer oxygen
      high humidity to patients who receive a tracheostomy due to respiratory failure. Both Low and
      High Flow high humidity devices are used routinely by health care facilities nationwide.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to perform a crossover study in both a medicine and
      surgical Intensive Care Unit to determine which type of oxygen High Humidity therapy should
      be preferentially utilized. Patients in one Intensive Care Unit will start off with Low Flow
      high humidity while the alternate unit will start with Hi Flow high humidity. After one half
      of the required sample size is accrued the investigators will cross over the two ICUs to the
      alternate type of oxygen High Humidity device. No other respiratory practices will change
      during the conduct of this trial.
