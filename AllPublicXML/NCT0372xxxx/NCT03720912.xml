  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral family therapy, specifically focused on insuring support for the primary caregiver
      of a child with type one diabetes mellitus and healthy family dynamics, may improve the
      child's glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c level (HbA1c).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success or failure of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) management in children depends not
      only on access to care, diabetes technologies and diabetes education, but also on the
      abilities of the patient and his/her family to carry out complex demands. Recent data show
      that family dynamics play a critical role in determining glycemic control in pediatric
      patients with T1D. The investigators prior work (Loomba-Albrecht and Glaser, unpublished
      data) suggests that the strongest determinants of glycemic control are factors related to the
      primary caregiver's involvement in supportive relationships with others, either a spouse or
      other family members. This provides a potential therapeutic target to improve outcomes for
      children with T1D.
