  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the feasibility of performing robotic navigation of peripheral airways in
      human subjects for the purpose of biopsying peripheral lung lesions will be evaluated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions remains a challenge due to a number of
      factors, one of which may be the ability to gain access to peripheral lesions due to the size
      and maneuverability of conventional bronchoscopes. In this study, the investigators will
      evaluate the feasibility of a new technique using a robotic endoscope with the Monarch
      navigational platform to both access and biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesions. The Monarch
      platform is a &quot;robotic&quot; assisted or electromechanical, software driven endoscopy system
      designed to be used by qualified physicians to provide bronchoscopic visualization of and
      access to patient airways for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
