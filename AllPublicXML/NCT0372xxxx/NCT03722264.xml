  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluoride is very effective in preventing dental decay (cavities) when applied in the form of
      a varnish on tooth surfaces. The purpose of this study is to verify if fluoride-releasing
      primer (OpalSeal) offers more protection against early dental decay (cavity) compared to
      conventional primer (Transbond XT) during treatment with braces.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primers are a type of 'glue' routinely used in orthodontics to attach brackets (metallic
      components) to the teeth. OpalSeal is a fluoride-releasing primer that has the potential to
      reduce cavities in patients receiving braces.

      Orthodontic patients are at particular risk of developing two types of early carious lesions
      (decay):

        1. Around the brackets called White Spot Lesions and

        2. Along the sides of the teeth after slenderization procedure called inter-proximal
           reduction (IPR).

      Our research questions are:

        1. Can OpalSeal offer protection against white spot lesions (WSL) around the brackets?

        2. Can OpalSeal offer protection against decay on the sides of teeth following IPR?
