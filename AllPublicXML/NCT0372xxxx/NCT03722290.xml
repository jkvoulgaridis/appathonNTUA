  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by loss of FMR1 expression on the X chromosome that leads
      to increased mRNA translation, which results in hyperactivation of ERK (extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase) and mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rafampicin complex 1) signaling
      and consequently in synaptic dysfunction and neurological development. There is presently no
      cure for FXS. Recent studies suggest that metformin (a widely prescribed drug for type II
      diabetes in children and adults) which crosses the blood-brain barrier, corrects various
      neurological and behavioral FXS phenotypes by normalizing ERK signaling, EIF4E
      phosphorylation and lowering expression of MMP9 to normal. Since this drug has not been
      previously used specifically for treatment of FXS (only few cases reported), the
      investigators propose an open-label trial of metformin in children and adults with FXS to
      better understand the safety and efficacy in both behavior and cognition.
