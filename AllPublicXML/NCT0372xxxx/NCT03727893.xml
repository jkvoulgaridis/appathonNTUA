    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this pilot randomized control trial (RCT) is to determine the efficacy
      of the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise protocols for the WheelMill System
      (WMS) to improve exercise intensity, cardiovascular fitness, metabolic health, and
      psychological well-being in manual wheelchair users (MWUs) with spinal cord injury (SCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injuries (SCI) are at greater health risk for major health conditions
      and poorer health outcomes than the population without disabilities. For people with SCI,
      physical activity is critical for both physiological and psychosocial well-being, however 75%
      of persons with SCI are not active enough to achieve activity-related health benefits. While
      current exercise guidelines for persons with SCI are limited and vary, health authorities and
      literature have focused more on recommendations for moderate-intensity exercise, however
      recent studies have shown that, due to the reduced exercise capacity of the active muscles
      used in persons with SCI, moderate-intensity exercise alone is inadequate to stimulate
      meaningful improvements in cardiovascular disease risk. An alternative exercise approach that
      has demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular disease risk and morality is
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Participating in exercise protocols of higher
      intensity may offer a more effective and time-efficient method of increasing cardiovascular
      fitness and metabolic health in persons with SCI. However, few studies have evaluated the
      efficacy of HIIT protocols to increase exercise intensity and clinically improve cardio
      metabolic health and fitness in this population. The WheelMill System (WMS) is a wheelchair
      roller-based system that allows persons with SCI to use their personal manual wheelchair for
      wheelchair training or endurance exercise. With this study, we aim to assess the efficacy of
      a HIIT intervention conducted on a wheelchair roller-based system in improving
      cardiorespiratory and metabolic function, psychosocial well-being, and exercise intensity for
      manual wheelchair users (MWUs) with SCI. We also aim to determine if the roller-based system
      is a feasible platform for delivering HIIT for MWUs with SCI as well as identifying the
      perspectives of the participants on the recruitment and enrollment process, the assessment
      methods, and tolerance and acceptance of the intervention protocol. The long-term goal of
      this research is to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce cardiovascular and
      metabolic disease risk in MWUs. This study will serve as the initial step toward that goal by
      pilot testing a HIIT intervention to increase exercise intensity of MWUs with SCI to promote
      physiological and psychosocial activity-related health benefits. We will recruit, enroll, and
      randomize MWUs with SCI into a roller-based Intervention Group (IG) or the Control Group
      (CG). Participants in the IG will complete an initial exercise education session and a
      12-week (3 sessions/wk) evidence-based HIIT program using the roller-based system.
      Participants in the CG will complete an initial exercise education session and enroll in a
      12-week (3 sessions/wk) independent workout program at an accessible community-based fitness
      facility. This study will measure the potential physiological, functional, and psychosocial
      health benefits of participating in a HIIT program designed for MWUs with SCI. We will then
      use the findings to define how exercise training at a higher intensity can support health
      outcomes and improve therapeutic and community-based interventions to promote
      cardiorespiratory and metabolic health and well-being of people with SCI.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VO2peak Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post Intervention at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>VO2 peak will be measured using a standard computer-integrated, open-circuit, breath-by-breath metabolic measurement system (TrueOne 2400, Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT, US) while the participant performs a graded-exercise test on an ACE, SCIFIT PRO2 (Life Fitness, Tulsa, OK, US). In addition, an H7 Heart Rate Sensor (Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY, US) will be placed on each participant to monitor heart rate during testing. Each participant will be fitted with a silicone mask to cover his or her mouth and nose while performing the exercise test, which is typically completed in 8-12 minutes depending on the participant's fitness level. The protocol involves a 3-minute warm-up at a workload of 8-10 watts (W) followed by a standard ACE ramp protocol. The ramp protocol requires participants to maintain 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) with incremental increases by 7 W every minute, until exhaustion.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Post Intervention at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MPT is a functional mobility and physical fitness test involving manual wheelchair users propelling a designated 30-meter loop. Participants are asked to propel as far as possible on the course within 6 minutes. Total distance propelled is determined by tallying the number of completed 30-meter loops and measuring the partially completed final lap using a tape measure.</description>

    <description>FACES is a 10-point visual-analog scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) for participants to rate their level of pain. FACES will be administered at the beginning and end of each session, for all groups, to ensure that sessions (IG, CG) are not causing or exacerbating pain.</description>

    <measure>Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Intervention at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WUSPI is a self-report measure of shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users (MWUs) during functional activities. The WUSPI consists of a 15-item questionnaire addressing shoulder pain during 15 activities within four domains: transfers, wheelchair mobility, self-care, and general activities. A 10-point visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) is used to determine pain intensity experienced during each activity. The WUSPI score (from 0 [no pain] to 150 [worst pain] across all items) indicates the participant's level of shoulder pain during functional activities.</description>
