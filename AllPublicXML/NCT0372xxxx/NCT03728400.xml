  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This aim of the study is to set up a procedure for screening for undernutrition in the
      neurovascular intensive care unit. This screening procedure follows a specific work
      concerning undernutrition in thrombolyzed patients (NCT03303820). This work was motivated by
      the fact that, despite a high frequency of undernutrition in the hospital (at least 30% of
      patients), undernutrition in neurovascular unit is studied very little. A cohort of
      thrombolysed patients in 2014 was studied retrospectively. Patients malnourished at the
      entrance had a non-significant, less good recovery of their stroke (+ 1 Rankin score point at
      3 months in malnourished patients at the entrance).

      The main objective of this project is to assess, prospectively, the frequency of
      undernutrition at the entrance to the neurovascular intensive care unit and to evaluate the
      implementation of the undernutrition screening procedure.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the number of patients who have had an assessment of their nutritional status, that is, for whom undernutrition is detected according to the terms proposed in the undernutrition screening procedure: search for previous quantified weight loss, input BMI, albuminemia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Rankin scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Rankin score will be performed in post stroke consultation, 3 months after inclusion. Rankin scale: 0 no symptoms, 1 No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms, 2 Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities, 3 Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted, 4 Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted, 5 Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent</description>
