    <textblock>
      SHR-1603-I-101 is an single-arm, open-label, dose finding phase I clinical trial of SHR-1603
      in subjects with advanced solid tumor or relapsed/refractory malignant lymphoid diseases. The
      study drug will be administered by intravenous infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1603-I-101 is a single-arm, open-label, dose finding, first-in-human(FIH) clinical trial
      of SHR-1603 intravenous infusion in subjects with advanced solid tumor or relapsed/refractory
      malignant lymphoid diseases.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SHR-1603,
      as well as to determine the maximally tolerated dose(MTD) and define the recommended Phase 2
      dose(RP2D) of SHR-1603.

      The study is consisted of a dose-escalation Part 1 followed by a dose expansion Part 2 and a
      clinical expansion Part 3.

      Part 1 will use accelerated titration and 3+3 dose-escalation design to determine MTD.

      Part 2 will further evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK/PD features of SHR-1603 based on
      the results of Part 1.

      Part 3 will include several cohorts of malignancies to collect preliminary efficacy
      information of SHR-1603.
