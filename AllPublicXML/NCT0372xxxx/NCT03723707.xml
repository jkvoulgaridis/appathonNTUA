      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a care quality improvement intervention
      featuring use of consensus decisional guidance for the medical management of diabetes (DM) in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) in primary care, provider (PCP)
      workflow enhancements supported by a panel manager(PM) for workflow support, electronic
