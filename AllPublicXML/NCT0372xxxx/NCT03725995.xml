      Aims: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of topical
      lidocaine in relieving pain related to INM administration.

      Design: This was a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-three uncooperative
      children, aged 4 - 11.

      Background and Aims: The use of intranasal midazolam (INM) has been commonly associated with
      a burning sensation of the nasal mucosa. However, despite its significance, this subject has
      received little adequate research focus. The objective of the current study was to evaluate
      the effectiveness of topical lidocaine in relieving pain related to INM administration.

      Design: This was a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-three uncooperative
      children, aged 4 - 11, were randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive the drug
      nasally via a pre-calibrated spray as per the following assignments:

      A: received 0.5 mg/kg midazolam, B: received lidocaine 2% prior to 0.5 mg/kg midazolam.

      C: received saline 9% (placebo), 0.5mg/kg. Children were asked to record the degree of pain
      using Wong-Baker-Faces- (WBFS) Scale.

    <description>The use of intranasal midazolam is associated with a burning sensation of the nasal mucosa, the pain was assessed using a self report pain scale Wong Baker Faces Scale, the degree of pain is determined by choosing a score of (0-2-4-6-8-10) (minimum score 0, means no pain, maximum score 10, means the drug hurts worst, higher scores are worse) the scores were reported by children received intranasal midazolam alone, intranasal midazolam preceded by intranasal lidocaine or intranasal saline (placebo).</description>
