      The specific aims of this sub-study are:

      Specific Aim #1: Work with game development team to develop a web-based version of
      smokeSCREEN.

      Specific Aim # 2: Build a pre-post survey into the smokeSCREEN game to anonymously collect
      survey information on players' perspectives, beliefs, behaviors around smoking.

      Specific Aim # 3: Collaborate with youth programs to pilot test the implementation of the new
      web-based version of smokeSCREEN into youth programs.

    <measure>To determine the impact of a web-based prevention videogame intervention prototype, smokeSCREEN, on participants' beliefs involving tobacco product use - pre test survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) and then played the videogame intervention. Fourteen questions were designed from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014)13 that focused on beliefs about cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco were used. For beliefs, questions had 4-5 choices ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree or definitely yes to definitely not, or 5 response choices ranging from very unlikely to very likely.</description>

    <description>Participants completed a post-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software), after they have played the videogame intervention. Fourteen questions were designed from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014)13 that focused on beliefs about cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco were used for the survey.

    <intervention_name>smokeSCREEN video game</intervention_name>
    <description>smokeSCREEN video game is web-based videogame intervention focused on tobacco use prevention in teens. The game has 1.5-2 hours of unique game play and focuses on combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco products.smokeSCREEN. Guided by the social cognitive theory and the theory of planned behavior, smokeSCREEN addresses a range of challenges that teens often face involving peer pressure and the use of tobacco products. Participants are provided access to the smokeSCREEN game through a private, password-protected website link and instructed to complete the game.</description>
