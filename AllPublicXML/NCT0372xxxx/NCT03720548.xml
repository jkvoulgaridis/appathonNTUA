  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3372993 in
      healthy participants and participants with AD. The study will also investigate how much
      LY3372993 gets into the bloodstream and test the effects of LY3372993 in participants with
      AD.

      The study has two parts:

        -  Part A - Healthy participants will receive LY3372993 or placebo. Part A will last up to
           17 weeks;

        -  Part B - Participants with AD will receive LY3372993 or placebo. Part B will last about
           317 days.

      In April, 2019, Eli Lilly and Company made a business decision to terminate Part B. No
      participants were enrolled.
