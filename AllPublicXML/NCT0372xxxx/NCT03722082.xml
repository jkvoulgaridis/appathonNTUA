  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high hereditary component and the contribution of neurodevelopmental processes in bipolar
      disorder and schizophrenia means implies the children of these patients are considered a high
      risk population for both diseases and therefore a very adequate sample for the study of
      vulnerability markers to both disorders. To date there is no previous literature on the
      psychological approach of children and adolescents of bipolar or schizophrenic patients. The
      concept of cognitive reserve (CR) was initially developed in the field of dementia, it
      assumes that people with the same brain damage may have different clinical manifestations
      depending on their ability to compensate for this damage, so a greater cognitive reserve will
      entail a greater capacity to compensate the alterations and difficulties due to the
      pathology. Enhancing CR in high genetic risk population could help the acquisition of skills
      that help compensate the clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging alterations and ultimately help
      in the prevention of the development of pathologies for those with higher risk.This study
      aims to develop and apply a psychological program in order to enhance cognitive reserve (CR)
      in child, adolescent and young adults offspring of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or
      bipolar disorder (SZBP-OFF).

  <detailed_description>

      The project will have two main objectives: to test the effectiveness of the psychological
      program and to test if the observed improvements are stable over time (nine months of
      follow-up). A sample of 108 SZBP-OFF and 52 community controls will be included. Both groups
      will be assessed with clinical scales, neuropsychological, CR and neuroimaging assessments at
      baseline. Then, the SZBP-OFF group will be randomized to psychological program to enhance CR
      (N= 54) or to support treatment (N=54). SZBP-OFF subjects will be evaluated with clinical,
      CR, neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests after the psychological intervention and at
      nine months follow-up in order to assess if the obtained results are stable over time. The
      investigators hypothesize that SZBP-OFF will show lower CR scores and higher percentages of
      psychopathology, cognitive difficulties and brain abnormalities. The investigators also
      hypothesize that SZBP-OFF who received the psychological intervention will increase their CR
      and will decrease the severity of the observed difficulties (in clinical, neuropsychological,
      CR and neuroimaging areas). These results will be stable in the nine month follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>This intervention focuses in the improvement of academic skills, the increase of leisure activities and the improvement of neurocognitive functions with the ultimate goal of improving daily functioning. This intervention is based on ecological tasks that will be carried out in two areas, both in the hospital and at home. Most of the techniques are based on: pencil and paper tasks, with audiovisual and virtual reality support, telephone applications and group activities. The groups will be made with parents and children, adolescents and young adults separately being the content of the sessions the same but adapted to the age of the attendees.</description>

    <description>The intervention is aimed at improving cognitive reserve in offsprings of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The program is composed of 12 sessions of 60 minutes and will be adapted according the three different age groups (6-12) (13-18) (18-25). Each group will include between 6-to-8 offsprings and conducted by 4 experienced neuropsychologists in both children and adults. The sessions are the following:</description>
