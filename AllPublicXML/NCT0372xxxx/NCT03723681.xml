  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 mg or 40 mg of quizartinib will be given to Chinese patients who were just diagnosed with
      AML. The study drug will be given to them along with standard therapies. The purpose is to
      find out the highest dose they can stand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of quizartinib in combination with standard induction therapy and consolidation therapy
      in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed AML.

      The quizartinib doses will be Level 1: 20 mg and Level 2: 40 mg. No increase in the
      quizartinib dose will be made in the same subject.

      Dose-limiting toxicity associated with quizartinib occurring at each level will be assessed,
      and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be decided using a 3 + 3 design.
