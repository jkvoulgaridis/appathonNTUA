QLQ-C30 has four-point scales for the first five items. These are coded with the same response categories as items 6 to 28, namely &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;Very much.&quot; For items 29 and 30, a seven-point scale (ranging from 1 = &quot;Very Poor&quot; to 7 = &quot;Excellent&quot;) rates overall health and overall quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants will not receive any intervention as a part of this study. This study will collect retrospective and prospective real-world data to describe retention rates for participants of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving ibrutinib in routine Italian clinical practice over a 2-year follow-up period. Participants with CLL who have started ibrutinib treatment within 3 months before enrollment visit or in case ibrutinib was prescribed before or on the enrollment day as per routine clinical practice within the 30 days after enrollment visit will be included in the study. The primary data source for this observational study will be the medical records of each enrolled participant, as well as questionnaires concerning quality of life and treatment adherence. Data will be collected every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for the second year during prospective period.</description>
