      Investigators deconstructed the port that removed from patients and identified there were
      structural weakness, old blood clot and fibrin deposits. Investigators consider the problem
      may be exist in maintenance. After thoroughly examination the maintenance protocol,
      Investigators identified the problem and try to remodel the maintenance protocol. The Goal of
      this study was to testify the clinical value of standard maintenance protocol.

      A secure and easily feasible vascular access is crucial for oncology patients because of the
      therapeutic need. Although intravenous port has been utilized for 3 decades, catheter-related
      complication still remain and had to deal with. According to investigators clinical
      experience, investigators summarized a standard algorithm as a recommendation for intravenous
      sport implantation. The complication before and after standard algorithm was 20 % and 3.5 %,
      respectively. However, catheter related infection and malfunction still could not be avoided.
      If patient was identified with these 2 complications, re-intervention is needed and
      cancer-related therapy has to be postpone. Investigators deconstructed the port that removed
      from patients and identified there were structural weakness, old blood clot and fibrin
      deposits. Investigators consider the problem may be exist in maintenance. After thoroughly
      examination the maintenance protocol, investigators identified the problem and try to remodel
      the maintenance protocol. The Goal of this study was to testify the clinical value of
      standard maintenance protocol.
