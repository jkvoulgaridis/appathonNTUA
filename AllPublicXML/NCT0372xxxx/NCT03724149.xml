    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine safety and effectiveness of transplanting lungs
      from Hepatitis C-positive donors into Hepatitis C-negative patients on the lung transplant
      waitlist, who will then be treated with appropriate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) after
      transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-labelled pilot clinical trial of Zepatier (Grazoprevir + Elbasvir), Epclusa (Sofosbuvir
      + Velpatasvir), or another appropriate DAA in at least 10 HCV-negative subjects receiving a
      lung transplant from a hepatitis C (HCV)-positive donor. Eligible subjects will receive a
      lung transplant from a deceased-donor, and then will receive treatment after lung
      transplantation when infection with HCV is confirmed in these lung transplant recipients.
      Treatment will be complete after 12 weeks for most subjects.

          -  Obtained agreement for participation from the lung transplant team

             and study visits for a minimum of 12 months after transplantation

          -  No active illicit substance abuse

          -  Women must agree to use birth control in accordance with Mycophenolate Risk Evaluation
             and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) following transplant due to the increased risk of birth
             defects and/or miscarriage

          -  Both men and women must agree to use at least one barrier method of birth control or
             remain abstinent following transplant due to risk of HCV transmission

          -  Inclusion criteria for treatment (not for entry as study patient) will include any
             detectable HCV RNA by week 4 post-lung transplantation

          -  Able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:
