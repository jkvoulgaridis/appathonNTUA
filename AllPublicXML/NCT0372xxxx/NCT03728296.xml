        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 to 70 years old (including 18 and 70 years old)

             diagnostic criteria:

        （1）Diabetes symptoms (hyperglycemia caused by polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, itchy
        skin, blurred vision and other acute metabolic disorders) + random blood glucose ≥ 11.1nmol
        / L; （2）Fasting blood glucose ≥7.0mmol/L or 75g glucose meets 2-hour blood glucose
        ≥11.1mmol/L.

        3、Voluntary informed consent is given, agree to follow the trial treatment and visit plan.

        Note: 2 is the venous plasma glucose level, if there is no diabetes symptoms, it is
        necessary to repeat the test on the next day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with acute complications of diabetes: including diabetic ketosis, diabetic
             ketoacidosis, diabetes, hyperglycemia, hypertonic state, etc.

          2. Patients with Severe bacterial and viral infections

          3. patients are participating in other clinical trials and treating with other immune
             cellular products (DC, CIK, T, NK, and Car T products with CD19 or other targets)

          4. Patients with severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (NYHA class 3-4)
             cannot cooperate with the study

          5. Patients with severe liver dysfunction(liver function AST and ALT exceeded 2.5 times
             the normal upper limit).

          6. Patients with kidney disease or moderate to severe renal insufficiency (renal function
             eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2)

          7. Women in pregnancy (urine/blood pregnancy test positive) or lactation; men or women
             with pregnancy plans in the last year; patients are not guaranteed to take effective
             contraceptive measures during the trial;

          8. patients were diagnosed as tumor or tumor chemotherapy, radiotherapy and acute uric
             acid nephropathy within 5 years.

          9. Other circumstances that researchers do not consider suitable for research.

         10. Withdrawal from trial, loss of follow-up or death due to other reasons

         11. Incomplete data, affecting effectiveness and safety judges

         12. Researchers believe that the need for termination of the trial is needed.
