      This trial studies an internet-based intervention for skin self-examination (SSE) in
      participants at increased risk for melanoma. Early detection of suspicious growths on the
      skin can be done by performing regular SSE checks. Using an internet-based intervention, such
      as mySmartCheck, may help to promote regular, thorough checks on the skin in individuals at
      increased risk for melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of mySmartCheck versus usual care on skin-self-examination (SSE)
      behaviors among individuals at increased risk for developing melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of mySmartCheck versus usual care on patients barriers and benefits
      to conducting SSE, SSE self-efficacy (confidence), level of worry about developing melanoma,
      and number of health care consultations (visits, telephone calls, and emails).

      II. To evaluate whether mySmartCheck effects are moderated by the patient's Total Body
      Photography (TBP) status.

      III. To identify barriers and facilitators to using mySmartCheck.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Participants complete a telephone based usability testing of the online program.
      Participants complete between 1-5 user testing sessions of the mySmartCheck program (about
      45-60 minutes per session) to provide feedback on acceptability, satisfaction, comprehension,
      and usability.

      PHASE II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Both the intervention and control
      group complete a baseline survey as well as a 13 weeks post-baseline survey.

      GROUP I: After completing the baseline survey, participants receive access to the
      mySmartCheck program, and continue to receive standard of care. Participants are asked to
      complete another survey 13 weeks post-baseline.

      GROUP II: After completing the baseline survey, participants receive standard of care.
      Participants are asked to complete another survey 13 weeks post-baseline.

      Study duration is 13 weeks for all participants.

    <time_frame>Up to 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three multi-item scales will be used to measure barriers and facilitators to using the mySmartCheck program. The first scale is 15 items (5-point response scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;a lot&quot;) adapted from The Internet Impact and Effectiveness Questionnaire. This scale measures patients' perceptions of an Internet intervention in terms of the program's effectiveness in resolving their targeted health condition. The second scale includes 18 items (3-point response scale from &quot;not a problem&quot; to &quot;a major problem&quot;) adapted from the Internet Intervention Adherence Questionnaire. This scale is used to identify obstacles and barriers that interfere with using Internet intervention programs. The final scale includes 13 items (4-point response scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;) adapted from the Internet Evaluation and Utility Questionnaire. This scale measures patients' experiences and perceptions of an Internet intervention.</description>
