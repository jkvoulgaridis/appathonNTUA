  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with a 2 week washout
      period. Healthy volunteers will receive placebo, 4 grams, or 8 grams of Sunfiber in addition
      to their regular diet. Fecal samples will be collected for measurement of bowl function,
      including the gut microbiota.
