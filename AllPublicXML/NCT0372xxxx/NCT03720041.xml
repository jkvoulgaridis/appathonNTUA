      Trial Title:

      FiTNEss (UK-MRA Myeloma XIV) - Frailty-adjusted therapy in Transplant Non-Eligible patients
      with newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

      Overview:

      A phase III, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial to compare standard (reactive) and
      frailty-adjusted (adaptive) induction therapy delivery with the novel triplet ixazomib,
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD), and to compare maintenance lenalidomide (R) to
      lenalidomide plus ixazomib (R+I) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not
      suitable for a stem cell transplant.

      All participants receive induction treatment with ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      and are randomised on a 1:1 basis at trial entry to the use of frailty score-adjusted
      up-front dose reductions vs. standard up-front dosing followed by toxicity dependent reactive
      dose-modifications during therapy. Following 12 cycles of induction treatment participants
      alive and progression-free undergo a second randomisation on a 1:1 basis to maintenance
      treatment with lenalidomide plus placebo versus lenalidomide plus ixazomib. Participants and
      their treating physicians will be blinded to maintenance allocation.

      Participant population:

        -  Newly diagnosed as having Multiple Myeloma (MM) according to the updated IMWG diagnostic
           criteria 2014 (see Appendix 1 for criteria)

        -  Not eligible for stem cell transplant

        -  Aged at least 18 years

        -  Able to provide written informed consent

      Number of participants:

      740 participants will be entered into the trial at Randomisation 1 (R1), with 478
      participants at Randomisation 2 (R2).

      Objectives:

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine:

        -  Early treatment cessation (within 60 days of randomisation) for standard versus
           frailty-adjusted up-front dosing

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS, from maintenance randomisation) for lenalidomide +
           placebo (R) versus lenalidomide + ixazomib (R+I)

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess progression-free survival (PFS) for
      standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing reductions, time to progression, time to 2nd
      PFS event (PFS2), overall survival (OS), survival after progression, deaths within 12 months
      of R1, overall response rate (ORR), attainment of â‰¥VGPR, attainment of MRD negativity,
      duration of response, time to improved response, time to next treatment, treatment compliance
      and total amount of therapy delivered, toxicity &amp; safety including the incidence of SPMs,
      Quality of Life (QoL), cost effectiveness of standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing
      of IRD and cost-effectiveness of R + I versus R.

      Exploratory objectives are prospective validation of a novel frailty risk score (UK-MRA
      Myeloma Risk Profile - MRP), usefulness of Karnofsky Performance Status (PS), and association
      of molecular subgroups with response, PFS and OS.

    <description>In the first instance treatment compliance is defined as a binary outcome i.e. did the participant receive 12 cycles of induction treatment. The total amount of therapy delivered will be first defined as the number of induction and maintenance cycles which the participant received. This may be extended to consider the percentage of protocol dose delivered. For each treatment (ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) this will be defined as the total dose received in a cycle compared to the total dose the participant should have received in the cycle without modifications, averaged across all cycles of treatment.</description>

    <description>European Organization for the Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is used to measure patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) at R1, after cycles 2, 4, 6 &amp; 12 of induction, and after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance (all cycles are 28 days).
The QLQ-C30 comprises multi-item scales &amp; single-item measures: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea &amp; vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, &amp; 6 single items assessing additional symptoms (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation &amp; diarrhoea). All scales &amp; single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level: a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high quality of life, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>

    <description>The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20) is used to measure patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) at Randomisation 1, after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days), and after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days).
The EORTC QLQ-MY20 comprises 20 questions that address four myeloma-specific QoL domains: Disease Symptoms, Side Effects of Treatment, Future Perspectives, and Body Image. Disease Symptoms, Side Effects of Treatment, and Future Perspectives are all multi-item scales, and Body Image is a single-item scale. Domain scores are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0-100. A high score for Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment represents a high level of symptomatology or problems, whereas a high score for Future Perspective and Body Image represents better outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomisation 1; after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days); after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol 5 Dimension 3 Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) will be used to measure participant-assessed quality of life at Randomisation 1, after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days), and after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days).
The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <description>The prospective validation of a novel frailty risk score (UK Myeloma Research Alliance Myeloma Risk Profile (UK-MRA MRP)) will use the following measurements at baseline to categorise individuals into fit, intermediate-fitness and frail using the UK-MRA MRP:
C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
Age,
Performance status on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (scoring from 0 to 5, with 0 - fully active and 5 = dead) and
Score on Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma scale (ISS). The ISS score categorises newly-diagnosed myeloma patients into three groups (I, II, or III) depending on expected prognosis/overall survival based on measurements of serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum albumin.</description>

                  thrombocytopenia and provided appropriate supportive measures and patient
                  monitoring are in place, platelet count â‰¥ 30 x 10^9/L is permitted. Please note:
                  Platelet transfusions are not allowed â‰¤ 3 days prior to randomisation in order to
                  meet these values.

               3. Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and

                  of contraception.)

             Male participants, even if surgically sterilised (i.e. status post-vasectomy), must

             participants must consent to) the Celgene-approved Pregnancy Prevention Programme.

             If female and of childbearing potential, they must have a negative pregnancy test
             performed by a healthcare professional in accordance with the Celgene Pregnancy
             Prevention Programme.

             relieve bone pain or spinal cord compression, prior bisphosphonate treatment, or
             corticosteroids as long as the total dose does not exceed the equivalent of 160 mg

                  medical or surgical intervention;
