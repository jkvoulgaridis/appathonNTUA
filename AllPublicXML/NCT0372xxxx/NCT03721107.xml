      A study to evaluate the effectiveness of oral doses of Blautix in adult subjects with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      500 subjects will be enrolled with a diagnosis of IBS as defined by Rome IV criteria will be
      classified into cohorts according to the Rome IV classification of IBS subtypes.

      Each cohort (Cohort C &amp; Cohort D) will recruit 250 subjects who will randomly receive either
      Blautix or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio overall of treated to control subjects.

      Subjects will undergo five visits in total across approximately 13 weeks. During the study
      treatment phase subjects will be asked to complete a variety of Quality of Life
      questionnaires at certain time points. These will consist of Abdominal Pain Intensity Score,
      IBS-SSS, IBS-QoL, HADS, Stool frequency, Stool consistency &amp; FFQ.

      Subjects will be required to produce relevant blood, urine and faecal samples at
      pre-determined timepoints from screening through to End of Treatment &amp; follow up visits.

The IBS-SSS is measured on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS scale) in combination with reported numeric values which equates to an overall score. Q1-4 are severity scoring and Q5-7clinical assessment. Reponses are totalled for Q1-4 (pts indicate on the vas scale from 0-100 ow much they agree with the statements asked o produce an overall score which is then used to categorize patients as no symptoms, mild, moderate or severe. The category thresholds are as follows '0 = no symptoms, 75-175 = mild symptoms, 176-300 moderate symptoms and more than 300 is severe symptoms</description>
