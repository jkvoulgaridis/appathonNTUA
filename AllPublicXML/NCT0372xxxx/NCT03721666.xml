  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a complex, nonvisual procedure that is
      challenging for the dispatcher. The aim was to explore the medical dispatchers' perception of
      bystanders' responses and dispatchers' reflections about the added value of visual
      information in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) situations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten individual interviews with medical dispatchers who had previously handled an emergency
      call concerning OHCA captured on closed-circuit television (CCTV) were conducted. First, the
      medical dispatcher listened to the emergency call and described their perception of the
      scenario. Afterward, the CCTV recording was shown to the dispatcher, who was then
      interviewed. The interviews were videotaped, and the audio files were transcribed verbatim.
      Thematic content analysis was conducted.

    <description>We applied a qualitative research methodology using thematic analysis with an explorative and inductive approach. The first author followed Braun and Clarke's six-step analytical approach, which has the following steps: familiarising with data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the report. Codes and themes were organised using Nvivo10 software (QSR International Pty Ltd, Australia). Analysis continued until saturation; that is, when information became redundant.</description>
