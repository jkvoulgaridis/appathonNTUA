    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The Subject:

          1. is anticipated to be hospitalized for the duration of treatment (minimum of 6 days).

          2. is ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. or their legally authorized representative is able to provide informed consent.

          4. has been diagnosed with a wound (eg, chronic, acute, traumatic, or dehisced wounds)
             and/or ulcer (ie, full- thickness wounds) that meets the following criteria:

               1. total surface area measuring ≥ 16 cm2, including a minimum width of 2 cm (before
                  removal of eschar at the bedside and excluding undermining).

               2. &lt; 20 cm across (edge-to-edge) at any point perpendicular to the wound edges.

          5. has, in the opinion of the investigator, no more than 2/3 of the wound bed surface
             area considered to be clean, healthy, and viable. If eschar is present at baseline, it
             must be removed by bedside debridement prior to assessing the percentage of clean,
             healthy, and viable wound bed.

          6. has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening (if female and has potential
             for pregnancy) and is willing to take precautionary measures to prevent pregnancy
             during the duration of the study (up to 9 days).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The Subject:

          1. has been diagnosed with malignancy in the wound.

          2. has untreated osteomyelitis.

          3. has an untreated systemic infection.

          4. has active cellulitis in the periwound area.

          5. has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to study materials: collagenase ointment,
             dressing(s), and/or dressing components such as acrylic adhesives or polyurethane.

          6. has, in the opinion of the investigator, a clinically significant condition that would
             impair the Subject's ability to comply with the study procedures.

          7. has had radiation directly to the wound area.

          8. has been diagnosed with a major vascular deficit limiting arterial inflow to the wound
             region, as determined by the Investigator's interpretation of the Subject's medical
             history.

          9. has eschar in the wound that cannot be removed by bedside sharp and/or mechanical
             debridement.

         10. is participating in another interventional clinical trial for the duration of the
             study.

         11. has unexplored fistulas in the wound or fistulas in the wound that connect to other
             body cavities.

         12. has a wound with any tunneling present.

         13. has inadequate hemostasis at the wound site, as determined by the investigator.
