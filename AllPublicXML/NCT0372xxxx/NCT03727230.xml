    <textblock>
      Red blood cells (RBCs) from &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL blood group express very weak RhD antigen and
      commonly regarded as RhD negative (D-). Until now, &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL patients still be treated
      as rare D- patients in clinic. Previous study from the &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL pregnant women with D+
      fetus showed no occurrence of alloanti-D immunization. This phenomenon, however, does not
      directly applicable for &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL patients receiving D+ blood transfusions, as
      different immunologic status between the pregnant women and patients may exist.

      In this study, to the patients identified with &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL phenotype and genotype, D+
      blood was transfused and then alloanti-D immunization was prospectively observed.

    <textblock>
      Red blood cells (RBCs) from &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL blood group express very weak RhD antigen and
      commonly regarded as RhD negative (D-). In the East and Southeast Asian populations, 9-30% D-
      individuals are &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL. Nowadays, &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL patients are conventionally
      transfused with D- RBC, which are difficult to organize based on the rarity of D- donors in
      our regions (0.3%).

      However, our previous study demonstrated that &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL pregnant women with D+ fetus
      did not develop alloanti-D during the pregnancy. Latter, this phenomenon was confirmed by
      different medical centers in China. Accordingly, &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL patients may also not be
      able to produce alloanti-D after transfusion with D+ RBC and consequently the use of D- RBC
      for the transfusion management of these patients may superfluous. However, this hypothesis
      needs to be carefully proved.

      In this study, we were able to verify this assumption. From October 2016 to October 2019,
      blood samples from 1264 Chinese patients with a primary D- phenotype from the hospitals in
      China were typed for &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL blood group in the Guangzhou Blood Center. DEL
      phenotyping was performed by the serological adsorption/elution antibody testing and
      genotyping for the &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL specific allele (RHD*1227A) using a new developed
      high-resolution melting (HRM) approach. Then, transfusions of D+ RBC were prepared for the
      cohort of &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL patients. After &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL patients received D+ blood
      transfusion, the follow-up antibody screening test was conducted to evaluate the alloanti-D
      immunization.

    <measure>No occurrence of alloanti-D immunization in 33 &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL recipients transfused with D+ blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Around 6 months after transfusion of D+ if possible</time_frame>
    <description>For the 41 Chinese &quot;Asia type&quot; recipients identified by the serological adsorption/elution test and HRM genotyping analysis, the new blood samples from the patients were obtained from the 33 recipients after transfusion of D+ blood. The clinical significant alloantibodies against the common antigens of red blood cell were tested by antibody screening test. And the antibody screening test was performed using reagent cells (REAGENS, Budapest, Hungary) in saline by the tube method and an indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) with the DG Gel Coombs card (Diagnostic Grifols, Barcelona, Spain). Meanwhile, RhCE and &quot;Asia type&quot; DEL typing were also repeated. Then, the result showed that no alloantibody including alloanti-D was identified in all 33 recipients.</description>
