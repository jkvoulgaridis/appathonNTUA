      HepQuant is an assay to measure liver function in other forms of liver disease such as
      hepatitis C. It measures the ability of the liver to process an naturally occurring substance
      called cholate and has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in some patient populations.

      The Fontan survivor is a patient who has undergone surgery or a series of surgeries that
      result in a functional single ventricle. The liver is particularly vulnerable to disease
      including congestion, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis. Currently liver function in the Fontan is
      not well-characterized and the HepQuant assay could help answer this question.

    <textblock>
      A novel test called HepQuant® is an assay that has been used to measure liver function in
      other types of liver disease. In these populations, it is hoped that the assay may show more
      subtle or sub-clinical liver abnormalities that blood tests alone cannot detect. HepQuant® is
      a test that examines the ability of the liver to process a substance called cholate, which is
      a naturally occurring substance in the body. Cholate gets to the liver 2 ways: through the
      gut (by mouth) or through the blood (IV or intravenous). The test involves administering oral
      and IV cholate which is labeled. This label is NOT radioactive, but can act as an
      indicator/marker for evaluation purposes.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a reliable means of measuring liver function in the
      Fontan survivor by examining cholate clearance. The investigators aim to 1) explore any
      association between level of cholate clearance and measurement of heart and liver function
      and 2) determine whether cholate clearance can predict clinical outcomes such as heart
      failure, ascites (development of fluid in the abdomen which can result from heart failure or
      liver failure), and need for heart transplant.
