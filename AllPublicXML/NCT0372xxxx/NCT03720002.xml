      This is a phase I-II study with the herbal formulation (HF2) for treatment of active
      ulcerative colitis

      This will be a two-stage study:

      Stage 1 will comprise an open label single arm exploratory study of 10 active ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients investigating oral HF2 therapy for induction of remission in
      outpatients with active UC. Active disease is defined as (SCCAI) score ≥5 and a score of ≥2
      in the modified Mayo endoscopic sub-score. Clinical remission is defined as a SCCAI score of
      ≤2 The patients will receive HF2 therapy for 4 weeks. Stage 2: If clinical response (defined
      as a drop of ≥3 points of the SCCAI score ) is achieved in ≥ 3 patients and no significant
      safety signals will emerge, the investigators will proceed to a prospective pilot randomized
      placebo-controlled study.Patients will be randomized into one of two arms: HF2 once daily or
      placebo formulation (2:1 proportion) for 4 weeks.

      The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients in clinical remission at week 4 after
      initiation of therapy.

      1.1 Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of HF2 to induce remission in patients
      with active UC.

      1.2 Methods:

      This will be a two-stage study:

      Stage 1 will comprise an open label single arm exploratory study of 10 active UC patients
      investigating HF2 therapy for induction of remission in outpatients with active UC.

      Stage 2: If clinical response is achieved in ≥ 3 patients and no significant safety signals
      will emerge, the investigators will proceed to a prospective pilot randomized
      placebo-controlled study.

      Stage 1: Open label study

      1.7 Primary outcome: The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients in clinical
      remission (SCCAI score of ≤2) at week 4 after initiation of therapy

      Secondary outcomes:

      1.7.1 The percentage of patients who had a rapid clinical response at day 7 after induction
      of therapy 1.7.2 The percentage of patients who had a clinical response at week 4 after
      initiation of therapy 1.7.3 Improvement in endoscopic score at week 4 compared to baseline
      according to modified endoscopic Mayo score (improvement of ≥ 1 point) 1.7.4 Achievement of
      mucosal healing (endoscopic modified Mayo score of ≤1). 1.7.5 Percentage of patients who
      achieve normalization and/or &gt;50% improvement in C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or calprotectin
      levels (computed out of patients with abnormal values at baseline for these indices).

      1.7.6 Time-to-response defined as number of days to achieve a drop of ≥3 points of the SCCAI
      score.

      1.7.7. Time-to-ceasing of bleeding, defined as number of days for complete absence of blood
      in stools (SCCAI bleeding sub-score of 0), in those patients who has at least some blood in
      stool at entry (SCCAI bleeding sub-score of 1 or more).

      1.7.8 The percentage of patients in clinical remission at day 7 after induction of therapy.

      1.7.9. Improvement in IBD quality of life as gauged by questionnaire (IBDQ). 2 Intervention:
      Patients diagnosed with active UC will receive HF2 therapy for 4 weeks. 3 Procedures: 3.2 At
      inclusion: clinical and endoscopic assessment, blood and stool tests, cardiac echo and liver
      ultrasonography 3.4 clinical and endoscopic assessment, blood and stool tests, cardiac echo
      and liver ultrasonography

      Stage II: A multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial. The study will be performed in
      Sheba Medical Center and up to 2 additional European centers (TBD). For this stage of the
      trial , the patients will received HF2 combintation or similar (as described above) (2:1
      allocation) for 8 weeks. After completion of 8 weeks, all responders previously on active
      drug will receive additional 8 weeks of oral curcumin or placebo as per original arm.

      6.2. Intervention: Patients will be randomized into one of two arms: HF2 or placebo
      formulation (2:1 proportion) for 8 weeks. Following the first 8 weeks, responders w ill
      receive an additional 8 weeks of curcumin 1.5 g/d or placebo (as per original arm).

      Patients will undergo clinical, laboratory (CRP, biomarkers, blood chemistry, CBC_biomarker
      (CRP and fecal calprotectin, at week 0,4,8 and 16 , and endoscopic assessment at baseline and
      week 8. Cardiac echo and liver US will be performed at week 0 and 8.

      Corticosteroid tapering will be allowed as per treating physician's discretion after week 8.
