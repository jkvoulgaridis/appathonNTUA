    <textblock>
      This study will be undertaken to compare the respiratory and analgesic effects of thoracic
      epidural versus ultrasound guided rectus sheath block analgesia after elective abdominal
      surgery with midline incision.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major proportion of pain experienced by patients undergoing abdominal surgeries is due to
      somatic pain signals derived from the abdominal wall. The central portion of anterior
      abdominal wall components (skin, muscles and parietal peritoneum) is innervated by sensory
      neurons branching from the anterior rami of spinal nerves T7 to T1. These neurons lie between
      the rectus abdominis muscle and posterior rectus sheath, and pierce the rectus muscle close
      to the midline. The tendinous intersections of the rectus muscle do not fuse with the
      posterior rectus sheath, thereby allowing the injectate to spread cephalo-caudally within
      this potential space. Rectus sheath (RS) block has been described for any midline abdominal
      incisions (epigastric and umbilical hernia repairs). As visceral pain becomes attenuated by
      the 2nd postoperative day, rectus sheath block can also be administered for midline
      laparotomy.

      As a single bolus of the local anesthetic has a maximum duration of 12 hours. it is necessary
      to insert a catheter into this space to allow either a continuous infusion of local
      anesthetic, or repeated boluses of local anesthetic every 8 to 12 hours for 48 to 72 hours
      post-operatively.

      However, the effects of rectus sheath block catheter analgesia on the respiratory function
      after abdominal surgery with midline incisions are still under investigation.

    <description>The measurements of diaphragmatic motion will be attained at the posterior surface of the diaphragm. From the tracings on M-mode, the distance between echogenic lines (DIA) in centimeters and diaphragmatic inspiratory/expiratory velocity in centimeters/second during quiet, deep, and sniff breathing will be measured on the frozen images.</description>

    <description>Verbal rating pain scale (VRS) (Ranging from 0 to 4), where 0=no pain, 1=mild pain, 2=moderate pain, 3=severe pain and lastly 4 =excruciating pain) will be recorded at rest and upon patient coughing; on admission to PACU (baseline), and 2, 4, 6, 12, and 48h postoperatively.</description>

    <description>Measurements of Forced vital capacity (FVC) will be measured by the use of hand-held spirometer (One-flowÂ®, Clement Clarke, U.K). At each assessment, the largest values of FVC will be recorded.</description>
