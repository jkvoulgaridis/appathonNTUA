  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase 2 study is to determine the optimal dose of ALS-L1023 by
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of ALS-L1023 comparing with placebo when used in
      combination with Ranibizumab for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration(AMD).

      The study is designed as multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-arm
      parallel-group phase 2 study in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

      This study consists of two separate phases: a loading phase and a PRN(pro re nata) phase.

      Once the subject provides a written informed consent, subject information including
      demographics, medical history, and concomitant medications will be collected, and only those
      who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will participate in the study.

      All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be randomized into three groups Group A
      (Ranibizumab 0.5mg &amp; ALS-L1023 600mg) or Group B (Ranibizumab 0.5mg &amp; ALS-L1023 1200mg) or
      Group C (Ranibizumab &amp; placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by whether
      or not the subject has PCV(polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) confirmed at Screening test.

      During the 3-month loading phase, all subjects will receive a Ranibizumab 0.5mg injection
      into the vitreous every month and take either the placebo or ALS-L1023 orally twice a day.
      During the following 3-12 month PRN phase, subjects will continue to take the placebo or
      ALS-L1023 in the same frequency as above but receive Ranibizumab injection only when it meets
      retreatment criteria. Subjects must instill antibacterial eye drops three times a day for
      three days after Ranibizumab injection.

      Subjects will visit the study site monthly during the 12 month study period in order to
      receive scheduled assessments and evaluate safety and efficacy of treatment. Image
      interpretation will be performed by a central reading center. The central reading center will
      confirm eligibility for enrollment and the discrimination of Polypoidal Choroidal
      Vasculopathy(PCV) at screening and play a role in interpreting whole images of all subjects
      after the end of the study.
