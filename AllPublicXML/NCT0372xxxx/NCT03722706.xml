  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational handbook
      for parents of children with atopic dermatitis (AD) in improving clinical outcomes for
      pediatric patients with AD and their parents. The handbook was developed by an
      interdisciplinary team of healthcare providers to facilitate therapeutic patient education as
      a routine component of care for pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Patient
      education is an important element of practice management guidelines for AD, particularly
      given complex treatment plans and high rates of non-adherence in this population. Parents of
      children with AD will be randomized into either the handbook arm (handbook provided as an
      adjunct to standard AD management with a healthcare provider at Boston Children's Hospital)
      or the control arm (standard management alone). Participants will complete study measures at
      two time points: baseline (prior to a clinic visit appointment for AD care at Boston
      Children's Hospital), and 3-month follow-up. Data will be analyzed for change on study
      outcome measures (AD symptoms, AD severity, quality of life) and satisfaction with the
      handbook.

    <description>The intervention being evaluated in this study is an educational handbook for parents of children with atopic dermatitis (AD). The handbook was developed and written by the interdisciplinary study team (psychologist, allergist, nurse practitioner, dermatologists, primary care physician, dietitian). Content was based on practice guidelines for AD management, consensus recommendations for therapeutic patient education for AD, and clinical experience of our study team. Content includes topics central to effective AD management, such as pathophysiology/course, elements of treatment plans, and strategies to improve quality of life, such as breaking the itch-scratch cycle, improving sleep, and coping with social-emotional issues.</description>
