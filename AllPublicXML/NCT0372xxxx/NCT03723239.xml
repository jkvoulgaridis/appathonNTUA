  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TricValve® Transcatheter Bicaval Valves System is indicated for relief of tricuspid
      insufficiency in patients with symptomatic heart disease who are judged by a heart team,
      including a cardiac surgeon, to be at extreme risk or inoperable for open surgical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TricValve® Transcatheter Bicaval Valves is a system of two self-expanding biological valves
      for the treatment of patients with hemodynamically relevant tricuspid insufficiency and caval
      reflux. The prostheses are implanted percutaneously into the inferior and superior vena cava
      without disturbing the native tricuspid valve. It is especially intended for use for patients
      at extreme risk or who are inoperable for open surgical therapy.

      Pre-Clinical and Clinical preliminary studies have shown an acceptable safety and performance
      profile of the TricValve® Transcatheter Bicaval Valves System. Given that the medical device
      is a potential long-term treatment for patients with tricuspid insufficiency, clinical data
      for long-term treatment periods is necessary. Thus, the current study is designed to
      investigate the safety and performance for at least 30 days and up to 5 years.

      The study has been approved by the Kaunas Regional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee.
