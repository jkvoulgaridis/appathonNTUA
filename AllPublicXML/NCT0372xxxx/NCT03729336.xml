  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urine culture and microscopic urinalysis will be compared between 2 collection methods: PEEZY
      midstream urine collection, and urethral catheter collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female patients presenting to the Baylor Scott &amp; White Health (Temple, TX) Urology clinic for
      complaints of lower urinary tract symptoms will be included. They will be approached by a
      clinical research coordinator and given more information. If they meet eligibility by
      screening, consents will be completed.

      Patients will proceed with their regular clinic visit with their clinician. Just prior to the
      physical exam, patients will use the PEEZY device to give a urine specimen in the privacy of
      the bathroom. The package with PEEZY includes the simple instructions for use. Patients
      return to the clinic room and the physical exam proceeds. An in-and-out catheter is used to
      obtain a post-void residual as well as a control urine specimen. After the remainder of the
      patient routine exam is complete, they will fill out a brief questionnaire.

      The 2 specimens will then be delivered to the lab. The clinical research coordinator will
      store consents and questionnaires that include the subjects study identification number in
      individual opaque envelopes that will be kept in a locked drawer accessible to only the
      investigators.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contamination of urine specimen with urethral and vaginal flora</measure>
    <time_frame>2 specimens from each subject (1 from each arm) will be taken to the lab for urinalysis and culture immediately after specimens are given. Culture results will be reported in 48 hours. After results are recorded, no further assessment of this outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Contamination defined as: presence of urethral or vaginal flora on urine culture OR epithelial cell presence in urinalysis</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (this is the only title for this scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Performed one time immediately after intervention. This will not be repeated.</time_frame>
    <description>On a questionnaire: patient rates level of distress experienced during each urine donation method. The scale is from 1 to 10. On this scale 10 is associated with the word &quot;agonizing&quot;, 8 is associated with &quot;horrible&quot;, 4 is associated with &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, 2 is associated with &quot;annoying&quot;, and 0 is associated with &quot;None&quot;. Unbearable distress is marked near 10. No distress is marked near 0. On this scale responses can only be reported as a number from 0-10, and a lower number indicates a better outcome. There are no subscales.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Performed one time immediately after intervention. This will not be repeated.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire created by investigator asks: Which way would you prefer to give a urine sample, if needed in the future? PEEZY or catheter.</description>
