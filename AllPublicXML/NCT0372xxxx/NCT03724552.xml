  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 8-week open-label study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and
      efficacy of Transcranial LED Therapy in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The
      investigators propose to enroll up to 30 subjects of both genders ages 18-59 years with
      intact intellectual functions who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

      Participation requires treatment sessions at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) twice
      weekly for eight weeks, totaling 16 visits. Each session lasts approximately 45 minutes.
      During the treatment session, the subject will lie down comfortably on an exam bed. Subjects
      will also be asked to complete a series of self-report questionnaires related to their
      symptoms and quality of life.

    <description>Reduction in ASD symptoms as measured by change from baseline on the clinician-rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2) scale.The SRS-2 identifies social impairment associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders and quantifies its severity across the lifespan. A lower score on the SRS-2 indicates a reduction in ASD symptoms. (Minimum score=0, Maximum score= 195).</description>

    <measure>Reduction in ASD Symptoms (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in ASD symptoms as measured by change from baseline on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement scales. The clinician-rated CGI can make an expert clinical global judgment about the severity of the illness (ASD) across various time points within the context of that clinical experience. A higher score CGI-improvement score indicates more improvement and therefore a reduction in ASD symptoms. (Minimum score=1, Maximum score=7).</description>
