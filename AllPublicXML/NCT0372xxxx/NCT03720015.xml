      A case control study with before-after design. A concurrent training and a nutritional
      management intervention was offered by a patient with head and neck cancer, in order to
      compare outcomes related to strength and endurance performance and to body composition

      Cancer causes important public health problems around the world and it is one of the most
      frequent cause of death overall. Among non-pharmacological treatment, physical exercise has
      shown improvements in different types of cancer and patients, but it is important to define
      the optimal dose. Our aim is to determine the effects of a concurrent training program and a
      nutritional management developed during radiotherapy treatment on physical performance and
      body composition. A patient with an oral cavity cancer will develop three sessions per week
      of concurrent training: resistance training included 9 standard exercises involving major
      muscle groups (4x8-12 RM), and cardiovascular training included a High-Intensity Interval
      Training (HIIT). Nutritional management will include a diet controlling macronutrients
      (~4g/kg/day for carbohidrates, ~2g/kg/day for proteins, and ~1g/kg/day for fats), along with
      some nutritional supplements such as beta-hydroxybeta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine,
      glutamine, omega-3 fish oil concentrate, and BCAA's during training sessions. Intervention
      took place during radiotherapy period (7 weeks). We expect that body composition will remain
      invariable, and 1RM will increased. VO2max is expected to be almost the same, but intensity
      tolerated at maximum VO2max could be higher. If our results confirm that, we could conclude
      that a combination between resistance exercise and HIIT along with a nutritional management
      developed during radiotherapy could be effective to prevent muscle mass loss and muscle
      function decrease in a young patient with oral cavity cancer.

    <description>Three sessions per week of concurrent training during radiotherapy period. Each session will begin with warm-up (5-min cardiovascular activity at low-moderate intensity, joint mobility and one set of resistance exercises circuit at 30-40% 1RM). Resistance training will follow the warm-up, including 9 standard exercises involving major muscle groups of the lower and upper body: vertical bench press, parallel bar dip for triceps, seated rowing, standing dumbbell curl for biceps, leg press, deadlift and shoulder press. All these exercises will be realized following circuit training with 4 sets of 8-12 repetitions, using a training load of 70-80% RM. When patient will able to complete more than 12 repetitions, load will be increased progressively 10%. Cardiovascular training will be completed 20-30 min after resistance training, and it will include High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) of 3 min near to the second ventilatory threshold and 2 min near to the first ventilatory threshold.</description>

    <description>Prescribed diet controlling macronutrients according to patient body weight (~4g/kg/day for carbohidrates, ~2g/kg/day for proteins, and ~1g/kg/day for fats). Patient will take one single dosage per day of probiotics (Arkoprobiotics® Defenses), 1 or 2 capsules of omega-3 fish oil concentrate (Solgar®, 600-1200mg depending on fat sources intake during the day), and a combine ingestion of 3g beta-hydroxybeta-methylbutyrate (HMB), 14g arginine, and 14g glutamine (HSN Raw Series®, all pure ingredients and making the ingestion adding each of them individually in a solution with 300-400 ml of water). During concurrent training sessions, between resistance exercise and HIIT, patient will also take 6g of BCAA's (HSN Raw Series®, 2:1:1) along with a banana. Additionally, patient could take whey isolated protein (Amix® IsoPrime CFM) to meet with some of the prescribed proteins intakes.</description>
