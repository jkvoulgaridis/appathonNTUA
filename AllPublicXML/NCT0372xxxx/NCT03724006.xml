  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common congenital malformations. Despite the
      progress made in the last decades in diagnosis and treatment, CHD continues to be associated
      with significant morbidity and mortality. Several studies have shown a reduction in the
      quality of life (QoL) of parents of children with CHD, which may affect children too. The
      main research aim is to assess and to understand the impact of a psychoeducational
      intervention in QoL of parents with newborns with CHD.

      We are including parents of inpatient newborns in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of
      Centro Materno Pediátrico (CMP) - Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João (CHUSJ) with
      the diagnosis of CHD, between March 2019 and February 2021. We also included parents of
      newborns born at CMP with the diagnosis of non-syndromic CHD, not admited in NICU, between
      September 2019 and February 2020. The inclusion criteria are: I) parents of newborns (up to
      28 days) with the diagnosis of non- syndromic CHD; II) newborns hospitalized in CMP-CHUSJ;
      III) parents aged ≥ 18 years. Parents of newborns with other important co-morbidities
      associated with CHD and those who do not have good understanding and expression in Portuguese
      will be excluded.

      Parents will be divided in 2 study groups: INTERVENTION group (I) and CONTROL group (C).
      Group I will receive a psychoeducational intervention in addition to the usual routines of
      the Service. Group C will receive the usual routines of the Service. The psychoeducational
      intervention, which consists of 2 sessions lasting 90 minutes each one, will be performed as
      soon as possible after inclusion in the study. Participants will be evaluated in three
      moments: M1 beginning of the study; M2 4 weeks after the intervention (I) or after enrollment
      (C) and M3 16 weeks after intervention/enrollment. The primary outcome will be parental QoL,
      which will be evaluated through the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref
      (WHOQOL-Bref). The family impact and the perception of positive contributions will be
      secondary outcomes. These outcome variables will be assessed by the Impact on Family Scale
      and the Positive Contributions Scale - Kansas Inventory of Parental Perceptions,
      respectively. A semi-structured interview will be performed after all quantitative data have
      been collected.

      The authors expect to find an increase of QoL and positive contributions and a decrease of
      family impact in the intervention group comparatively to the control group.

    <description>Changes on parental quality of life assessed through World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQOL-Bref). The WHOQOL-Bref instrument is composed by 26 items, which are organized in 4 specific domains: Physical (7 items), Psychological (6 items), Social Relationships (3 items), Environment (8 items) and a general QoL facet (2 items). All items are quoted from 1 to 5. Three items, related to questions posed negatively (Q3, Q4 and Q26), must be reversed (the calculation implies the subtraction of their value to six units). The results are transformed on a scale of 0 to 100. Each domain score is computed through the formula: [(sum of all items - number of items) / (4x number of items)] x 100. Higher scores correspond to better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Changes on family impact assessed through Revised Impact on Family Scale. Impact on Family Scale evaluates the parents' perception of the impact of the child's chronic health condition in family life. Revised Impact on Family Scale contains 15 items. It is a unidimensional scale that scores overall family impact. This score results from sum of all item responses. The result ranges from 15 to 60. Higher scores are indicative of perceived higher family impact associated with child's health condition.</description>

    <description>Changes on perception positive contributions assessed through Positive Contributions Scale - Kansas Inventory of Parental Perceptions. The Portuguese version of the Positive Contributions Scale - Kansas Inventory of Parental Perceptions is composed by 43 items that assessed 6 dimensions/subscales: 1) Source of Personal Growth and Future Consciousness; 2) Source of Learning Out of Experience; 3) Source of Acceptance and Family Cohesion; 4) Source of Happiness and Affection; 5) Source of Spirituality and 6) Source of Social Network Expansion. The scores of the subscales are computed by the average of the items that composes them. Higher scores indicate a perception of greater positive contributions in the different dimensions.</description>

    <description>The intervention, prepared by a multidisciplinary team, will consist of two 90 minutes collective sessions (max. 8 families). Sessions will consist of lectures, group discussion and relaxation. The program includes content on the effects of a diagnosis of a congenital anomaly on a child in the parents and in the family, stages of mourning, adaptation process, coping strategies, legislative framework and social protection. This is a non-specific intervention for CHD, where the main focus is the diagnosis of a congenital anomaly.
In second session, written support material will be distributed. Participants will be asked to practice relaxation in the next 4 weeks.</description>
