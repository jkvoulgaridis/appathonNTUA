      The reported high level of stress among dental students and its consequences, considering the
      known benefits of background music. This study was designed to evaluate students' level of
      stress and impact of background music on their efficiency of work, performance and learning
      ability during pre-clinical lab.

      METHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional questionnaire study, 61 preclinical students from the
      college of dentistry, Ajman university-Fujairah campus who met the defined inclusion criteria
      participated.

      After a semester of the normal lab without BM (Background Music), various genres of BM were
      introduced in the lab. Psychological stress assessment was done using P.S.S (Perceived Stress
      Scale).Students were asked to fill up a written feedback questionnaire at the end of six
      weeks of BM. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used in order to study the
      statistical relationships among groups.

    <description>students were involved in the pre-clinical prosthodontic lab. Participation in these labs were mandatory and it involved crown and bridge preparations on typodont models. There were 2 sessions of these labs per week, one for each gender. Each session lasted for 3 hours.
The study was conducted in 2 phases. At the beginning of the first phase of the study, the labs were conducted without any BM for 4 weeks. PSS(perceived stress scale), a standardized and validated, self-reporting international test was used for measuring the level of psychological stress were administered to all participants.</description>
