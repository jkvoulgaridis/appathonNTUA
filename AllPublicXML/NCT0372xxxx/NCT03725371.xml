      This study investigates the psychophysiological correlations of aggression and response to
      aversive stimuli in a population of 133 children clinically diagnosed with conduct disorder
      (CD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Data was gathered about
      participants' level of aggression through the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire
      (RPQ). The stimuli that were presented to the participants included 1) a loud sound, 2)
      threatening photographs from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), and 3) the
      Trier Social Stress Task (TSST). Participants' psychophysiological features of heart rate and
      galvanic skin conductance were measured and analyzed in relation to their RPQ scores and
      clinical diagnosis.

        hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, i.e. combined type or ADHD predominantly inattentive type or
