  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is little evidence on the effect of a nickel-free diet on gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). We hope to determine if a nickel-free diet improves GERD symptoms in patients
      with a nickel allergy by having patients complete a questionnaire on their GERD symptoms
      before and after initiation of 8 weeks on a nickel-free diet.
