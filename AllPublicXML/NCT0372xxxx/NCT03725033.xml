      Purpose of the study:

    <textblock>
      Design is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in
      parallel groups.

      The study will include outpatients adults aged 18 to 70 years with impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT) who did not receive glucose-lowering agents previously. Persons with pre-diabetes,
      obesity (especially with visceral or abdominal obesity), dyslipidemia (with high
      triglycerides and/or low-density lipoproteins), hypertension, diabetes in first-degree
      relatives will be considered as potential candidates to participate in the study.

      After the patient's information sheet and the form of informed consent for participation in
      the study are signed on the screening (visit 0; day from -7 to 0), complaints and history are
      collected, registration of concomitant conditions and diseases, objective examination,
      calculation of body mass index (BMI), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting blood
      glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), biochemistry, and urinalysis will be performed.
      Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age will be performed.

      If eligibility criteria are met and there are no non-inclusion criteria on Visit 1 (Day 1),
      the patient is randomized to one of two groups: the Subetta group (patients will take 2
      tablets twice a day for 12 weeks) or placebo group (patients will take a placebo according to
      the scheme of Subetta for 12 weeks).

      In the course of the study, two more visits in 4 (Visit 2) and 12 (Visit 3) weeks are
      planned, during these weeks complaints are recorded, a patient's examination is recorded,
      therapy compliance and safety are assessed. On Visit 3, OGTT, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c,
      biochemistry, and urinalysis will be performed.
