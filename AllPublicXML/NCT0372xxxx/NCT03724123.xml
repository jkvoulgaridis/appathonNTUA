  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Machine learning methods potentially provide a highly accurate and detailed assessment of
      expected individual patient risk before elective cardiac surgery. Correct anticipation of
      this risk allows for improved counseling of patients and avoidance of possible complications.
      The investigators therefore investigate the benefit of modern machine learning methods in
      personalized risk prediction in patients undergoing elective heart valve surgery.

      The investigators performe a monocentric retrospective study in patients who underwent
      elective heart valve surgery between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014 at our center.
      The investigators use random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines
      to predict the 30-days mortality from a subset of demographic and preoperative parameters.
      Exclusion criteria were re-operation of the same patient, patients that needed anterograde
      cerebral perfusion due to aortic arch surgery, and patients with grown up congenital heart
      disease.
