  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of three specific odors on simulated
      driving performance. It is hypothesized that the presence of peppermint, rosemary, and
      zest/pulp will increase memory recall for navigation and improve reaction times for braking,
      compared to performance during unscented conditions

    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of scented odors on the attention and behavioral
      performance of healthy young adult and older adult drivers. Past research indicates that
      specific scented odors (i.e., peppermint and cinnamon) enhance motivation, performance and
      alertness, decrease fatigue and stimulate the central nervous system in a variety of
      contexts. The current study will examine the effect of three different odors on simulated
      driving as participants perform navigation and braking scenarios. This study will be the
      first of its kind to elucidate the association between specific scents and performance gains
      in simulated driving. The data will serve as proof-of-concept for eventual patient focused
      interventions relative to sensory stimulation and driving.

    <description>The navigation task will consist of up to six blocks of instruction/recall segments that will contain the same number of turns over the same distance, but with novel environmental stimuli and a randomized order of turns unique to each block.</description>
