  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple day
      dose of JNJ-67670187 compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase 1 randomized double-blind, placebo controlled multi dose study in
      up to 144 adult healthy volunteers. The safety, tolerability and impact on the microbiome
      following intake of oral dose of JNJ-67670187 for up to 14 days will be evaluated.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAEs are AEs which will occur between administration of study drug and 3 months or up to Day 84 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

             signs, and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening and at admission

          -  Be otherwise healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening
             and at admission. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant

          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening and a negative urine
             pregnancy test on day of admission

          -  Must have normal bowel movements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a positive serum pregnancy test at screening, a positive urine pregnancy test, or

          -  An active cigarette smoker or has quit cigarette smoking within the previous 6 months

          -  Has a positive urine toxicology screen at screening or at admission for substances of
             abuse including but not limited to cocaine, cannabinoids, amphetamines,
             benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants and methadone

          -  History of any clinically significant medical illness or medical disorders the
             investigator considers should exclude the participant, including (but not limited to),
             neuromuscular, hematological disease, immune deficiency state, respiratory disease,
             hepatic or gastrointestinal (GI) disease, neurological or psychiatric disease,
             ophthalmological disorders, neoplastic disease, renal or urinary tract diseases, or
             dermatological disease

          -  Has an active systemic or GI acute or chronic infection as determined by appropriate
             clinical screening and laboratory tests
