  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of a 14-day concomitant therapy for the
      third-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, and whether it is safe while
      maintaining an ideal eradication rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infects half of the world's population. H.pylori eradication is an
      effective approach to reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer. However, eradication
      rates of first-line therapy decreased over years due to the rapidly increasing antibiotic
      resistance of H. pylori worldwide. An ideal rescue therapeutic regimen to cure refractory
      H.pylori infection is currently warranted. Few published paper evaluated the efficacy of
      14-day furazolidone containing concomitant therapy in the third line treatment. This study
      aims to propose a new concomitant therapy for the patients with two or more treatment
      failure, and then evaluates whether adverse effects are tolerable. .

    <description>Both intention to treat(ITT) and per-protocol(PP) analyses will be used for the assessment of the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection. The ITT analysis includes all the patients who take at least one dose of the study medications. The PP analysis is limited to patients who take over 90% of the study medications and complete follow-up.</description>
