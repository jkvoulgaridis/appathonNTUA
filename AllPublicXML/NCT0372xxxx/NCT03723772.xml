  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the new long-acting insulin 287 with the marketed insulin glargine for
      use in type 1 diabetes. The study will test how insulin is taken up in your blood, how long
      it stays there and how the blood sugar is lowered. The participant will get both of the
      insulins in a random order. Insulin 287 is a new medicine while insulin glargine is already
      approved for the treatment of diabetes and can be prescribed by a doctor. The participant
      will get 8 weekly doses of insulin 287 and 14 daily doses of insulin glargine. There will
      also be a run-in period of 2 days to 4 weeks with daily doses of insulin glargine before you
      start the insulin 287 period. All doses will be injected under the skin. The study will last
      for about 16 to 24 weeks. The participant will have 27 visits with the study doctor.
