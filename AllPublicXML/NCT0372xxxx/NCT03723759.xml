  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at how five different formulations of faster aspart 200 U/mL reach and
      stay in the blood after injection. The purpose is to find a formulation that behaves
      similarly to the reference product called faster aspart 100 U/mL (marketed as FiaspÂ®). The
      participant will get all five formulations and the reference product. The order in which the
      participant gets them is decided by chance. The participant will get each medicine once
      during the study meaning that the participant will get a total of six injections with study
      medicine. The medicine will be injected under the skin in the stomach. The study will last
      for about 2 to 21 weeks depending on individual visit schedule. The participant will have
      nine clinic visits with the study doctor (including the one in which the participant give
      consent).
