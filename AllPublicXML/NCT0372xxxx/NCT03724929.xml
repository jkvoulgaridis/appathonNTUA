    <textblock>
      Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the heterodimer α4β7 integrin and
      which has shown its efficacy in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) by inducing and maintaining clinical
      response/remission. The French marketing authorization was obtained for Ulcerative Colitis in
      patients in failure with anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) agents. In the pivotal study,
      correlation between drug levels and clinical response during induction and maintenance
      therapy were reported. Moreover, in 3.7% of cases, anti-vedolizumab antibodies were reported
      during the time-course and 1% had samples that were persistently positive. Up to now, data on
      the pharmacologic VDZ parameters are scarce and the relationships as well as the predictive
      value of the measurement of VDZ concentrations and VDZ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) during
      the induction and maintenance phases remains unknown. It could be of paramount interest to
      early identify UC patients under VDZ who will be responders to VDZ induction and to identify
      those who will achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with VDZ.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of the pharmacokinetic studies of monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF antibodies
      currently) has assumed increasing importance of its use in clinical practice. Therapeutic
      algorithms for both Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) have been published and are used by
      many expert teams in the event of loss of therapeutic response. Similarly, the concentrations
      are assuming important in the indication of therapeutic de-escalation. Lastly, the assays may
      predict medium-term therapeutic response to treatment and thus enable proposal of preventive
      therapeutic changes (5). The Gemini 1 study (phase 3 vedolizumab vs. placebo in Ulcerative
      Colitis) showed a correlation between drug levels and clinical response during induction and
      maintenance therapy. Moreover, in 3.7% of cases, anti-vedolizumab antibodies were reported
      during the time-course and 1% had samples that were persistently positive. (1). In addition,
      we have decided to assess the clinical response to VDZ induction at W10 (Week 10), as the
      Gemini III trial for Crohn Disease (Crohn Disease) have reported, among patients who had
      experienced previous Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonist failure, that 15% of those given
      vedolizumab versus 12% under placebo were in remission at W6 (P=0.433) whereas a higher
      proportion of them were in remission (26%) under VDZ when compared with the placebo arm (12%)
      at week 10. Therefore, in clinically non-responders at W10, an additional dose of 300 mg of
      VDZ will be infused at W10 and every four weeks.

    <description>To determine if the best cut-off points of vedolizumab (VDZ) trough levels measured at W6 capable to identify UC patients who will achieve a clinical response at week 10 with VDZ and also the best cut-off points of VDZ trough levels measured at W14 capable to identify UC patients who will achieve a clinical remission to maintenance therapy with VDZ :
Blood samples will be systematically collected at W0, W2, W6, W14 and W52 for vedolizumab pharmacokinetic parameters, including the vedolizumab trough levels and the specific anti-vedolizumab antibody. A supplementary blood sample will be collected at W10 which is the point where a significant greater number of patients were in remission.
Rectosigmoidoscopy will be performed in each center at time points W0, W10 and W52, to evaluate treatment efficacy.
In cases of loss of response, rectosigmoidoscopy will be performed before and four weeks after optimization.</description>
