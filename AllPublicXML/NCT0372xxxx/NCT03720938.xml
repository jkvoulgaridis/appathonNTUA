  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inactivity was reported to be high in children and considered to be the fourth common cause
      of death in all ages. The reason for children is usually the increasing indoor use of
      sedentary screen time. Active Video Games (AVG) have recently been introduced for decreasing
      the sedentary time for children and directing them to physical activity (PA) at home.The aim
      of this study is to show the quantitative effect of games on physical fitness parameters like
      weight, body mass index (BMI) and fat ratio (FR). The study also aims at the factors for
      motivation or continuance of the games as self-perception and enjoyment levels together with
      qualitative effects of games on satisfaction and attitude changes in inactive children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research related a causal association between inactivity, low esteem, and excess weight for
      children. For this reason, academic performance decreases and obesity associated diseases
      such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart diseases, depression, and cancer might ensue.
      Children usually do not prefer to perform outdoor PA due to several causes including low
      sense of self perception.

      So far studies have shown an almost equivalent energy spent through AVGs to the physical
      activity of moderate intensity. Games have been previously demonstrated to prevent excess
      weight. There were no studies of AVG in children with varying weights, inactivity and
      technology preoccupation. Similarly, no qualitative research of AVG in children exploring
      enjoyment levels and attitude changes were encountered.

      Thus, the investigators aim to find the quantitative effect of AVG on physical fitness
      parameters like weight, BMI and FR. Other aims are studying factors for motivation or
      continuance of the games as well as the feelings and perspectives of the participant
      children's parents for the games.

      <recruitment_details>Four primary public schools among 14 in the central schools of Bolu region were randomly selected. In January to February of year 2013, all children (n=1300) from grades III,IV,V and VI were given froms for participation.Children positively responded to informed consent forms (n=918) were accepted as eligible for the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The discrepancy between the enrolled (918) and assigned (n=106) numbers of children could be attributed to strict &quot;inclusion&quot; and &quot;exclusion&quot; criteria, and particularly to dropped out children due to technological preoocupation and physical inactivity as well as problems interfering physical activity and self-perception.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>&quot;Technology preoccupied&quot; children were determined if children were using the computer for activities other than homework, for at least 7 h or more in a week, watching television for 3 h or more in a day, playing video games for 5 h or more in a week in addition to the parental definition of the children as preoccupied with technology.
Similarly, &quot;physically inactive&quot; children were defined as having activity scores less than 1.56 by Ekelund Criteria. Activity scores were calculated by dividing daily energy consumptions by basal metabolic rates described previously methods.</description>

        <title>Enjoyment Levels of Genders From Sports Category in the Game Group by Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES-SF)</title>
        <description>For Sports category, there were 5 games of boxing, tennis, golf, baseball, and bowling. Thus, each child was evaluated after every single game by five bipolar scale questions. Questions 1 and 4 were starting from positive to negative answers (left to right) and scored as 7-1. Scale scores were determined by calculating the mean. All scale scores were summed to calculate the Category score. The higher the score, the better the enjoyment in this category.
Min-Max Sports Category scores were 11-25 for females and 17.8-26.2 for males.</description>
        <time_frame>After every game during 12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Enjoyment levels only in the intervention group were assessed since control group did not play the games of interest.</population>

          <title>Enjoyment Levels of Genders From Sports Category in the Game Group by Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES-SF)</title>
          <description>For Sports category, there were 5 games of boxing, tennis, golf, baseball, and bowling. Thus, each child was evaluated after every single game by five bipolar scale questions. Questions 1 and 4 were starting from positive to negative answers (left to right) and scored as 7-1. Scale scores were determined by calculating the mean. All scale scores were summed to calculate the Category score. The higher the score, the better the enjoyment in this category.
Min-Max Sports Category scores were 11-25 for females and 17.8-26.2 for males.</description>
          <population>Enjoyment levels only in the intervention group were assessed since control group did not play the games of interest.</population>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Conforming strictly to the rules of CONSORT extension for such &quot;well controlled&quot; studies when clustering with huge numbers of clusters without the risk of contamination might be impossible and unnecessary in small research areas like the city, Bolu.</limitations_and_caveats>
