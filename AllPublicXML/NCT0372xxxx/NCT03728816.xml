  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to understand the clinical characteristics, etiology and resistance
      phenotype of major pathogens of SCAP in China through multicenter and prospective
      investigation. Thus to provide epidemiological basis for improving the SCAP diagnosis and
      treatment protocol suitable for China.

    <textblock>
      During the study period, all patients who are diagnosed with SCAP and meet the inclusion
      criteria in the participating unit should be enrolled in the study . At the end of the trial,
      each participating unit should complete at least 20 qualified cases, and all participating
      units should have a total of more than 300 qualified cases.

        1. Learn about the etiology of SCAP in China.

        2. Grasp the resistance phenotype and molecular epidemiology of major pathogens of SCAP in
           China.

        3. Know the important clinical characteristics of SCAP in China, including age, basic
           diseases, length of hospital stay, length of stay in ICU, duration of mechanical
           ventilation, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, complications, mortality, etc.

        4. Analyze and clarify the clinical risk factors of affecting SCAP mortality.

        5. Understand the current situation of antibiotic treatment of SCAP in China.
