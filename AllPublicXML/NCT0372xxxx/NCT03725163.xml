  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of providing
      treatment for adolescents with trichotillomania through the use of telehealth. Parent or
      legal guardians' psychological flexibility scores will be assessed to determine if their
      levels of flexibility potentially moderate treatment outcomes.

      The study will test the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: Telepsychotherapy will result in significantly better trichotillomania symptom
      outcomes for adolescents than a waitlist control condition.

      Hypothesis 2: Telepsychotherapy will result in significantly better psychological flexibility
      outcomes for adolescents than a waitlist control condition.

      Hypothesis 3: Telepsychotherapy will result in significantly better overall wellbeing
      outcomes for adolescents than a waitlist control condition.

      Hypothesis 4: Within-group changes (that include both conditions following treatment) will be
      significant from pre-treatment to post-treatment and will not significantly differ from
      post-treatment at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up.

      The investigators of this study plan to recruit 60 participants, 30 adolescents and 30
      parents or legal guardians. This number will provide adequate power (0.70) to detect a large
      effect size (d=.81). All portions of this study will be completed online using
      teleconferencing software, Zoom (similar to Skype).

      Participants will be randomized into either a treatment or waitlist control group. All
      participants will receive treatment, however, those in the waitlist group will wait 12 weeks
      before beginning treatment. Treatment will consist of 10, 50 minute sessions with up to six
      short (10-15 minute) booster sessions during a three-month period following treatment.
      Participants and parents/guardians will complete full assessment batteries at intake,
      post-waitlist (only those in the waitlist condition), post-treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months
      following treatment. Moreover, adolescent participants will be asked to track their daily
      pulling behavior each day while in treatment(with parent/guardian help if desired). This will
      be done through the use of daily text message reminders using app.eztexting.com to the
      parent/guardian that will include a link to the short (less then 5 minute) Qualtrics survey.
      All treatment sessions will take place online using video conferencing software (i.e., Zoom).

      Parents/guardians will be invited to participate in the final 10 minutes of each session.
      This will allow for the adolescent to review what they have learned and also allow the
      parent/guardian to be involved in the fulfillment of treatment goals and to assist with
      skill-building throughout the week. Parents will also be give a short (1/2 to 1 page) handout
      following each session that will explain what was taught and how they can best help the
      participant make progress. Parents will also be asked to complete a short measure of
      psychological flexibility at intake, post-waitlist (only when applicable), post-treatment,
      and 3, 6, and 12-months following treatment.

    <measure>Trichotillomania Scale for Children-Chile and Parent Versions (TSC-C &amp; TSC-p)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in scores from baseline, 10-week post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure can be filled out by both the adolescent and parent. This measure is broke into 2 components: severity (5 items) and distress/impairment (7 items). A total of 3 scores are obtained, one for each component and a total score. This measure provides information about symptom severity and level of impairment or distress of trichotillomania for the client. Items 1-5 represent the severity score, each item is scored 0-2 with 2 representing higher severity. Items 1-5 are summed then divided by 5 to give a severity score. Items 6-12 represent the Distress/Impairment section and follow a similar scoring format summing each item and dividing by 7 to represent the Distress/Impairment score. The Severity Score and Distress/Impairment score are summed to give a total score. The minimum value for scores can be 0, with the highest score being 4 for the total score.</description>

    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Trichotillomania (AAQ-TTM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in scores from baseline, 10-week post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses a participant's overall levels of psychological inflexibility in relation to trichotillomania and how impairing trichotillomania may be for the individual. Each item ranges on scores from 1 (Never true) to 7 (always true). Higher scores on each item indicate higher levels of distress or psychologically inflexibility in relation to their trichotillomania. The values for each items are summed to provide a total score. Higher scores tend to indicate greater psychological flexibility. Items 2,3,4,5,7,8, and 9 are reversed scored.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in scores from baseline, 10-week post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The AFQ-Y measures psychological acceptance, cognitive fusion, and similar processes related to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model. It serves as a potential predictor of negative outcomes.This is an 8-item Likert-type scale, with values ranging from 0= &quot;Not at all True&quot; to 4= &quot;Very True&quot;. Scores from each item are summed and divided by the total number of items completed, then this average score is multiplied by 8. Higher scores indicate greater levels of distress or impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Youth Outcome Questionnaire (YOQ-C &amp; YOQ-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in scores from baseline, 10-week post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The YOQ covers a variety of situations, moods, and behaviors which are common to adolescents and these may or may not apply to each participant. It provides an assessment for tracking adolescent behavior by both the adolescent and parent and gives an understanding of the effectiveness of therapy. This is a 35-item Likert-type scale with items 1-30 ranging from 0 = &quot;Never or Almost Never&quot; to 4 = &quot;Always or almost always&quot;, while items 31-35 range from 0 = &quot;Haven't met therapist yet&quot; to 5 = &quot;Strongly agree&quot;. The first 30 items indicate total distress in a clients' life. Scores greater than or equal to 46 indicate clinically significant distress or impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Acceptance Questionnaire (6-PAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in scores from baseline, 10-week post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-PAQ provides a measure of psychological flexibility for parents/legal guardians in their interactions with their children and parenting behaviors. This is an 18-item Likert-type scale with responses ranging from 1 = &quot;Strongly disagree/never&quot; to 4 = &quot;Strongly agree/almost always&quot;. Items 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 18 are reverse scored. Lower scores represent greater levels of parental psychological flexibility, while higher scores indicate greater levels of parental psychological inflexibility.</description>

    <intervention_name>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Enhanced Behavior Therapy (AEBT)</intervention_name>
    <description>This treatment approach blends traditional behavior therapy elements of habit reversal training and stimulus control techniques with the more contemporary behavioral elements of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The first phase of the treatment, clients are taught skills for stopping and preventing their unconscious pulling episodes. The second phase, clients are introduced to ACT. Unlike interventions that aim to change the type or frequency of pulling-related cognitions, this treatment uses strategies to change the function of these cognitions. Clients are taught to see urges for what they really are and to accept their pulling-related thoughts, feelings, and urges without fighting against them. Over the course of 10 session clients will learn to be aware of their pulling and warning signals, use self-management strategies for stopping and preventing pulling, stop fighting against their pulling-related urges and thoughts, and work toward increasing their quality of life.</description>
