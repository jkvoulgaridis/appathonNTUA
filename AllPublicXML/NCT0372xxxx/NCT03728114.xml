  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown cognitive impairment such as memory, perception and learning skill
      during ascent to high altitudes. However, few studies have directly investigated the effect
      of high altitudes exposure on attention—a high-level cognitive function. Remote ischemic
      conditioning (RIC) is a noninvasive and easy‐to‐use neuroprotective strategy, It has been
      proven to be an effective strategy for neuroprotection in ischemic stroke and chronic
      cerebral ischemia patients.

      This study will provide insights into the preliminary proof of principle, safety, cognitive
      dysfunction and blood oxygen levels protective effects of RIC in Adults Exposing to High
      Altitude Conditions, and this data will provide parameters for future larger scale clinical
      trials if efficacious.
