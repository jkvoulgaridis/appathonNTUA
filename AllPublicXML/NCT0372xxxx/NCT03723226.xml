  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restricted (BFR) exercise has been shown to improve skeletal muscle adaptations to
      resistance exercise. BFR uses blood pressure cuffs (i.e., tourniquets) to reduce skeletal
      muscle blood flow during resistance exercise. One benefit of BFR is that skeletal muscle
      adaptations to resistance exercise training including muscle hypertrophy and increases in
      strength can be achieved at lower-loads (e.g., 25-30% 1RM), that are often comparable to more
      traditional resistance training loads (70-85% 1RM). However, the impact that low-load BFR
      resistance exercise has on muscle quality and bioenergetics is unknown. The present study
      will examine the impact of 6 weeks of low-load, single-leg resistance exercise training with
      or without personalized BFR on measures of muscle mass, strength, quality, and mitochondrial
      bioenergetics. The investigators will recruit and study up to 30, previously sedentary,
      healthy, college-aged adults (18-40 years). The investigators will measure muscle mass using
      Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry and muscle strength and endurance using isokinetic testing.
      The investigators will normalize knee extensor strength to lower limb lean mass to quantify
      muscle quality. The investigators will also use near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure
      mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the vastus lateralis. Finally, the investigators will
      measure markers of systemic inflammation and markers of muscle damage using commercially
      available ELISA assays.
