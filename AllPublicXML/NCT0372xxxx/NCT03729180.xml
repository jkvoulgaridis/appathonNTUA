  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is enrolling adults who are scheduled for either inpatient or outpatient elective
      surgical procedures at The University of Chicago.

      At pre-operative visits, patients will be consented and a blood sample will be obtained for
      preemptive genotyping across a panel of actionable germline variants predicting drug response
      or toxicity risk.

      Genotyping results will be delivered to participating providers as patient-specific drug-gene
      clinical decision support summaries using a secured Web portal, the Genomic Prescribing
      System (GPS).

      Participating anesthesiologists and critical care and pain management physicians and
      associated providers from the Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care at the University of
      Chicago will be invited to receive results for their participating patients.

      There will be an initial 6- month &quot;run-in&quot; period of the study comprised of approximately 100
      enrolled adults in which all patients will have pharmacogenomic results made available to
      providers. The run-in period will allow for process refinement and GPS delivery to be
      examined and optimized prior to the randomized phase

      After the initial run-in period, patients will be randomized to one of two arms - in the
      pharmacogenomic arm, providers will have access to GPS and pharmacogenomic information,
      whereas in the control arm, providers will not have access to GPS and patient-specific
      pharmacogenomic information (current standard of care).
