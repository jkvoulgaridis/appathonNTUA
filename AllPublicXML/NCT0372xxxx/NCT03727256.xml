  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of ultrasound therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation on
      the muscle architecture and functional capacity of patients with knee osteoarthritis.

      All participants who were satisfied with the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one
      of two study groups: Group 1- ultrasound therapy group; Group 2 - the neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation group. Group allocation was randomized in two blocks of 30 sealed
      envelopes without external marks, which were mixed and numbered from 1 to 30, containing a
      piece of paper with the group allocation. The researchers responsible for outcome measures
      and ultrasonograhic measurements were blinded to the patients' diagnosis or intervention.

    <measure>Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was assessed using a 0 to 10 visual analogue pain scale, with 0 meaning 'no pain' and 10 meaning 'excruciating pain'.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC (Westren Ontario and McMaster Universities) index is used to assess patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee using 24 parameters.To assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip and / or knee osteoarthritis, Minimum total score: 0, maximum total score: 96.Disability scores increase as Womac osteoarthritis index scores increase.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>15 meter walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to walk as fast as possible along a level, unobstructed corridor on the command &quot;go.&quot; The patients stood before the starting line. A hand-held stopwatch was started as the subjects passed a predetermined start mark and stopped as they passed a second mark 15meter from the start mark.Walking duration was determined as second before and after treatment</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle measurements were made before and after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasonography was used to measure muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length. Muscle thickness was measured as the mean distance between the superficial and deep aponeurosis at both image muscles. The distance between the intersection composed of the superficial aponeurosis and muscle fascicle, and the intersection composed of the deep aponeurosis and muscle fascicle was defined as muscle fascicle length. The results was measured as millimeter.The angle between the muscle fascicle and deep aponeurosis was defined as Pennation angle.</description>
