      Phase 2 clinical trial on the efficacy of cabozantinib in locally advanced, recurrent and/or
      metastatic salivary gland cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Salivary gland cancer (SGC) is a rare cancer with 24 histological subtypes.
      Treatment options for locally advanced and/or metastatic SGC are limited. The tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor cabozantinib suppresses tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and has been
      approved for renal cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Cabozantinib may also be of value in
      advanced SGC because c-MET, one of the targets of cabozantinib, is frequently overexpressed
      in SGC.

      Objectives: To assess the objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) of
      patients with advanced SGC treated with cabozantinib in 3 cohorts: salivary duct carcinoma
      (SDC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), other SGC's.

      Study design: Single arm, single center, phase II clinical trial in 3 cohorts: ACC, SDC and
      other SGC's.

      Study population: Patient with c-MET positive, locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic
      SGC.

      Intervention: Cabozantinib tablets 60 mg once daily until progressive disease, intolerable
      toxicity, or investigator and/or patient decision to withdraw for a maximum duration of 2
      years.

    <intervention_model_description>3 cohorts:
adenoid cystic carcinoma
salivary duct carcinoma
other subtypes of salivary gland cancer
sample size: The Simon two-stage design will be used, The first stage consists of 9 patients per cohort ((1) SDC, (2) ACC) evaluable for response. If 0 responses out of the first 9 evaluable patients are observed, the study will be stopped. In any other situation, the study will be continued until 17 patients are evaluable for response per cohort. If â‰¤2 responses are observed the study will accept the null hypothesis. If &gt;2 responses are observed, the null hypothesis will be rejected. In the third cohort (other SGC) 9 patients will be included to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in other subtypes of c-MET positive SGC. Because different subtypes are included in this cohort, these results are hypothesis forming but will not be used for statistical analysis. Therefore, this study cohort will be closed after the first stage with 9 patients.</intervention_model_description>
