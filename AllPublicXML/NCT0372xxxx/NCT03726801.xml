    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial consisting of 64 participants,
      which aims to assess the effectiveness of a nursing intervention for family members and
      patients prior to surgery to prevent body image disorder in breast cancer operated subjects.
      or colon (32 participants), compared to the intervention limited only to patients (32
      participants).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is one of the most important public health problems on a global scale in the 21st
      century. The National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases highlights, among the most frequent
      neoplasms, prostate cancer, colon-rectum, lung in men and breast, colon-rectum in women.

      One of the main treatments to be able to approach this type of tumors, such as breast and
      colorectal, is surgery. There are different surgical procedures (conservative surgery,
      mastectomy, ostomy) that, in a forceful way, affect the body image of the individual,
      sometimes generating extreme and painful situations. They are procedures that carry
      biopsychosocial implications and that generate a change in lifestyle.

      A better psychological preparation and an effective health education of the patient prior to
      surgery (consisting of providing the information of the intervention, providing psychological
      support during the entire surgical process and reporting on the changes that will occur),
      balance the characteristic stressful trait of surgery, thus decreasing the level of anxiety
      of the individual.

      In order for the patient to overcome this change in his body image, the role played by his
      immediate family member is fundamental, not only because it helps him improve the quality of
      life that he will have during the course of his illness, but also because an adequate
      emotional state can improve the patient's therapeutic response.

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the body image disorder suffered by patients with
      breast and colorectal cancer after undergoing surgery, comparing the group that received a
      previous nursing intervention with their immediate family member, compared to the patients
      who received this intervention without him.

      A randomized, non-blinded, controlled clinical trial was conducted. The study consisted of
      performing a nursing intervention prior to breast and colon surgery to both groups, giving
      health education divided into four phases: providing information on the disease, showing
      surgeries and similar experiences, explaining coping methods and reporting on techniques of
      relaxing.

    <time_frame>16 months</time_frame>
    <description>he alteration of the body image will be evaluated with the BIS SCALE after surgery, in the control group (patients who attend the nursing intervention prior to the same without family), and in the study group (patients who attend this intervention together with a direct family member). The Bis Scale has a score of 0 to 30 with 0 being no alteration of the body image and 30 a severe alteration.</description>

This measurement is made to check if the family influences the patient's self-esteem.

    <description>The average of the QLQ Scale is calculated. BR23 - quality of life (concern for the future, sex practice, enjoyment of sex, breast symptoms, arm symptoms), differentiating whether patients with direct family members or without them go to the nursing intervention prior to surgery. This measurement is made to check if the family influences their quality of life. The QLQ BR 23 Scale have a score of 0 to 100 points, with a lower score being better functionality for worry about the future, symptoms of the breast and arm symptoms, and a lower score for worse functionality in sex enjoyment and sex practice.</description>
