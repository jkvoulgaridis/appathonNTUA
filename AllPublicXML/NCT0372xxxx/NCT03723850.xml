  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is the safest and most accessible,
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique available for testing causal links between different
      brain regions and functions, by manipulating cognitive abilities. By identifying key
      experimental factors that can improve the reliability and robustness of stimulation effects
      on cognitive performance in different age groups, this project should lead to the widespread
      adoption of these design features in future applications. This study will investigate the
      extent to which tDCS to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (or dlPFC) impacts recollection
      accuracy and working memory performance as a function of time-of-day in younger and older
      adults. Moreover, this study will test the extent that tDCS to dlPFC impacts memory
      performance by impacting information-specific processes and/or cognitive control processes
      that operate across different types of information, thereby informing basic theories of how
      dlPFC contributes to memory in younger and older adults.

    <measure>Episodic memory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>This task is performed immediately after tDCS is administered, and lasts approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure episodic memory performance, participants will perform a recollection task. They will first study picture and word stimuli (encoding phase). On the subsequent memory test (retrieval phase), participants will be asked to differentiate between studied and non-studied items, as well as recollecting the previous format for studied items (i.e. recollecting the picture or word). For each tested item, participants will also be asked to make a confidence judgement about their response. The primary dependent variable (DV) will be recollection accuracy: the proportion of correctly recollected studied items minus the non-studied item baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working memory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>This task lasts approximately 10 minutes and is performed immediately after the episodic memory task (approximately 20 minutes after the end of the tDCS session).</time_frame>
    <description>To measure working memory performance, participants will perform two versions of the N-back task -- a verbal version (i.e., presenting the numbers 1-9 in a varied sequence) and a visuospatial version (i.e., presenting a colored square in one of 9 locations on a 3x3 grid in a varied sequence). The primary DV will be working memory accuracy: proportion of targets correctly identified minus the proportion of lures incorrectly endorsed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Right-handed (according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory)

          -  Normal or corrected vision

          -  Fluent in English (started learning by age 6)

          -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent for study procedures, and to comply
             - with study procedures for the entire length of the study.

          -  For individuals in the 'younger adults' group, must be between 18 and 30 years of age

          -  For individuals in the 'older adults' group, must be between 60 and 75 years of age

          -  A score of 23 or above on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (out of 30,
             education-corrected) is required. This is to minimize the inclusion of suspected mild
             cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, targeting individuals that score in the normal
             range according to the recent meta-analysis of MoCA's ability to differentiate normal
             aging from MCI in Carson et al. (2018, Int. J of Geriatric Psychiatry).

          -  Performance above threshold on the episodic memory task during the baseline session.
             The threshold is defined as having a hit rate that is at least 5% greater than the
             false alarm rate, where hit rate is defined as the number of studied items identified
             as studied, divided by the total number of studied items, and false alarm rate is
             defined as the number of new items identified as studied, divided by the total number
             of new items. We don't anticipate this threshold to exclude many, if any subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neuropsychological conditions associated with cognitive decline or seizure

          -  Cochlear implants or metal in the brain/skull (except titanium)

          -  Psychoactive medications, or diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, or any
             psychotic diagnoses

          -  History of excessive use (clinically treated) alcohol or narcotics

          -  Hospitalization for head trauma (e.g. concussions) in the past 5 years

          -  Individuals above a threshold score on an assessment of depression, specifically, a
             score of 10 or above on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)(Manea et al., 2012)

          -  Risk of pregnancy

          -  Low tolerance of skin irritation

          -  Prior brain stimulation experience (self-report)
