  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether there is a difference in postoperative (after
      surgery) endoscopic appearance of the sinus cavities (the way that the sinuses look through a
      camera) between sinuses that receive one of two types of resorbable steroid eluting sinus
      packing (a sponge-like material which dissolves within several days while releasing a
      steroid): 1) Propel Implant or 2) Nasopore soaked with triamcinolone at the time of
      endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis.

      1. The Propel 'implant' is composed of small, flexible tubes which dissolve while releasing
           Mometasone which is one type of steroid. This application has been approved for use by
           the FDA.

        2. Nasopore soaked with triamcinolone. This &quot;packing' is a sponge-like material which
           dissolves while releasing triamcinolone, which is another type of steroid. Triamcinolone
           has been approved for use topically elsewhere on the body, although the specific use of
           Triamcinolone in the sinuses has not been approved by the FDA.

      Both of these procedures are currently used regularly by Dr. Pearlman in practice at the
      conclusion of ESS for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. As standard of care, treatment is
      determined intraoperatively (during surgery), at the discretion of the surgeon. In this
      study, each subject will have both treatments (one in each cavity). The 'experimental' aspect
      relates to directly comparing the two procedures.

      This research study is being done because there is currently a lack of consensus regarding
      the optimal nasal packing regimen. There have been no comparison studies and practice
      patterns vary widely. Our study looks to compare the Propel implant to Nasopore packing
      soaked in Triamcinolone.

    <measure>Change from Pre-operative score in Patient's nasal endoscopy, as measured by Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy (POSE) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operatively; Post-operatively at 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Validated endoscopy grading score.The score is calculated by determining several characteristics of the appearance of the sinus cavities. The score ranges from 0-32 (or 0-40 if frontal and sphenoid sinuses are opened at the time of surgery). A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <description>The score is calculated by determining the amount of polyp, edema, and secretion in the nasal cavity on both sides. The score ranges from 0-12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
