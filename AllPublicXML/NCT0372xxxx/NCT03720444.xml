  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to carry out a study evaluating the effectiveness of the MDT method
      (mechanical diagnosis and therapy) in the subacute phase of common low back pain.

      Few studies have specifically evaluated the effectiveness of the MDT method in the subacute
      phase, a phase that appears to be crucial before the chronicization of low back pain.

      The main objective of this study will be to evaluate the pain of patients managed by the MDT
      method.

      The analysis of the main criterion (Visual Analog Scale) will be done using a type individual
      clinical trial specific: the Single Case Experimental Design or SCED in lines of multiple
      bases.

      This type of study makes it possible to carry out a comparative test on a single subject
      acting as its own witness in order to obtain an acceptable level of evidence response for
      that particular patient.

        The study population is all patients aged 18 to 55 years who consult with one of the Mc
        Kenzie physiotherapists participating in the study, for a common low back pain reason
        between 4 and 12 weeks of evolution.

        The first ten patients consulting one of the physiotherapists involved and meeting the
        criteria will be recruited. Each patient will receive information about the research and
        sign a consent.

        Patients with a strong suspicion of specific low back pain will be excluded from the
        outset.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consultant patients at the Picasso physiotherapy practice (5 rue Nina Simone - 44 000
             NANTES)

          -  Aged 18 to 55 years old

          -  Suffering from common-looking low back pain. Low back pain is defined as pain or
             localized discomfort under the 12th dorsal vertebrae and above the inner fold buttock,
             with possible irradiation to the lower limb but not exceeding the knee.

          -  Evolving for 4 to 12 weeks (subacute period).

          -  Period preceded by a period of 30 days without low back pain (in order to avoid
             recurrent low back pain, rather similar to the chronic phase).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Signs of specific low back pain (confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis): fracture,
             infection, osteoporosis, inflammatory disease, tumor

          -  Irradiation below the knee

          -  Patient knowing she is pregnant

          -  Protected adults

          -  Patient with proven cognitive impairment

          -  Patient with a decompensated psychiatric pathology

          -  Incapacity to consent

          -  Refusal to participate in the study
