  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' previous studies results showed that the non-invasive treatment effects of
      low-energy lasers with the period of 5 consecutive days, could significantly improve the
      local function of static and dynamic motion stability of the lower extremities (p&lt;0.0001)
      among the participants with lower limb periostitis. Therefore, investigators would like to
      further understand the treatment effect of intravascular low-energy laser on the central
      nervous system disorders. It is hoped that with this study, investigators can better
      understand how to use intravenous laser therapy to help those participants improve their
      ability of self-care and functional recovery.
