  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to internal medicine care environments have complex care needs and must be
      treated as persons with resources and responsibilities. Person-centred care is defined as
      care in which the caregiver aims to get to know the patient as a person, and the care
      comprises a holistic approach to assess patients' needs and resources. There is strong
      motivation for future health care to transform into an approach that acknowledges and
      endorses every patient's resources, interests and needs. There is limited existing research
      on the benefit of implementing person-centred care in internal medicine care environments for
      all patients regardless of diagnosis or care pathway. Little is known about the effects of
      person-centred inpatient care on patients' satisfaction with care. This study includes adult
      patients admitted to an internal medicine inpatient unit regardless of reason for admission.
      The aim of the study is to evaluate effects of person-centred inpatient care on care
      processes, in terms of satisfaction with care and person-centred content in medical records
      and to evaluate effects on self-reported health and self-efficacy.

    <time_frame>From date of admission until the date of discharge, up to 60 days of hospitalization.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is assessed with the questionnaire Quality from the Patient Perspective. The questionnaire comprises four dimension of with two dimensions is used: Identity-oriented approach (13 items) and the sociocultural atmosphere (5 items). One item from the medical competence subscale (effective pain relief) and one additional item on provision of information about medications is also used. Two kinds of assessments are being made at each item: whether things were being done (perceived reality) and whether the right things were being done (subjective significance). For the primary outcome only the assessments of perceived reality are being used. Items are rated on a four-point response scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 4 (completely agree). Each item also has a response option of &quot;not applicable&quot;. Subscales can be reported item by item or combined in a subscale score (average of all responses within the subscale).</description>

    <measure>Self-reported health assessed with EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>at the date of discharge, an average of 5 days after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported health is measured with the EuroQual-5Dimensions-5Levels questionnaire (EQ- 5D- 5L). The questionnaire comprises 1 item per dimension. The dimensions of importance for health which are included are; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Patients rate each item on a scale ranging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems/unable to). A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also includes EQ-VAS, in which the patients grade their current health status on an analogue scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health).</description>

    <measure>Physical and psychological wellbeing assessed with the Quality from the Patient Perspective questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at the date of discharge, an average of 5 days after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rated their physical and psychological wellbeing on two separate five-point Likert scales ranging from &quot;very good&quot; (5) to &quot;very bad&quot; (1). These two items are included in the Quality from the Patient Perspective questionnaire as two separate questions.</description>

    <description>General self-efficacy measures confidence in one's ability to handle difficult challenges in life. It includes 10 items, which are rated on a four- point Likert scale giving a summary score of 40 for the total scale (10-40).</description>

    <time_frame>From date of admission until the date of discharge, up to 60 days of hospitalization.</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire comprises four dimension of with the two rational dimensions was used for this specific aim: medical- technical competence (4 items) and physical-technical condition (3 items). Two kinds of assessments are being made at each item: whether things were being done (perceived reality) and whether the right things were being done (subjective significance). For this secondary outcome the assessments of perceived reality is being used. A four-point response scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 4 (completely agree) forms the basis of ratings, each item also had a response option of &quot;not applicable&quot;. Subscales can be reported item by item or combined in a subscale score (average of all responses within the subscale).</description>

    <description>The intervention comprises three sequential steps in the care process. The first two steps follow one after the other in conjunction with admission to the ward: 1) person-centred assessment, and 2) creation of a person-centred health plan. Persistent person-centred inpatient care, the third step, is practiced throughout the hospital stay, and is a component of the quality and patient safety program.
The model is systematically applied to all patients admitted to the unit. All staff are trained in PCC before implementation of the intervention.</description>
