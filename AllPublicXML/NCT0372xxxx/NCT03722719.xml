  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that voluntary pelvic floor muscle
      pre-contraction (the Knack) (alone) can be a treatment for urine leakage during efforts. For
      this purpose, the following parameters will be analysed and compared amongst 1) the Knack, 2)
      pelvic floor muscle training and 3) the Knack + pelvic floor muscle training groups: urine
      leakage as assessed by the pad test, urinary symptoms, muscle function, quality of life,
      subjective cure, adherence to exercises in the outpatient setting and at home and perceived
      self-efficacy of pelvic floor muscle exercises.

      The study population will comprise women with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence or
      mixed urinary incontinente (with predominant stress urinary incontinence) as assessed by
      means of the one-hour pad test (leakage ≥2 g). Leakage up to 10 grams will be rated mild
      stress urinary incontinence and of 11 to 50 grams as moderate stress urinary incontinence.
      The sample will also include women with grade 2 muscle strength (normal contraction with
      elevation of the anterior vaginal wall) on the two-finger assessment rated according to the
      Oxford scale.

      The primary outcome measure will be the objective cure of urinary incontinence as assessed by
      means of the one-hour pad test three months after randomization.

      Secondary outcome measures: three-day bladder diary, 1 hour pad test, International
      Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form, Incontinence Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, Subjective cure of stress urinary incontinence, Self-efficacy/outcome
      expectation to pelvic floor muscle exercises, Frequency of the outpatient sessions, adherence
      to home exercises and pelvic floor muscle function, morphometry, strength and vaginal squeeze
      pressure.

    <measure>Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three and six after months after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of stress urinary incontinence on quality of life will be assessed by the Incontinence Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. The Incontinence Quality-of-Life Questionnaire evaluates the limitations on human behaviour, psychosocial impact and social embarrassment. The score ranges from 0 to 100 points, and the lower the score, the greater the impact of urinary incontinence on the patient's quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective cure of stress urinary incontinence.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three and six after months after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective cure will be measured by asking the patients if they were &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;dissatisfied&quot; about their condition (urinary incontinence) after treatment. The investigators considered them to be &quot;satisfied&quot; when the patient was happy with the results and did not want a different treatment and &quot;dissatisfied&quot; if the patient desired a treatment other than the initial one.</description>

    <description>The number of completed exercise sets will be obtained using an exercise diary, and it will be recorded as the mean of the exercise sets per month performed during the three-month therapy intervention for both groups and the number of home exercise sets in both groups will also be assessed at the six-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>The scale contains 17 questions in the format of a visual analogue scale with answers ranging from 0 (not confident at all) to 100 (the most confident). Thirteen items refer to self-efficacy and four to outcome expectations. The final scores will be obtained by calculating the mean of the items, ranging from 0 to 100, in which higher values are equivalent to more beneficial self-efficacy/outcome expectation to pelvic floor muscle exercises.</description>

    <intervention_name>the Knack</intervention_name>
    <description>The Knack consists of voluntary PFM contractions before and during activities that increase abdominal pressure. Such contraction elevates the pelvic floor cranially, with consequent closure of the urethra, vagina and rectum, stabilization of the pelvic floor and avoidance of urine leakage.</description>

    <intervention_name>PFMT</intervention_name>
    <description>The rationale underlying intensive PFM strength training is that it might develop the structural support of the pelvis by raising the levator plate to a permanent, higher position within the pelvis and promoting PFM and connective tissue hypertrophy and stiffness. These conditions facilitate automatic and more efficacious activation of motor units (neural adaptation), which impedes descent during activities that increase abdominal pressure.</description>
