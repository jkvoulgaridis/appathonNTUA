  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly is often associated with social, physiological and psychic changes. However, no study
      has examined accidental poisoning-induced changes.

      The objective of the study is to identify and analyze the various causes of potentially toxic
      accidental exposure of the elderly to determine preventable causes and propose prevention
      strategies.

      Elderly is often associated with social, physiological and psychic changes. Many studies
      tried to demonstrate their influence in the genesis of pathological events such as falls or
      suicide of the elderly but none on the genesis of accidental poisoning.

      However, poisoning in this age group is frequent and sometimes severe. In order to improve
      care of the elderly, it seems necessary to focus on potential toxic accidental exposure.

      For this, Poison Control Centre of the University Hospital of Bordeaux has identified the
      causes over a period of 5 months (from 01 March to 31 July 2017) from calls to the centre.
