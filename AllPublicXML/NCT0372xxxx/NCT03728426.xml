      The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of letermovir antiviral treatment of active
      cytomegalovirus infection or cytomegalovirus disease in patients with infections that are
      refractory or resistant to available treatments or who are experiencing organ dysfunction
      that makes unsafe the use of available antiviral treatments.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness
      of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved letermovir for treatment of
      cytomegalovirus infection, but it has approved letermovir for the prevention of
      cytomegalovirus infection in bone-marrow transplantation patients.

      This is the first time that letermovir will be administered to children in a clinical trial.

      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus, which a majority of people acquire at some time in
      their life. CMV remains in your body, but does not cause symptoms in the majority of people.
      Patients with a weakened immune system (a system that protects you from infections) may be
      more at risk for the virus becoming active and causing damage to some of your organs,
      especially in the gut and lungs. If the virus becomes present above a certain quantity, the
      doctor usually prescribes a drug to treat the infection at this stage to avoid damage to the
      organs.

      In this case, the virus is no longer responding to the prescribed drug, and other drug
      options will be harmful to the participant's health. Participants are being invited to take
      part in a research study for an investigational drug called letermovir. The purpose of this
      study is to find out whether letermovir is as effective and as safe in treating CMV infection
      in patients who cannot tolerate standard treatments such as ganciclovir or foscarnet.

             with HIV infection that require antiviral treatment for CMV.

          -  Documented CMV disease or persistent CMV infection (CMV virus load above 500 IU/mL on
             consecutive measurements, at least one day apart).

             60 ml/min/1.73 m2 by bedside Schwartz equation in &lt; 18 years-old) at baseline or which
             develops during antiviral treatment.

             --Patients who develop severe myelosuppression or renal dysfunction during antiviral
             treatment as defined above are eligible without having to meet the
             refractoriness/antiviral resistance criterion.

          -  Combinations of genotypic antiviral resistance and organ dysfunction that lead to
             eligibility are presented in the full protocol eligibility table.

          -  The effects of letermovir on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration
             of study participation, and 3 months after completion of letermovir administration.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after
             completion of letermovir administration.

             test.

             will be discussed with the patient's primary treatment physician.

          -  Patient taking strong inhibitors or inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes including
             rifampicin, phenytoin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, or cobicistat.

          -  HIV patients who are receiving antiretroviral treatment protease inhibitors
             (darunavir, lopinavir, etc) whether by themselves or boosted with ritonavir or
             cobicistat, or HIV patients receiving cyclosporine treatment due to strong drug-drug
             interactions.

          -  Combinations of genotypic antiviral resistance and organ dysfunction that do not meet
