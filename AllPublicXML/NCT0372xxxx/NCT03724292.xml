  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Part 1 of a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which
      VTP-43742 was administered to participants; Part 1 in healthy volunteers and Part 2 in
      psoriatic participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple dose
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics effects of
      VTP-43742 in healthy volunteers conducted at a single, study center in the United States
      (Part 1). A total of 74 participants were enrolled both parts of the study (Part 1 with 40
      healthy subjects; Part 2 with 34 psoriatic participants). This post includes data from Part 1
      of the study only; Part 2 is reported separately.
