      Multicenter observational program Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of Detralex
      treatment in patients with chronic venous edema (CEAP class С3) in real clinical practice
      Design The VAP-PRO-C3 is a multicenter observational program, which is carried out in the
      frame of routine consultations and follow-up of patients. The program includes patients with
      chronic venous diseases (CVDs) of CEAP class C3. It is scheduled in Russia for 2018-2019. The
      program is expected to enroll 90 phlebologists from 60 cities of Russia. The planned number
      of patients is 900 Aim of the study The study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety
      of systemic pharmacotherapy (Detralex) as a part of combination treatment, and its influence
      on the general outcomes of treatment of patients with chronic venous edema (CEAP class C3) in
      real clinical practice.
