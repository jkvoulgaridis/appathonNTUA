  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the present study aimed to follow up our participants in order to consider the changes in
      weight and anthropometric measurements after the 12-month weight maintenance as well as the
      total of 18 months, consisting of the previously described 24 weeks active weight loss and a
      further 53 weeks weight maintenance. The secondary outcome was to compare the abdominal
      adiposity, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism during these periods.
