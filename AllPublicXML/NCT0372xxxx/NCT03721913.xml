  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community participation of children with ASD is affected by child (including body function
      and personal factors), family and environmental factors. This study proposes an innovative
      Participation-based intervention based on the principles of self-determined, family-centered,
      strength-based, and solution-focused approaches. This intervention targets on promoting
      children's community participation, and forms solution strategies from analyzing the strength
      and needs of child, family, and environment. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      efficacy of participation-based intervention on community participation and family
      empowerment for children with ASD 6-10 years of age.

    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have social interaction and communication
      disorders, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, which may further restrict daily
      activities and participation. Participation of children with ASD often are more restricted in
      the community than at home and school, due to problems such as environmental barriers and
      resources inadequacy. Research showed that school-age children with ASD participated less in
      social, leisure and sports activities than children with typical development, thus may result
      in loneness or social isolation and impact on long-term physical and psychological health.

      Community participation of children with ASD is affected by child (including body function
      and personal factors), family and environmental factors. This study proposes an innovative
      Participation-based intervention based on the principles of self-determined, family-centered,
      strength-based, and solution-focused approaches. This intervention targets on promoting
      children's community participation, and forms solution strategies from analyzing the strength
      and needs of child, family, and environment. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      efficacy of participation-based intervention on community participation and family
      empowerment for children with ASD 6-10 years of age.

      This study is proposed as a 2-year project that will use a stratified randomized controlled
      trial design to examine the efficacy of participation-based intervention (experimental group)
      in comparison to no additional intervention (control group). The study period includes
      12-week intervention phase and 12-week follow-up phase, and 3 outcome measures: pre-test,
      post-test, and follow-up. The primary outcomes are children's community participation, the
      secondary outcomes are parental empowerment, family quality of life, and satisfaction with
      partnerships. This study will have great impact on promoting collaboration among child,
      family and therapists, and supporting full inclusion in society of children with ASD and
      their families.

    <measure>Change in the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) performance and satisfaction scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention at 12 weeks and follow-up at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is a measure for identifying children's participation problems and prioritizing the goals. The parents will be asked to use a 10-point rating scales (1-10: higher scores indicating better performance and higher satisfaction) to rate their perception of performance and satisfaction of the goals.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention at 12 weeks and follow-up at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS is a measure for evaluating the goal attainment. It is a five level scale ranged from -2 to +2 where -2 represented the level of performance before intervention, 0 the expected level of attainment after intervention and +2 represented a level of attainment that exceeded expectations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Empowerment and Efficacy Measure (PEEM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention at 12 weeks and follow-up at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PEEM is a 20-item questionnaire designed to measure parent functioning. The parents will be asked to use a 10-point scale to indicate how well each statement captures the way they feel about themselves in relation to their role as parent. A rating of 1 is used to indicate that the statement is a poor match for the way they feel and sounds nothing like them. A rating of 10 indicates that the statement is a perfect match and describes exactly how they feel. The total possible score ranges from 20 to 200.</description>

    <measure>Family Quality of Life (FaQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention at 12 weeks and follow-up at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FaQoL(McWilliam, 2011) is a 40-item questionnaire rate on a 5-point scale (1-poor to 5-excellent) for parents to rate their perception of satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Chinese version of Family-Professional Partnership Scale (FPPS-P-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-intervention at 12 weeks and follow-up at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>(only for the intervention groups) The FPPS-P-C is a 18-item scale for assessing parents' perceptions of the importance of and their satisfaction with family-professional partnerships. The parents will be asked to indicate how important each item was for their partnership with a professional serving their child using a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (very important).</description>
