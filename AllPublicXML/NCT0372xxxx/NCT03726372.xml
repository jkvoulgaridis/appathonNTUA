  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During robotic laparoscopic surgery, a high intraperitoneal pressure may result in high
      airway pressure and inadequate perfusion of the abdominal organs, and as a result the
      postoperative outcomes. Degree of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) can affect the intraperitoneal
      pressure. In this study, the patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic surgery will be
      assigned to deep NMB group and moderate NMB group. Perioperative outcomes including maximal
      intraperitoneal pressure, maximal intraoptic pressure, quality of emergence, postoperative
      pain, and incidence of postoperative respiratory complication will be compared. The results
      of this study will provide evidence for optimizing NMB protocol of robotic laparoscopic
      surgery.
