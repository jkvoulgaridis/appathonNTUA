  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of automated sleep analysis by the Dreem dry-EEG
      headband and deep learning algorithm in comparison to the consensus of 5 sleep technologists'
      manual scoring of a gold-standard clinical polysomnogram (PSG) record in healthy adult
      volunteers during an overnight clinic-based sleep study.

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 25 adult volunteers who will undergo a one-night in-lab sleep study.
      All volunteers are first prescreened over the phone. Upon arrival at the research center,
      volunteers provide informed consent, are interviewed to confirm eligibility, and complete a
      detailed demographic, medical, health, sleep, and lifestyle survey. After the survey,
      participants are fitted with the PSG and the Dreem headband by the sleep technologist. During
      the PSG sleep study, the Dreem headband records EEG, pulse, oxygen saturation (SO2),
      movement, and respiratory rate.

      Dreem's algorithms will be used to automatically stage the Dreem sleep data, and the results
      will then be compared to the consensus of 5 sleep technologists' manual scoring of the
      respective PSG records for the same individuals to determine the accuracy of Dreem's sleep
      staging algorithms.
