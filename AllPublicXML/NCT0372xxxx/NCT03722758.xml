    <textblock>
      This is a split-mouth, randomized clinical study that evaluating the 36-month performance of
      different restorative materials in the treatment of root caries lesions. A total of 110
      restorations were randomly placed, half using resin composite (Spectrum TPH3) and the other
      half using the resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Riva Light Cure). Restorations were
      evaluated at the baseline, 6, 12, 18,24 and 36 months according to the USPHS criteria.

      The aim of the study was to comparatively assess the 36-month clinical performance of a micro
      hybrid resin composite and resin-modified glass ionomer cement in root caries lesions.

      Thirty-three patients with at least two root caries lesions participated in this study. A
      total of 110 restorations were randomly placed, half using resin composite (Spectrum TPH3)
      and the other half using the resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Riva Light Cure).
      Restorations were evaluated at the baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. The data were
      analyzed with Pearson's Chi-square, Cochran's Q, Friedman tests and Logistic Regression
      Analysis (p=0.05).

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary factor for determining the clinical performance of a restorative material is the marginal adaption score. It represents the survival rates of the restorations after a period of time. According to ADA guidelines, a restorative material should show at least 90% survival rate after 18. The retention scored as 0 (restoration appears to adapt closely to the surface of the tooth with no crevice formation), 1 (an explorer caught lightly when run in both directions, and there was visible evidence of early crevice formation), 2 (an explorer got caught in both directions and penetrated a marginal crevice), 3 (the crevice had sufficient depth to expose the dentin, required replacement) or 4 (The restoration was fractured or lost).
Clinical evaluation is performed to examine if the restorations are in place or fallen.</description>
