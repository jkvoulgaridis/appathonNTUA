    <textblock>
      The new investigational and FDA-approved device is named &quot;SkyLife&quot; and is a mattress, which
      uses blue LEDs as the light source similar to those used in the currently-used overhead blue
      LED panel devices.

      The new investigational and FDA-approved device is named &quot;SkyLife&quot; and is a mattress, which
      uses blue LEDs as the light source similar to those used in the currently-used overhead blue
      LED panel devices. It is believed that this device will not only avoid many of the side
      effects when fluorescent tube lights are used, since it delivers safer, non-ultraviolet
      light; but may also be more effective than currently-used blankets or mattresses, which use
      blue halogen lamps or fluorescent tubes as light sources. The light is emitted under the
      baby. This study will discover if this device should be used in place of the currently-used
      devices.
