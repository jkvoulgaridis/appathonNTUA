  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part, single arm study designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of
      LTX-315 to induce T-cell infiltration prior to TIL expansion in patients with soft tissue
      sarcoma. Following intratumoural injection of LTX-315 to a selected lesion, the lesion will
      be extracted for T-cell culture, expansion and infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced/metastatic tumours who have received at least one approved standard of
      care treatment will be recruited. All patients must have at least two lesions, one that can
      injected with LTX-315 and another that can used to assess response. In the first part of the
      study, LTX-315 will be administered intratumorally on 4-6 dosing days over a 2-4 week period
      to an index lesion which will be biopsied or removed after treatment for T-cell expansion.
      The second part will involve culturing and expanding T-cells for infusion of tumour
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) following an induction regimen. The safety and efficacy of
      the LTX-315 and TIL treatment will be assessed. Patients will be followed up for 15 months.
