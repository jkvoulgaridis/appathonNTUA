  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a conventional therapeutic regimen, based on
      treatment escalation (step-up strategy) and driven by the treat-to-target approach, with that
      of an early aggressive intervention based on the initial start of a combination of
      conventional and biological DMARDs (step-down strategy).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a a 12-month open label, randomised, actively controlled, multi-centre, prospective, superiority trial of two different treatment strategies (Step-down versus Step-up).
After signature of informed consent/assent patients will be randomized into two therapeutic arms: &quot;Step-up&quot; or &quot;Step-down&quot;. Patients in the Step-up arm will be treated according to a conventional strategy based on treatment escalation and driven by the treat-to-target strategy. Patients in the Step-Down arm will be treated with an early, combined, aggressive therapy for 6 months.
After the conclusion of the 12-month observation period of the trial, patients will be followed for up to 5 years for the evaluation of disease course, medication requirements, adverse events, and long-term disease-related morbidity.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The effectiveness of the two therapeutic strategies will be compared by assessing the frequency of clinical remission (CR) at 12 months. CR is defined as the persistence of the JADAS state of ID for at least 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Time to JADAS/JIA ACR clinical remission</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to achieve the state of JADAS/JIA ACR ID will be calculated as the time difference (in days) between the date of randomization and the date of the visit at which the patient will be observed to be in clinical remission (i.e. persistent inactive disease for at least 6 months).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time spent in JADAS/JIA ACR inactive disease</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative time spent in the JADAS/JIA ACR state of ID will be calculated as the time difference (in days) between the date of the first visit at which the patient will be observed to be in ID and the date at which he/she will be observed to be no longer in ID that is when the disease will flare (see later for definitions), or database closure for analysis purposes. We will assume that if a patient is found to be in ID at 2 consecutive visits, the patient had ID on all days between these visits. If a patient will be found to have ID at a particular visit, but lost the ID status at the subsequent visit, the patient will be considered to have been in ID until the recurrence of active disease. Patients found to be in ID only at the time of database closure will contribute a single day of ID. The time in inactive disease per patient will be recorded and compared between the 2 arms.</description>

    <description>The area under the curve (AUC) of the JADAS10 score assessed at every study visit and the AUC of the parent version of the JADAS (parJADAS) assessed monthly will be recorded and compared between the 2 arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time spent on therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative time on therapy will be calculated as the time difference (in days) between the date of the visit at which the patient will start a systemic medication (synthetic or biologic DMARDs or steroids) until the date at which he/she will be observed to no longer be in treatment with a systemic medication, or completed the study. We assume that if a patient does not receive medications at 2 consecutive visits, the patient had not received medications all days between these visits. Patients initiating a systemic treatment at the final visit of the study will contribute a single day of time in therapy. The mean percentage of time spent on therapy per patient will be recorded and compared between the 2 arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of flares</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of patients who develop flare, defined as the recurrence of active disease after attaining inactive disease at last visit according JADAS or JIA ACR definition, and the number of flares and the time to flare per patient will be recorded and compared. Notably, all patients prescribed intra-articular injections, synthetic or biologic DMARDs or systemic steroids will be considered as flare independently from JADAS or ACR criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of uveitis onset</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of patients who develop uveitis according to the Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) will be recorded and compared between the 2 arms. The rate of patients requiring systemic medications for treatment of uveitis will be also recorded and compared between the 2 arms. However, these patients will be excluded from the study and followed for safety only.</description>
