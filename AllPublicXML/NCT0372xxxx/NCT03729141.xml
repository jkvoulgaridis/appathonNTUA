  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: increasing dietary cholesterol in humans will increase visceral, but not
      subcutaneous adipocyte size, free cholesterol content, and inflammatory gene expression.

      Visceral and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies will be obtained from non-obese
      subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center after 3
      weeks of zero (control) or 1g dietary cholesterol supplementation. Blood samples will also be
      taken before and after 3 weeks of dietary supplementation (0 vs. 1g dietary cholesterol) to
      measure plasma lipids levels, and ex vivo monocyte chemotaxis. Blood will also be used to
      isolate CD14+ monocytes for RNA extraction and storage for future transcriptome studies.
      Measurements of adipocyte size, free cholesterol content, and inflammatory gene and protein
      expression in the adipose tissue biopsies to test the hypothesis. Adipocytes and the stromal
      vascular fraction will be isolated and evaluated for CD14+ macrophages for RNA extraction and
      storage for future transcriptome analysis.

      A Wake Forest School of Medicine Clinical Research Unit-based pilot study will be conducted
      in which subjects scheduled to undergo elective intra-abdominal surgery at Wake Forest
      Baptist Medical Center (i.e., cholecystectomy, Nissen fundoplication, hernia repair, etc.)
      will be recruited. Subjects will be randomly and blindly assigned to receive daily treats
      (cookie, brownie, or muffin) containing either no added cholesterol (control) or 1g of
      cholesterol/day (~0.4 mg/Kcal cholesterol) for 3 weeks prior to surgery. Three weeks for the
      length of cholesterol supplementation has been chosen because this is within the duration of
      human egg-consumption studies in which significant elevations in plasma LDL concentrations
      occurred. A blood sample will be taken from each participant at baseline before starting the
      supplementation period and after 3 weeks of 0 or 1g/day cholesterol supplementation, at the
      time of scheduled surgery. The blood samples will be used for measurement of lipid profile,
      ex vivo monocyte chemotaxis, and for monocyte RNA isolation. During surgery, abdominal wall
      subcutaneous adipose tissue and mesenteric (visceral) adipose tissue samples will be
      obtained. Aliquots of adipose tissue will be fixed overnight for histology and measurement of
      adipocyte size distribution and CD68 immunostaining, flash frozen and stored for cholesterol
      quantification by gas liquid chromatography, extracted to isolate RNA and protein for
      quantitative real time PCR and immunoblotting of inflammatory gene and protein expression,
      and collagenase digested to isolate adipocytes and stromal vascular cell fraction macrophages
      which will be used to extract and store RNA for future transcriptome analyses.
