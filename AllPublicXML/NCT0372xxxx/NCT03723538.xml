    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing tracheal resection and reconstruction surgery are enrolled in this
      prospective observational pilot study to evaluate dexmedetomidine-based sedation after
      tracheal surgery in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patients remain electively intubated with
      an uncuffed nasal endotracheal tube, awake and exhibit spontaneous breathing The neck was
      maintained in flexion through chin-to-chest sutures. Infusion of dexmedetomidine was started
      from a dosage of 0.7 μg kg-1 h-1 followed by dose titration to the target level of the
      sedation Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, (RASS) score -1/-2 using a dose range of 0.2-1.4
      μg kg-1 h-1.
