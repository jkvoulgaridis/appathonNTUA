  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV), is a cause of severe and highly
      fatal lower respiratory tract infection, first identified in 2012. As of August 2018, there
      have been 2229 cases reported with a case fatality rate &gt;35%. In 2015 an individual returning
      to South Korea served as the index case for an outbreak of 186 individuals, of who, &gt;20%
      died. GLS-5300 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the MERS CoV spike (S) glycoprotein.
      This Phase I/IIa study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of GLS-5300
      administered intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation at 0.3 and 0.6 mg/dose assessing
      2 and 3-dose regimens.
