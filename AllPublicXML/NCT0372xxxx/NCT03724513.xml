      This is an original case series on soldiers evacuated from HAA(High Altitude Area) over last
      one year(Sept 2017- Aug 2018) , of which 100% cases were found to have gastric antrum
      perforation. This is a deviation from the usual trend that is being noted in Indian
      subcontinent where duodenal perforations are commonest.

      INTRODUCTION : This is an original case series on soldiers evacuated from HAA(High Altitude
      Area) over last one year(Sept 2017- Aug 2018) , of which 100% cases were found to have
      gastric antrum perforation. This is a deviation from the usual trend that is being noted in
      Indian subcontinent where duodenal perforations are commonest.

      DISCUSSION : High altitude associated dyspepsia is a common phenomenon and some studies done
      in high altitude population have recorded high incidence of antral gastritis and mucosal
      atrophy on histo-pathological evaluation. This is also supported by high incidence of
      H.pylori infection. The presence of atrophic gastric mucosa associated with antral gastritis,
      when exposed to hypobaric hypoxemic conditions faced by soldiers posted to heights above
      15000ft , may leads to increased intra-luminal pressure and ischemia which probably
      predisposes individuals for gastric antrum perforations.

      CONCLUSION : This is a relatively untouched topic as we have not found studies on high
      altitude related gastric perforations and probably this is the first case series of its kind.
      The acknowledgement of this phenomenon may pave way for further studies for defining the role
      of high altitude in gastric perforations.
