      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be provided with fibrillar collagen powder
      dressing. The powder dressing will be used in accordance with its label. After cleansing the
      wound by the clinical site staff, the powder is placed directly on the wound, and then the
      wound will be covered with an appropriate moisture retentive secondary dressing. Patients
      will visit the clinic twice a week to have the powder re-applied. Wound evaluations will take
      place once a week at the outpatient clinic, with the intervention lasting up to twelve weeks.
      Concurrent standard of care, such as compression for venous ulcers, will be provided.

    <description>The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment tool score will be used to assess the wound's status throughout the study. The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment tool measures wound status. The wound size score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound depth score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound edge score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound undermining score ranges from 0 to 5. The necrotic tissue type score ranges from 1 to 5. The necrotic tissue amount ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate type score ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate amount score ranges from 1 to 5. The skin color surrounding wound score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue edema score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue induration score score ranges from 1 to 5. The granulation tissue score ranges from 1 to 5. The epithelialization score ranges from 1 to 5. The total score from these sub-scores added together is used as the total BWAT score. For all sub-score values, a value of 0 or 1 is a better outcome.</description>

    <description>A powder-like fibrillar collagen microsponge composed of Type I porcine dermis collagen. The dressing is a currently marketed, cleared device in the United States, indicated for the management of full and partial thickness wounds: pressure ulcers, diabetic ulcers, caused by mixed vascular origin, venous ulcers, and several other wound types.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has one of the following types of wounds below the knee: diabetic ulcers, pressure
             ulcers, venous ulcers, ulcers of mixed-vascular origin, traumatic wounds, or
             post-surgical wounds

          -  Wound has been present for at least four weeks

          -  Wound is free of necrotic tissue or debridement practices will take place prior to
             initial visit in order to remove necrotic tissue

          -  Wound has failed at least one wound care treatment

          -  Wound size is between 1 and 100 square centimeters

          -  Patient has adequate circulation as demonstrated by biphasic or triphasic Doppler
             waveform, measured within three months prior to study enrollment. If monophasic on
             exam, then non-invasive tests must display Ankle Brachial Index greater than 0.8 and
             no worse than mild disease on segmental pressures.

          -  Wound is confirmed as being free of infection and absence of osteomyelitis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study timeframe, or breast feeding

          -  Unable or unwilling to receive porcine collagen

          -  Wound is infected or presence of osteomyelitis

          -  Allergy or sensitivity to collagen

          -  Inability, in the opinion of the Investigator to follow protocol requirements, attend
             follow up visits in a timely manner, or otherwise comply with the requirements of the
             protocol
