  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fight against the scarcity of grafts is a major public health issue in France. Despite a
      very good success rate of transplants from brain-dead donors or living donors, the waiting
      time for transplantation continues to increase, leading to morbidity and mortality, as well
      as medical costs. Since 2005, the BioMedicine Agency has implemented a protocol authorizing
      kidney and liver samples taken from deceased donors after cardiac arrest (DDAC). This type of
      sampling has become a common practice in several regions of France and Europe. In case of
      DDAC, the sampling protocol poses a significant temporal constraint, since the patient must
      be taken within 6 hours after the cardiac arrest. This constraint leads to a specific
      organization of the announcement of the death and the request for non-opposition to the levy.

      The brutal loss of a loved one is a potentially traumatic experience for family members. The
      manifestations of the pathological components of mourning such as post-traumatic stress
      disorder, anxio-depressive syndrome, pathological bereavement, are often expressed early in
      the first year after the death of the loved one. Families of organ donor patients probably
      represent a population at high risk for the expression of psychiatric conditions such as
      post-traumatic stress disorder or pathological bereavement. The limited time available to
      prepare relatives to make a decision could promote the expression of psychiatric morbidity in
      the short or medium term. The data on this new transplantation procedure and its
      psychological consequences are insufficient, and we consider that if a state of
      post-traumatic stress occurred in more than 50% of parents, the procedure of announcement
      would be reviewed. The purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis.

      Most of the work on relatives of potential organ donors has focused on procedures for brain
      death. Most of this work has focused on characterizing the determinants of acceptance or
      refusal of organ donation in the family. The literature relating to the follow-up of
      relatives of a patient after organ donation is very poor: very few studies have focused on
      the psychological consequences and / or the psychological state of this population in the
      period post-death. In addition, very few qualitative and quantitative studies make it
      possible to evaluate the appearance of psychopathological manifestations related to the
      announcement of death simultaneously with a request for organ removal. This research,
      therefore, will make it possible to estimate the possible psychological impact on the
      bereaved family as well as an assessment of the psychological state. A mixed methodology
      (quantitative and qualitative) will make it possible to highlight explanatory factors of the
      quantitative results.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of relatives with post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months with a score ≥ 33 on the Impact of Event Scale - Revised.
The Impact of Event Scale - Revised measures symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, numbing and hyperarousal with respect to a particular life-threatening event. Subscales of the scale: Intrusion scale (range 0-24 score); avoidance scale (range 0-26 score); hyperarousal scale (range 0-18 score. Range of the scale 0-88 scores.
Score 24 and more: PTSD is a clinical concern. Score 33 and above : This represents the best cutoff for a probable diagnosis of PTSD Score 37 and more : This is high enough to suppress the immune system's functioning (even 10 years after an impact event).</description>

    <measure>Score of depression and anxiety (Hospital of Anxiety and Depression Scale).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital of Anxiety and Depression Scale measures an anxio-depressive symptomatology and evaluates its severity. It does not try to distinguish different types of depression or anxiety states. This scale was constructed excluding any item concerning somatic aspects. Subscale anxiety (range score 0-21) and Subscale depression (range score 0-21). The thresholds for the sub scores are:
0-7 score = no anxiety disorder or depressive disorder; 8-10 = anxiety disorder or depressive disorder suspected; 11-21 = anxiety disorder or depressive disorder.
Range total score= 0-42. The thresholds for a total score are:
0-14 score= no anxiety or depressive disorder 15-42 score= existence of an anxiety or depressive disorder.</description>

    <measure>Score of pathological mourning (Inventory of Complicated Grief)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Inventory of Complicated Grief measures the symptoms of 'complicated grief'.The complicated grief is identified by the extended length of time of the symptoms, the interference in normal function caused by the symptoms, or by the intensity of the symptoms (for example, intense suicidal thoughts or acts).The complicated grief may appear as a complete absence of grief and mourning, an ongoing inability to experience normal grief reactions, delayed grief, conflicted grief, or chronic grief. Factors that contribute to the chance that one may experience complicated grief include the suddenness of the death, the gender of the person in mourning, and the relationship to the deceased.
Range total score= 0-88. Respondents with ICG scores greater than 25 are significantly more impaired in social, general, mental and physical health functioning and in bodily pain than those with ICG scores less than or equal to 25.
No subscales.</description>
