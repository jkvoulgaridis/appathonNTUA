    <textblock>
      The aim of study is evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy in of the treatment
      myogenic temporomandibular disorders.

      They will enrolled 100 patient which will be divided into two groups. The primary objective
      is evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy on pain (measured with the Visual Analogic
      Scale - VAS scale).

      The second objective is evaluate mandibular motion (by measuring the range of motion - ROM)
      and investigate the presence of psychosocial factors (using the Anxiety and Depression Scale
      - HADS questionnaire).

    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled clinical trial with randomization according to a multi-phase design.

      Phase 1 involves the enrollment of patients with DTMs based on diagnostic criteria.

      Phase 2 includes the algogenic, kinetic and gnathological evaluation of the enrolled
      patients.

      Phase 3 provides for the adoption of the criterion to one of the 2 treatment groups on the
      basis of the randomization list.

      The 2 therapeutic protocols are:

        -  gnathological therapy (splint) associated with education and physiotherapy (test group);

        -  gnathological therapy (splint) associated with education (control group). During the
           first visit the patient will be enlisted by evaluating the inclusion and exclusion
           criteria and signed the informed consent, he / she will be assigned a unique
           identification code.

      The code consists of a progressive number followed by the patient's initials (eg 01-F.R.).

      Subsequently, the patients will be randomized blinded and assigned to one of the two study
      groups.

      Randomization will be performed using random, computer-generated, centralized numbers placed
      in sealed opaque envelopes provided by the study coordinator.

      Both types of treatment will be performed by a single operator respectively.

    <measure>Evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy using the VAS scale which allows to measure the varation of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from initial VAS at 3 and 6 months from the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS measures the intensity of the pain that thethe patient perceived and it is represented by a 10 cm long scale with a score from 0 to 10. The VAS will be evaluated in 3 times: at rest; during the maximum buccal opening; during chewing</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ROM (range of motion)</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement of the ROM occurs at the recruitment then at 3 and 6 months from the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ROM measures the joint function. It provides the analytical and millimetric measurement of functional movements with a precision gauge positioned between the incisal edges of the upper and lower anterior groups.
It should be noted: maximum buccal opening; deviation of the median line; left and right lateral movements; overjet and overbite.
It should also be noted the extent of final elasticity (or end-feel test and its nature (elastic, painful, hard)</description>

    <measure>Psychosocial factors with questionnaire of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire is administered at the recruitment then at 3 and 6 months from the beginning of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) is a questionnaire used to identify the presence of anxiety and depression in people with non-psychiatric health problems. It is divided into two subscales, one on anxiety (HADS-A) and one on depression (HADS-D), each containing seven mixed items. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, with a maximum score of 11 for each subscale. A score of 11 or more indicates a significant case of psychiatric comorbidity, a score of 8-10 means the presence of a disorder, a score of 7 or less is considered normal8.</description>

    <description>Alginate impressions will be taken and the plaster models of the dental arches will be made.

    <description>The treatment consists of a series of interventions: advice on self-treatment techniques to be performed at home and administering manual therapy techniques addressed to: temporomandibular district, cervical and cervico-thoracic junction.
Each session will be carried out individually and will last for 45 minutes. This duration will be divided as follows: 25 minutes dedicated to the temporomandibular district, 15 minutes to the cervical and cervico-thoracic junction, 5 minutes to teaching self-treatment techniques to be carried out at home and to verify the correct way of performing them.
The cycle will consist of 10 sessions distributed over 3 months.</description>
