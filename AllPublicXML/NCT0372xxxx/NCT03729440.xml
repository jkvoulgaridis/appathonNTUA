  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal stricture is one of the most common sequelae of caustic injury. Up to 70% of
      patients with grade IIB and more than 90% of patients with grade III injury are likely to
      develop esophageal stricture. Stricture formation can be prevented by suppressing fibrosis
      and scar formation therefore; many agents are explored for treatment on various models in
      this subject.

      In spite of the multiple efforts to educate the public, Caustic ingestion maintains its place
      as an important public health issue due to the availability of caustic agents and the loose
      regulatory control on its production. All the cases will be evaluated by detailed history and
      thorough physical examination and necessary investigations. Patient's sheet will include;
      name, age, sex, occupation, residence, type of administrated substance, route and mode of
      exposure, symptoms and sighs (pain , vomiting , diarrhea) and any received treatment.
