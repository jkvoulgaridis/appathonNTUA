  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is a major public health concern. Approximately one in four
      consult their general practitioner (GP) with a musculoskeletal problem during the course of a
      year, making it the largest diagnostic group.

      Modifiable factors including affective disorders (e.g. anxiety and depressive symptoms) and
      sleep problems may be important prognostic factors for MSK pain. However, there is a lack of
      prospective research examining the interaction between these conditions in patients with MSK
      pain in a GP-setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of 299 participants from a GP-setting. Investigators will
      evaluate the occurrence of MSK pain at one-year follow-up and how the predictors (anxiety,
      depressive, and sleep problems and multi-site MSK pain) are associated with prognosis of MSK
      pain.

      A secondary aim will be to identify those factors associated with new onset MSK pain.
      Participants will complete a sleep questionnaire (the ATHENS insomnia questionnaire)
      containing 8 questions about sleep quality and quantity and a questionnaire (The Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Score)) containing 14 questions focusing on anxiety and depression.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be MSK pain as evaluated by a self-report pain questionnaire. To be classified as having MSK pain, the pain must occur at least weekly and negatively interfere with the patient's usual activities. The prevalence of MSK pain at follow-up will be assessed to determine if patients from general practice who reported MSK pain at baseline still have MSK pain at one-year follow-up</description>

    <description>This outcome will be new onset MSK pain assessed by a self-report pain questionnaire. The incidence of MSK pain at one-year follow-up will be assessed among patients from general practice who reported no MSK pain at baseline.
To be classified as having MSK pain, the pain must occur at least weekly and negatively interfere with the patient's usual activities.</description>

        Patients aged 12 years and over visiting the GP during the study period in November 2017.
        The patients who consented to participate in the follow-up (299 patients) are eligible for
        one-year follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 12 years visiting the GP who contributed baseline data and over who
             consented to be contacted as part of a prospective cohort study

        Based on baseline assessment, patients were divided into two separate groups: The MSK pain
        group and the control group (representing the pain-free background population in general
        practice).

        Inclusion Criteria for MSK pain group:

          -  Musculoskeletal pain at any body site

          -  Pain least once a week during the preceding month

          -  Pain that negatively interfere with the participant's usual activities.

        The same criteria for 'MSK pain' apply for the follow-up study.
