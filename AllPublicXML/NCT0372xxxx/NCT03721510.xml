    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and anti-viral efficacy of PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 antibodies for HIV prevention and
      therapy. PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 are recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies
      that target a V3 glycan-dependent epitope region of the HIV envelope protein and the CD4
      binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV envelope protein. PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 mAbs were
      chosen for this study because of their potency, their ability to neutralize a wide array of
      cross-clade HIV viruses in a complementary pattern, and their proven antiviral activity in
      animal studies, e.g., their capacity to robustly prevent and treat simian-human
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus monkeys.

      The potency and breadth of PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 raise the possibility that
      monoclonal antibodies may be effective for HIV prophylaxis at low doses and against global
      viruses. Neutralization sensitivity profiles are complementary; and the combination of these
      mAbs with unique epitope specificities will provide experience assessing the potential
      additive, synergistic, or antagonistic properties of two bNAbs given sequentially.

             written informed consent will be obtained from the volunteer before any study-related
             procedures are performed.

          3. All volunteers born female engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy
             must commit to use an effective method of contraception from the day of the first IV

          4. All sexually active volunteers born male, regardless of reproductive potential, must
             be willing to consistently use an effective method of contraception from the day of
             investigational product administration until at least 6 months following the final
             investigational product administration to avoid exposure of partners to
             investigational product in ejaculate, and to prevent conception with female partners.

          5. All volunteers born female must be willing to undergo urine pregnancy tests at time
             points indicated in the Schedule of Procedures and must test negative prior to

             months after final investigational product administration.

          7. Willing to forgo donations of blood and/or any other tissues, including bone marrow,

             infection as suggested by the available medical history and laboratory data from the
             time of the diagnosis. Note: ART is defined as a regimen including &gt; 2 compounds,
             e.g., 2x nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus either non-nucleoside
             reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor.

        Exclusion criteria for all volunteers:

          1. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition, other than HIV
             infection, that is considered progressive or in the opinion of the investigator makes
             the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study.

          2. Any clinically relevant abnormality on history or examination including history of
             immunodeficiency (other then HIV infection) or autoimmune disease; use of systemic
             corticosteroids, immunosuppressive, anticancer, or other medications considered
             significant by the investigator within the previous 6 months. The following exceptions
             are permitted and will not exclude study participation: use of corticosteroid nasal
             spray for rhinitis, topical corticosteroids for an acute uncomplicated dermatitis; or
             a short course (duration of 10 days or less, or a single injection) of corticosteroid
             for a non-chronic condition (based on investigator clinical judgment) at least 6 weeks
             prior to enrollment in this study.

          3. If born female, pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy during the period of

             judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with volunteer study compliance.

          5. Bleeding disorder that was diagnosed by a physician. Note: A volunteer who states that
             he or she has easy bruising or bleeding, but does not have a formal diagnosis and has
             intramuscular injections and blood draws without any adverse experience, is eligible.

          6. History of a splenectomy.

          7. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within the previous 30 days or planned receipt
             within 30 days after administration of investigational product; or receipt of other
             vaccine within the previous 14 days or planned receipt within 14 days after infusion
             with investigational product (exception is live attenuated influenza vaccine within 14
             days).

          8. Receipt of blood transfusion or blood-derived products within the previous 3 months.

             within the previous 3 months or expected participation during this study. Note:
             receipt of placebo in a clinical trial in the previous 3 months will not exclude a
             volunteer from participation if documentation is available and the Medical Monitor
             gives approval.

         10. Prior receipt of an investigational HIV vaccine candidate, monoclonal antibody or
             polyclonal immunoglobulin. Note: receipt of placebo in a previous HIV vaccine or
             monoclonal antibody trial will not exclude a volunteer from participation if
             documentation is available and the Medical Monitor gives approval.

         11. History of severe local or systemic reactogenicity to injections or IV infusion (e.g.,
             anaphylaxis, respiratory difficulties, angioedema).

         12. Psychiatric condition that compromises safety of the volunteer and precludes
             compliance with the protocol. Specifically excluded are persons with psychoses within
             the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide, or history of suicide attempt or gesture
             within the past 3 years.

         13. If, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, it is not in the best interest of
             the volunteer to participate in the trial.

         14. Seizure disorder: a volunteer who has had a seizure in the last 3 years is excluded.
