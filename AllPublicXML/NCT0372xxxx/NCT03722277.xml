  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of variable load training in
      patients with knee osteoarthrosis.

      The intervention will consist of resistance training with variable load in knee extension-
      and flexion. The control group will receive conventional strength training with rubber band.

      Outcome measures will be the Knee Osteoarthrosis Outcome Score, functional capacity measured
      in a sit to stand test, 30m. pace walk and a 9 step stair climb test. Additionally isometric
      strength in knee flexion- and extension will be measured.

    <description>Based on symptoms/strength measured in an isometric maximum strength test at five different angles of knee flexion- and extension, participants will be training with variable load during both concentric and excentric phase of the dynamic movement. Initially participants will start at 40% of symptom limited isometric strength, this will increase to 50% during the training period.</description>
