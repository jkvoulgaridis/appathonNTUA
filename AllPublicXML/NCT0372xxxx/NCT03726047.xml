  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with chronic stroke (&gt; 6 months post-stroke) will learn a new walking pattern
      through distorted visual feedback. Retention of the pattern will be tested without visual
      feedback immediately after learning and 24 hours later. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      the control group or the exercise group. The control group will simply complete the learning
      task. The exercise group will complete 5 minutes of exercise immediately following the first
      retention test to test for the effects of exercise on retention 24 hours later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant time and money spent on post-stroke rehabilitation, stroke survivors are
      left with reduced walking capacity and significant disability. After stroke, individuals must
      relearn movements that have been disrupted due to damage to the brain, therefore, enhancing
      motor learning is critical to improving the rehabilitation of walking after stroke. In this
      project investigators will examine how individual factors influence motor learning after
      stroke and use this information to personalize post-stroke rehabilitation.
