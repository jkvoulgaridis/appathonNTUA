  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to test a guided e-mental health intervention called Step-by-Step for
      people living in Lebanon. Step-by-Step is a self-help programme delivered through an app or
      website and aims to treat symptoms of depression and other symptoms of psychological
      distress. First, a small study will be conducted to test the research procedure. Second, a
      large study will be conducted to test the effectiveness of Step-by-Step.

      People residing in Lebanon (i.e. Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrian displaced people), above
      the age of 18 with symptoms of depression will be recruited through social media, posters,
      radio and television adverts, etc. Minors (under the age of 18) and people who have plans to
      end their life will be excluded from the study.

      To test whether the use of Step-by-Step improves symptoms of depression, two groups will be
      compared. Participants in the intervention group will receive Step-by-Step, while those in
      the control group will receive basic information about depression and a list of health
      centres where they can get face-to-face help that is based on evidence. In addition,
      participants in the intervention group will receive weekly phone or chat support (up to 15
      minutes) provided through lay helpers who were trained and work under the supervision of a
      trained clinical psychologist. The study hypothesises that participants who receive
      Step-by-Step will have a higher symptom improvement than participants who receive basic
      information.

      In order to assess symptoms of depression and other symptoms of psychological distress,
      participants in this study will complete several questionnaires three times: At the beginning
      of the study, after 8 weeks, and then three months later (i.e. 5 months after the beginning
      of the study).
