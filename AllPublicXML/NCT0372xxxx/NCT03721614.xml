  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, active control, open-label, multinational, randomized clinical trial comparing
      single long BioMime™ Morph Coronary Stent System vs. two overlapping Xience family Coronary
      Stent Systems to evaluate safety and performance in approximately 200 patients with long de
      novo lesions will be randomly enrolled in a 2:1 ratio [BioMime™ Morph (n=133) vs. XIENCE
      family (n=67)].

      The study population should include patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to
      de novo lesions (lengths ≥26 mm and ≤56 mm irrespective of number of lesions) in native
      coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter of (proximal to distal) 2.75 - 2.25 mm,
      3.00 - 2.50 mm and 3.5 - 3.00 mm in patients eligible for Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary
      Angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting procedures.

      All patients must meet all the study inclusion / exclusion criteria before enrolment in the
      study. All subjects shall accept clinical follow up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 24
      months post procedure.

      10% of the patients [(2:1) BioMime™ Morph (13) vs. Xience (7)] will be assessed for OCT
      analysis from pre-designated site(s) and based on availability of OCT console at the site and
      Patient's consent. [Time Frame: Post-procedure and 6 months (±14 days)]
