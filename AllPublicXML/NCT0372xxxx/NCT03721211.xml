  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a PET imaging tracer as a possible means of imaging breast
      cancer.

      The imaging agent involved in this study is:

      -[11C]Martinostat (called C-eleven-Martinostat)

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study imaging agent in patients who have breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved [11C]Martinostat as an
      investigational tracer (a type of dye used to for radiographic imaging) in a select few
      research studies. The FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research.

      In this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called
      [11C]Martinostat in patients with breast cancer.

      The purpose of the study is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called
      histone deacetylase, or 'HDAC' in breast tumors. Proteins are molecules made from amino acids
      that perform activities in the cell for the body to function in a healthy way. Prior research
      suggests that HDAC levels or amounts can be altered in some breast tumors. The investigators
      are trying to develop a method of imaging the HDAC protein in breast tumors. This could help
      them to study protein changes that occur in some breast tumors, and potentially help guide
      treatment of breast tumors in the future.

      In this study, the investigators will take the pictures of the participant's chest, including
      the breasts, using a PET/MRI scanner. The investigators will the study tracer, or dye, called
      [11C]Martinostat to make these detailed pictures.

      [11C]Martinostat was initially developed to image the HDAC protein within the brain, because
      amounts or levels of HDAC can be altered in some diseases of the brain. In these previous
      studies of [11C]Martinostat conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have
      been no problems). While this is not the first time [11C]Martinostat has been used in humans,
      it is the first study in which the investigators are using this tracer to study breast
      cancer.

    <description>Evaluate the ability of PET-MRI to visualize and quantify uptake of [11C]Martinostat in breast tumors above background tracer uptake. SUVmax will be collected from the primary breast tumor and the normal background breast tissue.

             dimension on either mammogram, ultrasound, or breast MRI

          -  Have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General Exclusion Criteria

          -  Previously treated breast cancer

          -  Concurrent malignancy of any type

          -  Recent breast surgery (within the past 12 months) on the ipsilateral breast as the
             current breast tumor

          -  Impaired elimination (as defined as having problems with urination)

          -  Metallic foreign bodies that would be affected by the MRI magnet, or fear of enclosed
             spaces likely to make the subject unable to undergo an MRI scan

          -  Participation in a research study/studies involving radiation exposure within the past
             12 months

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, major kidney or liver disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Currently lactating (either breast feeding or breast pumping)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the radioactivity of
             [11C]Martinostat and the resulting risks of teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to administration of [11C]Martinostat, and because lactation may potentially
             affect the uptake of [11C]Martinostat on PET, breastfeeding women are excluded from
             the study.
