  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This within-person, crossover, 2-condition, placebo-controlled study compares the impact of
      two perimenstrual conditions on severity of suicidal symptoms in females with past-month
      suicidality but minimal risk of imminent suicide attempt. The two conditions are (1) natural
      perimenstrual withdrawal from estradiol and progesterone (during placebo), (2) perimenstrual
      stabilization of estradiol and progesterone using transdermal estradiol and oral micronized
      progesterone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of observational studies have documented increased risk of suicide attempt,
      suicide death, and more lethal attempts during the perimenstrual (around menses) window of
      the female reproductive cycle; however, no experiments have investigated the causal role of
      ovarian steroid changes across the natural perimenstrual period in risk factors for acute
      suicidality. In response, the proposed experimental work investigates a causal role of
      perimenstrual withdrawal from the hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in
      previously-documented acute perimenstrual increases in suicidality.

      Participants are 30 women between the ages of 18 and 45 with current suicidal ideation but
      minimal risk for suicide attempt. Using a placebo-controlled, crossover within-person design,
      the experiment tests the hypothesis that suicidality will be heightened during natural
      perimenstrual E2/P4 withdrawal (under placebo), but that experimental prevention of this
      perimenstrual E2/P4 withdrawal (with exogenous administration of E2/P4 hormones) will prevent
      these perimenstrual increases in suicidality and associated risk factors.

    <measure>Perimenstrual Change in Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) Suicidal Ideation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Midluteal Baseline and Perimenstrual</time_frame>
    <description>The SITBI is an interview designed to assess various aspects of suicidality, including ideation, planning, intent, and behavior. This outcome is a single item representing suicidal ideation severity from the SITBI interview which was measured as part of a daily questionnaire completed via smart phone. The question was: &quot;Today, how intense were your thoughts of killing yourself?&quot;. Each day, individuals chose a response ranging from 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Severe). Values could range from 0 to 4, and higher values indicate more suicidal ideation. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (final seven days of medication use in that condition) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (7 days starting on the day of the positive ovulation test for that condition). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease in symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Perimenstrual Change in Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) Suicidal Planning Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Midluteal Baseline and Perimenstrual</time_frame>
    <description>The SITBI is an interview designed to assess various aspects of suicidality. This outcome is a single item representing suicidal planning from the SITBI interview was measured as part of a daily questionnaire via smart phone. The question was: &quot;Today, how seriously did you consider acting on a suicide plan?&quot;. Each day, individuals chose a response from 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Severe). Values could range from 0 to 4, and higher values indicate more suicidal planning. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (final seven days of medication use in that condition) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (7 days starting on the day of the positive ovulation test for that condition). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <measure>Perimenstrual Change in Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 of Each Condition (Lab 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Hopelessness is assessed with the Beck Hopelessness Scale, a 20-item self-report measure with true-false items that assess hopelessness and the extent of positive and negative beliefs about the future. This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Summed scores range from 0 to 20. Scores provide a measure of the severity of self-reported hopelessness: 0-3 minimal, 4-8 mild, 9-14 moderate, and 15-20 severe. Higher values on the raw scale represent greater hopelessness. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <measure>Perimenstrual Change in Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 of Each Condition (Lab 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) includes 20 items that ask the person assessed to report his or her experience of mood symptoms. Instructions were modified such that symptoms were rated over the past week (rather than the standard 2 weeks). This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from zero to 60, with most persons attaining a score of 15 or less. Higher scores are considered worse. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 7 of Each Condition (Lab 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPPS-P (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsivity Scale) Lack of Premeditation subscale includes 11 items that ask the person to report experience of impulsivity over the past two weeks. Instructions were modified such that symptoms were rated over the past week (rather than the standard 2 weeks). This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from 11 to 44. Higher scores are considered worse. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <measure>Perimenstrual Changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) Anxiety Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 of Each Condition (Lab 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems) Anxiety scale includes 7 items that ask the person assessed to report his or her experience of anxiety over the past two weeks. Instructions were modified such that symptoms were rated over the past week (rather than the standard 2 weeks). This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from 7 to 35. Higher scores are considered worse. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <measure>Perimenstrual Change in State Self-Esteem Scale Social Evaluation Subscale (SSES-SE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 of Each Condition (Lab 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The SSES-SE (State Self-Esteem Scale Social Evaluation subscale) includes 7 items that ask the person assessed to report his or her experience of social self-esteem--that is, a sense that others are evaluating one in a positive light-- in the present moment. Instructions were modified such that symptoms were rated over the past week (rather than the standard 2 weeks). This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from 7 to 49. Higher scores are considered better as they indicate better social self-esteem. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in self-esteem, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

        <title>Perimenstrual Change in Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) Suicidal Ideation Score</title>
        <description>The SITBI is an interview designed to assess various aspects of suicidality, including ideation, planning, intent, and behavior. This outcome is a single item representing suicidal ideation severity from the SITBI interview which was measured as part of a daily questionnaire completed via smart phone. The question was: &quot;Today, how intense were your thoughts of killing yourself?&quot;. Each day, individuals chose a response ranging from 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Severe). Values could range from 0 to 4, and higher values indicate more suicidal ideation. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (final seven days of medication use in that condition) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (7 days starting on the day of the positive ovulation test for that condition). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Perimenstrual Change in Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) Score</title>
        <description>Hopelessness is assessed with the Beck Hopelessness Scale, a 20-item self-report measure with true-false items that assess hopelessness and the extent of positive and negative beliefs about the future. This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Summed scores range from 0 to 20. Scores provide a measure of the severity of self-reported hopelessness: 0-3 minimal, 4-8 mild, 9-14 moderate, and 15-20 severe. Higher values on the raw scale represent greater hopelessness. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

          <title>Perimenstrual Change in Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) Score</title>
          <description>Hopelessness is assessed with the Beck Hopelessness Scale, a 20-item self-report measure with true-false items that assess hopelessness and the extent of positive and negative beliefs about the future. This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Summed scores range from 0 to 20. Scores provide a measure of the severity of self-reported hopelessness: 0-3 minimal, 4-8 mild, 9-14 moderate, and 15-20 severe. Higher values on the raw scale represent greater hopelessness. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

        <title>Perimenstrual Change in Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Score</title>
        <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) includes 20 items that ask the person assessed to report his or her experience of mood symptoms. Instructions were modified such that symptoms were rated over the past week (rather than the standard 2 weeks). This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from zero to 60, with most persons attaining a score of 15 or less. Higher scores are considered worse. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase). Therefore, positive values represent degree of perimenstrual increase in symptoms, and negative values represent degree of perimenstrual decrease.</description>

        <description>The UPPS-P (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsivity Scale) Lack of Premeditation subscale includes 11 items that ask the person to report experience of impulsivity over the past two weeks. Instructions were modified such that symptoms were rated over the past week (rather than the standard 2 weeks). This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from 11 to 44. Higher scores are considered worse. Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in a given condition as the person's score at lab 2 (in the perimenstrual phase) minus the person's score at lab 1 (midluteal phase).

This measure will be collected at the second lab visit in each condition (day 7 following ovulation). Scores can range from 7 to 49.

      <desc>Assessed during daily study phone calls. Under &quot;Participant Flow&quot;, Arm/Group is represented by two condition order categories (i.e., &quot;Active Condition, then Inactive Condition&quot; vs. &quot;Inactive Condition, then Active Condition&quot;); this allows one to understand effects of condition order on participant flow. Here, Arm/Group is represented as exposure to active vs. placebo conditions, since that is the relevant grouping to understand how placebo vs. active medication influenced risk of adverse events.</desc>
