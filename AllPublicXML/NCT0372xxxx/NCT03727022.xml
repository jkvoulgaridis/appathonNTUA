  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study
      is to provide an initial evaluation of two intra-articular (IA) injections of SM04690 (each
      at the dose of 0.07mg per 2mL injection) approximately six months apart into the target knee
      of moderately to severely symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) subjects. Subjects who complete
      this 52-week long study will be eligible to enter the extension phase for an additional 52
      weeks of treatment.
