  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During laparoscopy, trocars are essential: they allow the passage of instruments through the
      wall. In gynecology, with exception, trocars 5mm (used for the passage of endo-scissors and
      forceps) and 10 to 12mm are used (especially for optics).

      Trocars are responsible for complications, such as vascular wounds, digestive wounds, pain,
      infections or postoperative hernias, or aesthetic sequelae, and should be chosen with
      caution: most complications of laparoscopy are essentially due to their placement, and the
      complications at the introduction of the first trocar are the most frequent.

      The MiniLap® system developed by Teleflex does not require trocars in the case of a single
      forceps, or a single 5mm trocar with the necessary forceps change (this is the Percuvance®
      system). The aim of the latter is to make minimally invasive surgery even less invasive,
      thanks to a reduction in the number of trocars used (in many cases, elimination of two
      trocars), smaller incisions (percutaneous use of instruments, with a diameter of 2,4mm) thus
      reducing the complications
