    <textblock>
      Techniques of the Cognitive Behavior Therapy combined with drug dependence psychoeducation
      was developed by research team. BDRC consists of 12 sessions, including an initial session, 3
      drug education sesssions, psychosocial counseling and behavioral skills. This initial session
      is designed to introduce the counselor, review the purpose and expectations of counseling,
      review the rules of confidentiality, agree on attendance times and rescheduling rules, and to
      begin to collect information from the participant on their drug use and risk behaviors.
      Behavioral contracting is a key component to this counseling approach. Drug education focuses
      on how heroin may influence patients' cognitive function and their HIV/HCV risk behaviors.
      Counseling and behavior skills trained patients to reflect their thoughts and learned new
      life skills in order to delay or abstrain from heroin use.

    <description>At the time of assignment to the counseling intervention arm of the study, there will be an initial meeting between the subject and the assigned counselor. As described in the counseling manual, this initial session is designed to introduce the counselor, review the purpose and expectations of counseling, review the rules of confidentiality, agree on attendance times and rescheduling rules, and to begin to collect information from the participant on their drug use and risk behaviors. Behavioral contracting is a key component to this counseling approach.</description>

    <description>Patients receive some HIV risk education for the enrollment; after that, health education is delivered irregularly (1-2 times a month or none), based on the patient's needs. During MMT treatment, the participant receives monthly random urine testing for opiate use and HIV testing as needed. Monthly meetings between the patient and physician are expected to occur however, there is no structure to these sessions and content is considered to be quite variable.</description>
