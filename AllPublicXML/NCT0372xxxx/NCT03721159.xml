  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The expression and quantification of Micro-RNA 146-a, was analyzed in the subgingival plaque
      samples of generalized chronic periodontitis patients with and without coronary heart
      disease. The demographic variables and periodontal parameters were assessed and correlated
      with expression of micro-RNA 146-a. The quantification of levels of micro-RNA 146-a was done
      using Real time Polymerase chain reaction. ( RT-PCR)

      The quantification of the levels of MicroRNA 146-a was analyzed in subgingival plaque samples
      of generalized chronic periodontitis subjects with and without coronary heart disease and
      compared them with the healthy subject.A total of 90 subjects were selected for the study and
      assigned to 3 groups based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Group I comprised of 30
      subjects with Generalized chronic periodontitis diagnosed with coronary heart disease.Group
      II comprised of 30 subjects with Generalized chronic periodontitis without coronary heart
      disease and Group III comprised of 30 systemically healthy volunteers with no chronic
      periodontitis or coronary heart disease. Demographic variables such as age, weight,height,BMI
      and income and clinical parameters such as plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket
      depth and clinical attachement levels were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were
      collected from all the 3 groups. The collected samples were subject to further molecular
      analysis for micro-RNA expression and quantification using RT-PCR.

          3. Should have ≥ 10 natural teeth.

          4. For group I Generalized chronic periodontitis patients with coronary heart disease:
             Generalised chronic periodontitis is defined as those having 30% or more sites with
             clinical attachment loss (CAL) ≥ 3mm.

          5. For group II Generalized chronic periodontitis patients without coronary heart
             disease.

          6. Healthy controls were selected based on the following criteria: Probing pocket depth
             (PD) less than 4mm, bleeding on probing (BOP) at ≤15% of tooth sides, and no
             periodontal treatment (Scaling and root planning or periodontal surgery) within the
             previous six months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with systemic conditions such as type I, type II and pre diabetes mellitus,
             respiratory diseases, renal disease, liver disease, collagenosis, rheumatoid
             arthritis, allergy, advanced malignancies and HIV infection were excluded from the
             present investigation.

          2. Use of drugs such as corticosteroids, antibiotics within 6 month of investigation and
             immuno-suppressive chemotherapy.

          3. Smokers and other behavioural factors which may influence the study.

          4. Patients who had undergone periodontal therapy within the previous 6 months.

          5. Female patients (due to hormonal changes and pregnancy which may alter the oral
             flora).
