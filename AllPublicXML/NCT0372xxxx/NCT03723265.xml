  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response
      in a real-world patient population and evaluate options to address non-response and patient
      management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Personalized CRT study is a multi-center, single arm, prospective observational study.
      The purpose of the study is to better understand and characterize heart failure (HF) patient
      management by characterizing the use and clinical benefit of Medtronic market-released
      features/tools within the HF Patient Management portfolio.
