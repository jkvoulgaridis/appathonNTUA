  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to search for effective and low toxicity anti-tumor angiogenesis drugs, jiangsu
      hengrui pharmaceutical co., ltd. developed the high-efficiency VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor apatinib. This drug is mainly used to treat malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR2
      to play an anti-angiogenic role. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that
      apatinib has good tumor growth inhibition activity for lung cancer. This study aims to
      further confirm the effectiveness and safety of apatinib third-line treatment for patients
      with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Apatinib, 250mg, once a day (qd), take it half an hour after meal (the time for taking the
      medicine should be the same as possible), and take it with warm water. 28 days is a drug
      delivery cycle.According to the patient's condition, a single drug was selected for 6 cycles
      of chemotherapy in gemcitabine, yew and ruibin, changchun. After the chemotherapy, the single
      drug apatinib was maintained.Adverse reactions should be closely monitored during the use of
      apatinib and adjusted as needed to enable patients to tolerate treatment. The adverse
      reactions caused by apatinib can be treated by symptomatic treatment, drug withdrawal and
      dose adjustment. In clinical studies, dose adjustment usually occurs in the second and third
      cycles (28 days is one cycle). In case of 3/4 grade adverse reactions, the drug can be
      suspended until the toxic and side effects are completely recovered. Exit the study if 3/4
      level of adverse reactions occur again after resumption of medication.
