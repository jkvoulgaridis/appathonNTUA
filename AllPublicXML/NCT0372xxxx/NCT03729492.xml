      Aim: To investigate if a symptom driven referral for chronic thrombosis in the lungs after
      acute pulmonary embolism is better than the current approach.

      Background: A number of patients with chronic thrombosis in the lungs after acute pulmonary
      embolism have dyspnea and reduced functional capacity without elevated pulmonary arterial
      pressure at rest (CTED). However, current guidelines for follow-up after acute pulmonary
      embolism will miss all patients with CTED, as referral for further examination is based on
      elevated pulmonary arterial pressure on echocardiography. Thus, the prevalence of CTED is
      unknown. The hypothesis is, that a symptom-driven referral of patients with previous acute
      pulmonary embolism is more sensitive in diagnosing CTED than the current approach.

      Methods and materials: Patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism in Region Midt
      (approx. 350 per year) will be screened for non-recovery or persistent pulmonary embolism
      related symptoms during their 3-6 months follow up at their local outpatient clinic. If the
      patient has persistent symptoms they will be referred to a scintigraphy. If CTED is suspected
      from the scintigraphy, the patient will be referred for full CTED work-up. The investigators
      expect to screen 300 patients for persistent symptoms with an expected study time of 3 years.

    <description>Patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in Region Midt (approx. 350 per year) will be screened for non-recovery or persistent PE related symptoms during their 3-6 months follow up at their local outpatient clinic. If the patient has persistent symptoms they will be referred to a V/Q-scan. If a V/Q mismatch is present, the patient will be referred to a full work-up for CTEPH/CTED.</description>
