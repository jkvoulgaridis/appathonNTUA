      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness, safety (tolerability),
      and duration of treatment response at 12 weeks of home versus office-based narrowband
      ultraviolet B phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Physician Global Assessment (PGA)
      and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) will be used to assess effectiveness, safety
      (tolerability), and duration of treatment response. This is a three year pragmatic,
      randomized, active comparator effectiveness study.

    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of ≤5 which corresponds to no to small impact of dermatologic disease on quality of life. DLQI is a 10 item survey that asks patients questions about their health related quality of life on a 0-3 scale. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired</description>

    <measure>Body Surface Area multiplied by Physician Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after randomization or earlier at discontinuation of phototherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment multiplied by Body Surface Area (BSA). BSA is a measure that asks the physician or his or her designee to assess the body surface area affected by psoriasis using the handprint method in which the palm of the entire hand approximates 1% of the body surface area. To do this, the patient's handprint, including the entire area of the palm and all 5 digits with the fingers close together but not overlapping, is used as a guide to estimate 1% of the BSA</description>

               1. History of photosensitivity or autoimmune disease such as lupus or
                  dermatomyositis which can be aggravated by ultraviolet radiation
