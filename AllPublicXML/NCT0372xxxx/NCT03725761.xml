    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of IMMU-132 in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing on abiraterone or enzalutamide. Patients who
      have progressed while on therapy with combination enzalutamide/abiraterone or
      ARN-509/abiraterone as part of ongoing clinical trials are allowed and may be enrolled in the
      study. To better understand the heterogeneity of response and in particular to identify
      patients likely to benefit, an extensive correlative biomarker program will be included to
      collect and analyze tumor tissue biopsies, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and circulating
      tumor DNA (ctDNA).

      A validated predictive biomarker would benefit the individual patient by enabling him to be
      treated with a safe effective oral drug and avoid one from which he is unlikely to benefit.
      It is also essential for prostate cancer drug development because the increasing availability
      of more life-prolonging therapies is making it more difficult to prove a survival benefit for
      the next promising agent.
