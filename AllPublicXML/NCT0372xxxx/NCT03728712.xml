  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation heterogeneity is a hallmark feature of most obstructive pulmonary diseases. In
      particular, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is pathologically and
      physiologically characterized by small airway destruction and marked airway cellular
      inflammation, which result in prominent expiratory airflow limitation, air trapping,
      hyperinflation and abnormal gas exchange. COPD is strongly linked with the exposition to
      inhaled irritants, most notably tobacco smoke, and is as such a potentially preventable
      disease. COPD-related morbidity, mortality and social costs are high: in Canada, COPD is the
      main cause of hospital admission among all chronic diseases and is the fourth leading cause
      of death.

      Diagnosis of COPD requires the objective demonstration of expiratory airflow limitation using
      spirometry. In the right clinical context, a post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC)
      / forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ratio &lt;0.70 is considered indicative of the
      presence of COPD, and therefore pulmonary function testing is required to make the diagnosis.
      However, the natural history of COPD represents a slowly-progressive continuum: active
      smokers that do not meet the criteria for COPD are still at risk of developing the disease.
      In fact, when compared to healthy non-smokers, active smokers without overt COPD can already
      show some pathological and clinical features of the disease. Notably, they report increased
      levels of resting dyspnea, chronic cough, lower exercise capacity, exercise-induced dynamic
      hyperinflation and marked airway inflammatory cellular infiltration, while conserving normal
      pulmonary function test values.

      These findings highlight the negative, clinically-measurable effects of tobacco smoking on
      pulmonary function, but also the limitations of standard pulmonary function testing in
      identifying the presence of early, mild airway disease and quantifying physiological
      limitations in these subjects. As such, there is a need for a novel, simple and reliable
      method of quantifying airway disease in this population.

      Quantitative lung ventilation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) allows an
      objective quantification of the regional heterogeneity of ventilation in humans. The
      coefficient of variation (CV) of the distribution of a radioactive tracer, inhaled during the
      test, allows the generation of heterogeneity maps and density curves of small elements of the
      lung. These variables are sensitive to the presence of COPD, asthma, air trapping and are
      correlated to even slight anomalies in pulmonary function testing in otherwise healthy
      subjects. As such, SPECT could prove useful as an early marker of airway disease in active
      smokers at risk of developing COPD, but its use in this context has never been formally
      tested.

      This pilot study addresses the question of whether lung SPECT could provide clinically
      relevant information on airway disease in active smokers without overt lung disease on
      pulmonary lung function testing.

    <description>Technegas-Tc99m is approved by Health Canada for the evaluation of ventilation. Technegas will be prepared with a Technegas Generator (Cyclomedica) according to the manufacturer recommendations with a simmer phase and a burning phase. 95% ethanol will be used to wet the carbon crucible. The crucible will be loaded with 20-30 mCi of Tc99m. Tc99m has a physical half-life of 6 hours.
Technegas will be administered to the patient within 10 minutes of its preparation, in a separate room than the scanning room. The inhalation technique will be rehearsed with the patient prior to the actual inhalation. The patient will be in supine position. A mouth piece and a nose clip will be used. The patient will be instructed to take 3 breaths of Technegas, starting after normal exhalation. A survey meter will be used to monitor the quality of the inhalation.</description>
