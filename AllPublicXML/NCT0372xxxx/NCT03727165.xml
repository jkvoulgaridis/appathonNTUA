  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition is considered the best way to feed those who can´t be fed orally. the
      standard protocol of administration includes continuous infusion for 24 hours; nonetheless
      this support is constantly suspended which causes a decrease in the nutrition administered vs
      the one formulated.

      Therefore this randomized clinical trial attempts to compare de standard administration vs.
      cyclic infusion during night hours measuring the formulated vs the administered volume of
      enteral nutrition given to the patient.

      The control group will be assigned standard 24 hour infusion of enteral nutrition while the
      experimental group will be assigned cyclic infusion during night hours. The variables include
      volume formulated, volume given in 24 hours, hours and reasons why the enteral nutrition was
      suspended, and related complications (abdominal distension, vomiting, and diarrhea).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be carried at San Ignacio University Hospital intensive care unit. Patients
      included will be over 18 years old who require enteral nutrition according to their attending
      or to the nutritional and metabolic support team.

      260 envelopes with the specific intervention were created. 130 of them are identified with
      number 0 which corresponds to no intervention, meaning continuous enteral nutrition infusion
      during 24 hours. The other 130 are assigned with the number 1 which corresponds to
      intervention, meaning nocturnal cyclic nocturnal enteral nutrition infusion.

      Envelopes will be randomly assigned sequentially from number 1 to 260, in which envelope
      number 1 will be assigned for the first patient. Each patient´s envelope will be labeled with
      its name and identification number. According to the information contained in the envelope
      the specific scheme assigned will be formulated.

      Envelopes will be kept at the Nutritional and metabolic support´s office; only research
      assistant will have access to this information.

      After 50% of the sample be achieved, there will be a data analysis to review the rate of
      intolerance to enteral nutrition in both groups.

      Principal investigators will review the entire data after completion of the clinical trial,
      measuring percentage of enteral nutrition delivered and intolerance to enteral nutrition
      feeding.
