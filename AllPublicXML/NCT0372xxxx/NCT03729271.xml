  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to improve treatment of patients with
      diarrhea predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) symptoms.Included patients will be
      requested to answer online surveys and will undergo treatment with rifaximin. Hydrogen breath
      testing and biologic samples collection will also be completed during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine whether hydrogen breath testing can be used to identify patients
      with IBS-D who are more likely to respond to rifaximin. Participating patients will complete
      a one week screening period when brief daily survey will be answered. Eligible patients will
      proceed with the treatment phase of the study, when patients will receive a 14 day course of
      rifaximin. All included patients will complete glucose and lactulose hydrogen breath tests
      before and after rifaximin treatment. Biological samples (e.g. blood, stool) will be
      collected at pre-determined time points and patients will answer daily brief survey for the
      duration of the study.

      It is anticipated that 210 patients will be screened to reach a goal of enrolling 110
      patients for the treatment phase of the study.
