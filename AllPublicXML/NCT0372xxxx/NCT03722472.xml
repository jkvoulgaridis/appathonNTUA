    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of single-vial lyophilized ID93 + GLA-SE compared to the
      two-vial presentation consisting of lyophilized ID93 and liquid GLA-SE administered as two IM
      injections in healthy adult subjects (aged 18 - 55).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a total of two doses administered IM on Days 0 and 56. Subjects will be
      monitored for approximately 421 days (one year following the last study injection), including
      safety laboratory analyses done just prior to and 7 days following each study injection.
      Tears and nasal swabs will be obtained for exploratory antibody analysis at Days 0, 70, and
      224. Blood samples will be obtained for immunological assays (secondary and exploratory) at
      Days 0, 7, 14, 56, 63, 70, 84, and 224).
