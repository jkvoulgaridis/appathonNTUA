  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become one of most important medical imaging tools over
      the past 30 years because it is non-invasive, requires no ionizing radiation, and provides
      exquisite images of soft tissues and anatomic structures with many tissue/disease specific
      contrasts. While MRI has served the community well for many years, it is increasingly clear
      that it also has significant limitations.

      One of the principle limitations is the lack of quantitative information for tissue/structure
      characterization. The current paradigm of MRI is to use a set of scanner settings to generate
      an image &quot;weighted&quot; by a specific MR contrast mechanism (physical parameter), where it is
      hoped that variations in the parameter will be accentuated. However, without quantitative
      knowledge of the parameters, the final image contrast may depend on many factors, which
      complicates image interpretation and diagnostic performance. Quantitative measurement can
      provide a great deal of information about tissue properties and pathological conditions,
      since these parameters ultimately determine the contrast that is observed in conventional
      images.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate novel quantitative MRI techniques in clinical
      studies to determine whether they can provide better, faster and more useful information for
      clinical diagnosis. In this study, the investigators propose to apply MR Fingerprinting and
      evaluate its performance for different diseases. These include, but are not limited to,
      diseases in the liver, kidney, cardiac, pancreas etc. The investigators hypothesize that the
      quantitative MR Fingerprinting imaging technique will lead to improved tissue
      characterization and diagnosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study will include English-speaking patients that are already scheduled to undergo
             a clinical MRI for diagnostic purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded.

          -  Women will be excluded from the healthy volunteers, due to a lack of funding for
             pregnancy testing. Funding for this will be considered for the future.
