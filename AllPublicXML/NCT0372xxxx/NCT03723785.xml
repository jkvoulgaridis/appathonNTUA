  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to look at the effect of decreased kidney function when getting
      one dose of insulin 287 and to guide dosing recommendations in people who have altered kidney
      function. Insulin 287 works in the body for a long time (long-acting). It is taken once a day
      by injecting under the skin. The main target patient group for insulin 287 is people with
      type 2 diabetes. Participants will get just one injection. The study will last for up to 80
      days. Participants will have 11 out-patient visits with the study doctor and one in-house
      visit of 3 days and 2 nights. Participants will have some assessments like several blood
      draws, electrocardiograms (ECGs), urine collections and capillary blood sugar tests.
      Participants cannot take part if they are hypersensitive to the study medicine, if they
      received any investigational product within 90 days before screening, or if they have certain
      diseases e.g. HIV or hepatitis or heart problems. Participants have to take photos if they
      experience any allergic reactions and send them to their study doctor. Participants' kidney
      function will be examined by a so called &quot;Iohexol test&quot;.
