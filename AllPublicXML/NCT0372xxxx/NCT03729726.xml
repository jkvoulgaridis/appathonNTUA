    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate the impacts of the
      Future Foundation (FF) 2.0 Personal Responsibility Education Innovative Strategies (PREIS)
      program on reducing students' sexual activity (vaginal), recent risking sexual activity
      without condom use, and unprotected sex (no condoms/contraceptives). FF will implement the
      2.0 PREIS Program with three cohorts of African-American youth in the 6th to 8th grades. FF
      aims to recruit and enroll 400 students who are new to the program for Cohort 1, 150 new
      students for Cohort 2, and another 150 new students for Cohort 3. These cohorts of eligible
      students will come from grades 6-8 in Woodland and McNair middle schools and projected to
      attend Banneker high school. Random assignment will be an ongoing process throughout the
      project enrollment periods. By the end of the recruitment processes, a total of 700 students
      will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group, resulting in 350
      students in each condition. Each year, the FF 2.0 PREIS intervention model will offer
      year-round grant-funded services, including after-school, summer programming, and parent
      engagement activities. The 350 youth randomly assigned to the treatment group will be offered
      the FF 2.0 PREIS program (Cohort 1 will target 200 treatment youth from January 2018 through
      June 2018; Cohort 2 will target 75 treatment youth from August 2018 through May 2019; and
      Cohort 3 will serve 75 treatment youth from August 2019 through May 2020.), while the 350
      students assigned to the control group may receive after school and/or summer programming
      from another community-based organization. The primary hypotheses for the RCT study are the
      following: significantly fewer numbers of students in the FF 2.0 PREIS intervention engage in
      vaginal sex than their control group peers do by the time of the end of the program and also
      at the six-month follow-up; significantly fewer numbers of students in the FF 2.0 PREIS
      intervention engage in recent unprotected sex significantly than the control group students
      do at the end of the program and also at the six-month follow-up; and significantly greater
      numbers of participants in the FF 2.0 PREIS intervention remain abstinent or report condom
      use during recent vaginal sexual activity than the control group students do at the end of
      the program and also at the six-month follow-up.

    <description>The Future Foundation 2.0 PREIS intervention model will include: a mandatory school-year program that offers after-school programming 4 days a week, including 120 hours of education (direct instruction &amp; homework support), 30 hours of health (social emotional learning &amp; sexual health), and 15 hours of student advocacy; an optional, 4-week summer program that offers 120 hours of programming each summer, including 16 hours of health (social emotional learning - service learning), 104 hours of project-based learning and enrichment (project-based learning in STEM - 64 hours) and enrichment (i.e., field trips, career speakers, and arts and crafts opportunities- 40 hours); and an optional parent engagement program, which will offer monthly parent workshops and quarterly events.</description>

    <description>The Future Foundation 2.0 PREIS intervention model uses a placed-based collective impact framework to provide a comprehensive intervention model, including: academic support and college and career readiness services, evidence-based social emotional learning instruction to strengthen protective factors and promote healthy transitions to adulthood, and trauma-informed, medically accurate, and age appropriate sexual health education. Moreover, the 2.0 PREIS program model features a unique student advocacy component designed to ensure that youth and their families receive the wraparound supports necessary for their students to remain on track for school success.</description>
