  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the Aerin Medical device (InSeca Stylus) when used to deliver
      radiofrequency (RF) energy to the posterior nasal nerve area to improve symptoms in those
      diagnosed with chronic rhinitis.

    <measure>Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) is a patient self reported questionnaire of four nasal symptoms: rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing. Patients will report their symptoms reflected or felt over the last 12 hours. Total scores can range from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates increased symptom severity. This study will measure the mean change in the rTNSS total score from Baseline to 12 week follow up visit</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment Related Adverse Events (Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>At or following the study procedure, and up to the final study visit at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Characterizing the type and frequency of adverse events reported. Subjects will be asked about possible side effects or adverse experiences related to the study procedure at each follow up visit. All events will be documented and identified as to its relationship and level of relatedness to the study device and/or study procedure. Date of onset, severity, duration and outcome will be documented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to 12 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>At least a 1 point improvement (decrease) in the rTNSS score. An overall responder rate of at least 55% is expected.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to each Follow Up Visit at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks post procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) is a patient self reported questionnaire of four nasal symptoms: rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing. Patients will report their symptoms reflected or felt over the last 12 hours. Total scores range from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates increased symptom severity. The mean change in the rTNSS total score from Baseline to each follow up visit: 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks post procedure will be recorded.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>rTNSS Individual Nasal Symptom Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to each Follow Up visit at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) is a patient self reported questionnaire of four nasal symptoms: rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing. Patients will report their symptoms reflected or felt over the last 12 hours. Total scores can range from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates increased symptom severity. Individual patient scores will be evaluated at each follow up visit at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks post procedure. Scores of each question will be summarized.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality-of-Life (QOL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The QOL will be completed by the subject both prior to the treatment procedure, and at the 12 week, 26 week and 52 week visits post procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality-of-Life (QOL) is a patient self reported questionnaire that will be used to gain understanding of the impact of chronic rhinitis on daily activities, feelings, symptoms and medication use. The answers use a 5-point Likert scale and range from Very Rarely to Very Frequently. Scores that are higher reflect worse rhinitis related quality-of-life. The QOL will be completed by the subject both prior to the treatment procedure, and at the 12 week, 26 week and 52 week follow-up visits post procedure. Response for each question will be summarized.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>The Subject Satisfaction Survey will be completed by the subject at the 12 week and 52 week visit post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Subject Satisfaction Survey is a patient self reported questionnaire to assess patient acceptance of the treatment procedure and results. 5 questions are asked on a 10-point scale where a score of 1 is a poor acceptance of the procedure and 10 is a positive acceptance. Subjects will be asked to complete the Subject Satisfaction Survey at the 12-week and 52-week follow-up visits post procedure</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Nasal Status Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Nasal Status Assessment is an evaluation, performed by a physician, of 10 specified physical or intranasal findings. Each finding is ranked in severity from Not Present to Severe. Each component of the assessment will be summarized.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The VAS Pain will be completed by the subjects at the 2 week, 4 week, 12 week visit post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a self reported score of pain felt during the treatment session and pain as it exists at specified visits post procedure. Patients will mark where they feel their pain exists on a 10 cm line. A score of 0 = No Pain and a score of 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable. Pain scores will be summarized for pain reported immediately post procedure and at the 2 week, 4 week and 12 week visit post procedure.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Concomitant Medication Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks visit post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will report any medication they are using at each study visit. Medication information will be summarized and reviewed to understand type, dose, frequency, duration and relation.</description>
