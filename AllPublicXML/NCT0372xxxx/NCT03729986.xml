  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether minimizing sternocleidomastoid (SCM) activation in supine position would increase
      diaphragm activation during loaded inspiratory muscle tests remains to be determined.
      Therefore, the purpose is to exam diaphragm and SCM activation during loaded inspiratory
      muscle tests in sitting and supine position in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle training usually performed in the upright sitting position. In healthy
      individuals, sternocleidomastoid (SCM) is rarely recruited during tidal breathing, but
      previous studies have demonstrated SCM activation during loaded inspiratory muscle tests in
      upright sitting position. Whether minimizing SCM activation in supine position would increase
      diaphragm activation during loaded inspiratory muscle tests remains to be determined.
      Therefore, the purpose is to exam diaphragm and SCM activation during loaded inspiratory
      muscle tests in sitting and supine position in healthy adults.

    <description>Loaded inspiratory muscle tests will be set at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure in sitting and supine positions. The orders of the two loaded test conditions will be conducted in random order with at least 20 minute separation. This is an observational study. Subjects will perform only 15 breaths with each loaded test condition to exam the performance of their inspiratory muscles. Loaded inspiratory muscle test is not for training.</description>
