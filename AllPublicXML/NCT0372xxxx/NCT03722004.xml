  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase IV randomized clinical trial that will assess intestinal and
      humoral immunity among infants who receive a combination of monovalent oral poliovirus
      vaccine type 1 and fractional dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, monovalent oral
      poliovirus vaccine type 1 only, and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk for circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) will increase in the years
      immediately after the cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in routine immunization
      programs. Judicious use of type-specific monovalent OPV (mOPV) will be necessary for outbreak
      response to prevent further paralytic infections and transmission; however, data on the
      intestinal and humoral immunity induced by mOPV1 are very limited. Furthermore, the
      additional benefit of fractional dose inactivated poliovirus vaccine (fIPV) on type 1
      immunity when given with mOPV1 is unclear. Data on intestinal and humoral immunity of mOPV
      type 1 (mOPV1) and combination use of mOPV1 and fractional dose of IPV (fIPV) are urgently
      needed and would be used to inform guidelines for type 1 outbreak response in a post-OPV
      world. In the immediate future, a strategy of shifting from bivalent OPV (bOPV) to mOPV1 as
      part of supplemental immunization activities in endemic countries is under consideration but
      data on intestinal and humoral immunity to support this change does not exist. This trial is
      designed to address both areas in which data are lacking.

      Healthy infants 5 weeks of age will be enrolled at two study clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
      and randomized to one of four study arms: mOPV1 + fIPV at 6 weeks, mOPV1 + fIPV at 14 weeks,
      mOPV1 only, and bOPV only. Infants will be followed-up until 18 weeks of age by clinic and
      household visits. Blood and stool specimens will be collected to test for vaccine response
      (humoral immunity) and vaccine virus shedding (intestinal immunity).

    <time_frame>Measured four weeks after administration of study vaccine(s). Vaccine response will be measured at 10 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks of age after 1, 2, and 3 doses of OPV, respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>Dichotomous (yes/no) variable defined as participants who are either seronegative (&lt;1:8 titers) at baseline who become seropositive (â‰¥1:8) after vaccination (seroconversion) or participants who demonstrate a four-fold rise in titers after vaccination between two specimens, e.g. a change from 1:8 to 1:32, after adjusting for expected decay in maternal antibodies. Antibody titers at 6 weeks of age will be the starting point for the expected decline in maternal antibodies, assuming at half-life of 28 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaccine virus particles</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 7 and 14 days after administration of the study vaccine. For Arms B, C, and D, this will be after administration of the first mOPV1 or bOPV dose. For Arms A, B, and C, this will be after the mOPV1 challenge dose at 14 weeks of age.</time_frame>
    <description>Presence or absence of vaccine virus particles in stool specimens.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reciprocal antibody titers</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured four weeks after administration of study vaccine(s). Vaccine response will be measured at 10 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks of age after 1, 2, and 3 doses of OPV, respectively.</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy infants 5 weeks of age (range: 35-41 days).

          -  Parents that consent for participation in the full length of the study.

          -  Parents that are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents and infants who are unable to participate in the full length of the study.

          -  A diagnosis or suspicion of immunodeficiency disorder either in the infant or in an
             immediate family member.

          -  A diagnosis or suspicion of bleeding disorder that would contraindicate parenteral
             administration of fIPV or collection of blood by venipuncture.

          -  Evidence of a chronic medical condition identified by a study medical officer during
             physical exam.

          -  Infection or illness at the enrolment visit (i.e., 5 weeks of age) that a study
             medical officer judges would prevent the start of study activities at 6 weeks of age
             (i.e., blood collection and vaccination).

          -  Receipt of any polio vaccine (OPV or IPV/fIPV) before enrolment based upon
             documentation or parental recall.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or reaction to polio vaccine, or its contents.

          -  Infants from multiple births. Infants from multiple births will be excluded because
             the infant(s) who is/are not enrolled would likely receive OPV through routine
             immunization and transmit vaccine poliovirus to the enrolled infant.

          -  Infants from premature births (&lt;37 weeks of gestation).
