  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some stimuli, such as sinusoidal networks in motion, or the best known, Necker's cube, are
      simple visual stimulations generating interpretations of unstable and oscillatory shapes or
      movements, mutually exclusive. Currently, the explanatory models of these perception
      phenomena are based on adaptation and learning mechanisms as well as the importance of noise
      in the perceptual and decision-making system. Often noise is a harmful component, but it can
      also be a facilitator in perceptual systems: the investigator's eye is always in motion, it
      is the micro-movements during eye fixation (phase of eye stability). In particular, the role
      of micro-eye movements has been identified in perceptual systems, and it will be necessary
      here to relate these micro-movements to the perceptive tilts facing multisable stimuli.
      However, how to access the perceptive states is a real question, since it has been shown that
      the participant's transfer of his perceptual state by means of a motor response can alter the
      very state of the percept. This is why the EEG activity will be analyzed to learn to
      discriminate the different percepts over time, without disruption of the participant's
      perceptual exploration endogenous activity.

      Each participant will benefit from a medical interview before inclusion to eliminate the
      contraindications to this study. The maximum duration of the individual participation of each
      subject in this study is 5 hours in two sessions. Each session lasts 2h30. Both sessions are
      spaced a maximum of 14 days apart. Each session includes EEG headset placement and oculometer
      calibration (20 min), followed by recording EEG and eye tracking activity during a visual
      cognitive task where the participant will be presented with multi-stable visual stimuli to
      watch. for one or two minutes after the tests. By repeating the essays and the conditions of
      presentation, each session will be organized in six blocks of 20 minutes each, interspersed
      with a break.
