  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal polyposis (NP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal and sinus mucosa leading
      to protrusion of edematous polyps in the nasal cavity. Prevalence of NP among the chronic
      rhinosinusitis patients is 25-30 %. NP leads to significant limitations in physical,
      emotional and social aspects of life of the affected patients. Sleep disorder is frequently
      reported by those patients with impaired nasal breathing. Till now few studies have
      objectively assessed the impact of NP on sleep quality. the objectives are to figure out
      sleep disturbances in NP and to analyze the outcomes of sinus surgery on sleep recovering.
