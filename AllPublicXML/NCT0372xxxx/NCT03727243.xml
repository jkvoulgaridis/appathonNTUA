      Background: Globally, sepsis is common with an estimated population incidence of 437 cases
      per 100, 000 person-years and acute mortality of 26%, one of the few major medical conditions
      whose incidence and resulting mortality continues to rise. However, true burden is likely
      significantly higher as a recent meta- analysis could find no data from LMIC where 87% of the
      world's population resides.

      Objective: Generate new knowledge that will eventually provide rapid and accurate information
      about an individual patient suffering from sepsis (or critical illness), including which type
      of microorganism is responsible for the infection and the severity and stage of the patient's
      immune response.

      Methods: MARS-India will be a prospective longitudinal, single-centre observational study,
      conducted in mixed ICU's of a &gt;2000 bedded tertiary teaching hospital in Manipal, India. The
      investigators will recruit to three groups- sex and age-matched healthy volunteers (n=150)
      and patients diagnosed with sepsis/septic shock or non-infectious ICU admissions such as
      severe trauma, severe burns and patients admitted to ICU after major surgery (n=400). The
      investigators have optimised a workflow to follow and describe the immunoinflammatory status
      of septic patients (as well as severe trauma/burn and major surgery) during the first 6
      months after their initial injury. At fixed time points the investigators will collect blood
      in PaxGene, heparin, citrate and EDTA tubes in addition to routine bloods and microbiological
      samples. Rectal swabs and stool will also be taken for microbiome analysis. Immune functional
      tests will be performed to determine whole-blood cytokine/chemokine production in response to
      ex-vivo stimulation using an 8-panel assay. Additionally, complete immunophenotyping using
      flow cytometry including HLA-DR expression and lymphocyte subsets will be obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New sepsis 3.0 definition has for the first time included a dysregulated host response to
      infection as the cause of organ dysfunction, however, sepsis remains a highly heterogeneous
      syndrome without an accepted definition of what constitutes a dysregulated host response. The
      field is only now realising that inclusion of specific characteristics of the host response
      (transcriptomic or immunological profiles) facilitate stratification of patients with sepsis
      into subgroups (endotypes), allowing for prognostic enrichment and targeted therapeutic
      intervention.

      Unfortunately, new guidelines continue to ignore the role of pathogens, virulence, sites of
      infection and lower-socio-economic settings. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether
      parasitic, viral and fungal conditions, common in LMIC, should be lumped with bacterial
      infections in the definition of sepsis. MARS -India will allow the investigators to compare
      these parameters and those of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens on the impact of the host
      response and outcomes in sepsis. Not least develop an accurate temporal association of
      endotypes and detailed understanding of the immune suppressed phenotype. A functional
      immunology approach throughout and correlations with changes in the gut microbiome will
      further fortify our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology to help establish a 'sepsis
      fingerprint' and framework for novel interventions in future. Epidemiology data in itself
      will considerably heighten our understanding towards a global perspective on sepsis.

      Furthermore, little guidance is offered in the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines toward optimal
      management of the seemingly cured post-acute sepsis patient, who is commonly readmitted with
      an infection or worse has a significantly reduced life expectancy (&gt;40% 1yr mortality in some
      studies). MARS-India will also aim to establish the burden of this stage of sepsis in a LMIC
      setting and study the underpinning pathophysiology in more detail to establish groundwork in
      uncovering pathways for future therapeutic targeting.

      It is apparent that biomarkers reflecting activity of targetable immunological pathways will
      be of paramount importance in managing the septic patient in future.
