      The purpose of the study to determine the effect of deep breathing exercise in smokers
      because deep breathing improve the lung capacity by filling the lung with the oxygen and
      improve the pulmonary function, it also reduce the stress and anxiety level by slowing down
      the pace of your whole body and therefore promote general relaxation and improve the quality
      of life in smokers, muscular activity or physical activity is also increased because by deep
      breathing maximum oxygen is reached to every muscle and they get nourish well so overall
      impact of deep breathing exercise is positive. Deep breathing exercise technique offered in
      the study are easy to learn and can be performed by everyone and everywhere safely, because
      there is no complex and pain full procedure. So deep breathing exercise have been proposed as
      a way of combating cigarette craving, improves quality of life and lung function.

    <intervention_model_description>Study was to determine the effects of deep breathing exercises in smokers. It was conducted on the general population of Isra Institute of Rehabilitation Sciences, Isra University, Islamabad Campus. 30 participants were selected through Non probability Convenience Sampling and later equally divided into experimental (n=15) and control group (n=15) through lottery method. Inclusion criteria were young smokers between 20-30 years of age and without any chronic pulmonary complication, smoking for past five years. Smokers with any pulmonary disease, acute infections, other systemic disease, chest deformity or any disability were excluded from study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In pursed lip exercise subject was guided to inhale through nose with mouth closed and exhale through pressed lips (pursed lips).
In Diaphragmatic breathing subject was instructed to place his one hand below the rib cage and the other hand on chest. The patient inhaled slowly so that stomach moves out against the hand. Tighten the stomach muscle while exhaling through pursed lip.
In powered breathing subject was to inhale and exhale forcefully with some movements like subject was instructed to inhale forcefully while moving his hands upward and exhale forcefully while moving hands downward.
These three exercise techniques were advised to each subject of experimental group. They have to practice these exercises 3-4 times a day with 10 repetitions each. These exercises can be performed in sitting position or in supine lying position. Subject can adopt any position in which he feels comfortable.</description>
