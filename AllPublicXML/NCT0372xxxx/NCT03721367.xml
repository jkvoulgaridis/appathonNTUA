      This is a pilot, cross-sectional study to assess liver stiffness and markers of hepatic
      injury, function, and fibrosis in patients with urea cycle disorders. This study will be
      conducted at 3 UCDC sites: Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, University of
      California San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, California and Seattle Children's Hospital,
      Seattle,Washington

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are among the most common inborn errors of liver metabolism.With
      early diagnosis and improved treatments, the survival of individuals with UCDs has improved,
      and this improved survival has led to unmasking of some long-term complications such as
      hepatic dysfunction and progressive fibrosis in a subset of patients. Hepatic complications
      in UCDs are quite variable and dependent upon the specific metabolic defect. Currently, there
      are no guidelines for monitoring hepatic complications or extent of liver disease in UCDs.

      The purpose of this study is: 1) To determine whether liver stiffness is higher in
      individuals with ASS1D, ASLD, and ARG1D as compared to females with OTCD, and to assess liver
      stiffness in other UCDs (citrin deficiency, NAGSD, CPS1D, and males with OTCD), 2) To test
      whether markers of hepatocellular injury and function and novel serum biomarker panels for
      hepatic fibrosis provide evidence of chronic liver disease in individuals with ASS1D, ASLD,
      and ARG1D as compared to OTCD and to assess these sample markers of hepatocellular injury and
      function and novel serum biomarker panels for hepatic fibrosis in other UCDs (citrin
      deficiency, NAGSD, CPS1D, and males with OTCD).
