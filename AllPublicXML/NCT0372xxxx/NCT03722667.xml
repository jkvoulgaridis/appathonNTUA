  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of a theoretically-derived
      technology-based intervention (called TechSuPPorT) and its associated neurological mechanisms
      for hypertension self-management in African Americans.

      The investigators will compare two intervention arms in this study, the Technology-Based
      Component Only arm (comparison group) and the TechSuPPorT arm (intervention group) in 20
      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension. We aim to:

        1. Determine whether there are differences in blood pressure (BP), health-related quality
           of life (HRQoL), and psychological health (affective well-being, depressive cognitions,
           anxiety) betweenTechSuPPorT and the Technology-based Component only arm.

        2. Determine whether there are differences in self-management behaviors (medication
           adherence, diet, exercise, self-monitoring BP) between the two groups.

        3. Examine whether self-efficacy, decision-making, motivation, patient activation, and
           perceived stress, and positive emotions mediate the relationship between the
           interventions and self-management behaviors.

        4. Determine if social support, demographics (age, gender, education), discrimination, and
           technology utilization moderate self-management behaviors, BP, HRQoL, and psychological
           health.

        5. Explore differences in neural processing (diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]/ task positive
           network [TPN] task-differentiation), and stress response (cortisol and inflammation
           panel) between the two groups.

      The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial to compare the effects of
      an Technology-Based Component Only arm and TechSuPPorT on self-management behaviors, BP
      control, and HRQoL outcomeson cognitive task switching between the DMN and TPN neural
      networks using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging
      (DTI). Both groups will be exposed to the three Technology-based components: (a) six weekly
      web-based modules focused on improving African Americans' knowledge and skills of
      hypertension management; (b) personalized medication adherence support (SMS reminder
      messages, adherence feedback, health and lifestyle tips) through Medisafe, a smartphone app;
      and (c) self-monitor BP with study provided BP monitor. Participants in the TechSuPPorT arm
      will receive the three Technology-based components plus positive psychological training, a
      structured online training and skill building techniques to promote optimism, resilience,
      well-being, and self-confidence.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators hypothesize that African Americans' hypertension self-management behaviors are influenced by the ability of the individual to task differentiate between the DMN and TPN neural processing. Furthermore, such behaviors will lead to improved BP control and HRQoL. Using a two-arm RCT pilot study, investigators will compare the effects of TechSuPPorT and the Technology-based component arm on BP, HRQoL, and psychological health (affective well-being, depressive symptoms, anxiety) and cognitive task differentiation of the DMN and TPN neural networks. Data will be collected at three points: baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Brain scans (fMRIs) will be captured at baseline and following the intervention at 8 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
