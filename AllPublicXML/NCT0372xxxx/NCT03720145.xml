  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of lifestyle medicine for the management
      of depression in Chinese adult population. The main components of lifestyle intervention
      typically include physical activity, diet, relaxation/mindfulness, and sleep. While lifestyle
      medicine has been recognized for centuries as a means to improve physical health, the field
      of lifestyle medicine in the context of mental health is still in its infancy. In the
      existing literature, there is increasing evidence demonstrating the efficacy of individual
      components of lifestyle medicine (e.g, physical activities and sleep) on depression. However,
      there is very limited research on the effectiveness of an integration of multiple lifestyle
      adjustments on depression.

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short form Health Survey - 36 items (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is used to assess the patients' general health and quality of life.

    <measure>Change in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MFI is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. Ratings on a 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the dimensions of general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SDS is a brief, 5-item self-report tool that assesses functional impairment in work/school, social life, and family life</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DASS-21 is a 21-items scales, comprises three sub-scales which measures the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress, over the past week. The DASS is based on a dimensional rather than a categorical conception of psychological disorder, thus it has no direct implications for the allocation of patients to discrete diagnostic categories. However, recommended cutoffs for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are given in the DASS Manual.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Credibility-Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-item CEQ yielded ratings of treatment credibility, acceptability/satisfaction, and expectations for success.</description>
