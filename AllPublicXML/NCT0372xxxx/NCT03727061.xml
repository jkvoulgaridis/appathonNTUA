      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of interstitial photodynamic therapy and to
      see how well it works with standard of care chemotherapy in treating patients with head and
      neck cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that has come back. Interstitial
      photodynamic therapy uses a light-sensitive drug called porfimer sodium. This drug is
      activated by laser light delivered through special fibers into the tumor. It is not yet known
      how well porfimer sodium interstitial photodynamic therapy works, with or without standard of
      care chemotherapy, in treating patients with head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of adjuvant porfimer sodium (Photofrin) mediated interstitial
      photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) in patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck
      cancer (HNC) who will receive standard of care (SoC) therapy that includes: chemotherapy
      (cisplatin or carboplatin and fluorouracil [5-FU]) and/or targeted agents (cetuximab), and/or
      immunotherapy (nivolumab, or pembrolizumab), i.e. standard of care (SoC) therapy and or other
      clinically approved treatment for the disease management such as: other chemotherapy,
      reirradiation or palliative treatment for pain control. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the
      efficacy of adjuvant porfimer sodium mediated I-PDT with SoC therapy by comparing the
      objective tumor response rate of a locally advanced HNC treated with I-PDT with SoC to SoC
      therapy alone, in patients with locally advanced or recurrent HNC. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between adjuvant
      porfimer sodium mediated I-PDT with SoC therapy and SoC alone, in patients with locally
      advanced or recurrent HNC. (Phase II) II. To compare changes in quality of life (QoL) between
      adjuvant porfimer sodium mediated I-PDT with SoC therapy and SoC alone, in patients with
      locally advanced or recurrent HNC. (Phase II) III. To evaluate the relationship between
      response rate and immune markers in patients with locally advanced or recurrent HNC receiving
      either adjuvant porfimer sodium mediated I-PDT with SoC therapy or SoC alone. (Phase II) IV.
      To evaluate the relationship between objective response rate and levels of serum alkaline
      deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity (SADA), a circulating biomarker, in patients with locally
      advanced or recurrent HNC receiving either adjuvant porfimer sodium mediated I-PDT with SoC
      therapy or SoC alone. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes and undergo
      I-PDT approximately 48 hours later. Patients also receive SoC chemotherapy (cisplatin,
      carboplatin, fluorouracil, cetuximab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) at the oncologist's
      discretion at either 7 days, 14 days, or 28 days later.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive SoC chemotherapy (cisplatin, carboplatin, fluorouracil, cetuximab,
      nivolumab, pembrolizumab) at the oncologist's discretion.

      ARM B: Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 3-5 minutes and undergo I-PDT approximately
      48 hours later. Patients also receive SoC chemotherapy (cisplatin, carboplatin, fluorouracil,
      cetuximab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) at the oncologist's discretion at either 7 days, 14
      days, or 28 days later.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 1-3 months for 1
      year, 2-6 months for 1 year, and annually up to 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale of 0-2.

          -  Patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer who failed to respond
             to standard therapy and are not amenable to standard curative treatment.

          -  Tumor accessible for unrestricted illumination for interstitial photodynamic therapy
             (PDT) (accessibility as determined by the physician).

          -  Patients are candidates to receive chemotherapy and/or targeted agents, and/or
             immunotherapy and/or clinically approved treatment for the disease management such as:

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months, in the judgment of the physician.

          -  Subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods
             (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form
             prior to receiving any study related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:
