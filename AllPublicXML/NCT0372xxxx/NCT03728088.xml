  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of an analysis of the communication styles and attitudes towards risk and
      uncertainty (i.e. non-technical attributes) in a surgical population with varying clinical
      experience.

      The study aims to investigate the differences and specific patterns in non-technical
      attributes that may be discerned in these groups and how these non technical attributes
      develop throughout surgical training.

    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the communication styles and attitudes towards risk and uncertainty in a
      population of surgical candidates (pre- and postgraduates), surgical trainees and surgical
      staff members, from the specialties of general surgery, orthopedics, urology and plastic
      surgery. After signing informed consent, participants complete an on-line questionnaire,
      which contains a set of validated tools.

      Initially, a cross-sectional analysis of the non-technical attributes will be conducted, to
      identify any patters, similarities or differences between participant groups.

      The study hypothesis is that significant differences can be observed in participant
      attributes, which relate to their clinical experience.

      Additionally, surgical candidates who agree to participate in this study and are accepted for
      a surgical training in either general surgery, orthopaedics, urology or plastic surgery, will
      be invited to repeat the questionnaire at a 2-year interval, to investigate the evolution of
      their non-technical attributes throughout their training and to identify general patterns.
