      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to characterize the safety of the
      second-generation FlexNav™ Delivery System for transfemoral implantation of the Portico™
      Transcatheter Aortic Heart Valve in symptomatic severe aortic stenosis patients who are
      considered of high or extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. Data from the study
      will be used to support CE Mark of the FlexNav™ Delivery System and Loading System in Europe.

    <textblock>
      The FlexNav European Union (EU) study will be conducted as a prospective, multi-center,
      single-arm investigational study.

      Up to 200 high or extreme risk patients with symptomatic, severe native aortic stenosis who
      are determined by an independent subject selection committee to meet eligibility criteria for
      Portico™ Transcatheter Aortic Heart Valve implantation via a transfemoral access approach
      will undergo a Portico valve implant using the second-generation FlexNav Delivery System.

      Subject data will be collected at screening, baseline, pre-procedure, peri-procedure,
      post-procedure, discharge, 30 days, 6 months and one-year from the index procedure.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Candidates for High Risk classification must meet all the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects must have co‐morbidities such that the local heart team concur the predicted
             risk of operative mortality is ≥15% or a minimum Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)
             score of 8%.

             a) A candidate who does not meet the STS score criteria of ≥ 8% may be included in the
             study if at least one surgeon in the local heart team concludes and documents the
             patient's predicted risk of operative mortality is ≥15%. The surgeon's assessment of
             operative comorbidities (including frailty indices) not captured by the STS score must
             be documented in the study case report form as well as in the patient medical record.

          2. Subject is of legal age or older for consent in the host country.

          3. Subject has senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis with echo-derived criteria: mean
             gradient &gt;40 mmHg or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s or doppler velocity index (DVI)
             &lt;0.25 and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of ≤1.0 cm2 (indexed Effective Orifice
             Area (EOA) ≤ 0.6 cm2/m2). (Qualifying AVA baseline measurement must be within 60 days
             prior to informed consent).

          4. Subject has symptomatic aortic stenosis as demonstrated by NYHA Functional
             Classification of II, III, or IV.

          5. The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and
             has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board
             (IRB) of the respective clinical site.

          6. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
             required post‐procedure follow‐up visits.

          7. Subject's aortic annulus is 19‐27mm diameter as measured by computed tomography (CT)
             conducted within 12 months prior to informed consent. If a CT i contraindicated and/or
             not possible to be obtained for certain subjects, a 3D echo and non‐contrast CT of
             chest and abdomen/pelvis may be accepted.

             All candidates for Extreme Risk classification must meet # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of the
             above criteria, and

          8. After formal consultation with the local heart team (including at least one surgeon)
             it is agreed that medical factors preclude the subject from undergoing operation,
             based on a conclusion that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity
             exceeds the probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically, the probability of
             death or serious, irreversible morbidity should exceed 50%. The local heart teams'
             consult notes shall specify the medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion
             and include a printout of the calculation of the STS score to additionally identify
             the risks in these patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Candidates will be excluded if any of the following conditions are present:

          1. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (defined as: ST Segment Elevation as
