  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged physical exercise (PE) is a challenge in type 1 diabetes with an increased
      incidence of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

      The purpose was to evaluate the impact of two consecutive days of carbohydrate (CHO) loading,
      followed by high intermittent CHO-intake during prolonged PE, facilitated by a proactive use
      of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (rtCGM), on glucose control in individuals with
      type 1 diabetes.

      Ten physically active individuals with type 1 diabetes were invited to participate in a 3-day
      long sports camp with the objective to evaluate CHO-loading and high intermittent CHO-intake
      during prolonged PE. 1.5 months later the same procedure was evaluated during a 90 km
      cross-country skiing race. Participants were instructed to act proactively using rtCGM with
      predictive alerts set for high and low glucose values to maintain sensor glucose values
      within target range, defined as 72-180 mg/dl (4-10 mmol/l).

      This is a descriptive, single arm, non-randomized interventional study. The intervention
      consisted of carbohydrate loading prior to and intermittent high carbohydrate intake during
      physical exercise and a proactive use of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (rtCGM) to
      achieve and maintain glucose control.
