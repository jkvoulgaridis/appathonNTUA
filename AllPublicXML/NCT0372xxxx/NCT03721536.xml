  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-flow anesthesia has been used for years with positive results, but its effects on
      hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation are not clearly known in high-risk morbidly obese
      patients who are prone to pulmonary dysfunction related to the obesity. Therefore, this
      prospective randomized study aimed to compare the effects of low-flow (0.75 L/min) and
      normal-flow (1.5 L/min) anesthesia on hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation in morbidly
      obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-flow anesthesia has several potential benefits. It improves the flow dynamics of the
      inhaled air, increase mucociliary clearance, maintain body temperature, reduce fluid loss,
      result in savings of up to 75% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce treatment costs
      (10 - 13). However, it is necessary to examine whether the reduction of fresh gas flow
      affects the quality and safety of anesthesia management, especially during high-risk
      operations such as laparoscopic bariatric surgery.
