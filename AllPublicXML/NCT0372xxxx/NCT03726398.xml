  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and scleroderma who develop pulmonary
      hypertension (PH) do not fit well into the current classification system and treatments for
      pulmonary hypertension. This study aims to better understand patients with ILD-PH and
      scleroderma and to determine if treatment with Macitentan is beneficial.

      The investigators aim to use pressure-volume loop derived right ventriculo-vascular coupling,
      pulmonary impedance, and invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to:

        1. Comprehensively phenotype patients with scleroderma ILD-PH and pulmonary vascular
           exercise limitation (PVL) relative to scleroderma ILD-PH without PVL.

        2. Compare the efficacy of chronic Macitentan therapy in improving 1) right ventricular
           hemodynamics 2) exercise capacity and 3) symptoms in scleroderma ILD-PH patients with
           and without PVL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have scleroderma ILD will be defined as having a total lung capacity of
             less than 80% predicted and CT evidence of fibrosis. The degree of fibrosis will be
             scored by a radiologist using the CT comparative scoring method of Wells et al (13).

          -  Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) as defined as resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure
             (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg with a wedge pressure of ≤ 15 mmHg during right heart
             catheterization.

          -  Stable ILD as evident by a stable FEV1 and FVC for 3 months prior to the initiation of
             the study, and be pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-targeted treatment naïve.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% or clinical,
             echocardiographic, and/or catheterization data consistent with heart failure with
             preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and/or moderate-severe aortic or mitral valve
             abnormality

          -  Patients with severe restrictive lung disease (FVC&lt;40% predicted) and/or obstructive
             lung disease (FEV1 &lt;55% predicted and FEV1/FVC &lt;70%).

          -  Patients with radiographic combined pulmonary fibrosis/emphysema (CPFE) will also be
             excluded if imaging shows predominant emphysema and/or obstruction is moderately
             severe (FEV1&lt;30%)

          -  Patients with a history of pulmonary embolism within the last three months or evidence
             of chronic pulmonary embolism.

          -  Patients with a known contraindication to right heart catheterization.

          -  Patients whom have received active or previous pulmonary vasoactive medication within

          -  Systemic treatment within 4 week prior to randomization with cyclosporine A or
             tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus (calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
             inhibitors).

          -  Treatment with cytochrome P3A (CYP3A) inducers within 4 weeks prior to randomization
