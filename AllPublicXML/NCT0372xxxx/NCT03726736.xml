  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance
      were treated with anlotinib（12mg，po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle） or placebo, the
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we envisage using anlotinib plus docetaxel treat
      the EGFR wild-type advanced Non-small cell lung cancer patients who were failure in the
      treatment of chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to further improve the patient's
      PFS or OS.

      This multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in China include phase I
      study and phase II study.

      Phase I study: to get the maximum tolerated dose of anlotinib when combined with Docetaxel.

      Phase II study: to compare the effectiveness and safety of Anlotinib Plus Docetaxel in
      patients of EGFR wild-type Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
