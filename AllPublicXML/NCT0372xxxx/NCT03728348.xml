  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to confirm the specificity of a multi-target stool DNA test
      (mt-sDNA), Cologuard, in an average risk population, ages 45-49.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects aged 45-49 at average risk for development of CRC will be enrolled. Subjects will
      complete the mt-sDNA screening test (Cologuard) followed by completion of a screening
      colonoscopy. The results of the mt-sDNA screening test (Cologuard) will not be provided to
      investigators for clinical management of study subjects. Personnel performing the colonoscopy
      and producing the resulting report and personnel performing histopathological review of
      tissue (if applicable) will remain blinded to the results of the mt-sDNA screening test
      (Cologuard) result.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is specificity of the mt-sDNA test (Cologuard) in the 45-49 age group in an average risk population, using colonoscopy with histopathology (when required) as the reference method. The primary analysis requires the one-sided 97.5% lower bound of the specificity of Cologuard to exceed 85.0%.</description>
