      This experimental, single-blind, randomized controlled trial study was conducted to compare
      the effect of the rapid injection technique without aspiration on pain level in the
      vaccination for the young adult students. The population of the study consisted of the
      nursing students who had to be tetanus vaccinated as a protective measure. The students were
      divided into two groups, as the rapid injection technique without aspiration and control
      group. The Numerical Rating Scale was used to determine the perceived pain level

      Study Design; This was an experimental, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

      Study Population and Study Sample; The study was conducted in Turkey, in a family health
      center (FHC) in Central Anatolia Region. The population of the study consisted of the nursing
      students (n:125) of the faculty of health sciences who had to be tetanus-vaccinated as a
      protective measure before the clinical practice. Sample selection was not performed in the
      study and the whole population was tried to be reached. However, as 53 students were
      vaccinated before and 2 students used a painkiller before the vaccination, the sample of the
      study consisted of a total of 70 students.

      The distributions of the students, who came to the family health center for the vaccination
      and were in accordance with the inclusion criteria, to the intervention group in which the
      rapid injection technique without aspiration was applied and the control group in which no
      intervention were applied by the simple randomized method. The papers with the same color and
      folding shape that represented the two study groups were put into a cloth bag. In order to
      provide the randomized distribution and reduce all the negative effects, the required
      explanation was made to the individuals to be vaccinated and they were requested to pull a
      paper randomly from the bag. In this way, the groups were balanced and totally 35 students
      were included in each group.

      The personal information form was filled for each individual, who came to the FHC for the
      vaccination and agreed to participate in the study, before the procedure. The tetanus vaccine
      was applied into the deltoid muscle of the left arm in the sitting position in both the
      intervention and the control groups in the vaccination room. All the vaccines were made by a
      single researcher in order to eliminate the vaccination differences.

      Outcome Measures Pain Level; As the study was a single-blind trial, the pain assessment was
      performed by another nurse, in the second minute after the injection, using the numerical
      pain rating scale, in order to provide neutrality. The nurse was informed by the researcher
      about the use of the scale. The nurses had no conflict of interest.

    <description>As the study was a single-blind trial, the pain assessment was performed by another nurse, in the second minute after the injection, using the numerical pain rating scale, in order to provide neutrality. The nurse was informed by the researcher about the use of the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to the VAS, the NPRS is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes (Rodrigues, 2001; Hawker, 2011). The scale is composed of numbers between 0 and 10. The pain scoring is performed in the way that the individual chooses the closest point related to his/her pain. &quot;0 point&quot; signifies no pain and &quot;10 points&quot; signify worst pain.</description>

    <description>After filling in the personal information form, the tetanus vaccine was administered by using rapid injection without aspiration technique (the injector was held at 90 degrees, it was pricked into tissue rapidly, and the drug was given in 1-2 seconds without performing aspiration). (the injector was held at 90 degrees, it was pricked into tissue rapidly, and the drug was given in 1-2 seconds without performing aspiration). 2 days after the vaccination, the researcher got in contact with the students in the intervention and the control groups in order to ask whether a local side effect developed in the vaccination site or not.</description>
