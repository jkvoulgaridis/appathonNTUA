      This study applies the regenerative properties of autologous fat transfer to treat mild to
      moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in comparison to the current standard of care, corticosteroid
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize the fat transfer would prevent scar formation and
      aid in nerve excursion along the canal (while the neoangiogenic and regenerative growth
      factors could stimulate nerve regeneration) better than the standard of care treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy affecting up to 13% of
      Americans; CTS is caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel leading to
      nerve ischemia and symptoms of numbness, pain, and tingling. Treatment options depend on the
      severity of symptoms and range from noninvasive options (most commonly, steroid injections)
      to definitive surgical release of the compressed median nerve. Both non-invasive techniques
      and surgical intervention have their shortcomings; thus a novel approach for CTS treatment
      may be indicated.

      Lipografting is an established, validated, and widely used technique of plastic surgeons that
      injects autologous fat to correct contour deformities. From observing these reconstructions,
      plastic surgeons have witnessed the regenerative properties of fat transfer, specifically
      delaying the affects of chronic radio-dermatitis. These clinical manifestations have fostered
      numerous studies defining fat as a rich source of pluripotent stem cells with the potential
      for reducing scar formation, bringing neo-angiogenesis, and providing a barrier against scar
      adhesions This study applies the regenerative properties of autologous fat transfer to treat
      mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in comparison to the current standard of care,
      corticosteroid treatment. Ideally, the fat transfer would prevent scar formation and aid in
      nerve excursion along the canal, while the neoangiogenic and regenerative growth factors
      could stimulate nerve regeneration.

    <description>This score will be determined by Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), which is a validated tool/survey for measuring upper extremity disability. The QuickDASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance sport/music or work modules (4 items, scored 1-5). These raw scores are used to calculate a score out of 100, with a higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

    <description>Brigham Women's Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire is a validated tool for measuring severity of symptoms for carpal tunnel syndrome. The questionnaire is self-administered, with each item scored from 1 to 5 (where 1 indicates no symptoms or no functional difficulty, and 5 indicates maximum symptoms or an inability to perform the functional task).</description>
