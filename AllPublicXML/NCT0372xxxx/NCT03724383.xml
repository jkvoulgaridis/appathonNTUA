  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the investigators are to demonstrate a reduction in frequency and symptoms
      of AF and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors following a lifestyle intervention in
      patients with paroxysmal AF. Participants will be randomized into control or intervention
      groups. The intervention will receive step trackers, diet counselling, an exercise program,
      and risk factor modification consultations. Controls will receive step trackers and care as
      usual. Testing will occur at baseline, six months, and one year.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty percent of cases of non-valvular AF are associated with other modifiable risk factors,
      including: obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or sleep apnea. Treating modifiable risk factors
      has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with AF. Treatment of AF with
      antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation has not been shown to improve survival. Recently,
      small cohort studies combining exercise, diet, and antiarrhythmic medications and/or ablation
      have shown improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and reduction in AF symptoms and
      frequency.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate a reduction in frequency and symptoms of AF and
      improvements in cardiovascular risk factors following a lifestyle intervention in patients
      with paroxysmal AF. This study uses a reproducible intensive supervised cardiac
      rehabilitation that includes exercise, diet, and risk factor modification for patients with
      paroxysmal, non-valvular AF. The investigators expect that a lifestyle intervention will show
      significant improvement in fitness and weight loss and improvements in AF symptoms and
      frequency, and cardiovascular risk factors when compared to a control group with paroxysmal
      AF and similar baseline characteristics who do not receive a diet and exercise program.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Consecutive patients meeting eligibility criteria that are seen for routine cardiology follow-up will be invited to participate in this study. Patients who accept the possibility of diet counseling and exercise program will be randomized and stratified to 'control arm' versus 'intervention arm.' The final study results will be reported after completion of one-year follow up. We will also carry out a mid-study data analysis at six-months. Forty patients will be randomized to control arm and 40 patients randomized to the intervention arm. Intervention will include Phase 1, a six month program including three months of diet counseling combined with home exercise, followed by three months (starting at week 13) of an in-hospital, Cardiac rehabilitation exercise program. Phase 2 of the intervention will include six months of home-based maintenance exercise and diet (starting at week 25). The entire intervention period will be one year.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in severity of atrial fibrillation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation Scale (CCS-SAF), and the Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity Scale (AFSS).
The CCS-SAF categorizes severity of atrial fibrillation from Class 0 to Class 4, with 0 being asymptomatic and 4 being severe.
On the AFSS, individual symptoms attributable to AF are scored on a five-point Likert scale, such that the total AFSS severity score ranges from 0 to 35, with higher scores indicating increased AFSS.
These two scales will be used simultaneously to inform the severity of Atrial Fibrillation.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life on SF36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF36) measures quality of life. Each question is scored on a Likert scale with varying ranges (0-3, 0-5, etc.). Using a score conversion toolkit, the score for each question is converted to a value out of 100, such that lower scores indicate lower quality of life and higher scores indicate a higher quality of life. Those scores out of 100 can be added to get a score out of 3600, but the quality of life is most often reported as a percent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Fat Mass</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Relative Fat Mass (RFM) is a measure for the estimation of overweight or obesity in humans.
The ratio or the patient's height and waist measurements in meters is multiplied by 20 before being subtracted from a number (shown in bold below) that adjusts for differences in gender and height:
RFM for adult males: 64 - (20 x height in meters divided waist circumference in meters) RFM for adult females:76 - (20 x height in metres divided by waist circumference in meters)</description>

    <measure>Low density lipoprotein</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is one of the body's lipoproteins and an important carrier of cholesterol. LDL is an important marker for the risk of developing heart disease.
LDL cholesterol levels should be less than 100 mg/dL. Levels of 100 to 129 mg/dL are acceptable for people with no health issues but may be of more concern for those with heart disease or heart disease risk factors. A reading of 130 to 159 mg/dL is borderline high and 160 to 189 mg/dL is high.</description>

    <measure>Metabolic equivalents (METs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fitness will be classified using metabolic equivalents (METs).
One MET is defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest and is equal to 3.5 ml O2 per kg body weight x min. The energy cost of an activity can be determined by dividing the relative oxygen cost of the activity (ml O2/kg/min) x by 3.5. This study will measure metabolic equivalents achieved on exercise stress test.</description>

    <measure>Diastolic Function Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>here are four grades of diastolic dysfunction as described below. Echocardiography is the gold standard to diagnose diastolic dysfunction.
Grade I (impaired relaxation): This is a normal finding and occurs in nearly 100% of individuals by the age of 60.
Grade II (pseudonormal): This is pathological and results in elevated left atrial pressures.
Grade III (reversible restrictive): This results in significantly elevated left atrial pressures.
Grade IV (fixed restrictive): This indicates a poor prognosis and very elevated left atrial pressures.</description>
