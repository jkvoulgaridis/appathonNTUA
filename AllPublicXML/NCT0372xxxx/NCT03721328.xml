      Study Type

      Prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter (3 to 5 sites), interventional trial.

      Primary Study Objective

      The objective of the study is to determine the safety profile of local antibiotic irrigation
      for the treatment of PJI.

      Primary Outcome Measure

      The overall safety profile is characterized by assessing the incidence of adverse events
      (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), suspected adverse reactions, adverse reactions, and
      unexpected adverse reactions.

      Follow-up

      Patients will be assessed for all measures at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 12 months from
      initial surgery.
