  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Fluor Protector S in preventing
      tooth decay in adolescents and to isolate factors that reduce its effectiveness.

      In this study, half of the randomly assigned participants will received fluoride varnish
      (Fluor Protector S) and will be considered an intervention group. The other half will undergo
      placebo application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from 6 systematic reviews involving 200 trials and more than 80,000 participants
      further supports the effectiveness of fluoride varnishes, applied professionally 2-4 times a
      year, for preventing dental caries. Additionally, the simultaneous use of fluoride varnishes
      with fluoride toothpaste appears to significantly enhance the caries-inhibiting effect
      compared with the use of fluoride toothpaste alone. The relative benefit of fluoride
      varnishes application seems to occur irrespective of baseline caries risk, baseline caries
      severity, background exposure to fluorides and application features such as prior
      prophylaxis, concentration of fluoride or frequency of application.

      To determine the sample size, the results of epidemiological studies conducted in the
      framework of the health monitoring of the Polish population in 2015 in the group of people
      aged 15 years (dmf = 5.75) and in 2016 in the group of people aged 12 years (dmf = 3) 0.7 as
      annual growth of caries, and literature data on the effectiveness of fluoride varnish in the
      prevention of permanent tooth decay in the general population at 43% (a reduction of about
      0.3% per year in dmf, Standard Deviation = 0.8) and was considered achievable in the case
      Apply Fluor Protector S at 3 months intervals in the high risk group of caries. Size of the
      study group with such assumptions (α = 0,05, power = 80%, mean reduction of dmf: 0,3,
      Standard Deviation = 0,8 ; t test for comparison of two groups) - Minimum 84 patients [70
      patients+ 20% (dropped out), in both groups].

      Participants will be allocated to the &quot;test&quot; and to the &quot;control&quot; group, respectively, by
      computer-generated randomly permuted blocks using R package in statistical software..

        -  The children will be examined and re-examined clinically by the same examiners.

        -  Statistical analyses will be performed using statistical software, the level of
           significance was set at 0.05. Intra-examiner reliability was assessed by kappa
           statistics.

        -  To compare average values between two independent groups U Mann-Whitney test will be
           used (for e.g. to compare experimental group with the control one); Wilcoxon signed-rank
           test will be used for paired samples (for e.g. to compare first measurement with final
           measurement for experimental group). Comparison of fractions will be conducted using
           Pearson's chi-square test of independence and Z test. The 95% confidence intervals will
           be calculated on the basis of normal approximation.

      Purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Fluor Protector S in preventing
      tooth decay in adolescents and to isolate factors that reduce its effectiveness.

Dental examination Qualified for the study will receive oral and written information on the causative factors of dental caries, hygienic and dietary recommendations.
Oral hygiene instruction will be provided.
Caries risk assesment
Application Fluor Protector S or Placebo
Dental examination will be performed before the intervention (preliminary), after 6 months and after 12 months. Dental exams will include an interview, a physical examination , radiological examination (bite- wing x-ray images) and Diagnodent assessment.
The applications of Fluor Protector S (intervention A) or placebo (intervention B) will be performed every three months during one year.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence and intensity of dental caries</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The decrease of caries, which means a lower caries occurrence and intensity (lower caries index dmft/dmfs) when comparing to the placebo group.
Diagnodent assessment scale similar at baseline and at the end of the study. The same number of teeth/surfaces with no caries in the fluoride varnish group when comparing to the placebo group, according to scale:
0-14 No caries 15-20 Enamel caries 21-99 Dentinal caries
In the study, bite-wing images are planned at 12 months intervals. The scale will be used to evaluate:
E1 - carious lesion including &lt;1/2 enamel, E2 - carious lesion including&gt; 1/2 enamel, D1 - tooth decay in dentin, not exceeding 1/3 of dentin, D2 - caries in the middle 1/3 of dentin, D3 carious lesion &gt; 2/3 of dentin. Codes E1 and E2 will be recorded as pre-cavity, codes ≥ D1 as cavity. Primary outcome is no signs of caries during radiological examination in fluoride varnish group when comparing to the placebo group.</description>
