  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, open-label, interventional study conducted in approximately 42 subjects
      with AML harboring an IDH2 mutation.

      The overall study is a 3-arm investigation of the PK effects of enasidenib at steady state on
      the probe compounds. (Part 1), followed by treatment continuation up to 28 months (Part 2).

      Each arm utilizes different probe compounds; enrolls a separate cohort of approximately 14
      subjects; and consists of 2 parts - investigation of the PK effects of enasidenib on the
      respective probe compound(s) (Part 1), followed by an enasidenib treatment extension (Part
      2).

      Subjects can only be enrolled in one treatment arm. The probes (which are given twice) used
      in the study are approved for use in the countries where the study will be conducted. The
      probes in Arm 1 consist of single doses of caffeine (100mg), dextromethorphan (30 mg),
      flurbiprofen (50 mg), midazolam (0.03 mg/kg), and omeprazole (40 mg). Arm 2 probes consist of
      digoxin (0.25 mg), and rosuvastatin (10 mg). Arm 3 probe is pioglitazone (15 mg). Enasidenib
      is administered orally. All probes, except for midazolam, are administered orally. Midazolam
      will be administered intravenously.

      In Part 1 (equivalent to Cycle 1), eligible subjects will receive the probes on Day -1,
      followed by the first dose of enasidenib on Day 1. Enasidenib will continue to be taken once
      daily for 28 days. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected according to
      a set schedule. Subjects will receive the probes a second time on Day 28. Part 2 of the study
      begins the next day when the subject begins a second round of daily enasidenib doses
      (equivalent to Cycle 2). Safety assessment s and procedures consistent with AML standard of
      care will continue.

          1. Subject is suspected or proven to have acute promyelocytic leukemia based on
             morphology, immunophenotype, molecular assay, or karyotype.

          2. Subject has AML secondary to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

          3. Subject has received a targeted agent against an IDH2 mutation.

             a. Prior treatment with an IDH2-targeted agent is acceptable if such treatment was
             interrupted for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation AND the patient was
             responsive to IDH2 treatment without progressive disease prior to transplantation.

          4. Subject has received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt; 14 days prior to
             the start of study treatment. Note that hydroxyurea is allowed prior to the start of
             study treatment for the control of leukocytosis (however, hydroxyurea should not be
             given within 72 hours prior to and after administration of azacitidine).

          5. Subject has received non-cytotoxic or investigational agents &lt; 14 days or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the start of study treatment.

          6. Subject has undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 60 days
             prior to the start of study treatment, or on immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at

          8. Subject has or is suspected of having central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

             a. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if CNS involvement by leukemia
             is suspected during screening.

          9. Subject has active uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, or viral infection
             (defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement
             despite appropriate antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and/or other treatment).

         10. Subject has immediately life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such as
             uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated
             intravascular coagulation.

         11. Subject has significant active cardiac disease within 6 months prior to the start of
             study treatment, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV

             acquisition (MUGA) scan obtained within 6 months starting study treatment.

               1. The LVEF should be representative of the subject's daily status (ie, not
                  collected during temporary disturbances such as sepsis, acute cardiac drug
                  toxicity, acute pulmonary embolism, etc).

               2. An imaging-based assessment of left ventricular function may be collected at
                  Investigator's discretion as part of screening if needed to resolve uncertainty
                  regarding prior tests or current clinical status.

         12. Subject is known seropositive or is infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             or has active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).

             administered orally.

         14. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 180 mmHg or

             probe compounds or study treatment.

             Note: A subject may be enrolled into an alternate arm of the study to which the
             subject does not have hypersensitivity if that alternate arm has not been filled, and
             if the alternate arm is available in the respective country. Subject is planning, or
             has reasonable probability, to violate the restrictions. Note in particular the
             medication restrictions.

         17. Subject has QTc interval (ie, Fridericia's correction [QTcF]) ≥ 480 ms or other
             factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (eg, heart
             failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome) at screening.
             Reversible factors such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may be corrected prior to
             dosing if the Investigator and Sponsor's Medical Monitor concur.

         18. In conjunction with the restrictions, subject is taking the following CYP-sensitive
             substrate medications that have a narrow therapeutic range are excluded from the study
             unless the subject can be transferred to other medications at least 5 halflives prior
             to the start of study treatment: paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP2C8), phenytoin
             (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), thioridazine (CYP2D6), theophylline, and tizanidine
             (CYP1A2).

         19. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that places the subject at unacceptable risk or would prevent the subject from
             participating in the study.

         20. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
