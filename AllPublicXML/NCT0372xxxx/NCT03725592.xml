  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Develop and evaluate the effectiveness of multi-level participatory interventions in reducing
      arsenic exposure among American Indian (AI) communities from North and South Dakota who
      participated in the Strong Heart Study (SHS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design, implement, and evaluate multi-level participatory interventions that can lead to a
      sustained reduction in arsenic exposure in adults and children in Cheyenne River, Oglala, and
      Spirit Lake communities in North/South Dakota by: 1) building local capacity at the tribal
      and community levels to ensure the long-term sustainability of the interventions. 2) conduct
      a 2-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing arsenic removal device only to removal
      device and intensive education and promotion among 300 households, 600 participants.

    <intervention_model_description>Recruit and prospectively follow 300 households and 600 participants (2 per household) to one of 2 study arms (150 households per arm). Each arm will receive arsenic removal devices. However the Standard Arm will only be provided with written instructions on how to use the arsenic removal device and follow-up phone calls, while the Intensive Education Arm will receive up to 5 additional in-visits and phone calls to provide support regarding the health implications of arsenic and the proper use and maintenance of the arsenic removal device.</intervention_model_description>
