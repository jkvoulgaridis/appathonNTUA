  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to examine if including mindfulness meditation or
      physical exercise at lunch break improve workers' recovery from work stress. Therefore, 72
      workers included either mindfulness meditation or physical exercise during their lunchbreaks
      for a month in order to find out if these recovery strategies have more favorable outcomes
      than usually spent lunch breaks concerning: a) psychological detachment, b) perceived stress,
      c) general health, d) burnout, e) fatigue, f) quality of sleep, g) cortisol awakening
      response and h) immunocompetence.

      The investigators conduct an intervention study in a sample of 72 knowledge-workers, who
      engaged in mindfulness meditation or physical activities for five weeks. They performed from
      15 to 30 minutes during their lunch breaks. The investigators randomly assigned participants
      to three experimental conditions: 1) mindfulness meditation, 2) physical activity, 3) control
      group (lunch break as usual). Online questionnaires before and after intervention assessed
      long term changes regarding recovery processes, perceived stress, health, mindfulness and
      burnout. For daily changes, a mobile application was developed to assess changes once per day
      immediately after work. The investigators also collect saliva samples to map cortisol and
      immunoglobulin A excretion across the intervention period. The investigators had two
      follow-up measures one and six months after the intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spanish version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire of Levenstein</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Validation of the Spanish version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire of Levenstein et al. (1993). It is a scale to measure stress in psychosomatic disorders. It consists of 30 items, with Likert responses from 1(almost never) to 4 (almost always). The Spanish version has 6 factors: Harrassment-social acceptance, Overload, Irritability-tension-fatigue, Energy-Joy, Fear-anxiety, Self-realization-satisfaction. The higher score, the higher perceived stress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery Experience Questionnaire (Sonnentag et al., 2007)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery Experience Questionnaire (Sonnentag et al. 2007) is a measure for assessing recuperation from work. It has 16 items divided into four subscales: psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery and control. Each subscale has 4 items. Every items has a 5-point scale from 1 (I do not agree al all) to 5 (I fully agree). Higher scores indicates a higher degree of recovery from work stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spanish version of the General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg et al., 1997)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short version of General Health questionnaire. It has 12 items divided into three subscales: Stress, Coping strategies and Self-steem. Every item has a Likert scale to answer from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicates worse general health.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary Immunoglobulin A</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Level changes from Baseline to 1 month follow-up. Samples were collected in Salivettes -trademark- (a plastic tube with a swab) twice a day: in the morning (round 7am) and after work (round 7pm). There were collected two Salivettes every of the three moment of measuring (pretest, postest and 1 month follow-up). That means there were taken 6 tubes for every participant.</description>
