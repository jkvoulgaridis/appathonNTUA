  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to trial remote patient monitoring (RPM) in the postpartum
      hypertensive population in a randomized control design, with an aim to increase the number of
      blood pressure measurements taken during the fragile and under-monitored postpartum period
      and to thereby improve postpartum blood pressure control and reduce severe morbidity and
      mortality. The investigators plan to compare the number of blood pressures recorded in the
      first 10 days postpartum between patients who have been enrolled in an RPM trial to those who
      are being treated with the usual care.

    <textblock>
      Many women develop high blood pressure as a complication of pregnancy. This high blood
      pressure can often take many weeks to resolve, and for some women it never resolves
      completely. If untreated, high blood pressure of pregnancy can lead to serious consequences,
      such as seizure or stroke. Unfortunately, because most women are sent home from the hospital
      just 2-3 days after having a baby, the best way of monitoring blood pressure at home is still
      unknown. Most women are given a prescription for a blood pressure cuff to use at home and an
      appointment to see their doctor at about one week after delivery to review their blood
      pressures, but many women have trouble checking their blood pressures, sometimes because they
      have a new baby at home and sometimes for other reasons like transportation or difficult
      social situations. Using a Bluetooth blood pressure monitoring system might help women have
      better blood pressure monitoring after they are discharged from the hospital after delivery,
      and therefore help to prevent some of the complications that can happen because of high blood
      pressure related to pregnancy.

    <description>Usual care group patients will be assigned to the usual care given to patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). This involves a prescription for a blood pressure cuff if they do not already have one, with which they will be asked to measure their blood pressure twice per day. They will be asked to keep a log of their blood pressure measurements and to bring that log to their next provider visit.</description>

    <description>Remote Patient Monitoring patients will use a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff, which will transmit blood pressure measurements via Bluetooth from the monitor to a tablet, which is able to be accessed by nurses staffing a remote clinical care center. Patients will also be prompted to answer surveys assessing symptoms of preeclampsia. The nurses will review measurements and survey results, which will be flagged in order of urgency. The measurements uploaded into the remote monitoring system will also be reviewed at the patient's next provider visit.</description>
