  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a primary rectal cancer without detectable distant metastasis who after
      locoregional therapy only, meaning preoperative radio(chemo)therapy plus surgery have at
      least a 40% risk of not having a CRM negative resection or a recurrence, local or distant,
      within three years will be treated with the short course 5 x 5 Gy radiation scheme followed
      by four cycles of combination chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) and TME surgery

      The multicentre, multinational RAPIDO (Rectal cancer And Pre-operative Induction therapy
      followed by Dedicated Operation, EudraCT number 2010-023957-12) closed patient entry in June
      2016 after having randomised the planned number of 920 patients. In the study, patients were
      randomised to conventional chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to 50 Gy with capecitabine followed by
      surgery or to short-course radiotherapy (scRT, 5 x 5 Gy), 6 cycles of
      oxaliplatin-capecitabine (CAPOX) followed by surgery. In the CRT arm, adjuvant chemotherapy
      with 8 cycles of CAPOX was optional. At the time of closure of the RAPIDO study, it was
      discussed in Uppsala whether CRT should be the reference treatment for these high-risk rectal
      cancers, the experimental treatment or an alternative. Influenced by a Polish study reported
      by Bujko et al in 2016 with a similar design comparing CRT with scRT followed by 3 cycles of
      FOLFOX), it was decided that the reference treatment for patient with primary rectal cancer
      at high risk of failing either locally or systemically should be scRT followed by 4 cycles of
      CAPOX and surgery. This regimen, identical to the experimental arm in a Chinese trial
      (Stellar trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02533271), preliminarily revealing promising pCR rates
      has since then been the reference treatment for patients having the same inclusion criteria
      as in the RAPIDO trial. Other centres in Sweden have also decided to use this regimen as
      reference treatment. A formal protocol is written and approved.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Histological proof of newly diagnosed primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum

               -  Locally advanced tumour fulfilling at least one of the following criteria on
                  pelvic MRI indicating high risk of failing locally and/or systemically (T4b, i.e.
                  overgrowth to an adjacent organ or structure like the prostate, urinary bladder,
