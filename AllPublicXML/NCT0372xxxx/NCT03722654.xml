  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to advance the science of mental health services for adolescent externalizing
      problems (AEPs) by developing therapist training procedures to increase fidelity to
      evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in usual care. Two widely endorsed approaches are
      consistently effective for treating AEPs: family therapy and CBT. Importantly, stronger
      fidelity to core EBIs of these approaches predicts better outcomes in research and community
      settings. Yet these EBIs are not widely implemented with fidelity. To help close this quality
      gap in adolescent services, investigators will develop an online intervention to strengthen
      fidelity to these EBIs in routine care: Measurement Training and Feedback System for
      implementation (MTFS-I). MTFS-I will target two essential aspects of EBI fidelity: Training
      components will seek to improve EBI self-monitoring, and a Feedback component will seek to
      increase EBI utilization. In keeping with NIMH's Experimental Therapeutics paradigm, this
      study will examine whether an Intervention (MTFS-I) has direct impact on immediate Targets
      (EBI self-monitoring and utilization).

      If promising, future R01 studies will examine links among intervention, targets, and ultimate
      outcomes (AEPs). The MTFS-I package will be an online quality assurance system completed by
      therapists and supervisors that can be readily sustained in usual care. Two weekly Training
      components will adapt gold-standard observational fidelity coding procedures to promote
      improved self-monitoring of the targeted EBIs, and a monthly Feedback component will adapt a
      measurement feedback system to promote increased utilization of these EBIs in everyday
      practice. To maximize provider investment, sites will delineate their own fidelity standards
      for family therapy and CBT and help design feedback report templates.

      The proposed study will be among the first to (1) test whether training therapists in
      observational assessment of EBI fidelity increases the accuracy with which they self-monitor
      use of those EBIs and (2) adapt measurement feedback procedures to track and improve
      therapist utilization of EBIs. To achieve study aims the investigators will first partner
      with two community clinics to develop sustainable MTFS-I procedures using a three-phase Pilot
      process. Investigators will then initiate an experimental Trial during which therapists (n =
      32, treating 192 clients) at four different clinics will be randomized to MTFS-I versus
      no-intervention Control. In both conditions two kinds of data will be collected:
      therapist-report checklists on use of core family therapy and CBT techniques with adolescent
      cases and treatment session audio recordings. MTFS-I uptake will be tracked electronically
      for online components (Aim 1: MTFS feasibility). Session recordings will be coded by
      observers for three facets of EBI fidelity: adherence (extent of EBI utilization), working
      alliance, and therapist competence. Observer ratings will measure the strength of EBI
      self-monitoring (Aim 2: therapist reliability and accuracy) and fidelity (Aim 3 [EBI
      utilization] &amp; Aim 4 [alliance, competence]). If effective, MTFS-I could be adapted to
      promote EBI fidelity for a variety of clinical populations and approaches.

      Discovering and disseminating effective methods to improve the quality of available treatment
      services for adolescent externalizing problems is an urgent public health priority. Despite
      the strong legislative and policy focus on quality of care evident in the CHIP
      Reauthorization Act of 2009 and the Affordable Care Act of 2010, comprehensive reports
      underscore the enduring &quot;quality chasm&quot; between behavioral treatments proven in controlled
      research versus those commonly practiced in usual care. The quality gap is highly evident for
      adolescent externalizing problems (AEPs), which encompass serious conduct problems,
      delinquency, and substance misuse. AEPs are the most common adolescent behavioral issues in
      specialty care, which follows from high prevalence rates: conduct disorder has a 9.5%
      lifetime prevalence rate, and 19% of adolescents report past-year illicit drug use with 7%
      meeting criteria for psychiatric disorder. Yet standard treatment quality for AEPs is
      considered mediocre to inadequate due to a host of factors headlined by the absence or modest
      quality of evidence-based services, insufficient provider training, and little quality
      monitoring.

      Two behavioral treatment approaches are prime candidates for upgrading the quality of AEP
      treatment services. Both family therapy (FT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have
      excellent efficacy evidence for AEPs in both research and community settings. Each has strong
      support for treating serious conduct problems, delinquency, and substance use, and each has
      several manualized versions proven efficacious across the AEP range. Due to this extensive
      evidence base, there is incentive from clinical providers and payers to deliver these
      approaches in routine care: Both are now approved for treating AEPs by federal and private
      insurance plans and by regulatory agencies that govern licensed treatment providers. Notably,
      therapists report that both approaches are highly valued in everyday practice.

      By consensus, the most efficient pathway toward improving the quality of mental health
      services is to increase the adoption and delivery of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in
      usual care. However, there is a caveat: For EBIs to be effective in frontline settings, they
      must be delivered with sufficient fidelity to the principles and procedures of the approaches
      they represent. This remains a most difficult challenge for which innovative solutions are
      sorely needed. With regard to AEPs, controlled studies have shown that strong fidelity to the
      FT and CBT approaches predicts improved client outcomes in both efficacy and effectiveness
      studies. Yet, at this time, neither FT nor CBT are widely implemented with fidelity in
      community clinics that treat AEPs. To promote EBI fidelity as a core virtue of the behavioral
      care system, the study team published a theoretical model in which EBI implementation is
      recognized as an essential driver of positive client outcomes. This model includes structural
      characteristics of care that directly influence both implementation and outcomes, as well as
      outcomes considered relevant within the &quot;quality of care&quot; framework. The middle section
      depicts elements of implementation that have proven salient for effective EBI delivery,
      including technical factors (adherence to core treatment techniques, therapist competence)
      and relational factors (e.g., alliance), given that both are related to outcomes. According
      to this model and similar others, EBI implementation fidelity is a multidimensional construct
      with three primary facets: Adherence (extent to which signature EBI techniques are utilized),
      Competence (skillfulness and responsiveness of EBI delivery), and Alliance (working
      relationship between provider and client). In AEP research, fidelity-outcome studies
      consistently find that stronger EBI adherence and stronger alliance predict better client
      outcomes. Evidence for competence-outcome effects is less consistent, in large part because
      competence remains difficult to operationalize reliably. According to this framework,
      innovations aimed at improving service quality should directly target EBI fidelity; stronger
      EBI fidelity will then boost client outcome.

    <measure>Change in EBI Fidelity: ITT-ABP Therapist-Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Conclusion of every session for 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Inventory of Therapy Techniques for Adolescent Behavior Problems is a 24-item, post-session, therapist-report fidelity tool that meets key criteria for pragmatic measures: relevance to stakeholders, low burden, broad applicability, strong psychometrics, and useful for data-driven decision-making (actionable). It requires 2-3 minutes to complete and was derived from validated observational fidelity tools for manualized treatments via a stakeholder-informed instrument adaptation process. The FT and CBT items each measure the adherence (i.e., thoroughness and frequency) with which each technique was used based on a 5-point Likert-type scale: 0 = Not at all, 1 = A little bit, 2 = Moderately, 3 = Considerably, 4 = Extensively.</description>

    <measure>EBI Fidelity: ITT-ABP Observational Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The ITT-ABP observational version mirrors the therapist-report version, with the addition of two items. To capture Competence, we will use a single item (identical 5-point scoring scale): &quot;Please rate the extent to which you were skillful and responsive in today's session&quot;. Competence is difficult to judge reliably even for trained coders. Nonetheless, we have had moderate success in coding Competence with a single item for both EBIs via the observational version of ITT-ABP: ICC = .55 for FT and .56 for CBT, 58. To capture Alliance, we will use the VTAS-R Short Form, a 5-item observational measure of therapeutic alliance, defined as the collaborative working relationship in therapy. The VTAS-R Short Form has likewise shown strong internal consistency, high correlations with the full-length VTAS-R, and predictive validity for retention and clinical outcomes for AEPs.</description>
