      This is a single‑arm, open‑label, Phase 4 study evaluating the effect of GO on the QTc,
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity of GO as a single‑agent monotherapy in adult and
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD33‑positive AML. Approximately 50 adult (age
      &gt;=18 years) and 6 pediatric (12 years =&lt; age =&lt; 17 years) patients who satisfy the study
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Enrolled patients will receive GO 3 mg/m2 up to 2
      cycles on Days 1, 4, and 7 at each cycle. The impact of GO on VOD/SOS in the context of
      previous and subsequent HSCT will also be assessed. Patients enrolled in the study will
      receive three doses of GO 3 mg/m2 (up to one vial) as a 2‑hour intravenous infusion on Cycle
      1 Days 1, 4, and 7. A second cycle of GO 3mg/m² (up to one vial) on Cycle 2 Days 1, 4, and 7
      will be allowed at the investigator's discretion for patients who meet the following criteria
      after Cycle 1: Bone marrow with a decrease of blast percentage to at least 25% or a decrease
      of pretreatment blast percentage by at least 50%; and Blood count with neutrophils
      &gt;=1,000/µL, and platelets &gt;=50,000/µL, except in patients with the bone marrow blasts &gt;=5%,
      the decrease in neutrophils and platelets thought to be due to the underlying leukemia. After
      GO treatment, subsequent anticancer therapy such as consolidation or conditioning regimen
      and/or HSCT could be considered at the investigator's discretion. A minimum interval of 2
      months is recommended between the last dose of GO and HSCT.
