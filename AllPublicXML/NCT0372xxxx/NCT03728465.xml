  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma will develop brain metastases
      during their lifetime. A possible treatment options for patients with brain metastases are
      surgery and radiotherapy but usually for lesions in the range of &lt; 3 brain metastases. This
      study was performed to evaluate the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with
      stage IV melanoma with &gt; 3 symptomatic brain metastases, who are not eligible for surgery or
      radiosurgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are a frequent problem in patients with melanoma. Up to 50% of patients with
      unresectable metastatic melanoma will develop brain metastases during their lifetime with a
      median overall survival of 4 months. Surgical removal or stereotactic radiosurgery of brain
      metastases can improve overall survival in patients with a limited number of lesions, usually
      in the range of one to three brain metastases depending on neuroanatomical localization. This
      benefit is no longer present when considering patients with &gt; 3 brain metastases. As
      cytotoxic chemotherapy and multiple chemotherapeutic agents show only limited activity in &gt; 3
      brain metastases patients, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab
      offer new opportunities to improve disease outcomes for these patients.

      This open label phase II study evaluates safety and efficacy of combined treatment with
      ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with stage IV melanoma with four or more symptomatic
      brain metastases, who are not eligible for surgery or radiosurgery.
