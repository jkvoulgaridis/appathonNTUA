      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of cefpodoxime 200 mg immediate
      (b.i.d) and cefpodoxime 400 mg modified release (q.d) tablet formulations in the treatment of
      acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

    <description>Change in acute sinusitis sign and symptoms at the end of treatment compared to baseline.
The outcome will be assessed by Sino-nasal Outcome Tests SNOT-22 and SNOT-16.
* SNOT-16 is recommended symptom questionnarie for acute rhinonusitis but Turkish validation is not existed. Therefore SNOT-22 is also added as a symptom questionnarie since Turkish Validation is available.</description>

    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given sample from middle meatus.
The outcome will be assessed according to microbiologic response:
Eradication: The absence of pathogen(s) at the end of treatment. Persistance: The same concentration of the pathogen(s) in culture after the end of treatment.
Superinfection: Detection of bacterial of fungal pathogens during or after treatment,</description>
