      Hypothesis We hypothesise that hip muscle strength can predict the outcome of hip
      arthroscopy. A relationship between strength and outcome can improve the success of the
      procedure and avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful surgery.

      Objectives The primary objective is to evaluate the relationship between hip muscle strength
      and outcomes of hip arthroscopy. The secondary objective is to determine a 'threshold
      strength' above which the operation becomes successful. If this relationship is established,
      it would launching a randomised control trial with targeted physiotherapy as the
      intervention.

      Background Hip arthroscopy is key-hole surgery to the hip joint which is performed for
      femoroacetabular impingement; a condition which describes a shape mismatch between the
      ball-and-socket hip joint. The number of procedures is increasing, however, studies have
      shown success in only half of patients undergoing the procedure.

      Several factors have been linked with outcomes; however, the influence of muscle strength has
      never been investigated. We performed a systematic review of this topic, revealing that
      muscles around affected hips are significantly weaker. We also developed a standardised
      protocol for the measurement of muscle strength.

      Plan Patients awaiting hip arthroscopy will undergo muscle strength testing pre- and
      post-operatively. There will be no deviation of treatment from their NHS care. Validated
      outcome measure questionnaires will be completed at five months post-operatively. Magnetic
      resonance imaging and electromyography tests will be performed on a subset of patients
      post-operatively.
