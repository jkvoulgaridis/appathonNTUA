  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized triple-blind clinical trial to evaluate the behavior of peri-implant
      tissues (bone and soft tissues) in BLX implants loaded early or delayed and with different
      surgical milling protocols. To this end, 40 BLX implants with a diameter of 3.75x10 will be
      placed in areas of mature bone scarred after extraction. They will be divided into 2 study
      groups, and these in turn into two subgroups. Group A: complete milling, Group B: partial
      milling. Each group will be assigned with code 1: early load and code 2: deferred load.
      Clinical and radiological parameters will be evaluated.

    <measure>Primary stability of implants and peri-implant tissues</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Randomly and following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the implants will be placed with the normal preparation protocol (n = 20) and with the preparation protocol with under-fresh (n = 20). We will evaluate the immediate post-surgical stability of implants and peri-implant tissues through the Ostell system, based on the resonance frequency analysis (RFA). The implant stability quotient (ISQ) is the value on a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100, with higher values indicating greater stability. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ</description>

    <description>Randomly and following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the implants will be placed with the normal preparation protocol (n = 20) and with the preparation protocol with under-fresh (n = 20). We will load the crowns in two different groups, code 1: loading the implants before 7 days after surgery; code 2: before 8 weeks after implant surgery. We will evaluate the stability at different moments, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.The implant stability quotient (ISQ) is the value on a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100, with higher values indicating greater stability. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ. ISQ values are obtained using resonance frequency analysis (RFA).</description>

    <measure>Basal Radiological Bone Implant level</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>At the moment of placing the implant a periapical radiography will be performed, considering this measure the basal radiological bone level (distance from the neck of the implant to the most crestal level of the alveolar bone). We will calculate the difference between the basal measure and the future measurements.</description>

    <measure>Basal Peri-implant tissue level: probing depth</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>At the moment of placing the implant, clinical variables will be evaluated: depth of probing (distance from the peri-implant margin to the most depth of the peri-implant sulcus). This will be the basal measure of the implant stability and peri-implant tissue levels. We will calculate the difference between the basal measure and the future measurements.</description>

    <description>After the implantation, we´ll load the temporary prostheses in two different moments, 7 days or 8 weeks depending of the aleatory coding. We will evaluate the bone level stability at 6 weeks in both groups. The bone stability will be measured as a difference between de basal bone level and the actual one in mm.</description>

    <description>After the implantation, we´ll load the temporary prostheses in two different moments, 7 days or 8 weeks depending of the aleatory coding. We will evaluate the peri-implant tissue stability by measuring the probing depth or just in case, the recession of the gingival margin. The stability will be gave by the differences between both measures, basal and actual in mm.</description>
