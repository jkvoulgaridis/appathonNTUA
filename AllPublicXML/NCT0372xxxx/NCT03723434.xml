  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the physiology of connectivity between cortical
      regions in the human brain in healthy participants and in patients with white matter lesions.
      Specifically, the investigators will examine the effects of paired associative stimulation
      (PAS) which consists in delivering brief (&lt; 1 ms) current pulses separated by a short
      millisecond-level time interval (&quot;asynchrony&quot;) to two cortical areas. The used techniques are
      all non-invasive and considered safe in humans: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
      electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional MRI (fMRI).
      Based on prior literature in animals and human studies, it is hypothesized that PAS may
      increase or decrease effective connectivity between the stimulated areas depending on the
      asynchrony value. The main outcome measure is source-resolved EEG responses evoked by
      single-pulse TMS; this is a more direct measure of neuronal changes occurring at the targeted
      cortical area than motor evoked potentials (MEPs) or sensor-level EEG responses used in
      previous studies.

      This study consists of two experiments.

      In Experiment A, healthy participants without disorders or medications influencing brain
      function (N=24) will be recruited. A range of negative and positive asynchronies (from minus
      50 to + 50 ms) will be tested. To allow comparison with prior studies that used MEPs as
      outcome measures, in 12 participants the primary motor cortex in the left and right
      hemisphere will be targeted. In another 12 participants, two cortical areas within the same
      hemisphere will be stimulated.

      In Experiment B, participants with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or multiple
      sclerosis (MS) (total maximum N across all such participants is 52) will be recruited. These
      participants are required to have one or more subcortical white matter lesions, which would
      be expected to result in cortico-cortical disconnections. Here, the investigators will only
      test PAS with positive asynchronies, with the goal of testing if the findings observed in
      healthy participants are similar in participants with white matter lesions. It will also be
      examined if the PAS-induced connectivity changes persist beyond the stimulation sessions if
      PAS is given repeatedly over several days. PAS will be applied to two cortical targets that
      have been disconnected from each other. The rationale for including more than one disorder in
      Experiment B is that the disconnections are in all cases caused by white matter lesions and
      the results may therefore be similar. To detect possible differences between disorders, the
      data from the three groups will also be analyzed separately.

    <intervention_model_description>PAS will be applied to two cortical targets at different asynchronies to modulate connectivity. PAS may selectively increase or decrease effective connectivity depending on the asynchrony. Negative asynchronies are expected to decrease effective connectivity, whereas positive asynchronies to increase it.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Experiment A: Within-session (before versus after PAS at 1 and 60 minutes). Experiment B: Within-session (before versus after PAS at 1 and 60 minutes). Across-sessions (persistence of changes up to 1 month after last PAS session).</time_frame>
    <description>EEG will be recorded with a 64-channel whole-head TMS-compatible device (NeurOne, Bittium, Kuopio, Finland). Data will be collected before (Pre-PAS) and at 1 minute (Post-PAS T1) and at 60 minutes (Post-PAS T60) after PAS. To record spTMS-evoked EEG responses the investigators will deliver 80 single TMS pulses to the two areas receiving PAS, one target after the other in separate runs. Effective connectivity will be measured by comparing the source-resolved EEG evoked response waveforms before (Pre-PAS) and at 1 (Post-PAS T1) and at 60 minutes after PAS (Post-PAS T60).</description>
