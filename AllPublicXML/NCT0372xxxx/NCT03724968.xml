      This is an open-label, non-randomized two arm Phase 2 study of intravenous nivolumab plus
      intravenous ipilimumab or intravenous relatlimab in patients with metastatic melanoma
      stratified by MHC-II expression.

      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the efficacy, measured by change in activated GZMB+ CD8+ T-cell density
      intratumorally, of two immunotherapy regimens in patients with advanced melanoma:

        -  nivolumab plus relatlimab in patients with MHC-II (+) melanoma, and

        -  nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with MHC-II (-) melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

      • To evaluate the response rate, median progression free survival, overall survival, and
      safety and tolerability of nivolumab plus relatlimab in patients with MHC-II (+) melanoma,
      and of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with MHC-II (-) melanoma.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To explore potential associations of biomarkers with clinical efficacy and/or incidence
           of adverse events due to study drug by analyzing biomarker measures within the
           peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment.
