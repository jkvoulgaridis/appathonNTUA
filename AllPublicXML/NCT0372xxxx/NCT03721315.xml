  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether increasing health literacy among COPD patients and their
      designated health coach during a hospital admission caused by symptoms exacerbation will lead
      to better health outcomes including increased health quality, and lower healthcare
      utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, contemporary methods to chronic disease management have failed to
      consistently tailor approaches among patients with low health literacy. They have produced
      mixed results in terms of successful interventions to address the needs of these populations.
      Low health literacy is especially common in medically underserved communities, including in
      North Philadelphia. This is reflected in the predominantly low-income and racial/ethnic
      minority population of the patients at this medical center. Management of chronic conditions
      such as COPD is complex. Patients with low health literacy find it especially challenging to
      self-navigate disease management. However, there is a lack of information on approaches to
      improve health outcomes among COPD patients with low health literacy.

      The long-term goal is to develop and evaluate a model of interventions to improve healthcare
      outcomes for socially disadvantaged populations. The objective is to pilot a randomized
      controlled trial that evaluates the effects of an intervention that provides enhanced
      education and material support, on adherence to care, among patients admitted for
      COPD-related issues and their home support dyad.

      The central hypothesis is that: compared to the standard educational intervention delivered
      by a registered nurse, the addition of an enhanced intervention (enhanced education,
      problem-solving skills and facilitative support) and the inclusion of a patient-designated
      support pair will result in greater adherence care and improves quality of life, especially
      among patients with low health literacy.
