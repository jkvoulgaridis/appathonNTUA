  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic conditioning(RIC) is a protective systemic strategy by organs brief and
      sublethal ischemia to confer protection from subsequent severe ischemia in distant organs,
      especially for heart and brain. This study will discuss whether RIC can play a part in
      preventing the patients with coexistence of cerebral and coronary atherosclerosis from the
      recurrence of cerebral vascular disease(CVD) or coronary artery disease(CAD). This study
      selects patients who suffered an ischemic stroke within 14 days prior to enrollment. All
      patients complete cerebral and coronary artery assessment. And then the the investigators
      select the patients who both have at least one cerebral vascular and at least one coronary
      artery stenosis over 50%, or the patients who both have at least one cerebral vascular
      stenosis over 50% and myocardial ischemic events history. These patients will randomly divide
      into two groups, RIC group and non-RIC group. Non-RIC group will only accept
      cardio-cerebrovascular disease secondary prevention treatment. RIC group will use not only
      cardio-cerebrovascular disease secondary prevention treatment, but also RIC everyday for
      three months, 5 cycles 5min ischemic-5min reperfusion each day. For the first month, the the
      investigators will call RIC group patients every week for insuring compliance and adverse
      effect. All patients will follow up endpoint events, cardio-cerebrovascular disease secondary
      prevention treatment, and the adverse effect every three months, up to one year.

    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS) is the most comprehensive and most widely used primary outcome measurement to assess the neurological functional disability in contemporary acute stroke trials. The mRS is an ordinal, graded interval scale that assigns patients among 7 global disability levels, which ranges from 0 (no symptom) to 5 (severe disability) and 6 (death). We will use mRS to evaluate the degree of disability or dependence during daily activities. The mRS will be assessed by certified study investigator at 3 months. The distribution of mRS will be compared between groups</description>
