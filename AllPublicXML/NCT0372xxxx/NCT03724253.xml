  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase II, multi-center, open label, single dose study in patients with tumor types
      known to overexpress Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR), including breast, prostate,
      colorectal, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).

      A total of 50 subjects were planned for the study (10 subjects for the dosimetry group and 40
      subjects for the non dosimetry group). The sponsor decided to close the recruitment
      prematurely, leading to a low sample size. In total, 22 subjects were screened for
      eligibility and 19 subjects were enrolled (2 subjects in the dosimetry group and 17 subjects
      in the non dosimetry group).

    <description>At lesion level, overall, positive, and negative agreement of [68Ga]-NeoBOMB1 were to be calculated based on the aforementioned tabulations as follows:
Overall agreement = 100% x (Double positive + Double negative) / total number of lesions identified by either imaging proceduresg

    <time_frame>Biopsy specimen collected within 6 months prior to study entry up to [68Ga]-NeoBOMB1 PET imaging acquired at Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnostic performance of [68Ga]-NeoBOMB1 to GRPR overexpressing malignancies (lesions) was to be compared with cytology and/or histopathology findings from archival and/or recent biopsy specimens.
Since the biopsy was performed on 1 lesion (collected either in primary or in metastatic tumors), a direct link may not be possible in case of multiple lesions per organ identified on [68Ga]-NeoBOMB1-PET. In this event, the determination of positive versus negative lesions on [68Ga]-NeoBOMB1-PET was done at organ level, i.e., if any lesion is positive in that organ, then the organ was to be considered positive. The sensitivity and specificity were to be calculated as follows: Sensitivity = 100% x True positive / (True positive + False negative); Specificity = 100% x True negative / (True negative + False positive).</description>
