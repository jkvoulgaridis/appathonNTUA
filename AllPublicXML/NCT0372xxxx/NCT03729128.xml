  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate whether add-on dextromethorphan (DM) and memantine (MM) is
      able to improve the treatment outcomes for ATSUD, and be associated with improvement in
      inflammatory markers, neurotrophic factors and neuropsychological tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In current study, we will conduct a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. We will
      recruit 100-120 patients with ATSUD in three years and allocate them to add-on low dose
      dextromethorphan and memantine (DM 30mg/day+MM 5mg/day) or placebo group in a 1: 1 ratio
      (patients will also undergo usual psychosocial interventions). We will follow up the
      participants for 12 weeks and measure the treatment responses, urine drug tests, craving
      scales and side effects to evaluate the therapeutic effects of add-on DM+MM.
      Neuropsychological assessments and tests for inflammatory parameters and neurotrophic factors
      will also be measured during 12-weeks follow up. The study results will show that whether
      add-on DM+MM is able to improve the treatment outcomes for ATSUD, and be associated with
      improvement in inflammatory markers, neurotrophic factors and neuropsychological tests.

    <measure>Urinary amphetamine tests</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The urinary amphetamine tests will be examined during the 12 weeks of treatment period in patients with ATSUD and the results will be compared between the experimental and placebo groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual analog scale (VAS) will be measured during the 12 weeks of treatment period in patients with ATSUD. The results will be compared between the experimental and placebo groups. The level of conscious craving was rated from 0 (none) to 100 (very much). Higher scores indicate more severe craving.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Side effects checklists</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the self-reported questionnaire, side effects checklists, to evaluate the side effects during the 12 weeks of treatment period in patients with ATSUD. The side effects assessment includes, A) Mental Status/6-item, B) Genito-Urinary/4-item, C) Cardiovascular/4-item, D) Head-Neck/10-item, E) Extremities/9-item, F) Skin/4-item, and G) Gastrointestinal Tract/2-item. The severity of side effects were divided into 4 degrees as follows: 0 = Not present; 1 = Mild or occasional; 2 = Moderate or occurs several times a day; and 3 = Severe or persistent. Scores in each subscale will be summated to get the final total scores. Higher scores indicate more severe side effects. The results of side effects checklists will be compared between the experimental and placebo group.</description>

    <measure>Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) will be measured in patients with ATSUD at the initial screen period and at the endpoint (after 12 weeks of treatment). We will compare the changes from screen period to the endpoint between experimental and placebo group. Performance on the WCST was scored in terms of the total number of errors (TNE, range form 0-128), perseverative errors (PE, range from 0-118), conceptual level responses (CLRs, range from 0-100%), number of categories completed (NCC, range form 0-12), and trials to complete the first category (TCC, range from 0-128). Higher scores indicate worse performance in TNE, PE, and TCC. Higher scores indicate better performance in CLRs and NCC.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous performance tests (CPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Continuous performance tests (CPT) will be measured in patients with ATSUD at the initial screen period and at the endpoint (after 12 weeks of treatment). We will compare the changes from screen period to the endpoint between experimental and placebo group. The CPT produces a standard set of performance measures that include the number of errors of omission and errors of commission. (1) Errors of omission occur when the participant fails to respond to the target stimulus. The omission errors t-scores are ranged from 20-80 (0-100%). Higher scores indicated worse performance. (2) Errors of commission occur when the participant responds to a non-target (X) stimulus. The commission errors t-scores are ranged from 20-80 (0-100%). Higher scores indicated worse performance.</description>

    <measure>Wechsler Memory Scale - third edition (WMS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Memory Scale - third edition (WMS-III) will be measured in patients with ATSUD at the initial screen period and at the endpoint (after 12 weeks of treatment). We will compare the changes from screen period to the endpoint between experimental and placebo group. WMS-III composite scores were calculated for the eight standardized primary indices: Auditory Immediate (AIM, range from 50-156), Visual Immediate (VIM, range from 47-162 ), Immediate Memory (IM, range from 40-164 ), Auditory Delayed (ADM, range from 46-162), Visual Delayed (VDM, range from 43-156), Auditory Recognition Delayed (ARDM, range from 55-145), General Memory (GM, range from 40-168), and Working Memory (WM, range from 45-156 ). Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Cytokines and neurotrophic factors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma levels of cytokines and neurotrophic factors, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α[pg/mL]), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1 [pg/mL]), interleukin 6( IL-6[pg/mL]), interleukin 8(IL-8[pg/mL]), interleukin 1β (IL-1β[pg/mL]), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF[pg/mL]), will be measured in patients with ATSUD at the initial screen period, day 1(baseline), week 4, 8, and 12(endpoint). We will compare the changes from screen period to the endpoint between the experimental and placebo group.</description>

    <measure>C-reactive protein</measure>

    <description>The plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP[μg/mL]) will be measured in patients with ATSUD at the initial screen period, day 1(baseline), week 4, 8, and 12(endpoint). We will compare the changes from screen period to the endpoint between the experimental and placebo group.</description>
