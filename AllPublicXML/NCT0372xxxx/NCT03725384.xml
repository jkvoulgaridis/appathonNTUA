  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia is a global health problem and the most common cause of anemia
      worldwide. Patients with iron deficiency (ID) and IDA can present with a multitude of
      symptoms including fatigue, restless legs syndrome and pica.Oral iron supplementation is
      associated with increasing hemoglobin in multiple studies in women, pregnant women and
      elderly patients.However, the optimal dose and frequency of oral iron supplementation for
      treatment remains unclear. The current proposed study attempts to address this gap in the
      literature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, pragmatic, non-inferiority, open label randomized controlled trial (RCT) in
      outpatients with iron deficiency anemia to evaluate the effectiveness of oral ferrous sulfate
      300mg (60mg elemental iron) once daily versus every other day to improve hemoglobin at 12
      weeks post-initiation. The rationale for this study includes: (1) IDA is a common and
      prevalent condition with potential adverse consequences if left untreated; (2) optimizing
      effectiveness of oral iron supplementation while minimizing side effects will improve
      treatment for patients.

      Because IDA is a global health problem, common in clinical practice and treatable, this study
      will have a significant practical impact on how clinicians treat outpatients with iron
      deficiency anemia and how patients tolerate therapy.

      For the patient, the expected benefit from taking part in this study is the potential to
      improve and treat iron deficiency anemia. These potential changes may lead to improved
      symptoms associated with iron deficiency anemia, such as cognitive and physical functioning,
      and fatigue.
