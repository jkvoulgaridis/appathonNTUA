  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent prospective observational data has established that distal blood flow compromise
      measured using noninvasive quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA) identifies a
      high risk subgroup of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar (VB)
      steno-occlusive disease, serving as an imaging biomarker for future stroke risk. The
      currently proposed study aims to determine if an endovascular intervention, submaximal
      balloon angioplasty, can be performed with adequate safety in this high risk subgroup of
      flow-compromised patients with VB stenosis. The study will also examine as secondary aims,
      the effect of the intervention on distal flow augmentation and on subsequent posterior
      circulation ischemic events.

      The objective is to conduct a multicenter safety study of submaximal balloon angioplasty and
      intensive medical management in patients with symptomatic VB stenosis associated with distal
      flow compromise as demonstrated by QMRA. These objectives will be met by enrolling patients
      into a single arm design of angioplasty and intensive medical therapy.

      Primary Objective

      1. Determine the safety of submaximal balloon angioplasty for treatment of symptomatic
      intracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis with distal flow compromise (device safety)

      Secondary Objectives

        1. A. Evaluate the initial hemodynamic effect of submaximal balloon angioplasty for
           symptomatic intracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis with distal flow compromise (evidence
           of short term biomarker modification) B. Evaluate the hemodynamic durability of
           submaximal balloon angioplasty at one year (evidence of sustained biomarker
           modification)

        2. Estimate the risk of subsequent posterior circulation stroke (at one year) following
           submaximal balloon angioplasty for distal flow compromised symptomatic intracranial
           vertebrobasilar stenosis (preliminary clinical efficacy)
