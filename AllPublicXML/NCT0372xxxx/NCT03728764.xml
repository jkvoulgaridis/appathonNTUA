      infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label trial will be conducted in up to 74 preterm infants to evaluate the formula
      as it would typically be used in the neonatal care unit and to document the safety and
      suitability of the two-stage feeding system in terms of growth in comparison to recommended
      growth goals, feeding tolerance, biochemical parameters, and adverse event reporting.
