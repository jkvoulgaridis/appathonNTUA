  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with mild to
      moderate plaque psoriasis.

      Approximately 574 subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for the first 16 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four phases:

        -  Screening Phase - up to 35 days

        -  Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase - Weeks 0 to 16

           - Subjects will be randomly assigned to either apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID or
           placebo tablets (identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally BID.

        -  Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16 to 32

           - All subjects will be switched to (or continue with) apremilast 30 mg BID. All subjects
           will maintain this dosing through Week 32.

        -  Observational Follow-up Phase - 4 weeks - Four-week Post-Treatment Observational
           Follow-up Phase for all subjects who complete the study or discontinue the study early.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
