    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaireï¼ˆEORTC-QLQ-C30), is a self-administered cancer specific questionnaire with multi-dimensional scales. It consists of both multi-item scales and single item measures, including five functional domains, a global quality of life domain, three symptom domains, and six single items. For each domain or single item measure a linear transformation will be applied to standardize the raw score to range between 0 and 100. The endpoints in QoL analysis are the mean EORTC QLQ-C30 QoL change scores from baseline for the physical function and global health status/quality of life subscale scores. After transformation, higher scores in these two subscales mean better outcome</description>

    <description>Napabucasin will be administered twice daily, at 240 mg bid (480 mg total daily dose).Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 will be administered intravenously. Gemcitabine 600 mg/m^2 will be administered intravenously following paclitaxel infusion. This regimen will be repeated on Days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy as long as they have not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation of study medication and have not demonstrated disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria</description>
