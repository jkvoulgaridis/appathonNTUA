  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was compare between 2% Mepivacaine and
      4% Articaine for inferior alveolar nerve blocks in patients with symptomatic irreversible
      pulpitis in mandibular molars as regards to their anesthetic efficiency; during access cavity
      preparation and instrumentation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six patients diagnosed clinically and radiographically with symptomatic irreversible
      pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth will received single-visit root canal treatment using
      ProTaper Universal rotary system for canal preparation, then they will be randomly divided
      into two groups (n=33) according to the anesthetic solution used, either Group M (3.6 ml
      Mepivacaine hydrochloride 2% with 1:100000 epinephrine) or Group A (3.4 ml Articaine
      hydrochloride 4% with 1:100000 epinephrine). The pain will be assessed using numerical rating
      scale (NRS) during access cavity preparation and instrumentation, then the need for
      supplemental anesthesia will be also recorded.

    <description>Pain intensity during access cavity preparation using numerical rating scale (NRS). The scale was numerical to facilitate its use by the participants. The Numerical rating scale is an 10-point scale anchored by two extremes &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;.
Pain was categorized into four categorical scores: (1) none [score 0], (2) mild [score from 1-3], (3) moderate [score from 4-6], (4) severe [score from 7-10].</description>
