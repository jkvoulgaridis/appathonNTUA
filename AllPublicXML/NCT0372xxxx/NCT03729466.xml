      Individuals participating in the study will be randomly divided into two groups through the
      randomized allocation software program. The first group will be given Clinical Pilates
      exercise training, while the second group will be considered as the control group. The
      exercises will be applied to the group attending the Clinical Pilates exercise training for
      45-60 minutes, twice a week for a total of 8 weeks. Each movement will consist of one set and
      10 repetitions. In the Clinical Pilates program, equipment and exercises will be gradually
      increased. Equipment to be used throughout the Clinical Pilates program; Pilates cushion,
      Elastic resistant band (red, green, blue), Exercise ball (65 cm) In the Clinical Pilates
      group, the training session will start with the warm-up program, core stabilization training,
      clinical Pilates exercises will be applied to increase the postural smoothness and strength,
      and the exercise session will be terminated with the cooling period. The clinical Pilates
      group will be given 5 key elements of clinical Pilates (Respiratory-Centre focus- Chest
      placement - Shoulder placement - Head-neck placement) will be explained. No exercise program
      will be applied to the control group for 8 weeks. A sufficient number of trials will be
      conducted to enable participants to adapt to the evaluation and treatment. The evaluations
      will be done as pre-test and post-test for both groups and then the groups will be compared.
      Individuals who have agreed to participate in the study and have signed the information
