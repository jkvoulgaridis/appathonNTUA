        Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for the study:

          -  Signed informed consent form (ICF) obtained prior to any study-related procedures
             and/or assessments performed.

          -  Males or females of non-child-bearing potential, aged ≥40 years on the day of signing
             the ICF.

          -  A diagnosis of IPF within 5 years prior to the screening visit as per applicable
             American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society(ERS)/Japanese Respiratory
             Society (JRS)/Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) guideline. Subjects receiving
             local standard of care for the treatment of IPF, defined as either pirfenidone or
             nintedanib at a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before screening, and during
             screening; or neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib (for any reason). A stable dose is
             defined as the highest tolerated dose. Prednisone at steady dose ≤10 mg/day or
             equivalent glucocorticoid dose is allowed (stabilized 4 weeks prior to screening and
             continued without variation of dose or regimen). Supportive care like supplemental
             oxygen or pulmonary rehabilitation is allowed.

          -  Meeting all of the following criteria at screening and during the screening period:

               -  FVC ≥50% predicted of normal

               -  Disease progression, defined as a decline of FVC (% predicted or mL) at the
                  investigator's discretion, during the 9 months prior to the screening period and
                  confirmed at the screening visit

               -  Diffusing capacity for the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥30% predicted of
                  normal (corrected for hemoglobin)

               -  Ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to FVC ≥0.70

          -  In a stable condition and suitable for study participation based on the results of a
             medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and laboratory
             evaluation. Stable condition is based on the clinical judgment of the investigator,
             co-morbidities should be treated according to the local applicable guidelines.
             Concomitant medication for chronic comorbidities should be stabilized from 4 weeks
             before screening and during the screening period (stable defined as no clinically
             relevant change according to the investigator's judgement).

          -  Able to walk at least 150 meters during the 6MWT at screening; without having a
             contraindication to perform the 6MWT.

        This list only describes the key inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects meeting one or more of the following criteria cannot be selected for this study:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the investigational medicinal product (IMP)
             ingredients or a history of a significant allergic reaction to any drug as determined
             by the investigator (e.g. anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization).

          -  Current immunosuppressive condition (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]
             infection, congenital, acquired, medication induced, organ transplantation).

          -  Positive blood testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBS Ag) or hepatitis C virus
             antibody (if positive, confirmed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA positivity). Note:
             Subjects with a resolved hepatitis A at least 3 months prior to first dosing of the
             IMP can be included.

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for carcinoma in situ of the
             uterine cervix, basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated with no
             evidence of recurrence, and prostate cancer medically managed through active
             surveillance or watchful waiting, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin if fully
             resected).

          -  Acute IPF exacerbation within 3 months prior to screening and during the screening
             period.

          -  Lower respiratory tract infection requiring antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to
             screening and/or during the screening period.

          -  Interstitial lung disease associated with known primary diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis,
             amyloidosis), exposures (e.g. radiation, silica, asbestos, coal dust), and drugs (e.g.
             amiodarone).

          -  History of lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplant.

          -  Unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary (other than IPF) or other disease within 6 months
             prior to screening or during the screening period (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart
             failure, stroke).

          -  Subject participating in a drug, device or biologic investigational research study,
             concurrently with the current study, within 12 weeks or 5-half-lives of the agent,
             whichever is longer, prior to screening, or prior participation in an investigational
             drug antibody/biologic study within 6 months prior to screening.
