  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial - the investigators plan to study the efficacy of pregnancy management in cases
      of suspcted preeclampsia, based on a 6-hour urine collection for protein, as compared to the
      standard 24-hour collection. For participants hospitalized at the maternal fetal unit at our
      institution, one sample of urine collected over 6 hours will be analyzed, and a second one
      following an additional 18 hours. Participants will be blinded to the urine collection result
      used to manage their pregnancy (actual 24 hour collection versus calculated 24-hour
      collection), as will be their attending physicians. An external physician will compare the
      two urine collection results, and in case only one is pathological (&gt;300 mg), will notify the
      research team and the attending physician.

    <description>Patients in this arm will collect urine for protein for 6 hours, and then an additional 18 hours. The result of the 6-hour collection will be multiplied by four, and the result will serve as the &quot;calculated collection&quot;, for pregnancy management. The additional 18 hour collection will serve for: 1. Patient blinding. 2. Calculation of the total 24-hour protein collection for reference.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will collect urine for protein for 6 hours, and then an additional 18 hours. The result of the total 24-hour collection will serve for pregnancy management. The initial 6-hour collection will serve for patient blinding.</description>
