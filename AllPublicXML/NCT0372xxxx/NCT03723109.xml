      The aims of this study are to evaluate and compare feasibility of airway management and risk
      for desaturation during standardized target controlled infusion (TCI) and rapid sequence
      induction (RSI) of anesthesia. A conventional way to induce anesthesia, i.e. manual injection
      of anesthetics, may be more accurate and predictable compared to dosing regimes based on
      complex mathematical algorithms used in TCI-systems. In addition, today many different models
      are presented and there is no consensus which kind of TCI-algorithm should be used
      universally. Moreover, dosing algorithms are most complex and challenging in underweight and
      morbid obesity. There are many publications on this field, but no data of feasibility of
      airway management can be found. Indeed, RSI induction is traditionally blamed to be risky and
      not recommended as a first choice.
