  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study. Volunteers will be vaccinated with the oral
      cholera vaccine, Vaxchora. Vaxchora has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for travelers to developing countries. Volunteers will also be asked to provide blood
      specimens over a follow-up time period of up to eight years. The specimens obtained in this
      clinical research study will be used to further the investigator's understanding of the
      protective immunological mechanisms that can be elicited systemically and may be applicable
      to other enteric pathogens.

    <description>One dose. Approximately 100 mL of cold or room temperature purified bottled water is placed into a clean disposable cup. The contents of the buffer sachet are added to the water and stirred. Then the contents of the active (lyophilized vaccine) sachet are added to the water and stirred for approximately 30 seconds. The reconstituted mixture should be completely ingested within 15 minutes.</description>
