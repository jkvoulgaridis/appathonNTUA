  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The e-OPRA Implant System, is a further development of the OPRA (Osseointegrated Prostheses
      for the Rehabilitation of Amputees) Implant System, approved under HDE (Humanitarian Device
      Exemption) H080004. The e-OPRA Implant system is an implant system for direct skeletal
      anchorage of amputation prostheses. The added feature in the e-OPRA Implant system, is a
      bidirectional interface into the human body that allows permanent and reliable communication
      using implanted electrodes. These electrodes will provide long-term stable bioelectric
      signals for an improved control of the prosthetic limb. The purpose of the study is to
      evaluate the feasibility of a lower limb amputee with the e-OPRA Implant System exhibiting
      full neural control over a neuro-mechanical prosthetic system.

      A maximum of six subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will undergo a surgery where the
      e-OPRA Implant System will be implanted. The subjects will participate in follow-up sessions
      of which the last one occurs approximately 24 months after the surgery. This is a
      prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled study.

    <measure>Preferred walking speed</measure>

    <description>Preferred walking speed, as each subject ambulates with the neuromechanical prosthesis, will be evaluated. Preferred walking speed will be compared to a non-amputee height/weight match for each enrolled subject. A baseline data set will first be collected for each subject ambulating with a conventional prosthesis. Each subject will be timed as they traverse a predetermined distance at a steady speed that they deem most comfortable.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A potential subject will be included in the study if she/he meets all of the following
        inclusion criteria:

          -  Male or Female age 22-65 at the time of surgery.

          -  The patient must have a medical condition requiring performance of a unilateral
             transfemoral amputation with a minimum of 13 cm of residual femur after amputation,
             and:

        A: At a minimum level of amputation of 20 cm or greater above the knee joint line if
        physical therapy and prosthetist evaluation is commensurate with a standard K3 ambulatory
        status; or, B: At a minimum level of amputation of 16 cm above the knee joint line as part
        of a single-stage procedure if physical therapy and prosthetist evaluation is commensurate
        with a more active K3 or less active K4 postoperative ambulatory status.

          -  The subject must have undergone independent consultation with at least two lower
             extremity surgical specialists to ensure they have exhausted all limb salvage options
             prior to undergoing amputation, as well as a psychiatric evaluation to ensure
             appropriate capacity and volition.

          -  The patient must have the ability to ambulate at variable cadence (an expected lower
             extremity prosthesis functional level of K3 or above).

          -  The patient must have adequate bone stock to support the implanted device.

          -  In the opinion of the investigators, normal cognitive function and absence of any
             physical limitations, addictive diseases or underlying medical conditions that may
             preclude patient from being a good surgical and/or study candidate.

          -  Willingness, ability and commitment to participate in baseline and follow-up
             evaluations for the full length of the study including the prescribed rehabilitation
             program.

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study provided by the patient or legal
             representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy during the first twelve (12)
             months of the post-surgical follow-up.

          -  Subjects who have not been completely abstinent from tobacco use for at least 6 weeks
             preoperatively.

          -  Active infection or dormant bacteria.

          -  Subjects would have less than 2 mm of remaining cortex bone available around the
             implant, if implanted.

          -  Evidence of or a documented history of severe peripheral vascular disease, diabetes
             mellitus (type I or type II), skin diseases, Neuropathy or neuropathic disease and
             severe phantom pain, or osteoporosis, such that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate.

          -  Evidence of any active skin disease involving the proposed surgical limb.

          -  History of systemically administered corticosteroids, immune-suppressive therapy or
             chemotherapy drugs within six (6) months of implant surgery.

          -  Severe co morbidity, atypical skeletal anatomy, or poor general physical/mental health
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good
             study candidate (i.e. other disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse,
             shortened life expectancy, vulnerable patient population, BMI &gt;40, etc.).

          -  The patient is currently involved in another clinical study where that participation
             may conflict or interfere with the treatment, follow-up or results of this clinical
             study.
