    <textblock>
      This observational study will collect data on the use of the drug Xydalba® in daily clinical
      practice in France. Such observational studies are also referred to as registries. The
      sponsor of the study is Correvio International Sárl, based in Switzerland.

      Xydalba® contains the active substance dalbavancin, a remedy for a certain type of bacterial
      pathogens (so-called &quot;gram positive bacteria&quot;) which cause the disease. Active ingredients
      against bacteria are also called antibiotics.

      Correvio wants to know which patients received the drug and how the disease went. The
      treatment places where you got Xydalba, ie clinic, intensive care unit or elsewhere should be
      recorded. In addition, it is important in this type of medication to track whether the
      pathogens are changing in any way. Any safety-relevant events (such as side effects) that
      have occurred during treatment should be investigated by the sponsor and submitted to the
      competent European authorities.

      OBJECTIVES

      The objectives of this registry are as follows:

        -  To determine the following characteristics in patients who received intravenous Xydalba
           administration:

        -  Patient characteristics.

        -  Disease characteristics.

        -  Pathogen characteristics.

        -  To characterize the usage of Xydalba.

        -  To characterize the patient's residence and, in hospitalized patients, the lengths of
           hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and the destination upon hospital
           discharge.

        -  To assess the response of Xydalba treatment, based on clinician determination.

        -  To characterize the major healthcare resource utilization (HRU) of patients treated with
           Xydalba.

      REGISTRY DESIGN:

      This is a multicenter, prospective registry of adult patients treated with Xydalba in France.

      All Adverse events (AEs) (serious and non-serious; special situations; related and
      not-related, collected prospectively or retrospectively) will be recorded in the eCRF.
      Treatment related AEs and SAEs will be reported to the healthcare authorities, as requested
      by local regulations and according to current Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices
      (GVP) Module VI - Collection, management and submission of reports of suspected adverse
      reactions to medicinal products (Rev 2).

      TEST PRODUCT (S), DOSE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION Xydalba (dalbavancin) as prescribed by the
      physician according to clinical practice.

      RATIONALE:

      This prospective registry is designed to capture information about the clinical use of
      Xydalba, its safety and effectiveness, characteristics of the patient, disease, pathogen,
      clinical course, treatment course, and hospitalization. This registry will capture the data
      in real world setting on patients who received Xydalba.
