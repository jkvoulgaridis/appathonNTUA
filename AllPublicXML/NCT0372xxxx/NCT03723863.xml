    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well occupational therapy (occupational therapist-led work
      intervention) works in facilitating work maintenance or re-entry to the workforce for stages
      I to III breast cancer patients who will be undergoing curative intent chemotherapy.
      Occupational therapy may help cancer patients maintain employment or successfully return to
      work soon after treatment.
