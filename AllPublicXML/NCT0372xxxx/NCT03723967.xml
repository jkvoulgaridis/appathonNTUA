      The primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of a
      combination of Durvalumab with the Carboplatin/Paclitaxel as first line treatment in patients
      with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN not eligible to standard chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      For recurrent or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), the
      standard first-line treatment is chemotherapy by cisplatin-fluorouracil and cetuximab which
      allows a median overall survival of 10.1 months. Due to its toxicity, this combination could
      be proposed only to patients younger than 70 years, good PS (ECOG PS0 or PS1) and adequate
      renal function.

      In routine practice it is estimated that the proportion of eligible patients is about two
      third. One third of patients were ineligible to first-line chemotherapy by
      cisplatin-fluorouracil-cetuximab. Among them, 25% due to PS2 and the others for various
      reasons (older than 70 years, renal insufficiency….). For these ineligible patients, an
      alternative chemotherapy should be proposed. The carboplatin-paclitaxel scheme with weekly
      paclitaxel is safe for poor population and demonstrated efficacy in head and neck cancers
      with overall survival varying from 4.9 months to 12.8 months in first line. The response rate
      varies from 20% to 52% and is about 25% in our experience. Even for frail patients it should
      be a safe and active treatment.

      Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD1 demonstrated survival benefit compared with
      chemotherapy in patients with SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based first line (median OS
      of 7.5 months versus 5.1 months and 12-month OS rate of 36.0% versus 16.6%). Safety data
      confirm these antibodies are of interest in a population of frail patients. Only 58.9% of
      patients experienced treatment-related adverse events with nivolumab arm and 13% of grade
      3/4. Durvalumab, an anti-PDL1 antibody is currently tested in SCCHN with promising results.

      Head and neck cancers are rapidly progressive and due to the delayed action of immunotherapy,
      and the recent demonstration that immunotherapy with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 can be responsible
      of hyperprogression, patients will probably benefit from addition of chemotherapy to
      immunotherapy, mostly for patients unfit for cisplatin-fluorouracil because their poor
      condition is often related to the cancer and a rapid response is needed.

      This trial proposes to study the addition of Durvalumab to chemotherapy in first line
      treatment for frail patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN.

      Prior to this evaluation, a run-in tolerance study in a limited number of patients to ensure
      that the experimental treatment combination is safe.

                  stable dose of insulin.

        Note: Subjects with alopecia, vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring
        systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) or chronic skin condition that does not
        require systemic therapy, are not excluded, as well as patients without active disease in
        the last 5 years (after consultation with the study physician) and patients with celiac
        disease controlled by diet alone.

          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms using Fredericia's Correction.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease or congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) class 2. Patients must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms
             at rest) or new-onset angina within the last 3 months or myocardial infarction within

             includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and
             tuberculosis testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV
             surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined
             as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are
             eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if
             polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.

             o Active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis,

               -  Active bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute,

             requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent

             8. Current or prior use, or need for the following concomitant
             medications/interventions not permitted during the study treatment period :

             marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study
             drug (except palliative radiotherapy on a non-target lesion after discussion with the
             coordinating investigator), immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer
             treatment, other than any stated in the protocol (Note: concurrent use of hormonal
             therapy for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g. hormone replacement therapy) is
             acceptable)).

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of durvalumab including, but not limited to systemic corticosteroids at doses
             exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and TNF-α
             blockers. Use of immunosuppressive medications for the management of investigational
             product-related AEs or in subjects with contrast allergies is acceptable.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP (Note:

                  intent is acceptable.

                  8. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during
                  the last 28 days prior to first study drug administration

                  9. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
                  (non-interventional) clinical study or during the follow-up period of an
