  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pancreatic cancer registry aims to collect information on people around the world who
      select focused ultrasound (FUS) as part of their treatment for pancreatic cancer to learn
      about the performance of the focused ultrasound technology and health outcomes; the impact of
      focused ultrasound on your overall health; and provide an understanding of the current care
      for pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry is to collect data on the performance of the focused ultrasound
      (FUS) technology and health outcomes. A wide variety of approaches exist for using FUS on
      pancreatic cancer patients, and the primary goal is to capture this broad spectrum of
      approaches and their impact on patients overall health. This information will help provide a
      better understanding of current care, and may possibly direct further, more specific
      investigations that will follow this registry. After obtaining informed consent a baseline
      history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging studies needed per standard of
      care will be performed. Patients' treatment is determined by their caregivers only, and thus
      the registry will evaluate patient management in &quot;real-world&quot; conditions.

      Enrollment Goal: 100

      Primary Outcomes: Pain related to pancreatic cancer, Objective response, Progression-free and
      overall survival, Performance Status, Clinical Benefit Response (CBR), Health-related quality
      of life

        The registry population will be drawn from patients who have been diagnosed with pancreatic
        cancer and are eligible for FUS therapy. Participants are allowed to receive
        standard-of-care treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and best supportive
        care. Participants being treated in another FUS clinical trial may be included in this
        registry.
