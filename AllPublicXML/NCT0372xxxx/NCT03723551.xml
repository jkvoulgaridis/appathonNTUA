    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to assess the safety and tolerability of Afabicin in the
      treatment of participants with bone or joint infection due to Staphylococcus aureus [both
      methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)] and/or
      coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and to compare it to standard of care (SOC).
