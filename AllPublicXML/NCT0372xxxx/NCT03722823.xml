  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to find out if tucatinib is safe for patients with
      liver problems. This study will look at participants with mild, moderate, and severe liver
      problems. For each participant with liver problems who takes part, a matching healthy
      participant who is of similar age, similar body mass index (BMI), and of the same sex will
      also take part. The study will look at how the drug affects healthy participants compared to
      participants with liver problems.

      This study is being conducted to provide information to develop dosing recommendations for
      tucatinib in subjects with hepatic impairment. The current study will be carried out in
      subjects with hepatic impairment according to 3 different Child-Pugh (CP) categories (Mild,
      Moderate, and Severe impairment), and in matched-control healthy subjects. The minimum number
      of matched-control healthy subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure that each
      hepatically-impaired subject has a healthy match. Each matched-control healthy subject will
      be enrolled following the enrollment of a Mild and/or Moderate and/or Severe hepatic
      impairment subject and will be matched by age (+/- 10 years), by BMI (+/- 20%), and by sex to
      the enrolled hepatic impairment subject(s). Each healthy subject may be matched with up to 1
      subject within each hepatic impairment group. Based on these criteria, with 3 cohorts of 8
      hepatically-impaired subjects enrolled in the study, the number of healthy control subjects
      required to be enrolled will be at least 8 and not more than 24.
