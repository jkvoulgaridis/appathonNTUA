    <textblock>
      TELECAST-TIA is a prospective single-center study evaluating guideline-based transient
      ischemic attack (TIA) treatment at an Acute Stroke Ready Hospital (ASRH) pre- and
      post-initiation of a specialist telestroke inpatient rounding service. TELECAST-TIA will
      study the following clinical endpoints: diagnostic stroke evaluation, secondary stroke
      prevention, health screening and evaluation, stroke education, inpatient complications, and
      stroke recurrence rates. Additional relevant non-clinical data will include patient and
      provider satisfaction scores, transfer patterns, and a cost analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telestroke is a validated intervention that improves the triage and emergent treatment of
      acute stroke, specifically related to the use of intravenous thrombolysis. Effective urgent
      stroke evaluation and secondary stroke prevention is also essential to decrease the risk of
      recurrent stroke, however, there have been no studies to date examining the use of telestroke
      to improve delivery of non-emergent inpatient stroke care per American Heart Association
      (AHA) guidelines.

      Currently, access to stroke specialist expertise is limited resulting in significant
      disparities in stroke care. Previous publications have identified that patients in rural
      areas may receive sub-optimal stroke care that does not follow accepted guideline
      recommendations. Telestroke is a cost-effective mechanism to deliver specialist stroke care
      to hospitals that do not have in-person stroke consultation available. The aim of
      TELECAST-TIA is to determine whether specialist telestroke inpatient rounding improves
      guideline-based TIA treatment when compared to non-specialist transient ischemic attack
      treatment.

      The primary outcome of TELECAST-TIA is a composite score of 3 categories: diagnostic stroke
      evaluation, secondary stroke prevention, and stroke education. Individual components of the
      primary outcome were principally derived from AHA stroke guidelines. Additional outcome
      measures include individual analyses of the components of the primary outcome as well as the
      complication rate, stroke recurrence rate, transfer rate, patient and provider satisfaction
      levels, and a cost-analysis. All outcomes will be assessed at 1 year post-implementation,
      with data accruement starting after a 3-month lead in phase.

    <description>A 19-item global assessment of fundamental TIA treatment primarily informed by AHA guidelines/GWTG criteria, represented in 3 categories:
Diagnostic evaluation (10 items): neurologist evaluation, LDL, HgA1c, head CT, brain MRI, intracranial vascular imaging, cervical vascular imaging, EKG, telemetry, and outpatient prolonged cardiac monitoring.
Secondary prevention (6 items): antiplatelet, anticoagulation, statin, antihypertensives, diabetes management, and carotid revascularization.
Stroke education (3 items): tobacco cessation counseling, exercise/lifestyle counseling, and signs of stroke.
An item is not scored when not indicated clinically (for example tobacco cessation in a non-smoker), therefore the composite scores will be reported and analyzed as percentages.</description>
