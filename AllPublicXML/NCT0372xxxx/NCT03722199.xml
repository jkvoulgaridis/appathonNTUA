  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavanols are natural substances who are frequently found in our nutrition. A lot of research
      has already been executed in the past to investigate what effects this flavanols could have
      in the human population. Based on these examinations, the investigators think and suggest
      that flavanols can have positive effects on the vascularly system, more specifically on the
      peripheral and cerebral blood vessels. The effects are only observed in a healthy
      populations, meanwhile patient populations like diabetes patients could really benefit from
      this. This is why the investigators will execute this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is divided into 3 main groups, namely healthy controls, patients with
      diabetes type 2 (defined by American Diabetes Association's (ADA)) and patients with
      essential hypertension (the latter group is again divided into 3 subgroups: use of
      betablockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers
      (ARBs). Each main goup will consist of minimal 20 subjects.

      In this interventional study the investigators ask the patient to come twice. One time they
      get capsules with real flavanols and the other time they get capsules with a placebo. The
      study will be double blinded so nor the investigators, nor the patients now at which
      investigation they get the real flavanols or the placebo.

      Before and after the intake of these capsules, a few measurements will take place. These
      measurements will be compared on the one hand with the second investigation day
      (inter-patients and intra-patient) and on the other hand with the pre-intake measurements
      (intra-patient).

      The different examinations are a Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) test, blood pressure analysis
      and an exercise test.

      The investigator who performs the FMD-test, followed a course and needed to pass an
      examination.

      The blood pressure measurements will be continuously for 20 minutes to avoid to much bias.

    <masking_description>The different capsules are separated into 2 boxes but both sorts of capsules have the same colour and size. They just have a different number marked on the white box. During the investigation day, the participant chooses an envelope marked with number 1 or number 2 leading to the decision of the box and thus the capsules they will get.</masking_description>
