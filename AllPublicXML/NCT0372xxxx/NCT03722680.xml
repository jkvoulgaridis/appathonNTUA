  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a phase II trial, randomized, parallel, double blind, multicenter, comparing riluzole
      versus placebo.

      The trial population is composed of patients ≥18 years old that have developed stage II/III
      colorectal cancer and are eligible for Simplified FOLFOX4 (6-12 cycles) adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      The primary objective is to assess the preventive efficacy of riluzole on the severity of
      oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy during the Simplified FOLFOX4 adjuvant chemotherapy
      of stage II/III colorectal cancers.

    <description>QLQ-CIPN20 Questionnaire (EORTC):
Self-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions that assess the symptoms and functional limitations of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The questionnaire is divided in 3 subscales: sensory, motor, and autonomic and gives a comprehensive picture of the nature, frequency, and severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all,&quot; 2 = &quot;a little,&quot; 3 = &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms.</description>

    <description>The interview portion of the DN4 questionnaire is a clinician-administered screening tool for neuropathic pain. The questionnaire includes 7 items, grouped into two questions. Each item, is answered as either YES or NO. A final cumulative patient's score is obtained by allocating 1 point for each YES and 0 point for each NO. If the patient's score is ≥3/7, the test is positive.</description>

    <description>This self-reported questionnaire assesses different neuropathic pain symptoms. The French NPSI includes 12 items that discriminates and quantifies five distinct dimensions of neuropathic pain. Each of these items are quantified on a (0-10) numerical scale.</description>
