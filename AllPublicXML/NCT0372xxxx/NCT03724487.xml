  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hypertension among U.S. adults increased from 32% to 46% and African
      Americans are disproportionately impacted. Self-managing hypertension presents challenges
      such as dealing with complex treatment regimen, including critical components of recommended
      hypertension treatment such as self-blood pressure monitoring, and lifestyle modifications
      involving diet, exercise, and tobacco cessation. African Americans with hypertension have
      lower adherence to self-management behavior due to multifactorial reasons. Substantial
      evidence has demonstrated the important role of community support in improving patients'
      self-management of a variety of chronic illnesses, though integrating technology in such
      programs are rarely offered.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a community outreach program
      using a technology-based intervention (TBI) to support self-managing hypertension (called
      COACHMAN) to improve BP control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COACHMAN targets barriers to hypertension knowledge, medication adherence, problem solving
      skills, patient-provider communication, and social support in an effort to improve blood
      pressure control.

      The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT) using a community
      participatory research approach and mixed methods to evaluate the efficacy of TBI
      intervention with community support (Coachman) compared to enhance usual care (ECU) among 40
      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension.

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Identify key content, design, and resources from a community of stakeholders, including
           determining facilitators and barriers of hypertension self-management among African
           Americans that will inform the development of COACHMAN using a mixed methods approach
           methods.

        2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of COACHMAN to improve BP control.

        3. Compare the difference in BP control between Technology-based intervention (TBI) and
           Enhanced usual care (EUC).
