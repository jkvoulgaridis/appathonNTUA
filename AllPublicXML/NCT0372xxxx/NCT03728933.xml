  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of rotigotine against placebo in
      adolescent subjects with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) over a 12-week maintenance
      period and to investigate the safety and tolerability of rotigotine in adolescent subjects
      with idiopathic RLS.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period in International Restless Legs Rating Scale (IRLS) sum score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period (Day 78)</time_frame>
    <description>The sum score ranges from 0 (no RLS symptoms present) to 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms), which is the maximum score. A score between 31 and 40, indicates very severe RLS. A score between 21 and 30 indicates severe RLS. A score between 11 and 20 indicates moderate RLS. A score between 1 and 10 indicates mild RLS and a score of 0 means no RLS.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Item 1 to the end of the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period (Day 78)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Item 1 (Severity of Illness) score ranges from 0 to 7 as follows: 0=not assessed, 1=normal, not ill at all, 2=borderline ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill, 7=among the most extremely ill. The CGI Item 1 is to be completed during an interview between the subject and the investigator or designee.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Restless Legs-6 Rating Scales (RLS-6) to the end of the Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period (Day 78)</time_frame>
    <description>The RLS-6 Rating Scales is designed to assess the severity of RLS and consists of 6 subscales. The subscales assess severity of symptoms at the following times of the day/evening: falling asleep, during the night, during the day at rest, and during the day when engaged in daytime activities. In addition, the subscales assess satisfaction with sleep and severity of daytime tiredness/sleepiness.Scores for each of the 6 subscales range from 0 (completely satisfied) to 10 (completely dissatisfied).</description>
