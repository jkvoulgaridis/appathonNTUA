  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans or spouses of veterans with a minor child will participate in a five-week parenting
      program. The goals of the parenting program are to assist in improving parent's sense of
      competence, improving parent's emotional regulation abilities, and lower parental stress by
      incorporating mindfulness and values-based parenting principles. The program will utilize
      evidence-based practices that will be delivered in a manner that incorporates aspects of
      military culture (i.e., language and concepts are tailored to that used within military
      culture). Mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy have been shown to be effective
      in treating service members [1], and this will be the first study that examines how learning
      these principles do or do not impact parenting stress, competence, and practices. The
      parenting program is free, and is offered by the investigators as a community service.
      Participation in the parenting program does not obligate enrollment in the research study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are over 312,000 Veterans living in the state of Oklahoma [2]. The Coffee Bunker is a
      non-profit community agency in Tulsa, Oklahoma that serves as the flagships program for
      Serving Our Service Members (S.O.S). The Coffee Bunker's mission is to offer support to
      service members and Veterans by helping them reintegrate back into their families and
      communities. The overall purpose of the present study is to work with the Coffee Bunker in
      offering support towards their mission, specifically in delivering organized parenting
      programs to service members and Veterans.

      Challenges of reintegration after a military deployment can increase levels of stress for
      Veterans, spouses, and their children. In fact, it is common for Veterans or service members
      who struggle with reintegration in their family to report feelings of isolation and lack of
      perceived control, which may impact their ability to parent effectively. The struggles of
      parents can negatively impact the functioning of the family, such that children may exhibit
      more behavioral problems and Veterans parents may be more vulnerable to mental health
      symptomology [3, 4]. Fortunately, research suggests that positive and effective parenting
      practices can mitigate family stressors [5, 6]. As such, given the stressors of reintegration
      among military families, it may be advantageous to implement an evidence-based
      psychoeducation parenting program tailored to Veterans. The goals of the parenting program
      are to assist in improving parent's sense of competence, improving parent's emotional
      regulation abilities, and lower parental stress. The current project will be evaluating
      possible benefits from an evidence-based parenting program with military families. The
      parenting program is free, and is offered by the investigators as a community service.
      Participation in the parenting program does not obligate enrollment in the study. This is
      made possible by one of the PI's (Zanotti's) Schweitzer Fellowship; Zanotti is conducting the
      parenting program along with Dr. Cromer, as a community service.

      The research portion of this study will be voluntary, and while participants will be
      recruited from the parenting program, it will be made clear that they can opt into the
      parenting program without doing any of the research measures. The research portion evaluates
      whether participation in the parenting program reduces parenting stress, increases feelings
      of parenting competence, and improves parenting practices. This study is unique in that
      evidence-based practices will be delivered in a manner that incorporates aspects of military
      culture (i.e., language and concepts are tailored to that used within military culture). The
      parenting program will incorporate mindfulness and values-based parenting principles.
      Mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy have been shown to be effective in treating
      service members [1] and this will be the first study that examines how learning these
      principles do or do not impact parenting stress, competence, and practices.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parenting Sense of Competence after 6 weeks, using the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC; Johnston &amp; Marsh, 1989)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (i.e., approximately 6 weeks after the start of the parenting program).</time_frame>
    <description>The PSOC consists of 16 items about parents' confidence on being a parent, answered on a six-point scale ranging from ''strongly disagree'' to ''strongly agree''. Scoring for some items is reversed so that, for all items, higher scores indicate greater parenting self-esteem. Two subscales measure efficacy (seven items) and satisfaction (nine items) in parenting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parenting Stress after 6 weeks, using the Parenting Stress Scale (PSS; Berry &amp; Jones, 1995)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (i.e., approximately 6 weeks after the start of the parenting program)</time_frame>
    <description>This 18-item self-report measure assesses common stressors and positive components associated with parenting. Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale (i.e., 1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). Positive items are reverse scored. A total stress score is generated by summing the items together (i.e., range=18-90). Higher scores indicate greater parental stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parent's Emotion Regulation Abilities after 6 weeks, using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scales (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (i.e., approximately 6 weeks after the start of the parenting program)</time_frame>
    <description>This 36-item questionnaire assesses aspects of emotion regulation and dysregulation strategies utilized by individuals. Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale (i.e., 1=almost never, 5=almost always). Negatively worded items are reverse scored. Six component scores as well as a total scare is generated. Higher scores indicate greater emotion dysregulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parenting Practices after 6 weeks, using the Parenting Practices Interview (PPI; Webster-Stratton, Reid, &amp; Hammond, 2001)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (i.e., approximately 6 weeks after the start of the parenting program)</time_frame>
    <description>The PPI was adapted from the Oregon Social Learning Centre's Discipline Questionnaire. Two subscales were used; Harsh Discipline (14 items, a 1⁄4 0.79), and Positive Parenting (15 items, a 1⁄4 0.67). Parents reported the probability and the frequency with which they used the different strategies on a seven-point scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parenting Styles after 6 weeks, using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire-Short Form (APQ-9; Elgar, Waschbusch, Dadds, &amp; Sigvaldason, 2007)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment (i.e., approximately 6 weeks after the start of the parenting program)</time_frame>
    <description>This 9-item self-report measure assesses three styles of parenting: positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, and poor supervision. It has good convergent validity with longer measures of parenting styles. Responses are provided on a Likert scale where 1 = never, 2 = almost never, 3 = sometimes, 4= often, and 5 = always.</description>

    <description>All study participants will receive our parenting program curriculum. There will not be a control group.
The parenting program will include the topics of mindful parenting strategies, emotional regulation, positive discipline, and positive parenting/attachment. Participants will be provided skills to develop strategies for each of the modules. Each session will contain elements of group troubleshooting and practice in-session. Practice at home will be assigned so that participants can continue to practice and implement these skills and strategies in their homes.
The program is taken from a published, empirically based program called &quot;Everyday Parenting: A Professional's Guide to Building Family Management Skills&quot; written by Thomas Dishion, Elizabeth Stormshak, and Kathryn Kavanagh.</description>
