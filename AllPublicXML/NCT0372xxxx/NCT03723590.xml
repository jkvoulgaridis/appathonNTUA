  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn patients meeting inclusion criteria will receive the esterified hyaluronic acid matrix
      as the primary matrix to manage their wound, in conjunction with the standard of care for
      managing these types of wounds. The study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will
      entail intervention with the wound matrix and will continue until one of the following occur,
      sufficient granulation has occurred and the patient can receive a STSG, the patient's
      physician determines an STSG is no longer necessary or 42 days of use with the wound matrix
      occur. Phase II will begin following the STSG procedure. In this phase, the wound will be
      monitored and proportion of STSG take will be evaluated but no application of the wound
      matrix device will take place. This phase will continue for 28 days or if the physician deems
      the patient no longer needs regular care to monitor the wound, whichever occurs earlier.
