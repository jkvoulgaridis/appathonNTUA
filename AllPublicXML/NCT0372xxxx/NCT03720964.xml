  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to identify mitochondrial mutations associated with
      presbycusis. Patients affected by severe presbycusis and normal hearing controls (according
      to ISO7029 norm) will be enrolled if satisfying inclusion criteria (aged from 40 to 80 years
      old) in existing biocollections in the University Hospital of Angers. After DNA extraction,
      the mitochondrial genome will be sequenced and data in silico analysed.

      The study will be proposed to patients consulting in the ENT department of the University
      Hospital of Angers. After clinical examination and audiometry recording, the eligibility
      criteria will be checked and inclusion in biocollections proposed. Presbycusis affected
      subjects will be enrolled in &quot;Mitochondrial Disease biocollection&quot; and normal hearing
      controls in &quot;Healthy Volunteer biocollection&quot;. These biocollections have been approved by the
      board comitee &quot;Centre de Protection des Personnes&quot;.

      After DNA extraction and mitochondrial sequencing, candidate variants will be selected by in
      silico analysis. The presence of mitochondrial variants in both groups (presbycusis and
      control) will be compared in multivariate analysis if needed.

      The nuclear DNA may be sequenced in order to complete the previous analysis and look for any
      candidate variant .
