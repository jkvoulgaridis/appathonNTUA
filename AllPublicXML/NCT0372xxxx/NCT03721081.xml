  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol with remifentanil provides good operative conditions for pediatric cochlear implant
      (CI); however, large doses of remifentanil usually result in postoperative hyperalgesia and
      increase postoperative pain. Local anesthesia (LA) is commonly used as an adjunct to general
      anesthesia in children; however, otologists are usually reluctant in the use of LA as it can
      cause abolishment of the electrical stapedial reflex threshold (ESRT).

      Seventy children (1-6 years) undergoing CI were recruited. Children were divided into two
      groups. The LA group received subcutaneous infiltration of 0.5 ml/kg lidocaine 1% in
      adrenaline 1:200,000 and the CT group received 0.5 ml/kg of Na CI 0.9% in adrenaline
      1:200,000. The primary outcome was number of patients requiring rescue analgesia (tramadol)
      during the first 24-h postoperative. Secondary outcomes were haemodynamic variables, the
      ESRT, intraoperative anesthetic requirements, time to LMA removal, time to total recovery,
      pain scores, time to first rescue analgesia and incidence of vomiting.
