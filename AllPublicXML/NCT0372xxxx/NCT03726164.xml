      This study investigates the cardioprotective effect of remote ischaemic pre-/postconditioning
      in patients presenting with a NSTEMI/Unstable angina undergoing PCI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with Non ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) - NSTEMI and
      Unstable angina patients are enrolled in this study.

      Eligible patients are approached, with patient information sheets and are consented for
      involvement into the study. Patients are randomised to intervention or control. Patients
      randomised to intervention will receive 3 x 5 minutes of forearm ischaemia (with the cuff
      inflated to 200 mmHg) separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion between each cuff inflation,
      prior coronary angiography.

      This protocol of episodic forearm ischaemia/reperfusion has been demonstrated to confer
      remote ischaemic preconditioning-induced protection.

      Prior to the intervention, a blood sample will be taken to measure serum troponin T and CK-MB
      (baseline level). Following PCI patients will be reviewed on the wards and their ongoing
      recovery will be assessed and reviewed prior to discharge from the study. Troponin T and
      CK-MB levels will be measured for the 24 hours after PCI, at various time points (6 hour, 12
      hour, 24 hour) as a measure of the degree of myocardial damage, and levels compared between
      the different treatment groups.

      Primary end point

      Myocardial injury (Peri-procedural Myocardial Infarction and Injury) measured by cTnT and
      CK-MB release over 24 hours after primary PCI.
