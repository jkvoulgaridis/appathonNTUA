  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A global and integrative treatment of opioid-use disorders (OUD) with opiate maintenance
      therapy (OMT) and psychosocial interventions is recommended by all current guidelines.
      Treatment of OUD aim at prevents risks and consequences of opioid use (death by overdose,
      contamination with infectious diseases, mental and physical degradation, social exclusion and
      decrease of quality of life). OMT are approved since more than 20 years for OUD and a large
      number of patients have been treated. Nevertheless, identification of prognosis factors
      associated with good outcome is still limited. OMT duration, high dosages of OMT and patient
      good consistency have been identified as good prognosis factors but other individual factors
      could be involved and explain why OMT isn't as effective for all patients. The investigators
      assume that social environment, other addictive behaviors, psychiatric comorbidities,
      personality disorders and pharmacogenetics parameters might be of interest. Association
      between phenotype/ genotype, safety of OMT and therapeutic outcome will be especially
      assessed. For voluntary patients specific tools for risk reduction will be implemented
      (screening of infectious diseases with blood tests and fibrosis with fibroscan). Thus, the
      aim of TOPAZE study is to highlight prognosis factors for good outcome in the treatment of
      OUD moderate to severe at 12 months follow-up. Three main axes will be considered: clinical,
      pharmacological and pharmacogenetics.

      All patients with moderate or severe OUD diagnosis (according to Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual Diploma in Social Medicine 5) who initiate OMT in addictionology department of Nantes
      hospital or in addiction care and prevention centers of Nantes could be included. Data will
      be collected during 3 visits.

      During the first visit (inclusion), clinical interview, electrocardiogram, urinary and blood
      tests (pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics analysis) will be provided. Infectious disease
      screening and fibroscan could be also provided as the patient wishes. Inclusion visit will
      also correspond to initiation of OMT.

      At 6 months follow-up (second visit) clinical interview, electrocardiogram, urinary and blood
      tests (pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics analysis) will be provided.

      At 12 months follow-up (final visit) clinical interview, electrocardiogram and urinary test
      will be provided.
