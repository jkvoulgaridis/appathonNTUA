      To characterize the impact of orthostatic hypotension (OH) and reflex syncope on signals
      measured using a wearable cardiac monitor prototype device.

      To evaluate the relationship of signals measured from the wearable cardiac monitor prototype
      device with reported symptom severity of orthostatic intolerance per standard data
      collection, analysis, and questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized feasibility study that will enroll up to 50 participants that have
      undergone a previous autonomic reflect screen (ARS) assessment and were either diagnosed with
      OH or reflex syncope, or considered to be control subjects for this study.

      A maximum of 20 subjects diagnosed with reflex syncope, a maximum of 10 subjects diagnosed
      with OH and a maximum of 10 control subjects will be enrolled. There will be one study visit
      per subject.

  <overall_status>Suspended</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to COVID-19, part of the budget used to fund the COST3 trial has been eliminated. The study
    will start again in the near future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and capable to provide informed consent

          -  Age 18 or above

          -  No contraindications to undergo tilt table test, Valsalva maneuver test, and deep

          -  Previously underwent a clinically indicated ARS assessment without complications
             (including deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and tilt table testing). Previously
             diagnosed with OH, reflex syncope, OR control subjects assessed as normal, based on
             the ARS assessment. Patient enrollment shall be based on the type of diagnosis.

             deep breathing test (components of the ARS assessment)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled in another clinical trial that might interfere with data
             collection.

          -  Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study

          -  Active Implantable Medical Device, e.g. cardiac implantable electronic devices,
             bladder stimulators, diaphragm stimulators, implantable neuro stimulator, implantable
             active monitoring devices, implantable active drug administration devices, etc.

             unwilling to hold such medications for at least four half-lives prior to testing
             (judged by the study Principal Investigator)

          -  Have any contraindication for tilt test, Valsalva maneuver test or deep breathing test
