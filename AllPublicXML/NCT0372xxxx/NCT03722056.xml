  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric GISTs are rare neoplasms that require excision for cure. Although the feasibility of
      laparoscopic resection of gastric GIST less than 2cms has been established, the feasibility,
      safety and long-term efficacy of these techniques for larger lesions are unclear.
      Investigators hypothesized that laparoscopic resection of gastric GISTs even for larger
      lesions is feasible &amp; results in low perioperative morbidity and an effective long-term
      control of the disease.

      Open surgical resection was the standard of treatment until two decades ago, but with advent
      laparoscopy and experienced gained over the years, the safety &amp; feasibility of laparoscopic
      resections of gastric GISTs has been proven but for tumors less than 2 cm. However, with gain
      of experience and skill in laparoscopic surgery, many surgeons have reported a safety &amp;
      feasibility excision of tumors greater than 5 cm. Our current study demonstrates the
      oncologic safety of the laparoscopic approach even with tumour size range up to 12cm, with
      efficacy and recurrence rates similar or superior to historical open surgical controls,
      however, it requires considerable expertise for safe manipulation of the tumour. All these
      resections were accomplished with minimal morbidity, no perioperative mortality, and short
      post-operative stay and comparable long term oncological outcomes.

    <description>all patients with suspected Gastric GIST undergoes laparoscopic resection. Tumour location decides the approach used for resection. Therefore, a variety of options such as local resections, wedge resections, transgastric resections, intragastric resection and partial gastrectomies were performed.</description>
