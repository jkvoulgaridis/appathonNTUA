      To exam the metabolomic profiling of CSF and plasma in diabetes and establish the human CSF
      Metabolome Database of Type 2 DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is known to be a rich source of small molecule biomarkers
      for central neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the metaboloic bases of CSF
      in diabetes patient have not been studied. In this plan, the investigators will use
      analytical platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS), to perform quantitative metabolomics on human CSF and blood samples and
      further establish the human CSF Metabolome Database of DM. This work will can supply
      important CSF metabolic profit information and help to facilitate a wide range of metabolomic
      studies on central nervous system diseases and their associations disease.

    <description>Plan to enroll 120 Type 2 diabetes and 120 non-diabetes patients with received spinal anesthesia.Blood will be collected at time point of pre-anesthesia 10 minutes and CSF samples will be collected at time point during spinal anesthesia induction. Blood will be collected, drawn into EDTA-coated tube.</description>

      Blood will be centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 4000 rpm. The supernatant (plasma) samples
      will be stored in aliquots at −80 °C until analysis. CSF samples will be stored in aliquots
      at −80 °C before analysis. The sample will be analyzed using hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic
      resonance (1H-NMR) and lipid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in the Metabolomic Core
      Laboratory at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital or Chang Gung University. Demographic data
      including age, gender, body weight, blood pressure and past medical data will be
      investigated. Blood HbA1c, blood/CSF glucose and insulin level also will be measured.
