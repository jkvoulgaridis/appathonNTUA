  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in a cohort of 8
      adult volunteers who are receiving regular hemodialysis treatment (HD) 3 days a week for 4
      hours each day and have been taking a total daily dose of 5-10 mg of amlodipine besylate for
      &gt;30 days as part of their usual care. Blood sampling will occur over 13 hours, with frequent
      sampling during HD and in the 4 hours after termination of HD treatment. The 8 subjects will
      all receive their prescribed total daily dose of 5-10 mg 5 hours prior to HD treatment. The
      pre-HD sample will also be sent for pharmacogenomics genotyping. Safety and pharmacodynamic
      assessments (blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) assessments) will be performed
      throughout the study. Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
      will be used to evaluate genotype of CYP3A4. CYP3A4 phenotype will be evaluated using the
      ratio of parent drug to metabolite. Non-compartmental analyses will be performed to compare
      maximum concentrations (Cmax), time to maximum concentration and area under the curve from
      time 0 to the last measurable sample (AUClast) between the two phases. Compartmental analyses
      will be performed to construct a model to explain time-dependent changes in amlodipine
      clearance. Monte Carlo simulations will be performed to compare amlodipine pharmacokinetic
      profiles on and off HD.
