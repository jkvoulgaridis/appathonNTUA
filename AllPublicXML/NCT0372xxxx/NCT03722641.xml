  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect on postprandial glycaemia in a
      healthy population after intake of milk and oat based products.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial glycaemia, insulinaemia and GLP-1 will be measured after intake of test meals
      with equal amount of carbohydrates (adjusted using bread) and equal amount of total water.
