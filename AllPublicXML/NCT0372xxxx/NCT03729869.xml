    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if a hormone called progesterone affects marijuana
      users' stress response and marijuana use. Progesterone is a naturally occurring sex hormone
      involved in the menstrual cycle and reproduction, and has been shown to reduce withdrawal
      symptoms when people stop using substances like cocaine and nicotine. It is not FDA approved
      for treating cannabis users and is considered an investigational drug in this study.

      Participants will complete a screening visit to determine study eligibility. Eligible
      subjects will be scheduled to begin 22 days of study participation. During the first week,
      participants will be randomly assigned to take either progesterone or placebo (inactive
      medication) twice a day, and to abstain from marijuana use. During this week, participants
      will upload videos of themselves taking their medication and performing saliva drug tests.
      They will collect and store additional saliva samples each morning for hormone testing. They
      will also participate in &quot;CREMA&quot; sessions (Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary Assessment)
      three times a day. These sessions include looking at stressful and neutral pictures and
      rating stress and craving. At the end of this week, participants will return to the clinic
      and participate in a stress task. For the next two weeks, participants will continue to
      collect saliva samples and participate in CREMA sessions. They will return at the end of the
      two weeks to return study supplies. Urine samples will be collected at each study visit.
