  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of 190 virologically
      suppressed HIV-infected adults
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fundamental principle of regimen switching is to maintain viral suppression without
      jeopardizing future treatment options. The reasons to consider regimen switching in the viral
      suppressed population are to simplify the regimen by reducing the pill burden and dosing
      frequency, to increase the tolerability, reduce the adverse effects as well as long-term
      toxicities, to prevent drug-to-drug interactions and to avoid the dietary requirements.

      Generic TAF/E/D (tenofovir alafenamide 25mg/emtricitabine 200mg/dolutegravir 50 mg), a
      single-tablet once daily regimen, will be an affordable regimen with the potential
      characteristics such as reduced pill burden, less drug to drug interaction and toxicities.
      The generic form (Mylan) is recently received the tentative approval from the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) under the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
      Whether DTG-containing regimen is a better option than protease inhibitors among
      resource-limited settings during the decisions for second-line treatment options, is needed
      to be evaluated.

      All participants will be switched from their pre-study ART regimen to a single tablet regimen
      (STR) of TAF/FTC/DTG 25/200/50mg once daily.

    <description>Anxiety at baseline will be compared to anxiety level at weeks 24 and weeks 48. Anxiety will be assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). There are 7 different items that assess the level of anxiety of the participants based on a four-point grading scale specific for each item assessed (i.e., I feel tense or 'wound up'; 0 = not at all; 1 = from time to time, occasionally; 2 = a lot of the time; 3 = most of the time). If the total score is between 0-7, then this is considered to be normal. If the total score is between 8-10, then this is considered borderline abnormal (borderline case). If the total score is between 11-21, then this is considered abnormal (case).</description>

There are 7 different items that assess the level of depression of the participants based on a four-point grading scale specific for each item assessed (i.e., I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy; 0 = definitely as much; 1 = not quite so much; 2 = only a little; 3 = hardly at all). If the total score is between 0-7, then this is considered to be normal. If the total score is between 8-10, then this is considered borderline abnormal (borderline case). If the total score is between 11-21, then this is considered abnormal (case).</description>
