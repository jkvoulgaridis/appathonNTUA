    <textblock>
      Previous research has showed that parent-training programs derived from the developmental
      individual-difference relationship-based model (DIR) could improve the communicative
      development of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the empirical evidence
      is weak. This study therefore examines whether a DIR-based parent-training program can
      improve children's adaptive functioning and parents' parenting skills using a rigorous
      randomized controlled trial design with a dose-matched control group. Forty preschool
      children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents were randomly assigned to the
      parent-training program group or the traditional program group at the pre-test phase. Both
      groups received 14-week intervention programs and were assessed using pre- and post-tests.
      Children's development levels and adaptive functioning were assessed by the Functional
      Emotional Assessment Scale (FEAS), the Chinese version of Psychoeducational Profile-third
      edition (CPEP-3), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). In addition, parents'
      parenting skills were assessed by the FEAS and parenting stress was evaluated by the
      Parenting Stress Index-Short Form.

      Introduction: Preschool children with autism spectrum disorder and their parents face many
      difficulties in daily lives, including children's adaptive functioning, parenting skills, and
      parenting stress. Therefore, effective and economical interventions are very important to
      support them. With appropriate theoretical bases, a parent-training program could be
      effective, economical, and feasible while the clinical manpower is insufficient. Among
      current intervention programs, the play concept and the developmental, individual difference,
      and relationship-based (DIR) model match the philosophy of occupational therapy. Previous
      research had showed the play- and DIR-based parent-training programs would improve children's
      communicative development. However, the empirical evidence was still weak due to poor
      research designs and little research was comprehensively investigated children's adaptive
      functioning. Moreover, the results of improvement in parenting skills and reduction of
      parenting stress were not consistent. Aim: This study would implement a dose-matched control
      group and comprehensive measurements to examine if the play- and DIR-based parent-training
      program would improve children's adaptive functioning and parents' parenting skills as well
      as reduce parenting stress. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that the better improvements would
      show in the parent-training program than those in the traditional program. Method: We
      recruited 40 preschool children with autism spectrum disorder and their parents and randomly
      assigned them to either the parent-training program group or the traditional program group
      after pretest phase. Both of them conducted 14-week intervention programs and were assessed
      after interventions. Children's development levels and adaptive functioning were assessed by
      the Functional Emotional Assessment Scale (FEAS), the Chinese version of Psychoeducational
      Profile-third edition (CPEP-3), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). In
      addition, parents' parenting skills were assessed by the FEAS and parenting stress was
      evaluated by the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form.

    <description>The Functional Emotional Assessment Scale (FEAS; Greenspan et al., 2001) is based on six functional developmental levels of the developmental individual-difference relationship-based model and divided into two parts that (1) examine the children's development and (2) assess the parenting skills. All parents in the study were asked to record their parent-child activities as 15-minute videos. All videos were coded using random numbers to hide the research information (e.g. groups and test time). Two videos (pre- and post-test) were reviewed for each child. Using the Chinese version of the Scoring Form translated by Liao et al. (2014; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.85), each item of the FEAS was rated as 0, 1 or 2. Higher raw scores represent better functions and skills. The total score is summed and ranges from 0 to 80.</description>

    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The performance scale of the Chinese Version of Psychoeducational Profile-3 (Schopler et al., 2005; Heep Hong Society, 2013) comprises six subtests for developmental abilities (cognitive verbal/preverbal, expressive language, receptive language, fine motor, gross motor and visual-motor imitation), which are summed to create communication and motor composites. The score of each item is rated as 0, 1 or 2. All six subtests for developmental abilities can be converted to age-equivalent and composite scores. The communication and motor composites scores range from 0 to 60. The higher the scores are, the better function the children achieve.</description>

    <measure>Change Scores of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS; Sparrow et al., 1984) comprises four domains, that is, communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills, for assessing adaptive functioning in children aged 3 to 12 years old. The raw score in each domain and total raw score are converted to an age-equivalent score. The domain scores are also expressed as standard scores with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. The range for each subscale is from 20 to 140. The subscales are summed to compute a total score, ranging from 80 to 560. The higher the scores are, the better adaptive functioning the children achieve.</description>

    <description>Parents in the treatment group received the parent-training program based on the DIR model. The parent-training program encouraged child-initiated activities according to the functional developmental levels. The treatment intensity and duration were the same for both groups including 3-week courses and 11-week home programs. The investigators in this study are two registered pediatric occupational therapists who have at least five years of early intervention experience and had studied the DIR model.</description>

    <description>Parents in the treatment group received the training program from the registered pediatric occupational therapist in six hours over three weeks. The occupational therapist provided suggestions and gave feedback. The parents were encouraged to interact with their children for at least 15 hours per week. Between the fourth and 14th weeks, the parents implemented the intervention programs at home and recorded the daily intensity. The occupational therapist met with the parents and children at monthly intervals (the seventh and 11th weeks) at the laboratory to discuss any difficulties they encountered and to practice the child-initiated activities.</description>

    <description>Parents in the control group also conducted a 14-week program. They received six hours of training over three weeks.Between the fourth and 14th weeks, the parents implemented parent-led activities at home and recorded the daily intensity. The parents were encouraged to do activities with their children for at least 15 hours per week. The occupational therapist met with the parents at monthly intervals (the seventh and 11th weeks) at the laboratory to discuss any difficulties they encountered while practicing the parent-led activities.</description>
