  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and clinical activity of
      AB928 in combination with mFOLFOX in participants with advanced metastatic gastroesophageal
      Cancer (GEC) or colorectal cancer (CRC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the dose escalation phase, escalating doses of AB928 in combination with mFOLFOX at
      standard doses will be assessed in participants with advanced metastatic GEC or CRC. Eligible
      participants will receive oral administration of AB928 as well as IV infusion of mFOLFOX. The
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of AB928 will be determined upon completion of the
      dose-escalation phase.

      In the dose expansion phase, AB928 at the RDE in combination with mFOLFOX at standard doses
      may be assessed in participants with advanced metastatic GEC or CRC.

      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment
      may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons specified in
      the protocol.

             other AEs considered not clinically significant by the Medical Monitor and
             Investigator.

         10. Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) within 28
