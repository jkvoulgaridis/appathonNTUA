    <measure>Anxiety-reduction in high risk women undergoing MRI using a combination of cognitive-behavioral techniques and clinical hypnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive-behavioral anxiety management techniques will be presented in a workbook format and the clinical hypnosis will be presented as an audio recording. Patients will self report their level of anxiety before, during and after MRI.</description>
