  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive neurologic disorder to occur in adults
      of working-age. Despite longstanding recognition of cognitive impairment as a symptom of MS,
      two obstacles in measurement have limited understanding its biological basis, and therefore
      identifying targeted options for management. First is the absence of a sensitive and precise
      measure of cognitive impairment. Second is the absence of an index of disease status linked
      to brain pathophysiology and cognitive performance. This project overcomes both obstacles to
      link cognitive impairment to MS disease biomarkers. The absence of a sensitive and precise
      measure of cognitive impairment, along with the absence of an index of disease status linked
      to brain pathophysiology and cognitive performance, limits the understanding of the
      biological basis for multiple sclerosis (MS). This project overcomes both obstacles to link
      cognitive function to MS disease biomarkers, and provides preliminary evaluation of a disease
      modifying therapy (Tecfidera) for preserving cognitive function.
