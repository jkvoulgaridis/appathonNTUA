  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the genetic background of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that benefit
      from trastuzumab combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, identify clinically actionable
      mutations that associated with trastuzumab resistance or drug efficacy, we designed this
      Observational phase II trial. The primary endpoint is genetic profile of HER2+ breast cancer
      patients treated with trastuzumab combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints
      included pathological complete response (pCR) rate and safety.

    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with stage II-III breast cancer still accounts for a large population in
      China, and neoadjuvant therapy is considered the standard treatment for them. The
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate takes for an indicator for regimens efficacy, and
      the achievement of pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with favorable outcomes
      including disease-free survival and overall survival.

      HER2+ breast cancer represents an invasive and poor prognosis subtype, and the efficacy of
      neoadjuvant therapy for these patients has been greatly augmented by the addition of
      trastuzumab. However, more than 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab
      combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy cannot achieve pCR, even experience primary drug resistance
      and rapid disease progression. Therefore, to explore the genomic features of the population
      that benefited from trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy is of great significance for
      personalized treatment of HER2+ breast cancer, aiming to avoid overtreatment and identify
      clinically actionable mutations for future therapy instructions.

    <description>100 cases of patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer will be assigned participants to neoadjuvant treatment regimen, including Trastuzumab combined with Docetaxel and Carboplatin. 5-10 ml peripheral blood will be collected from each patient and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks/sections or fresh tumor tissues/biopsies will be obtained from the hospitals before and after neoadjuvant therapy. The genomic characteristics between patients achieved pCR and non-pCR will be analyzed. The clinically actionable mutations for future therapy instructions will be identified.</description>
