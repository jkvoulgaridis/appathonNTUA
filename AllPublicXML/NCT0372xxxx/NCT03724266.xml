  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PICO approach P (population): maxillary anterior teeth having necrotic pulp with symptomatic
      apical periodontitis with evidence of apical radiolucency (minimum size 2 mm x 2 mm).

      I (intervention):0.2% nanochitosan as intracanal medication. C (control): calcium hydroxide
      paste intracanal medication.

      O (outcome):

      Primary outcome: postoperative pain at time interval 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Postoperative pain, swelling, palpation, percussion and mobility at one week, 3, 6, 12
           months

        2. Number of analgesic tablets used at 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and one week.

        3. healing of apical periodontitis using CBCT at 3, 6, 12 months

    <measure>change in postoperative pain after intervention of chitosan: NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>4,12,24,27 hours</time_frame>
    <description>pain assessed by numerical rating scale, pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS) which is proven to be a simple, valid, and a reliable pain measurement tool. The NRS consists of a series of numbers from zero to 10 with the end-points representing the extremes of pain as &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the worst possible pain&quot;. Patients will rank their pain level by making a mark on the number they thought it represented their pain. The pain intensity is assigned into four categorical scores: 1, no pain (score 0); 2, mild (scores 1-3); 3, moderate (scores 4-6); 4, severe (scores 7-10). Pain is evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively after the initial visit at 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours</description>
