  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of treatment involving a single infusion
      of donor-derived regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg) in first time, living donor renal
      transplant recipients.

      DCreg will be prepared from monocytes obtained by leukapheresis from prospective
      (non-mobilized) living kidney donors and infused into the respective recipients 7 days before
      renal transplantation. This study will enroll 28 subjects (14 recipients, 14 donors). The
      duration of follow-up will be:

        -  1 week following the leukapheresis procedure for donors and

        -  2 years following their DCreg infusion for kidney recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a single-center, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1 study, enrolling
      N=14 de novo kidney transplant recipients and their respective living donors. The study
      objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a single infusion of donor-derived
      regulatory dendritic cell (DCreg) treatment.

      Transplant recipients will receive combination immunosuppressive agents according to the
      site's Standard of Care (SOC) regimen, with two exceptions:

        -  mycophenolic acid (MPA) will be initiated 7 days before transplant, at the time of donor
           DCreg infusion, instead of on the day of transplant; and

        -  the pre-transplant dose of MPA will be half the standard post-transplant dose, due to
           increased drug bioavailability in recipients with low kidney function defined by
           glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

      Consequently, participants will be maintained on triple immunosuppressive therapy with MPA,
      tacrolimus, and prednisone after transplant, a combination regimen widely applied as SOC at
      many transplant centers in North America and worldwide.

      Note: Participants will not be withdrawn from known effective therapy for the purpose of
      participating in this research.
