      This trial is to investigate the use of nivolumab in sequence with standard of care surgery
      and radiation/chemoradiation in locally advanced oral cavity Squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oral cavity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is usually treated with surgery, often followed by
      radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Unfortunately despite this treatment, it
      recurs or spreads in about half of patients. In this trial the investigators aim to
      investigate the use of nivolumab in sequence with standard of care surgery and
      radiation/chemoradiation.

      Following confirmation of eligibility patients will be treated with a single dose of
      nivolumab 1-2 weeks prior to surgery to remove their tumour. Based on pathological risk
      factors determined following surgery, patients will be assigned to undergo adjuvant
      radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Patients with high risk criteria (Extra capsular spread,
      involved margins) will be assigned to chemoradiotherapy. A further single dose of nivolumab
      will be given between surgery and commencement of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

      Following completion of chemo/radiation, patients will commence adjuvant nivolumab, with a
      total of 6 doses given at 4 weekly intervals. Patients will be followed up for 12 months post
      surgery.

      The primary objectives of this trial is to determine disease free survival at 12 months post
      surgery and the feasibility of recruiting to both cohorts.
