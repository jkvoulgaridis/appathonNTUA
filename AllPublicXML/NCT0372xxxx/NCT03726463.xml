  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADPKD is the most common form of hereditary kidney disease and is known to occur in 1 of 400
      to 1000 population in the U.S. ADPKD consists of 2.8% of patients receiving kidney
      transplantation in our center. It is known that ADPKD is associated with vascular anomalies,
      including abdominal aneurysms, valvular anomalies and especially intracranial aneurysms.
      Intracranial aneurysms occur in 9~12% of the ADPKD population which is higher than 2~3% in
      the general population and is known to be associated with PKD1 or PKD2 heritage.

      Until now, most of the studies regarding intracranial aneurysms in ADPKD are conducted in
      animal models, and there are only few cellular studies conducted from human samples. While
      performing kidney transplantation to ESRD ADPKD patients, arterial tissues from nephrectomy
      specimens can be obtained. The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanism of
      intracranial aneurysm in ADPKD patients by analyzing iliac and renal artery characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADPKD is associated with PKD1 gene on chromosome 16 and PKD2 gene on chromosome 4 and these
      gene respectively code polycystin 1 and polycystin 2. Currently the hypotheses for increased
      intracranial aneurysm rate in ADPKD patients is that mutation of polycystin is not only
      confined to nephron tissues but also in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells
      and results in mutation of vascular phenotype. Also recent studies show polycystin complex
      causes cystic changes through mutation in primary cilia in renal epithelium. Wild type
      endothelial cells respond to fluid shear stress by regulating levels of intracellular calcium
      and nitric oxide, however, PKD1 or PKD2 mutation in fetal aortic endothelial cells revealed
      loss of these responses.

      During kidney transplantation, bilateral nephrectomies are routinely performed to ADPKD
      patients. In this study, blood, urine, iliac artery and renal artery tissues will be
      collected from ADPKD patients receiving kidney transplantation to analyze the arterial
      characteristic and gene mutation of ADPKD patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      mechanisms associated with intracranial aneurysm occurence in ADPKD patients by analyzing the
      genetic mutation and vascular deformities of these patients.
