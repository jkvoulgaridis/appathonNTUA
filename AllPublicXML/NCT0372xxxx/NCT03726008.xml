  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan National Health Insurance system was launched in 1995 and the diagnosis and treatment
      for gestational diabetes mellitus were reimbursed. However, controversy regarding treatment
      and prevention programs for the other different levels of gestational hyperglycemia
      continues. Moreover, long-term follow-up studies for the impact of different levels of
      gestational hyperglycemia on women's perinatal consequences were not found. Thus, the purpose
      of the study, is to explore the effect of a perinatal health promotion program on three
      different levels of gestational hyperglycemic women's bio-psycho-social features and their
      offspring's development.

      The investigators will recruit 120 women with three different levels of gestational
      hyperglycemia and assign them to either experimental group (a total of 60 women of
      gestational hyperglycemia) or control group (a total of 60 women of gestational
      hyperglycemia). Data will be collected at the women's six-month gestation, hospitalization
      for childbirth, and six weeks, six months, and one year postpartum. The three-year study
      findings can demonstrate the consequences and risk factors for women with three different
      levels of gestational hyperglycemia to suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the
      results can be taken as an evidence-based intervention for the perinatal health promotion
      program in preventing the gestational hyperglycemic women to suffer from type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and in decreasing the impact of gestational hyperglycemia on the development of the
      gestational hyperglycemic women's offspring.

    <description>The newborn Apgar score in 1 and 5 minutes.The test is generally done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts.</description>

    <description>The Diabetes Management Self-efficacy Scale(DMSES) measures the individual's efficacy expectations for engaging in 20 type 2 diabetes self-management activities (Bijl et al., 1999).
The scale is scored according to a 1-5 point numerical scale indicating the level of efficacy expectation the respondent has for each item with higher scores indicating greater levels of self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Changes of postpartum stress</measure>
    <time_frame>about 2 days after hospitalization for childbirth, and six weeks after childbirth, six months after childbirth, and one year after childbirth.</time_frame>
    <description>The 62-item Hung Postpartum Stress Scale (Hung PSS) is a valid and reliable tool for assessing women's postpartum stress during the 42-day postpartum period.
Exploratory factor analysis indicated three components of postpartum stress: concerns about maternal role attainment, body changes and lack of social support (Hung, 2007) The Cronbach's alpha of the Hung PSS was 0.95. On a five-point Likert scale rating from 1 (not at all) - 5 (always), women rated each item on how often stress was perceived during the postpartum period. The score for postpartum stress was derived by summing all ratings, resulting in potential scores between 62-310. Higher values indicated a higher level of stress.</description>

    <measure>Changes of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>women's six-month gestational age, about 2 days after hospitalization for childbirth, and six weeks after childbirth, six months after childbirth, and one year after childbirth.</time_frame>
    <description>The 18-item Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire(TDQ) is widely used to screen for depression in Taiwan. The TDQ is a culture-specific, self-administered questionnaire; its sensitivity and specificity have been measured as 0.89 and 0.92, respectively (Lee, Yang, Lai, Chiu, &amp; Chau, 2000). Using a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 0-3), participants indicated whether and how often they experienced each item. Total scores ranged from 0 to 54; higher scores indicated more severe depression symptoms. The values of Cronbach's α at the five time points were .82 to .90.</description>

    <measure>Changes of health status</measure>
    <time_frame>women's six-month gestational age, about 2 days after hospitalization for childbirth, and six weeks after childbirth, six months after childbirth, and one year after childbirth.</time_frame>
    <description>We used the 12 items Chinese Health Questionnaire(CHQ) to measure perinatal women's health status (developed by Cheng (1985) and verified by Chong and Wilkinson (1989). Responses used a 4-point Likert scale (1 = not at all; 4 = most of the time). Responses of 1 or 2 were recoded as &quot;0,&quot; responses of 3 or 4 were recoded as &quot;1,&quot; and a total score ranging from 0 to 12 was calculated by summing the ratings (Chong &amp; Wilkinson, 1989). The CHQ's sensitivity and specificity have been measured as 91.9% and 66.7%, respectively (Chong &amp; Wilkinson, 1989); in this study, values of Cronbach's α ranged from .64 to .75 at the five time points.</description>
