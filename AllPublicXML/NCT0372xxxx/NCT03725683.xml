  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the endoscopic treatment of superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery in
      patients with lower extremity arteriosclerosis occlusion, the intercalation caused by the
      predilation of increasing caliber balloon and matching caliber balloon was compared, and then
      the impact of the two predilation methods on the intraoperative treatment strategy and short
      and medium-term prognosis was analyzed. The study was designed as a prospective,
      multi-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled study. It is planned to set up 5-10
      research centers with 340 subjects, and the single center will be less than or equal to 100
      subjects, in the form of competition from each research center.
