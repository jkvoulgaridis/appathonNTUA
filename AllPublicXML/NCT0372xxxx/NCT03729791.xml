  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial to reveal the effect of tDCS on
      negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and its underlying mechanism using the
      neuroimaging and electrophysiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will investigate the use of a novel technique, transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. tDCS permit the
      application of an extremely weak continuous electrical current to the brain through an anode
      and a cathode applied on the scalp. Anodal stimulation appears to increase brain activity
      whereas cathodal stimulation has the opposite effect.

      Using anodal and cathodal tDCS the investigators aimed to treat negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia. The investigators plan to apply tDCS such that it can simultaneously increased
      activity in the frontal brain areas and reduce activity over temporoparietal cortex, 2 areas
      involved in the physiopathology of the disease. Real active stimulation will be compare to a
      sham condition in 44 patients (22 in each group). 44 patients will be included in Seoul
      National University Hospital

    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of neurostimulation that uses constant, low direct current delivered via electrodes on the head. It can be contrasted with cranial electrotherapy stimulation, which generally uses alternating current the same way</description>
