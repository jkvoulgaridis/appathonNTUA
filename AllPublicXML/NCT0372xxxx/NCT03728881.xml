      Background:

      Cervical cancer is a dangerous disease caused by a germ called human papillomavirus (HPV).
      There are 3 safe vaccines that protect women against HPV and cancer. Currently, girls receive
      2 doses of HPV vaccine. Researchers want to test if only 1 dose is enough. This study in
      Costa Rica is one of several new 1-dose studies being done around the world.

      Objective:

      To find out if giving only 1 dose of the HPV vaccine Cervarix to young girls works the same
      as giving 3 doses of the HPV vaccine Gardasil to young women.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy girls ages 9-14

      Healthy women ages 18-25

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests and questions about their health.
      Their parents may answer some of the questions.

      Participants will get the vaccine as an injection in the arm. They will be observed for 15
      minutes each time they get the vaccine.

      Participants ages 9-14 will get the Cervarix vaccine 1 time. Six months later, participants
      (or their parents) will be asked about their health. This contact will be a phone call and
      will take about 5 minutes.

      Participants ages 18-25 will get the Gardasil vaccine 3 times over 6 months.

      All participants will have 1 half-hour visit every year for 3 years after getting the
      vaccine. This can be at the clinic or the participant s home. Participants and/or their
      parents will answer questions about the participant s health and any vaccines they received
      since the last contact.

      Participants will give a blood sample.

    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination successfully prevents targeted HPV infections, related
      precancerous lesions, and, ultimately, cervical and other HPV-related cancers. Despite the
      established efficacy of the HPV vaccine, most girls living in areas with the greatest risk
      for cervical cancer are not being vaccinated. The cost and logistical difficulties of
      vaccinating girls with the recommended multiple-dose administration has been a significant
      impediment to preventing this often-fatal cancer.

      The goal of this research is to provide convincing and actionable evidence for regulatory
      bodies that a single dose of the HPV vaccine will elicit an immune response sufficient to
      protect against targeted HPV infections and subsequent neoplasms. This study will provide
      earlier and complementary results to the definitive 24,000-girl study evaluating the vaccine
      efficacy for a 1-dose regimen against virologic outcomes, which is underway in Costa Rica and
      is scheduled to be completed in 2024/5. That study, called ESCUDDO, is being conducted by the
      U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones
      Biomedicas (ACIB).

      Our specific objective is to show that the immune response for 1-dose of the bivalent vaccine
      Cervarix in girls 9-14 years old is non-inferior to the immune response for 3-doses of the
      quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil in women 18-25, a dosage/population combination with
      demonstrated efficacy. We emphasize that we are evaluating a single dose using the more
      immunogenic vaccine (i.e. Cervarix) in the population (i.e. 9-14-year-old girls) that has the
      stronger immune response. Therefore, despite a 1-dose regimen eliciting lower titers than a
      3- dose regimen when using the same vaccine and population, we hypothesize that 1-dose of
      Cervarix in girls will be non-inferior to 3-doses of Gardasil in women. We would expect that
      a successful demonstration of non-inferiority will provide a direct regulatory pathway for
      label change, which would in turn promote early adoption of and preparation for 1-dose
      vaccine programs by relevant agencies (i.e. WHO). We note that new vaccines or new
      administrations of a vaccine have, in the past, been recommended or approved for licensure by
      demonstrating that the immune response for the new vaccination plan is non-inferior to the
      immune response from an existing, approved vaccination plan. For the HPV vaccine, these
      immunobridging studies have informed the recommendation for a two-dose administration, and
      vaccination in 9-14 year old girls and boys. Scientifically, this study can provide
      additional evidence that subunit vaccines with repetitive structures elicit sufficient
      antibody responses to confer protection and will demonstrate the importance of the adjuvant
      system to maximize plateau titer levels.

      From this effort, we anticipate one of two outcomes, which are summarized below along with
      their implications.

      Outcome #1: The HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels at 24 and/or 36 months from 1-dose of
      Cervarix in girls 9-14 years old are non-inferior to 3-doses of Gardasil in women 18-25 years
      old. The implication from this result is that 1-dose of Cervarix will be efficacious for
      protecting against incident HPV 16/18 infection and associated precancerous lesions. The
      result could lead to provisional approvals supporting a 1-dose regimen of the bivalent HPV
      vaccine by international and regulatory agencies (e.g., WHO, FDA, and EMA), contingent on the
      definitive corroboration of efficacy from ESCUDDO, which will deliver its results three to
      four years later.

      Outcome #2: The HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 antibody levels at 24 and 36 months from 1-dose of
      Cervarix in girls 9-14 years old cannot be demonstrated to be non-inferior to 3-doses of
      Gardasil in women 18-25 years old. The implication from this result would be that the vaccine
      efficacy of a single dose will need to be directly evaluated by demonstration of protection
      against pertinent virologic outcomes, as planned in our ongoing 1-dose ESCUDDO study.
