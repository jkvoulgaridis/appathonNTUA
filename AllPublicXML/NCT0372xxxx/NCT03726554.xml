      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled, dual cohort post
      market surveillance study. The primary objective of this study is to confirm the safety and
      performance of the Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder System when used with the Comprehensive
      Porous Augmented Glenoid Baseplate and/or Comprehensive Mini Humeral Tray in primary and
      revision reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Comprehensive Reverse Porous Augmented Glenoid Baseplate and Comprehensive Mini Humeral
      Tray belong to the Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty System. They were developed to
      provide patients with grossly deficient rotator cuffs with another surgical option. The aim
      of the Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder System is to increase shoulder function while reducing
      pain.

      A maximum of 7 sites will contribute to this study. Enrollment of 7 sites on a global scale
      will allow for assessment of device consistency across different regions. Enrollment per site
      will not exceed 45 shoulders. 146 implants will be included in this study with competitive
      enrollment. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed
      Consent process.
