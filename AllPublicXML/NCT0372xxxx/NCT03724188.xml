  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the clinical, laboratory and vascular calcification
      outcome within 6 months duration in patients undergoing surgical parathyroidectomy (total,
      subtotal, and total with autotransplantation)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients above the age of 18, with end stage renal disease maintained on regular
      hemodialysis and are indicated for surgical parathyroidectomy.

      The indications for parathyroidectomy included persistently elevated intact parathormone
      hormone levels of greater than 500 pg/mL, uncontrolled hypercalcaemia with hyperphosphataemia
      or clinical symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism refractory to medical treatment. These
      symptoms included bone pain, pruritus, fracture, fatigue and calciphylaxis

      These patients will be exposed to pre-operative evaluation of clinical, laboratory and
      vascular calcification in abdominal aorta and coronary calcium scoring using ECG- gated non
      contrast CT in hemodialysis patients undergoing parathyroidectomy

      Post-operative evaluation of clinical, laboratory and vascular calcification in abdominal
      aorta and coronary calcium scoring using non contrast CT will be done 6 months post-operative

      Assessment of the relation between preoperative and postoperative measures

      Patients with the following criteria will be excluded:

        1. chronic kidney disease patients not yet on regular Hemodialysis

        2. patients who had primary hyperparathyroidism

        3. patients who had received kidney transplantation

        4. patients who underwent repeated parathyroidectomy

        5. patients who were lost to follow-up or with missing data.
