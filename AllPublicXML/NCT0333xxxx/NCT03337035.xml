    <textblock>
      Because oral probiotics reported to potentially induce endogenous Oxytocin, and Oxytocin has
      been reported to improve social behaviors, the investigators will conduct a pilot trial to
      compare the effects of probiotics and Oxytocin on social behavioral changes in ASD children.
      Additionally, the investigators will check oxytocin levels, and perform brain fMRI in some
      subjects, in order to determine which treatment is more efficient, sustainable, and
      practical, and whether both treatments in combination are better than either treatment alone.
      If the trial is conclusive, the investigators will conduct a trial in large scale to
      understand more the mechanism of ASD behaviors and corresponding effective interventions.

      This study description is in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
      (CONSORT) guidelines that are published for the evaluation of randomized controlled trials.
      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study. Subjects will be
      randomized to 2 groups:

      Phase 1: a. oral placebo, and b. oral probiotics; Phase 2: a. intranasal Oxytocin(OXT) + oral
      placebo, and b. intranasal OXT + oral probiotics

      The treatment will proceed for a total of 28 weeks. In the first phase (16 weeks), all the
      patients will be randomly and proportionally divided into two groups: Group A (30 subjects)
      receives oral probiotics while Group B (30 subjects) receives an oral placebo. In the second
      phase, subjects in Group A and Group B will continue their respective oral probiotics or
      placebo administration as in Phase 1. In addition, both groups will be simultaneously
      administered with intranasal OXT spray.

      Testing will be performed 3 times total (before, during, and after treatment). The tests
      include behavioral surveys, cognitive tests, clinical autonomic tests, and blood tests for
      oxytocin levels. Investigators plan to select up to 10 subjects from each group to conduct a
      series of MRI studies at week 0, week 16 and week 28.

    <description>social behavior test - The total score is calculated based on 5 sub-scales (Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactive/Noncompliance, and Inappropriate Speech). There are 58 questions that are scored on a 0-3 scale 0 -&quot;not at all a problem&quot;, 1- &quot;the behavior is a problem but slight in degree&quot;, 2- &quot;the problem is moderately serious&quot; and 3- &quot;the problem is severe in degree&quot;.
