    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trials studies pembrolizumab and radiation therapy in treating patients
      with intermediate or high-grade soft tissue sarcoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab and radiation
      therapy may work better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the rate of complete histopathologic necrosis following the combination of
      pembrolizumab and neoadjuvant radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria following the combination of radiation and pembrolizumab.

      II. To confirm the tolerability and safety of the combination of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab
      and radiation in a population with localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) based on Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) per institutional standard at the Seattle
      Cancer Care Alliance as an outpatient therapy. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks, up to a maximum
      of three doses, for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily for 5-6 weeks beginning on Day 1 of Week 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days after last dose, 90
      days after last dose, 30 days after post-operative visit (wound care follow-up), and then
      every 12 weeks for up to 1 year, then every 6 months up to 5 years.
