  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 5 weeks treatment with
      dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients on how the hormone insulin acts on sugar uptake in
      muscles.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if dapagliflozin improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity expressed as
      corrected glucose disposal rate (cGDR) in comparison with placebo after 5-week double blind
      treatment. Insulin sensitivity will be determined using a 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
      clamp (EHC) procedure
