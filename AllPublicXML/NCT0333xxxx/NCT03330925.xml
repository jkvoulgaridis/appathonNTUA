    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and the feasibility of this
      device, and its ability to increase venous blood flow

      Primary safety Endpoint:

      To demonstrate the safety of the device- no serious adverse effect

      Primary feasibility Endpoint:

      Increase the blood flow velocity

      The blood flow will be detected by a Duplex Ultrasonography test at the popliteal vein and
      the femoral vein.

      The volunteers will rest at controlled environment room . Measurements will be performed
      after 30 min of rest without the device on the leg (baseline) and after 30 min of device
      activity .

    <time_frame>60 min</time_frame>
    <description>The primary feasibility assessment will be based on the ability of the device to increase the blood flow velocity at the popliteal vein. The blood flow will be detected by a Duplex Ultrasonography test at the popliteal vein. Two Measurements will be performed, the first will be after 30 minutes of rest without the device on the leg (baseline) (T0) and the second will be after 30 min of device activity</description>
