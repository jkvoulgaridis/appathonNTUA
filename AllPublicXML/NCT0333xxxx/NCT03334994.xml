  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of current study to evaluate connective tissue graft combined with immediate implant
      placement as an innovative option for less facial gingival tissue recession, less pocket
      depth and less clinical attachment loss versus immediate implant alone.

      P: Adult patients with single or multiple non-restorable teeth in esthetic zone I: Immediate
      implant + Connective tissue graft. C: Immediate implant alone. O: Primary Outcome: Facial
      gingival level Secondary Outcome: Patient satisfaction, probing depth, probing attachment
      loss, tissue biotype, keratinized mucosal width and bleeding on probing.

      P.M will select patients from the outpatient clinic of the Oral Medicine and Periodontology
      Department - Cairo University. Screening of patients will continue until the target
      population is achieved. Identifying and recruiting potential subjects is achieved through
      patient database.

    <masking_description>Blinded participants: patient will be ensured by masking the instruments during the surgery. The patient will be informed of the steps of the surgery (as mentioned in the consent form) without getting into details. Blinding to the clinical, radiographic assessors is done by not involving them in sequence generation or allocation concealment or surgery performing.</masking_description>
