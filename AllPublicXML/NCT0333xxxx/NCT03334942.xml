      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Child and Family
      Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI), provided soon after a violent traumatic event, in
      producing significant and sustained reduction in PTSS among assault injured youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to target modifiable risk and protective factors during the early post-trauma
      period may promote recovery and reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following violent
      injury by facilitating cognitive and emotional processing of trauma reactions, increasing
      coping capacity, and providing emotional support.

      Investigators seek to evaluate the effectiveness of the Child and Family Traumatic Stress
      Intervention (CFTSI), provided soon after a violent traumatic event, in producing significant
      and sustained reduction in PTSS among assault injured youth.

      Participants will be recruited from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) emergency
      department (ED) or Trauma Unit following interpersonal assault. Investigators seek to enroll
      300 participants from CHOP. Participants must reside in Philadelphia County with a caregiver
      for at least the last six months, be 8 to 18 years of age (inclusive), have been received for
      an injury resulting from a qualifying interpersonal assault, and both child and caregiver
      must be able to speak English. Youth must have a Child Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      Symptom Scale (CPSS) score &gt; or = 11 during study screening.The Child and Family Traumatic
      Stress Intervention (CFTSI) is the study intervention. The primary outcome measure is
      youth-reported PTSS at 4 and 10 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Research assistants (RAs) will perform eligibility screening in the CHOP ED or Trauma Unit on potentially eligible youth and their caregivers who present for care following an assault-related injury. For individuals discharged before being screened, RAs will phone them within 14 days of discharge for screening. Consented youth and caregivers will complete baseline study assessments followed by random assignment to either the intervention [Violence Intervention Program (VIP) with Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI)] or control (VIP-only) conditions. VIP is the standard of care provided to assault injured youth treated in the CHOP ED or Trauma Unit. The study coordinator or VIP staff member will notify youth of their assigned condition. CFTSI clinicians will schedule intervention sessions with the families in community-based mental health centers. RAs will be blinded to participant condition and administer baseline and follow-up assessments to all participants.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS-5) score from baseline to 4 months post-ED visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in youth ages 8 to 18 years old. Items correspond to DSM-5 PTSD symptom criteria. Symptom items are rated on a Likert-type scale (0-1-2-3-4) corresponding to &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;6 or more times a week/almost always.&quot; The CPSS yields a symptom severity score (sum of responses) and can be scored for possible PTSD diagnosis. Possible CPSS-5 scores range from 0 to 80. Based on the current evidence regarding screening for PTSD risk, we will employ a screening cut-off (greater than or equal to 11) on the summed CPSS severity score from 20 symptom items, indicating moderate PTSS.</description>

Item responses are summed to create an RCADS total score with higher scores indicating greater frequency of anxiety and low mood. Possible scores on the short form range from 0 to 75.</description>

    <description>The SDQ and SDQ-P assess externalizing and internalizing problem areas (conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, peer problems) as well as pro-social behavior in youth. The measure has age-tailored parent- and self-report versions, with two questions assessing intervention change. Items are scored as &quot;not true&quot;, &quot;somewhat true&quot;, or &quot;certainly true.&quot; The first four problem subscales (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer problems) are summed to create a Total Difficulties scale score ranging from 0 to 40. Higher scores on the difficulties subscales and Total Difficulties scale correspond to higher levels of difficulty. Higher scores on the prosocial behavior scale indicate higher levels of strengths.</description>

    <description>The Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI) is a 5-8 session intervention, initiated within 60 days of trauma exposure for youth reporting acute PTSS. CFTSI is designed for children age 7 and older, and requires the involvement of a caregiver who knows the child well enough to report changes in the child's behavior and symptoms. CFTSI targets modifiable risk and protective factors during the early post-trauma period to promote recovery and reduce PTSS via caregiver-child communication and cognitive and emotional processing. CFTSI uses skill modules (e.g., sleep disturbance, intrusive thoughts, anxiety) to teach effective strategies to decrease a child's PTSS. Coping and communication skills are taught and practiced in caregiver-child sessions and in the home.</description>
