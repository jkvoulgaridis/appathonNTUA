      The purpose of the DIAMOND-AF study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of the
      DiamondTemp System for the treatment of drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation in patients.

    <textblock>
      The DIAMOND-AF study is a prospective, single blind, 1:1 randomized controlled study being
      performed at multiple centers in the United States, Canada and Europe. The study will
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the DiamondTemp System used for ablation in patients
      with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Subjects will be randomized for treatment with
      either the DiamondTemp Ablation Catheter or the TactiCath™ Quartz Contact Force Ablation
      Catheter manufactured by Abbott. Patients will be followed for 12 months.

    <description>Accumulated changes in QOL using the AF QOL Survey (AFEQT Questionnaire) from baseline through 6 and 12 months following ablation procedure.
The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) Questionnaire is an atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life Questionnaire. The overall AFEQT score can range from 0 to 100, with 0 corresponding to complete disability and 100 corresponding to no disability. So a higher AFEQT score means a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Neurological changes measured using the NIH stroke scale between baseline and post-ablation (pre-discharge visit) and at 12 months post-ablation procedure.
The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. The total NIHSS score can range from 0 to 42, with 0 indicating no stroke symptoms and 42 indicating extremely severe stroke symptoms. So a higher NIHSS score means a worse outcome.</description>
