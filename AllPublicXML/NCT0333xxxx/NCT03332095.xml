    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      doravirine (also called MK-1439 or DOR) and doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (also called MK-1439A or DOR/3TC/TDF) in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of DOR and
      DOR/3TC/TDF in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents.

      This study will be conducted in two cohorts: Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. At study entry (Day 0),
      participants in Cohort 1 will receive a single dose of DOR added to their current HIV
      regimens. (The antiretroviral drugs in their current HIV regimens will not be provided by the
      study.) Participants in Cohort 1 will undergo intensive PK evaluations, and they will have an
      additional study visit at Week 2.

      The study team in consultation with a Study Monitoring Committee will evaluate data from
      Cohort 1 before enrolling participants in Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive
      DOR/3TC/TDF once daily from Day 0 through Week 96. They will attend study visits at Weeks 1,
      2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 64, 80, and 96. Study visits will include physical examinations,
      PK evaluations, and blood and urine collection.
