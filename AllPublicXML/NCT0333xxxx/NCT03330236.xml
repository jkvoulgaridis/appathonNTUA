  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, double blinded, randomized and controlled parallel trial to
      investigate the effect of the anesthetic care guided by EEG monitor (SedLine) on
      postoperative delirium. EMODIPOD = Electroencephalography Monitoring tO Decrease the
      Incidence of PostOperative Delirium

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of the anesthetic care guided by EEG monitor (SedLine) on (1) the
      incidence of delirium in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and within the first five days
      after laparoscopic surgery and (2) the incidence of in-hospital complications and 30-day
      mortality in adult patients after laparoscopic surgery.

    <description>All patients in the study arm will receive the anesthetic care guided by the SedLine EEG Brain Function Monitor in addition to the conventional monitors. In addition to the conventional/standard interventions of anesthetic care, an additional intervention related to this trial is the anesthetic &quot;depth&quot; management via the titration of the propofol and remifentanil infusion rates to maintain SEF and PSI in the targeted ranges based on the SedLine EEG monitoring.</description>

Patients in the control arm will be monitored using the SedLine EEG Brain Function Monitor; however, the screen of this monitor will be covered by an opaque cloth and blinded to the anesthesia team.</description>
