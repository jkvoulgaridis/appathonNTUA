    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of GDC-9545 as a single agent and in combination with
      palbociclib and/or luteinizing hormone−releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in participants with
      advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) breast cancer.
