  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy and
      some patients who relapse following CD19 directed therapy relapse with CD19 negative
      leukemia. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T-cells obtained directly
      from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express two chimeric antigen receptors
      (CARs). One is to recognize CD19 and the other is to recognize CD22, both of which are
      proteins expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD19+CD22+ leukemia.
      The CAR enables the T-cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through recognition of
      CD19 and CD22. This is a phase 1 study designed to determine the safety of the CAR+ T-cells
      and the feasibility of making enough to treat patients with CD19+CD22+ leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First 2 subjects: male and female subjects age â‰¥18 and &lt; 27 years (as of 2/16/18 the
             first 2 subjects were enrolled and treated); subsequent subjects &lt;31 years.

          -  Diagnosis of CD19+22+ leukemia

          -  Disease status:

               -  If post allogeneic HCT: Confirmed CD19+CD22+ leukemia recurrence defined as at
                  least 0.01% disease following allogeneic HCT

               -  If relapse/refractory status with no prior history of allogeneic HCT, one of the
                  following:

               -  First marrow relapse at end of first month or re-induction with marrow having at
                  least 0.01 % blasts by morphology and/or MPF

               -  Primary refractory as defined as greater than 5% blasts by multi-parameter flow
