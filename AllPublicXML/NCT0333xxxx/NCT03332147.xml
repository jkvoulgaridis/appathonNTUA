  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares both of the investigational device and reference device to the gold
      standard Patient Monitor of the accuracy of heart rate and respiratory rate monitoring. The
      primary variables for the analysis of heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) are each of
      the overall mean roots mean square difference (RMSD). Results of the investigational device
      and reference device compared with the patient monitor is evaluated to see if there are
      equivalent. Motion and bed exit accuracy will be evaluated by comparing with the manual
      observation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The testing will be conducted in three periods. In the Accuracy Tests (periods

      1 and 2), one of the contact-free devices will be used to monitor the HR and RR, while being
      compared with the Patient Monitor. The RHEA investigational device and reference device will
      be used to monitor the same subject at different times, as the sensors of the two devices are
      placed at a similar location of the bed. HR and RR will be recorded for all three devices.

      The primary hypotheses for HR, are as follows:

      Adults HO: μ = 3.25 vs. HA: μ &lt; 3.25

      The primary hypotheses for RR, are as follows:

      Adults HO: μ = 2.25 vs. HA: μ &lt; 2.25 where μ represents the population mean HR or RR. If the
      upper bound of the confidence interval is less than the hypothesized value, the corresponding
      null hypothesis will be rejected. Comparison of the performance of the two contract-free
      devices will be performed on the recorded results via statistical analysis. The hypothesis
      here is that the two devices have equivalent performance. The third test will assess the
      ability of the RHEA device to accurately detect motion in or exit from the bed, as compared
      to the manual observation. Motion and no motion accuracy will each be calculated along with
      their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

    <intervention_model_description>The reference device and Patient Monitor are used to monitor the heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) of the same participant at the same time in Test 1. The RHEA device and patient monitor are used to monitor the heart rate and respiratory rate of the same participant at the same time in Test 2. The two tests results will be compared and evaluated for the accuracy of the two devices. The RHEA device is used alone to evaluate the accuracy of motion or no motion alarm in Test 3.</intervention_model_description>
