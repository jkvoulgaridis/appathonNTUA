  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole
      intravenous solution in Chinese participants at high risk for invasive fungal infections.
      Neutropenic participants undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndromes will be enrolled in the study. The primary hypothesis is to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenous (IV) posaconazole (POS) solution in
      Chinese participants at high risk of invasive fungal infections and determine the percentage
      of Chinese participants who reach steady-state concentration averages of POS in blood plasma
      of 500 ng/ml and higher. Two subgroups were evaluated: Subgroup 1 from serial PK blood draw
      sampling and Subgroup 2 from sparse limited PK blood draw sampling.
