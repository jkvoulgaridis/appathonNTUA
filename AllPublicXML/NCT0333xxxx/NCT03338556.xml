    <description>Overall total symptom score (TSS), defined as the sum of the total symptom scores from day 1 to day 8 inclusive, using the 10-point symptom diary card on a 0 - 3 point scale
The following symptoms in the 10-item symptoms questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0-3, where Grade 0 was absence, Grade 1 was just noticeable, Grade 2 was bothersome but did not prevent participation in activities, and Grade 3 was bothersome and interfered with activities:
Runny nose, Stuffy nose, Sneezing, Sore throat, Earache, Tiredness, Cough, Shortness of breath, Headache, Muscle/joint ache.
Diary cards were filled out 3 times/day on Day 1-7 and once on Day 8. Possible range of outcomes for TSS: 0 - 660 (higher numbers indicating worse outcomes)</description>

    <description>Total symptom scores (from the 10-item modified Jackson symptom diary card) were used to calculate the AUC, from Day 1 (Assessment 1) to Day 8, after challenge, for each subject using the trapezium rule, based on the available non-missing calculated total symptom scores between Day 1 (Assessment 1) and Day 8. The 10-point symptom diary card, measured three times daily was combined to generate total symptom score. The following symptoms in the 10-item symptoms questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0-3, where Grade 0 was absence, Grade 1 was just noticeable, Grade 2 was bothersome but did not prevent participation in activities, and Grade 3 was bothersome and interfered with activities:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18 to 55 years on the day of first dosing with Investigational Medicinal Product
             (IMP).

          2. In good health with no history of major medical conditions from the medical history,
             physical examination, and routine laboratory tests as determined by the Investigator
             at a screening evaluation. A subject with a history of Herpes type 1 or 2 infection
             may be included if there are no active lesions present and the subject is not taking
             active medication.

          3. A total body weight ≥50 kg and Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥18 kg/m2. If the BMI is more
             than 30 kg/m2, the subject may be included if the waist measurement is less than 102
             cm (male), or less than 88 cm (female).

          4. The following inclusion criteria are applicable to subjects who are in a heterosexual
             relationship and female subjects in a female same sex relationship (i.e. the criteria
             do not apply to those in a male same sex relationship):

               1. True abstinence - when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception).

                  Or

               2. Two forms of effective contraceptive methods among (between) the couple, which
                  are defined as:

                  • For males: i. Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream, sterilisation (with
                  the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the
                  ejaculate. This applies only to males participating in the study).

                  • For females: i. Women no longer of child bearing potential (post-menopausal
                  females are defined as having a history of amenorrhea for at least 2 years,
                  otherwise they should have documented status as being surgically sterile or post
                  hysterectomy. The latter applies only to female subjects participating in the
                  study).

                  ii. If of childbearing potential, then acceptable forms of contraception include:

                  o Established (a minimum of 2 weeks prior to first dosing with IMP) use of oral,
                  injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.

                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps), both with one of the following - spermicidal
                       foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

                       • The longevity of contraception is as follows: i. Male subjects must comply
                       with agreed contraception from the first IMP dosing, and continuing until 90
                       days after the date of the last IMP dosing or Viral Challenge which ever
                       happens later.

                  ii. Male subjects must not donate sperm following the first IMP dosing, and
                  continuing until 90 days after the date of the last IMP dosing or Viral Challenge
                  which ever happens later.

                  iii. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy
                  test at screening and just prior to the date of first dosing with IMP and must be
                  using contraception consisting of two forms of birth control (one of which must
                  be a barrier method) starting from at least 14 days prior to the first IMP dosing
                  and continuing until 90 days after the date of the last IMP dosing or Viral
                  Challenge whichever happens later.

          5. An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject and the Investigator.

          6. Sero-suitable for the Challenge Virus.

          7. Subjects must be willing to comply with the protocol visit schedule including both
             face to face and phone visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have a significant history of any tobacco use at any time (total ≥10 pack

             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with a subject completing the
             study. The following conditions apply:

               -  Subjects with clinically mild atopic eczema/atopic dermatitis may be included at
                  the Investigator's discretion (e.g., if there is no regular use of topical

               -  During screening, if subjects have a total cholesterol level &gt; 6mmol/l they will
                  be excluded from the study.

               -  Any concurrent serious illness (e.g., COPD, history of malignancy) that may
                  interfere with a subject completing the study. Basal cell carcinoma within 5

             abnormalities in spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced
             vital capacity (FVC)).

          5. History or evidence of autoimmune disease or known immunodeficiency of any cause -

             (prescription and/or non-prescription), including vitamins or herbal and dietary
             supplements within the specified windows, unless in the opinion of the Investigator
             and/or Sponsor's Medical Expert, the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety. Specifically, the following are excluded:

The following symptoms in the 10-item symptoms questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0-3, where Grade 0 was absence, Grade 1 was just noticeable, Grade 2 was bothersome but did not prevent participation in activities, and Grade 3 was bothersome and interfered with activities:
Runny nose, Stuffy nose, Sneezing, Sore throat, Earache, Tiredness, Cough, Shortness of breath, Headache, Muscle/joint ache.
Diary cards were filled out 3 times/day on Day 1-7 and once on Day 8. Possible range of outcomes for TSS: 0 - 660 (higher numbers indicating worse outcomes)</description>
