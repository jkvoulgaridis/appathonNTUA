  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of subcutaneous givosiran (ALN-AS1),

    <measure>Annualized Rate of Porphyria Attacks in Participants With Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Porphyria attacks were defined as meeting all of the following criteria: an acute episode of neurovisceral pain in the abdomen, back, chest, extremities and/or limbs, no other medically determined cause, and required treatment with intravenous (IV) dextrose or hemin, carbohydrates, or analgesics, or other medications such as antiemetics at a dose or frequency beyond the participant's usual daily porphyria management. The annualized rate of porphyria attacks is a composite endpoint which included porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin administration at home.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Change From Baseline in Weekly Mean Score of Daily Worst Pain as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in Participants With AIP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated worst daily pain score in an eDiary using the 11-point BPI-SF NRS, in which 0=no pain and 10=worst pain. Daily eDiary entries were averaged into a weekly (i.e. 7 day) score. The change from baseline in weekly mean scores is defined as the post baseline weekly mean score minus the baseline score. Lower scores indicate an improvement. The 6-month AUC was calculated based on change from baseline in weekly mean scores.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) in Participants With AIP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a survey designed for use in patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference. A higher score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Annualized Rate of Porphyria Attacks in Participants With Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</title>
        <description>Porphyria attacks were defined as meeting all of the following criteria: an acute episode of neurovisceral pain in the abdomen, back, chest, extremities and/or limbs, no other medically determined cause, and required treatment with intravenous (IV) dextrose or hemin, carbohydrates, or analgesics, or other medications such as antiemetics at a dose or frequency beyond the participant's usual daily porphyria management. The annualized rate of porphyria attacks is a composite endpoint which included porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin administration at home.</description>

        <title>Average Change From Baseline in Weekly Mean Score of Daily Worst Pain as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in Participants With AIP</title>
        <description>Participants rated worst daily pain score in an eDiary using the 11-point BPI-SF NRS, in which 0=no pain and 10=worst pain. Daily eDiary entries were averaged into a weekly (i.e. 7 day) score. The change from baseline in weekly mean scores is defined as the postbaseline weekly mean score minus the baseline score. Lower scores indicate an improvement.</description>

        <description>The SF-12 is a survey designed for use in patients with multiple chronic conditions. This 12-item scale can be used to assess the physical and mental health of respondents. 10 of the 12 questions are answered on a 5 point likert scale and 2 are answered on a 3 point likert scale. The questions are then scored and weighted into 2 subscales, physical health and mental health. Respondents can have a score that ranges from 0-100 with 100 being the best score and indicating high physical or mental health. A 3 point change in SF-12 score reflects a meaningful difference. A higher score indicates improvement.</description>
