    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 study to
      evaluate the efficacy of a new formulation of phenylephrine HCl and a currently marketed
      phenylephrine HCl for relief of nasal congestion in subjects with naturally occurring cold
      symptoms.

             the common cold) as determined by the Investigator at screening.

               -  Blood pressure must be within the following limits after sitting for
                  approximately 5 minutes: &gt; 90 and &lt;140 mm Hg systolic, and &gt;50 and &lt;90 mm Hg

         21. Other severe, acute or chronic, medical or psychiatric condition(s) or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or IP
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

         22. Currently participating in another clinical trial or has done so in the past 30 days.
