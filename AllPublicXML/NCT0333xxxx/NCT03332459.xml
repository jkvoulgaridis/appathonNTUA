  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term follow-up (LTFU) study is to evaluate the incidence of the
      clinical diagnosis of asthma and the frequency of wheezing in infants and children with
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection who were treated with (lumicitabine or placebo)
      and have completed their last planned studyâ€‘related visit in a feeding Phase 2 study
      (64041575RSV2004).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSV is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. The primary hypothesis
      is that treatment of RSV-infected infants/children with lumicitabine (also known as
      JNJ-64041575 or ALS-008176) will decrease subsequent wheezing/asthma compared to placebo
      (looks like lumicitabine). The participants who have completed treatment course
      (lumicitabine/placebo) and last study visit in a previous study, 64041575RSV2004, for the
      treatment of RSV infection will be enrolled in this LTFU study. The main purpose of this
      study is to understand the impact of lumicitabine on the occurrence of asthma/wheezing in
      infants/children with a history of RSV infection. The participants will be assessed via
      monthly calls with the parents/caregivers and also at site visits at 3, 6,12 and 24 months.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. Number of participants with reportable AEs (considered as respiratory illness AEs, including subsequent RSV infections; AEs considered at least possibly related to lumicitabine or placebo) will be reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and may jeopardize participant and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
