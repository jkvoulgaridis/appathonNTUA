  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile and treatment effect
      of pamiparib in Chinese participants with advanced high-grade ovarian cancer (including
      fallopian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer) and triple negative breast cancer in phase I,
      and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamiparib in Chinese participants with recurrent
      epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer),
      harboring germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/gene 2 (BRCA1/2) mutation in phase II.

             Participants who have histologically or cytologically confirmed high-grade epithelial
             ovarian cancer (including fallopian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer), harboring
             germline BRCA1/2 mutation

          4. Participants must have measurable disease as defined per the RECIST, version 1.1.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1

             investigational agent, anti-cancer Chinese medicine, or anticancer herbal remedies ≤
             14 days (or ≤5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) prior to starting study drug, or who
             have not adequately recovered from the side effects of such therapy.

          2. Participants who have undergone major surgery for any cause ≤ 4 weeks prior to
             starting study drug. Participants must have adequately recovered from the previous

             study drug. Participants must have adequately recovered from the previous treatment
             and have a stable clinical condition before entering the study.
