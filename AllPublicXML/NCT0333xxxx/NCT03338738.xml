  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global spread of ESBL-producing enterobacteria (EBLSE) poses a real public health
      problem. The exposure of patients to antibiotic therapy leads to an increase in resistant
      bacterial populations within the digestive flora. As a result, the diagnosis of digestive
      colonization by EBLSE is an event that has become common in hospitalized patients in
      intensive care / intensive care under high pressure antibiotics. The aim of this work is to
      study the impact of beta-lactams frequently prescribed on the microbiota and the emergence of
      multiresistant bacteria in the digestive flora and to evaluate, in colonized patients, the
      factors associated with the occurrence of an infectious episode. In particular, the impact of
      the relative fecal abundance of ESBL enterobacteriaceae on the occurrence of this event will
      be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among enterobacteria, the production of ESBL is the first cause of multi-resistance. The
      consequences of multidrug-resistant enterobacterial infections predominantly represented by
      ESBLs are currently well known, both from the individual point of view (increase in mortality
      and length of hospital stay) and collective (increase in costs of care). Data from the
      literature reveal an increased risk of ESBL bacteremia in patients with rectal carriage of
      ESBL-producing enterobacteria. It therefore appears necessary in known patients with
      ESBL-producing enterobacteria to evaluate the impact of different antibiotics (beta-lactams)
      on the modification of flora, the increase of faecal abundance in multidrug-resistant
      bacteria such as E. coli ESBL and evaluate the factors associated with infections in these
      patients.

    <description>Patients with ESBL, antibiotic pressure will be included. On the day of inclusion, a stool culture is performed on the first stool issued after the start of antibiotic therapy in order to evaluate the initial flora and the relative initial faecal abundance of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In the absence of stool emission by the patient, a rectal swab will be performed. 72 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy, a blood sample (5 ml) will be taken to determine plasma concentrations of antibiotics. In addition, a stool sample will be taken at 72 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, at the end of antibiotic therapy and 60 days after this end to evaluate the change in initial flora and relative faecal abundance of ESBL-producing enterobacteria.</description>

    <description>Patients with ESBL enterobacteria, antibiotic pressure are patients with ESBL positive result diagnosed by stool culture and a rectal swab.
The intervention correspond to addition of 4 stool samples (or 4 rectal swabs in the absence of stool emission) and a blood sample.</description>
