      Study Objectives

      The objectives for this randomized trial are:

        1. To determine the efficacy of daily low-dose atropine (0.01%) for slowing myopia
           progression over a two-year treatment period in children aged 5 to less than 13 years
           (Primary Outcome On-Treatment).

        2. To determine the efficacy of atropine treatment on myopia progression 6 months following
           cessation of low-dose atropine treatment (Secondary Outcome Off-Treatment).

      Synopsis of Study Design The current study is designed as an efficacy study, making effort to
      maximize adherence to treatment group assignments. After a run-in phase during which all
      participants are treated with daily artificial tear eyedrops for 2-4 weeks (and glasses are
      updated if required) to assess their ability to adhere to daily eye drops, participants are
      randomly assigned to daily atropine or placebo for 24 months, followed by 6 months off
      treatment.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Cycloplegic autorefraction, axial length, and additional biometry will be measured by a masked examiner at all follow-up visits using the same instrumentation on the participant throughout the study. Masking will be accomplished by having site personnel administer cyclopentolate to both eyes of each participant and wait 30 minutes before he/she sees the masked examiner. The masked examiner may be a technician or an investigator and must be certified to complete these measurements. Parents, patients, and investigators are also masked to treatment.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>At 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of change from baseline to 24-months in spherical equivalent refractive error (SER), as measured by a masked examiner using cycloplegic autorefraction (on-treatment comparison).
The mean of the three readings from autorefraction in each eye will be calculated and then the mean of both eyes for each participant will be used for the analysis.
The treatment group difference (atropine - placebo) and a 95% confidence interval will be calculated based on the model estimates at 24 months.</description>
