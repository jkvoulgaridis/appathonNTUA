  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label parallel arm study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and ammonia control, of RAVICTI® as compared to NaPBA in urea
      cycle disorder subjects not currently or previously chronically treated with phenylacetic
      acid (phenylacetate; PAA) prodrugs. The study design will include: 1) Baseline Period; 2)
      Initial Treatment Period; 3) a RAVICTI only Transition Period 4) a RAVICTI only Maintenance
      Period; and 5) a RAVICTI only Safety Extension Period. The study will run for approximately
      25 weeks.

          -  Male and female subjects with a suspected or confirmed UCD diagnosis of any subtype,
             except NAGS deficiency.

          -  Suspected diagnosis is defined as having experienced a HAC or a documented high
             ammonia of &gt;=100 µmol/L

          -  Confirmed diagnosis is determined via enzymatic, biochemical, or genetic testing.

               -  Requires nitrogen-binding agents according to the judgment of the Investigator

               -  Birth and older.

               -  All females of childbearing potential and all sexually active males must agree to
                  use an acceptable method of contraception from signing the informed consent
                  throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
                  Acceptable forms of contraception are (oral, injected, implanted or transdermal),
                  tubal ligation, intrauterine device, hysterectomy, vasectomy, or double barrier
                  methods. Abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control, though appropriate
                  contraception must be used if the subject becomes sexually active.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has received chronic treatment with an oral phenylbutyrate (RAVICTI, NaPBA,
             Pheburane, or other) longer than 14 consecutive days within one year prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Temporary use of NaPBA for acute management of a hyperammonemic crisis in the past is
             acceptable.

               -  Any concomitant illness (e.g., malabsorption or clinically significant liver or
                  bowel disease) which would preclude the subject's safe participation, as judged
                  by the Investigator.

               -  Has undergone liver transplantation, including hepatocellular transplant.

               -  Subjects on NaBz at Baseline will be excluded if they are viewed by the
                  Investigator as being unable to undergo NaBz transition to a PAA prodrug during
                  the Initial Treatment Period.

               -  Known hypersensitivity to PBA or any excipients of the NaPBA/PBA formulations.

               -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients. Women of childbearing potential must have a
                  pregnancy test performed at the Baseline Visit prior to the start of study drug.
