  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate different inflammatory cells that
      accumulate on the ocular surface, during sleep, and how these cells may contribute to dry eye
      disease. This study will involve at-home self-collection of tears using an eye wash method
      with sterile saline solution. While a diagnostic technique, the eye wash may also have a
      therapeutic benefit in dry eye sufferers, which will be assessed in the second phase of this
      project.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every night during sleep, there is an influx of white blood cells on to the surface of the
      eye. These cells likely perform a protective function, but it is also possible that their
      dysregulation could lead to disease. Using a larger cohort, our investigation hopes to better
      understand the function of these cells and their potential to be linked to dry eye disease.
      Further, the way in which these cells are collected, using an at-home self-collection of
      tears using an eye wash method with sterile saline solution, immediately upon awakening,
      could potentially provide relief to dry eye sufferers if performed on a daily basis.
