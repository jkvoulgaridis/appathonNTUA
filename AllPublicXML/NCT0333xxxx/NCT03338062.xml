  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare radiation treatment plans that are designed for
      patients with liver cancer. One treatment plan will be created using routine procedures and
      scans normally performed for radiation treatment planning. The other treatment plan will be
      created using routine procedures with the addition of two imaging scans; a HIDA
      (Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid) scan and an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan. This
      study will evaluate if adding these imaging scans to treatment planning can reduce the amount
      of radiation to healthy liver tissue during treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Diagnosis of primary liver malignancy (including hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] or
             cholangiocarcinoma) or liver metastasis from any primary solid tumor site by
             characteristic imaging findings on CT or MRI, clinical presentation, and/or pathologic
             confirmation of diagnosis.

          -  Subjects with other current or prior malignancies are eligible for this study.

          -  Patients with liver metastases must have at least one of the following clinical
             factors that may affect liver function:

               1. History of liver resection (at any time)

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with non-SBRT liver directed therapies may

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study. Women of

          -  Subjects must not have received chemotherapy within 2 weeks of planned 1st day of RT.

             lesion(s) must be ≤6 cm

             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would in
