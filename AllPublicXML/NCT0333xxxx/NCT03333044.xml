  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation process of a
      multi-level, integrated intervention to decrease HbA1c among South Asians with uncontrolled
      diabetes, including four components: 1) an EHR-based registry function to increase
      identification of South Asian patients with uncontrolled diabetes; 2) CHW-led health coaching
      of registered patients to promote health behavior change; 3) HIT-enabled and CHW-facilitated
      identification and referral to culturally relevant community resources for patients; and 4)
      HIT-enabled care coordination between the CHW and other members of the healthcare team.
