  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is minimal data on the combination of rivaroxaban and ticagrelor in patients
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
      Furthermore, there exists significant controversy among physicians in the use of oral
      anticoagulants in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy in this population. The present
      recommendation is triple therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel + warfarin), which has been related
      to major bleeding complications. Previous studies have shown that ticagrelor has been proven
      to be more effective in reducing the rate of death, new heart attacks, or strokes than the
      previously recommended drug, clopidogrel, and studies have shown that less bleeding occurs
      with rivaroxaban than with warfarin. Therefore, it would be ideal to investigate the two
      potent drugs, ticagrelor and rivaroxaban, in combination in order to gain insight in the
      management of these high-risk patients.

      The CAPITAL PCI AF study is a phase 3 Health Canada regulated interventional study involving
      the use of investigational drugs. It is a non-randomized, open-design study. The
      investigational team is studying the highly potent drug Ticagrelor, which is prescribed to
      participants receiving a stent placement, given in combination with Rivaroxaban, an oral
      anticoagulant recommended for patients with AF. The primary clinical endpoint is a safety
      outcome measuring bleeding complications in participants with AF treated within one year of
      the index PCI. The primary efficacy endpoint is measured by the clinical outcomes of death,
      stroke, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and stent
      thrombosis within one year of the index PCI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has undergone a PCI with stent placement, plus

          2. Documented non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF)* within 1 year before screening, OR
             &gt;1 year before screening if patient had been receiving oral anticoagulation
             (OAC)therapy for the atrial fibrillation for 3 months immediately before the index
             PCI.

               -  AF is defined by its presence on an electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitor, or
                  any device that provides a rhythm strip documenting paroxysmal, persistent or,
                  permanent atrial fibrillation.

        Atrial flutter can be included as &quot;AF equivalent&quot;. The stroke risk in patients with atrial
        flutter is not much different from that in AF. Furthermore, many patients diagnosed with
        atrial flutter subsequently develop AF. Hence, current guidelines recommend that OAC should
        be used in patients with atrial flutter similar to that in patients with AF.

        Non-valvular AF is defined as the absence of moderate to severe mitral stenosis or the
        presence of a mechanical valve as per 2016 ESC guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 years old

          2. Any condition that contraindicates anticoagulant therapy or would confer an
             unacceptable risk of bleeding, such as, but not limited to:

             i. active internal bleeding, ii. bleeding at a non-compressible site, iii. bleeding
             diathesis within 30 days of PCI, iv. baseline platelet count &lt;90,000/Î¼L, v. history of
             intracranial hemorrhage, vi. clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within
             12 months of PCI, vii. baseline INR &gt; 1.5 in patients not prescribed VKA, suggesting
             underlying coagulation disorder.

          3. History of stroke

          4. Cardiogenic shock at the time of screening

          5. Ventricular arrhythmias refractory to treatment at the time of screening

          6. Calculated CrCl &lt;30 mL/min at the time of screening

          7. Known significant liver disease (e.g., acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis,
             cirrhosis), or liver function test (LFT) abnormalities at screening: alanine
             transaminase (ALT) &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal or ALT &gt;3 times the upper limit
             of normal plus total bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal

          8. Hemoglobin level &lt;90 g/dL at screening

          9. Any severe condition that would limit life expectancy to less than 12 months

         10. Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or serious trauma within the past 30
             days

         11. Incomplete staged PCI procedure (once completion of the staged PCI has occurred, the
             final PCI may become the index event)

         12. CABG planned

         13. Transient AF caused by a reversible disorder (e.g. thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary embolism,
             recent surgery)

         14. Any condition other than non-valvular AF requiring long-term anticoagulation with VKAs
             such as moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis, mechanical heart valves, deep vein
             thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or left ventricular thrombus

         15. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to rivaroxaban or ticagrelor

         16. Pregnant or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study, or unwilling to
             employ an investigator-approved method of birth control

         17. Participation in a study with another investigational device or drug &lt; four weeks

         18. Is receiving systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 (CYP)
             3A4 and p-glycoprotein (P-gp; eg, the azole-antimycotic ketoconazole and the
             HIV-protease inhibitor ritonavir). Treatment with fluconazole is allowed.
