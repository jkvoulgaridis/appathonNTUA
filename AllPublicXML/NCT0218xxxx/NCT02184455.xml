  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to perform a limited pilot study to determine the
      safety and feasibility of DermGEN in the treatment of non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
      This will be a one-arm prospective study. It is hypothesized that DermGEN treatment will
      result in positive healing outcomes with no significant adverse effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a one-arm prospective study. This study in Halifax will be mirrored in one other
      participating health care center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with each centre anticipated to
      enrol 5-10 patients for a total of 15-20 patients.

        inclusion criteria is satisfied:

          1. Patient with documented stable Type I or II diabetes (HbA1C &gt;7.0 within 1 month prior
             to Day 0).

          2. Patient's ulcer has been present for a minimum of 2 weeks as of Day 0.

          3. Study ulcer has healed &lt;30% in size during the 2 weeks prior to Day 0.

         11. Patient has participated in another study using investigational drug(s) or device
             within the previous 30 days

             osteomyelitis may be included, providing there exists a suitable base for application

        <title>Percentage of Wound Area Reduction Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Digital photography was utilized to capture the appearance and size of the ulcer at each visit. In the photograph a measurement scale was shown beside the wound. The area of the wound was calculated by manually outlining wound edges on a digital image and then using the open source program ImageJ to calculate the area of the wound. For calculating the percentage change in area of the wound, the wound areas at each time point were divided by the size of the wound at baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>
