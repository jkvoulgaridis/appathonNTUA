      To investigate the efficacy and safety of hirudin plus aspirin therapy compared with warfarin
      in the secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the patients with cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation,guidelines recommended
      warfarin as the secondary prevention therapy. But warfarin has its disadvantages such as risk
      of bleeding and the requirement of frequent INR monitoring. The underuse of warfarin is a
      prominent problem in China. In our study, patients with cardioembolic stroke were treated
      with hirudin plus aspirin or warfarin. The aim of our study was to compare efficacy and
      safety of hirudin plus aspirin and warfarin in secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke
      due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
