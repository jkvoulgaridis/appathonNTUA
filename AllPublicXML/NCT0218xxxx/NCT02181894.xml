  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placing artificial airways in infants is often performed under emergent life-saving
      conditions, which necessitates a procedure that is both accurate and efficient. Intubations
      of the newborn are often necessary before an accurate weight can be reported and estimations
      are often inaccurate. The current national standard uses body weight to predict the
      appropriate tube depth yet this approach tends to place the tube too deep for the smallest
      and most vulnerable neonate; and placement accuracy of any size infant is only 50-70%. The
      consequence of malpositioned ETTs resulting from poor oxygenation, lung hyperinflation,
      pneumothoraces and death has been suggested to cost $20 to $54 million annually.

      The morbidity and the financial impact suggest an optimal and accurate approach to place ETT
      in neonates has not been identified. Other methods to estimate the proper depth of the
      orotracheal tube have shown promise yet no comparison studies have been performed.
      Identifying the most accurate method to safely place neonatal orotracheal tubes will improve
      placement precision and reduce adverse events and their associated costs.

      Hypothesis

      Compared to weight, sternal to xyphoid length and shoulder to elbow length, the nasal to
      tragus length will become the most accurate method for predicting the safe depth of orally
      placed neonatal endotracheal tubes.

    <description>Subjects will be &lt;72 hours of age and orally intubated. Following consent, four measures will be reported (i.e. body weight, nasal to tragus length, suprasternal notch to xyphoid process and shoulder to elbow length). Measures will be compared against a chest x-ray and placement of ETT at the subjects lip to identify the most accurate method to place endotracheal tubes in the newborn.</description>
