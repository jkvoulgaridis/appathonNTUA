    <time_frame>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the association of CYP2C19 genotype and its association with CYP2C19 phenotypes. To characterize the ability of the CYP2C19 genotype to predict pantoprazole plasma clearance, a correlation with CYP2C19 phenotype was explored using both standard linear and nonlinear regression techniques and their respective tests for significance and goodness of fit. In addition, the impact of all covariates on pantoprazole systemic exposure and apparent plasma clearance (e.g., demographic determinants of extent of obesity such as the waist:hip ratio, CYP2C19 genotype, BMI, and REE) was explored using validated population-based PK methods (NONMEM).</description>

          <description>The study design included a screening visit (0-31days prior to baseline), during which informed consent was obtained and blood was collected for isolation of DNA for genotyping.
During the Baseline Visit (Day 1) included REE measurement (before drug administration using a MedGem indirect calorimeter), study drug administration, and PK evaluation. The MedGem measures oxygen consumption (VO2) to determine resting metabolic rate. Study drug was then administered orally, and repeated blood samples of 1.0 ml each were collected at pre-dose (within 30 minutes), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours (±10 minutes) after dosing. For those participants with the PM CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample was to be obtained at 12 hours after dosing. Between Day 10 and Day 13 after the Baseline Visit, investigators conducted a follow-up call to assess participants’ general wellness and to collect Adverse Event (AE) information.</description>

            <description>The study design included a screening visit (0-31days prior to baseline), during which informed consent was obtained and blood was collected for isolation of DNA for genotyping.
During the Baseline Visit (Day 1) included REE measurement (before drug administration using a MedGem indirect calorimeter), study drug administration, and PK evaluation. The MedGem measures oxygen consumption (VO2) to determine resting metabolic rate. Study drug was then administered orally, and repeated blood samples of 1.0 ml each were collected at pre-dose (within 30 minutes), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours (±10 minutes) after dosing. For those participants with the PM CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample was to be obtained at 12 hours after dosing. Between Day 10 and Day 13 after the Baseline Visit, investigators conducted a follow-up call to assess participants’ general wellness and to collect Adverse Event (AE) information.</description>

            <description>The study design included a screening visit (0-31days prior to baseline), during which informed consent was obtained and blood was collected for isolation of DNA for genotyping.
During the Baseline Visit (Day 1) included REE measurement (before drug administration using a MedGem indirect calorimeter), study drug administration, and PK evaluation. The MedGem measures oxygen consumption (VO2) to determine resting metabolic rate. Study drug was then administered orally, and repeated blood samples of 1.0 ml each were collected at pre-dose (within 30 minutes), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours (±10 minutes) after dosing. For those participants with the PM CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample was to be obtained at 12 hours after dosing. Between Day 10 and Day 13 after the Baseline Visit, investigators conducted a follow-up call to assess participants’ general wellness and to collect Adverse Event (AE) information.</description>

        <description>The pharmacokinetic blood samples will be 1.0 ml each and collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, &amp; 8 hours after receiving one dose of Pantoprazole study drug. For those subjects with the poor metabolizer CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample will be obtained at 12 hours after dosing. Here we report CL/F TBW.</description>

During the Baseline Visit (Day 1) included REE measurement (before drug administration using a MedGem indirect calorimeter), study drug administration, and PK evaluation. The MedGem measures oxygen consumption (VO2) to determine resting metabolic rate. Study drug was then administered orally, and repeated blood samples of 1.0 ml each were collected at pre-dose (within 30 minutes), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours (±10 minutes) after dosing. For those participants with the PM CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample was to be obtained at 12 hours after dosing.

        <description>To examine the association of CYP2C19 genotype and its association with CYP2C19 phenotypes. To characterize the ability of the CYP2C19 genotype to predict pantoprazole plasma clearance, a correlation with CYP2C19 phenotype was explored using both standard linear and nonlinear regression techniques and their respective tests for significance and goodness of fit. In addition, the impact of all covariates on pantoprazole systemic exposure and apparent plasma clearance (e.g., demographic determinants of extent of obesity such as the waist:hip ratio, CYP2C19 genotype, BMI, and REE) was explored using validated population-based PK methods (NONMEM).</description>
