    <textblock>
      This proof of concept study proposes targeted delivery of a broad-spectrum cytotoxic agent
      (doxorubicin), via a specially formulated LTSL (ThermoDox®) activated by mild hyperthermia,
      by using focused ultrasound (FUS), to achieve enhanced intra-tumoural doxorubicin
      concentrations for the same systemic dose.

      Adult patients with incurable confirmed hepatic primary or secondary tumours received a
      single cycle of LTLD, followed by ultrasound-mediated hyperthermia to a single target liver
      tumour. The primary endpoint relates to evidencing enhanced delivery of doxorubicin from LTLD
      at the target tumour site, by comparing intratumoural concentrations of the drug before and
      after focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, purely pharmacological approaches have failed to address what is essentially a
      threefold challenge: (i) to deliver therapeutically significant concentrations of active
      agents to the tumour vasculature while minimizing off target effects; (ii) to release the
      therapeutic agent 'on-demand' at the target site; and, (iii) to improve the distribution and
      spread of the therapeutic agent against the intra-tumoural pressure gradient in order to
      achieve a therapeutically relevant concentration throughout the tumour.

      Recent pre-clinical studies performed at Oxford using ThermoDox® released using FUS has shown
      that increased uptake at the target site is achievable. Hence there is great promise in using
      this combination therapy to achieve increased tumour uptake and local dose for the equivalent
      dose of doxorubicin used in systemic chemotherapy for human subjects, which has a well
      established and safe toxicity profile. The first extracorporeal FUS device in Europe was used
      for a study performed at Oxford between 2002 and 2004.

      This single centre trial was sponsored by the University of Oxford. The recruiting study site
      was Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, where there is extensive clinical FUS experience.

      The study is split into two parts. Part I identified optimal FUS exposure parameters for a
      range of patient BMIs and tumour locations within the liver using real time thermometry data
      from an implanted thermistor. After at least 5 and no more than 14 participants have had the
      intervention using real-time thermometry, data was reviewed by the Trial Management Group
      (TMG) to confirm readiness to proceed without real-time thermometry. Part II, which did not
      require thermistor implantation, is designed to reflect how the therapy would be implemented
      in clinical practice.

      Participants received treatment for 1 day and are followed up for 30 days. All evaluable
      participants from both Part I and Part II were included in the endpoint analysis. Doxorubicin
      concentrations were directly determined from tissue biopsies of the target tumour, using a
      Good Laboratory Practice-validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay, based
      on previously published methods.

      If this study demonstrates successful targeted drug delivery in human subjects using LTSLs
      released by mild-hyperthermia, this could potentially transform the future of chemotherapy in
      clinical practice; targeted therapy using LTSLs containing other chemotherapeutic agents
      triggered non-invasively by mild hyperthermia could be applied to any solid organ cancer.

    <description>Analytical chemistry (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) for total doxorubicin (including both released and unreleased forms) was performed on section of intratumoral biopsy samples in Good Clinical Practice Laboratory, using a validated assay.
Doxorubicin concentration was evaluated in biopsy samples both post-LTLD and post-LTLD+FUS.
Tumour samples were not analysed same day and were frozen at -80^oC for subsequent analysis. Required to evaluate the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>To satisfy the primary endpoint, a demonstrable two-fold increase in*, or value exceeding 10μg/g of, the concentration of intra-tumoural doxorubicin at the treated tumour site following FUS-induced mild hyperthermia, was required in at least 50% of evaluable participants.
* As per the a priori protocol design, in Part II the biopsy prior to FUS-induced mild hyperthermia is not performed and therefore the average value for all evaluable tumours receiving intervention in Part I is used as a comparison for the two-fold increase from pre-FUS to post-FUS biopsy.</description>

For success, sustained and controlled hyperthermia is required in the target tumour, consequent with drug release (in excess of 39.5^oC).

    <measure>Persistence of Cell Viability Stain Post-LTLD+FUS</measure>
    <time_frame>Tissue obtained on day of intervention (Day 1). All CK8 cell viability staining was performed within 2 months of sampling.</time_frame>
    <description>Post-LTLD+FUS tissue from the targeted liver tumours was obtained by biopsy at the time of the intervention, between 24/03/2015 and 29/03/2017. Cytokeratin-8 (CK-8) is a cell viability marker which if present, demonstrates lack of ablative cell death by any ablative modality, including FUS.
Not all histological cell types express CK8, thus if the Post-LTLD+FUS it may either indicate:
i) Non-CK8 expression ii) Thermal ablation and consequent cell death.
Note there was uncertainty about CK8 expression of individual patient tumours prior to recruitment. In this study if the Post-LTLD+FUS tissue shows specific cellular CK8 cellular staining, then it demonstrates that i) the tumour is CK8+, and, ii) the tumour was not instantaneously thermally ablated and any subsequent cell death is likely due to drug delivery/chemo-ablation.

Part I of the study was designed to identify optimal focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure parameters for a range of tumour locations within the liver, using real-time thermometry data from an implanted thermometry device (a thermistor or thermocouple). Plasma and biopsy samples of the target liver tumour were taken pre-LTLD, post-LTLD and post-LTLD+FUS.</description>

ThermoDox® (LTLD) Focused Ultrasound of Target Liver Tumour Post-LTLD Biopsy of Target Liver Tumour
Following a minimum of 5 Part I cases, and subject to Trial Management Group approval, Part II of the study was opened to run in parallel to Part I. Part II did not require implantation of a thermometry device, and instead used predictions from Part I data to set the FUS parameters. Targeted drug delivery in Part II thus proceeded completely non-invasively, and this part of the study was designed to more closely reflect how the therapy might be implemented in routine clinical practice. Plasma samples were taken pre-LTLD, post-LTLD and post-LTLD+FUS. Biopsy samples of the target liver tumour were taken only post-LTLD+FUS.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>10 patients were recruited (6 to Part I of the study and 4 to Part II of the study).
Patients required at least one liver tumour accessible to ultrasound. Full screening criteria are available from ClinicalTrials.gov or the published protocol summary, both detailed in the References section.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Part I (Patients Enrolled Between March 2015-April 2017)</title>
          <description>Part I of the study was designed to identify optimal focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure parameters for a range of tumour locations within the liver, using real-time thermometry data from an implanted thermometry device (a thermistor or thermocouple). Patients in Part I receive a single cycle of Lyso- Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox®) intravenously, at a dose of of 50 mg/m2. After a minimum of five patients have received the Part I intervention with real-time thermometry, data was reviewed by the Trial Management Group (TMG) to confirm readiness to proceed without real-time thermometry in Part II of the study. Plasma and biopsy samples of the target liver tumour were taken pre-LTLD, post-LTLD and post- LTLD+FUS.
Parts I and II of the study were not randomised, and both Parts of the study are detailed further in the published protocol summary (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40349-017-0104-0).</description>

          <title>Part II (Patients Enrolled Between June 2016-Feb 2017)</title>
          <description>Following a minimum of 5 Part I cases, and subject to Trial Management Group approval, Part II of the study was opened to run in parallel to Part I. Part II did not require implantation of a thermometry device, and instead used predictions from Part I data to set the FUS parameters. Targeted drug delivery in Part II thus proceeded completely non-invasively, and this part of the study was designed to more closely reflect how the therapy might be implemented in routine clinical practice.
Plasma samples were taken pre-LTLD, post-LTLD and post-LTLD+FUS. Biopsy samples of the target liver tumour were taken only post-LTLD+FUS.

        <title>(Part I Only) Achievement of Satisfactory Hyperthermia Within the Target Liver Tumour for a Range of Participant Body Mass Indices (BMIs) and Tumour Locations Within the Liver (Optimal FUS Exposure Parameters)</title>
        <description>Achievement of hyperthermia in the target liver tumour, as determined by real-time thermometry obtained by an indwelling thermometry device.
For success, sustained and controlled hyperthermia is required in the target tumour, consequent with drug release (in excess of 39.5^oC).

            <title>Part I (July 2014-July 2017)</title>
            <description>Part I of the study was designed to identify optimal focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure parameters for a range of tumour locations within the liver, using real-time thermometry data from an implanted thermometry device (a thermistor or thermocouple). Patients in Part I receive a single cycle of Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox®) intravenously, at a dose of of 50 mg/m2. After a minimum of five patients have received the Part I intervention with real-time thermometry, data was reviewed by the Trial Management Group (TMG) to confirm readiness to proceed without real-time thermometry in Part II of the study. Plasma and biopsy samples of the target liver tumour were taken pre-LTLD, post-LTLD and post-LTLD+FUS.
Parts I and II of the study were not randomised, and both Parts of the study are detailed further in the published protocol summary (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40349-017-0104-0).</description>

            <title>Part II (May 2016-July 2017)</title>
            <description>Following a minimum of 5 Part I cases, and subject to Trial Management Group approval, Part II of the study was opened to run in parallel to Part I. Part II did not require implantation of a thermometry device, and instead used predictions from Part I data to set the FUS parameters. Targeted drug delivery in Part II thus proceeded completely non-invasively, and this part of the study was designed to more closely reflect how the therapy might be implemented in routine clinical practice.
Plasma samples were taken pre-LTLD, post-LTLD and post-LTLD+FUS. Biopsy samples of the target liver tumour were taken only post-LTLD+FUS. Parts I and II of the study are not randomised, and both Parts of the study are detailed further in the published protocol summary (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40349-017-0104-0).</description>

        <title>Persistence of Cell Viability Stain Post-LTLD+FUS</title>
        <description>Post-LTLD+FUS tissue from the targeted liver tumours was obtained by biopsy at the time of the intervention, between 24/03/2015 and 29/03/2017. Cytokeratin-8 (CK-8) is a cell viability marker which if present, demonstrates lack of ablative cell death by any ablative modality, including FUS.
Not all histological cell types express CK8, thus if the Post-LTLD+FUS it may either indicate:
i) Non-CK8 expression ii) Thermal ablation and consequent cell death.
Note there was uncertainty about CK8 expression of individual patient tumours prior to recruitment. In this study if the Post-LTLD+FUS tissue shows specific cellular CK8 cellular staining, then it demonstrates that i) the tumour is CK8+, and, ii) the tumour was not instantaneously thermally ablated and any subsequent cell death is likely due to drug delivery/chemo-ablation.
For more information see key TARDOX Lancet Oncology publication and Cytokeratin 8 reference (both detailed in References section).</description>

        <population>5/6 Part I patients and 4/4 Part II patients had tissue which was analysable for CK-8. The Outcome Measure Data Table demonstrates the number of patients from each arm having CK-8 positive tumour biopsy samples post-LTLD+FUS, indicating lack of thermal ablation (which is consistent with desired hyperthermia rather than undesirable FUS ablation).</population>
