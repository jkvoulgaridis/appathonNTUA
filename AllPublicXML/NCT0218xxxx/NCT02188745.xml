  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive breast cancer, high-dose estrogen therapies were used. This seems
      counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function, while estrogens increase ER
      function, but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of
      metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that
      develop resistance to anti-estrogens, likely because such cancers have adapted to grow
      without ER function, and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer
      cells. In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens,
      treatment with the estrogen 17B-estradiol induces tumor response. Furthermore, when
      17B-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17B-estradiol, switching back
      to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective. These observations suggest that cancers can
      alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17B-estradiol-sensitive states. The
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17B-estradiol / anti-estrogen
      therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth
      than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic
      anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer is rarely cured by current therapies. ER+ breast cancers ultimately
      become resistant to all available anti-estrogens. Response rates to estrogens are similar to
      those of anti-estrogens in the metastatic setting. Given that ER+ breast cancers are often
      responsive to anti-estrogens and estrogens, alternating anti-estrogen/estrogen therapies may
      be more effective than continuous treatment with either type of agent. Anecdotal evidence
      indicates that such a strategy of alternating therapies is effective in some patients.
      Preclinical evidence suggests that anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancers are sensitized
      to the anti-tumor effects of estrogens. Such cells harbor subpopulations that can ultimately
      regain the ability to grow in the presence of estrogens, and revert to their
      anti-estrogen-sensitive state. The investigators will formally test whether alternating
      17B-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies is effective for the management of
      anti-estrogen-resistant metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, and to identify molecular
      biomarkers that predict tumor response to 1) 17B-estradiol and 2) alternating
      17B-estradiol/anti-estrogen therapies. If successful, this study would present a novel
      strategy to manage metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer by pre-emptively switching therapies
      prior to disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women ≥18 years of age with clinical stage IV ER+/HER2- breast cancer, or with locally
             recurrent ER+/HER2- disease not amenable to therapy for curative intent.

          2. Patient must have been treated with an anti-estrogen at any time in their disease
             history. Combination regimens that include an anti-estrogen and any biologic, or
             targeted therapy, are permitted (e.g., any CDK inhibitor, everolimus, or any other
             novel biologics), and are considered to be a single hormonal therapy based regimen.

               -  Any number of prior lines of anti-estrogen (i.e., hormonal) therapy is
                  permissible.

               -  One line of prior chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease is permissible.

          3. Histologic documentation of ER strongly+/HER2- breast cancer by core needle biopsy,
             fine needle aspiration, incisional biopsy, or surgical biopsy of ≥1 site(s) of
             metastatic or locally advanced disease performed as standard of care within the past 4
             months for assessment of eligibility for study participation (except as noted below in
             c/d/e).

               1. ER strongly+ status defined as ER staining by immunohistochemistry in ≥50% of
                  malignant cell nuclei with an intensity ≥2+ on a scale of 0-3+. These criteria
                  are equivalent to an Allred score ≥6.

               2. HER2-negative status is defined as immunohistochemistry score of 0-1+, or with a
                  FISH ratio of &lt;2 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been done (as per ASCO/CAP
                  definitions). In cases of borderline or equivocal HER2 status, eligibility will
                  be determined by the PI.

               3. Archived tumor specimens: Excess tumor tissue must be available for research
                  purposes. This will include tumor tissue sufficient to make ≥10 five-micron
                  sections; more tumor tissue is preferred.

                  Freshly acquired tumor specimens: As part of a clinically indicated biopsy
                  procedure, an additional 1-3 cores or tissue fragments will be obtained by core
                  needle or surgical biopsy for research purposes and FFPE.

               4. Patients with bone-only metastatic disease with a history of ER+/HER2- breast
                  cancer are eligible, and bone biopsy is not required, providing their primary
                  cancer is consistent with the above-described ER and HER2 criteria.

               5. Patients with non-bone metastatic disease in whom a safe and accurate biopsy of
                  recurrent/metastatic disease cannot be readily obtained are also eligible,
                  providing their primary cancer is consistent with the above-described ER and HER2
                  criteria.

          4. Patient must be a candidate for treatment with 17B-estradiol and an aromatase
             inhibitor.

          5. If the most recent therapy was in the adjuvant setting, the recurrence-free interval
             (time from initiation of adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy to clinical evidence of
             disease recurrence) must have been ≥2 years.

             If the most recent therapy was in the advanced/metastatic setting, the
             progression-free interval must have been ≥3 months (except in the case of
             investigational hormonal therapies).

          6. Patient must be post-menopausal based on either a history of an oophorectomy, or ≥1
             year of amenorrhea. An elevated serum gonadotropin level and estradiol level in the
             postmenopausal range (as locally defined) can be used to confirm menopausal status in
             a subject with &lt;1 year of amenorrhea.

             participation.

          9. The following laboratory values must be confirmed for eligibility within 28 days prior
             to initiation of study therapy:

          2. Any other concurrent systemic anti-cancer treatments, including conventional
             chemotherapeutic agents and biological agents, during the study period.

             Anti-resorptive bone therapies (e.g., bisphosphonates, denosumab) are permitted.

          3. Any investigational cancer therapy in the last 3 weeks.

          4. Known CNS disease, unless clinically stable for ≥ 3 months.
