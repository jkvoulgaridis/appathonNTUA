  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to determine the feasibility and safety of stem cell
      collection and gamma-globin gene transfer, and success of gene correction in subjects with
      sickle cell disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of gene transfer using ARU-1801
      (CD34+ cells transduced with the gamma-globin lentiviral vector). Gene transfer will occur
      ex-vivo into CD34+ enriched human bone marrow or plerixafor-mobilized peripheral blood
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) collected from subjects with severe sickle cell disease (SCD).
      Subjects will undergo reduced intensity chemotherapy conditioning with single-dose melphalan
      to facilitate engraftment of ex-vivo ARU-1801 via IV infusion. Subjects will return to the
      study site at regular intervals for follow-up for 2 years after the ARU-1801 infusion. It is
      anticipated that a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) clinical study will be initiated, in
      which all subjects completing the 2 year study visit will be asked to consent and enroll, and
      will followed for a further 13 years.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Signed informed consent form.

          -  Has confirmed diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD)

          -  Has severe sickle cell disease, defined as one or more of the following:

               1. Minimum of two episodes of clinically diagnosed acute chest syndrome (ACS)
                  requiring hospital admission, or one life threatening episode of ACS requiring
                  intensive care unit (ICU) admission for exchange transfusion and/or intubation,
                  or frequent ACS episodes which necessitate treatment with chronic transfusion
                  therapy.

               2. Frequent painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) which significantly interfere
                  with normal life activities, defined as a history of 2 or more severe acute
                  sickle pain events per year requiring additional treatment at a medical facility
                  outside of home pain management over the preceding 2-year period prior to study
                  enrollment, or that necessitate chronic transfusion therapy.

               3. Subjects on chronic transfusion therapy for severe disease symptoms other than
                  those listed above, and which interfere with normal life activities.

          -  Has failed hydroxyurea therapy, was unable to tolerate hydroxyurea therapy, or has

             severe disease (Note: must be off hydroxyurea therapy for 2 months prior to stem cell
             collection). If refusing hydroxyurea, the subject must document that they have been
             educated about the benefits and continue to refuse the treatment. Patients placed on
             chronic transfusion therapy instead of hydroxyurea for severe disease are eligible.
             Subjects unable to take hydroxyurea due to financial or safety monitoring constraints
             are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating/breastfeeding.

          -  Female subjects who are not surgically sterile, postmenopausal or who refuse to
             practice effective method of birth control as determined by the Investigator for one
             year after receiving the study drug. Women must also agree not to breastfeed for 1
             year after receiving the study drug.

          -  Any participant of reproductive potential who refuses to agree to use an appropriate
             contraceptive method determined by the Investigator, for 1 year after receiving the
             study drug.

          -  Patients with an active malignant disease or receiving treatment for any type of
             cancer (except squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of
             the skin).

          -  Current diagnosis or history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV.

          -  Has received another study drug within 30 days, or 5 half-lives of the last dose
             (whichever is longer), prior to screening.

          -  Has severe obstruction, restriction or diffusion defect on pulmonary function tests.

          -  Has uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections within 1 month prior to
             starting the conditioning part of the study. Subjects with fever should wait for
             symptoms to resolve before starting the conditioning part of the study.

          -  Has a history of stroke or is at moderate to high risk of primary stroke (eg receiving
             chronic transfusions or hydroxyurea for primary prevention of stroke; has severe
             cerebral vasculopathy defined as moderate stenosis in &gt;2 arterial segments; and/or has
             sever stenosis/occlusion in ≤2 segments in the polygon of Willis or presence of
             Moyamoya-like disease).

          -  Patients with alpha thalassemia sickle cell disease.

          -  Has previous liver biopsy showing cirrhosis, bridging hepatic fibrosis, or active
             hepatitis; or has received chronic transfusions and has previous evidence of iron
             overload and evidence of liver fibrosis by noninvasive liver imaging.

          -  Has a matched sibling donor, unless the subject has declined this option or this
             option is not feasible. Documentation must be included as part of the informed consent
             process for subjects who decline this option.

          -  Has a known hypersensitivity to any study treatments (e.g. melphalan, plerixafor).

        Other protocol-defined inclusion-exclusion criteria may apply.
