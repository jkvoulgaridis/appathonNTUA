      The primary aims of this study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) for the treatment of either refractory (240) or newly
      diagnosed (739) Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) in patients after lung
      transplantation.In compliance with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS)
      Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) decision, the study will collect specified
      demographic, comorbidity, treatment, and outcome data exclusively for Medicare beneficiaries
      who are treated with Extracorporeal Photopheresis for either refractory or New Bronchiolitis
      Obliterans Syndrome .

    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation has become the treatment of choice for selected patients with end-stage
      lung disease. Long-term survival after transplantation remains disappointing. Chronic
      rejection bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome has emerged as the leading obstacle to better
      long-term outcomes, and is the leading cause of death beyond the first year after
      transplantation. This disorder is a fibroproliferative scarring process that involves the
      narrowing of the airway lumen and ultimately complete luminal obliteration. Physiologically
      and clinically, this luminal narrowing results in airflow limitation and breathlessness.
      Histologic confirmation of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome is difficult with bronchoscopy
      obtained lung biopsies because of the patchy distribution of the disorder and inadequate
      sampling of small airways with transbronchial lung biopsies. As a result Bronchiolitis
      Obliterans Syndrome is diagnosed and staged by the decline in Forced Expiratory Volume
      measurement from a pulmonary function test.

      In general, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is treated by intensifying the
      immunosuppressive regimen. The specific approach is variable from center to center, but
      typically includes optimizing the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen to include tacrolimus
      and mycophenolate mofetil, high-dose steroids, and a course of anti-thymocyte globulin.
      Despite treatment, most patients continue to show progressive decline in lung function
      resulting in worsening functional status, quality of life, and ultimately graft failure and
      death.

      Extracorporeal photopheresis has been used at some centers as a salvage treatment for
      progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Extracorporeal photopheresis involves
      separating the patient's blood into a leukocyte-enriched component (buffy coat) and a
      leukocyte-depleted component. The buffy coat is then photosensitized with 8-methoxypsoralen
      and treated with ultraviolet light within a photosensitization chamber, resulting in
      leukocyte apoptosis. Although the exact mechanism of action of extracorporeal photopheresisis
      unclear, re-infusion of this apoptotic leukocyte population into the patient's circulation is
      thought to result in alterations in antigen presenting cells, cytokine profiles, and the
      expansion of regulatory T cells.

      On May 2, 2012, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued a Decision Memo stating that
      Extracorporeal photopheresis is covered for Medicare beneficiaries for the treatment of
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome following lung allograft transplantation only when the
      procedure is provided under a clinical research study.

      This study looks at (1) Early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans or refractory
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome using a standardized, more frequent spirometry monitoring
      approach (i.e., defined as using either more frequent laboratory based spirometry every 4-8
      weeks) and (2) Early implementation of Extracorporeal photopheresis in both participants with
      early stage refractory bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and also as first line therapy in a
      subset of participants at the initial diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, in the
      context of a new randomized controlled trial.

      The study will look at whether certain coexisting disease states or patient-related
      demographic, functional, treatment-related or diagnostic variables (e.g. extent or
      statistical significance of the rate of pre-Extracorporeal Photopheresis - Forced Expiratory
      Volume decline) might prove to have predictive value in identifying subsets of bronchiolitis
      obliterans syndrome patients that are likely, or unlikely, to experience reduced rate of
      decline or stabilization in Forced Expiratory Volume following extracorporeal photopheresis
      treatment. Therefore this study will look to enroll a large series of patients from multiple
      United States centers to confirm that Extracorporeal Photopheresis significantly reduces the
      rate of Forced Expiratory Volume decline in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome patients
      refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug therapy, and to capture and assess specified
      patient demographic, treatment-related, diagnostic, functional and co-morbidity-related
      variables that may predict outcomes after Extracorporeal Photopheresis therapy.

      This study includes a randomized controlled trial that will compare outcomes in patients with
      an initial diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or New bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome who receive either conventional (i.e., that involves the standard of care at the
      respective enrolling center) or Extracorporeal Photopheresis for first line management of New
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The randomized controlled trial component of the study
      will enable evaluation of potential survival and quality of life benefits of early treatment
      of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome with first-line Extracorporeal Photopheresis .

      Subjects with Refractory bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome who agree to participate in the
      study will be informed of the following: to limit the use (and attendant risks) of
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis therapy to those patients who are most likely to benefit, their
      eligibility to receive Extracorporeal Photophereis within the study will be determined by the
      study team's analysis of their pre-enrollment pulmonary function testing along with input
      from their physician.

      Subjects with Newly-Diagnosed Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome who agree to participate in
      the study will be informed that they will be randomly assigned to either a control group
      (Control) who will receive the local Standard of Care for management of their Bronchiolitis
      Obliterans Syndrome or to an Early Photopheresis Intervention group who will receive
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis as first line management of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome.

      The protocol states specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for both the Refractory
      Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome participant and the newly diagnosed Bronchiolitis
      Obliterans syndrome participant. Once eligibility is confirmed and the patient has provided
      informed consent, all Forced Expiratory Volume measurements captured within the 12 months
      prior to enrollment will be entered in the electronic database. Based on the slope of the
      Forced Expiratory Volume and achievement of a statistically significant rate of decline in
      lung function in the Forced Expiratory Volume the Refractory Bronchiolitis Obliterans
      syndrome participant will be electronically assigned to either Extracorporeal Photopheresis
      treatment or Observation. The newly diagnosed Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome participant
      will be randomized to either Extracorporeal Photopheresis treatment and standard
      immunosuppression therapy or Control which is Standard immunosuppression Therapy.

      The participant will be assigned a unique identification number created from the electronic
      data base. The patient demographics, co-morbidities, medical history including date of lung
      transplantation, underlying disease necessitating lung transplantation, vital signs, height,
      weight, and current immunosuppression regimen will be entered at baseline. A Quality of Life
      Questionnaire will be asked at baseline and every 3 months the first year and then annually.
      A pulmonary function test will be captured every 30 days on all patients except the
      Refractory Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome participant assigned to Observation. Pulmonary
      function tests will be ordered on the Observation patient at the physician's discretion.
      Certain de-identified source documents will be required and verified on all forms
      electronically submitted. Data points will be verified against de-identified source by the
      Data Coordinating Center. The online data entry portal and study database will contain a
      mechanism to a) clearly denote the status of each submitted Case Report Form, including
      whether the case report form is complete; b) list the source documentation needed c) indicate
      if the site staff member and investigator have attested to the validity of the data on the
      Case Report Form; and d) indicate if the Data Coordinating Center has verified the accuracy
      of key elements of the study data and what data queries remain. This centralized monitoring
      will complement our on-site monitoring visits. For most sites an initial on site monitoring
      visit will be soon after the first three patients are enrolled to ensure that the site
      personnel understand study processes and expectations, and to permit early completion of
      additional training to address any deficiencies. Should remote or on-site monitoring reveal
      areas of particular deficiency or concern, the monitoring plan will be adjusted to focus on
      those particular areas for the site. In general, sites and patients affiliated with a major
      violation will be monitored with greater completeness. Sites deemed to be largely compliant
      with the protocol and regulatory requirements based upon the initial monitoring visit are
      expected to have subsequent visits performed at a reduced level of frequency. Overall, the
      study team will seek to optimize resource use by focusing on the most critical data elements
      that may impact subject safety and/or data quality and integrity.

      Participants who receive Extracorporeal Photopheresis treatment will receive 24
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis treatments over the 6-month period following enrollment.

      Allowed Treatment for Refractory Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome patients in the
      Observation will be ordered at the physicians discretion.

      Treatment for the Newly Diagnosed Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome patients in the Control
      Arm of the randomized control trial will be dictated by the standard of care within each
      enrolling institution and will involve changes in immunosuppressive agents. These patients
      will not be eligible to receive Extracorporeal Photopheresis treatment.

      Other than Extracorporeal Photopheresis, no other interventions for Bronchiolitis Obliterans
      syndrome will be used except for Azithromycin for patients in the randomized Early
      Photopheresis Intervention.

      An improvement in the Forced Expiratory Volume measurement taken from the pulmonary function
      test will be used to assess the success or the benefit of the Extracorporeal Photopheresis
      treatment. Patient's will have spirometry the first week of therapy, and repeated every 30
      days for the first year, and then annually. All patients will be followed for 5 years.There
      are considerations for crossover built into the protocol.

      Statistical Methods.A clinical response will be determined using Forced Expiratory Volume as
      primary endpoint and will be defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the rate of decline of
      Forced Expiratory Volume assessed by comparing the average rate of Forced Expiratory Volume
      decline over the 6 months prior to Extracorporeal Photopheresis against the average rate of
      Forced Expiratory Volume decline over the 12 months following initiation of Extracorporeal
      Photophereis.

      Survival Primary Outcome: Mortality three years after diagnosis of Bronchiolitis Obliterans
      syndrome using standard of care management of Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome is 52%.
      Assuming 15% exclusion related to early crossover and a 5% loss to follow-up of enrolled
      patients, 739 patients who meet the standardized criteria for Bronchiolitis Obliterans
      syndrome would need to be enrolled and randomly assigned to either the Early Photopheresis
      Intervention or control cohorts to detect a difference. The outcomes between the two
      Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome disease severity strata will be assessed separately. The
      patient will be followed for up to five years or until their date of death and the following
      data will be collected annually after the first year: Spirometry results, the number of
      maintenance Extracorporeal Photopheresis treatments performed and Quality Of Life surveys
      will be tabulated.

             liver-lung recipients, are eligible).

          4. Patients with a diagnosis of BOS using at least two laboratory based FEV1 values
             obtained at least three weeks apart that are both at least 20% lower than baseline
             FEV1 using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT)
             definition (The average of the two highest FEV1 measurements obtained at least 3 weeks
             apart after transplantation).

          5. Refractory BOS defined as ongoing decline in FEV1 despite at least one of the
             following treatments: azithromycin, high-dose steroid, anti-thymocyte globulin, total
             lymphoid irradiation, sirolimus, or everolimus.

          6. At minimum five recorded FEV1 measurements obtained at intervals of at least two weeks
             apart, over the 6 months preceding study enrollment, of which one FEV1 must be within
             two weeks prior to enrollment.

          7. History of frequent spirometry monitoring defined as having had regular FEV1
             measurements during the preceding four months prior to enrollment with no time
             interval between FEV1 measurements that exceeds 8 weeks.

          8. A documented clinical assessment including a physical assessment and Complete Blood
             Count (CBC) with White Blood Cell Count (WBC) within two weeks prior to enrollment.

        INCLUSION criteria for NEWLY Diagnosed BOS

          1. Age (18 years old or older)

          2. Medicare-eligible status (i.e., patients with both Part A and Part B)

          3. Lung transplant recipient (combined organ transplant recipients, e.g. heart-lung or
             liver-lung recipients, are eligible).

          4. History of close FEV1 monitoring prior to diagnosis of new BOS defined as having had
             either of the two monitoring approaches:

             Frequent laboratory based spirometry defined as having had regular FEV1 measurements
             during the preceding six months prior to diagnosis of new BOS with no time interval
             between FEV1 measurements that exceeds 8 weeks.

             Frequent Home Spirometry through a Standardized Home Spirometry Method: this Method is
             currently IRB approved and will be utilized to meet this close monitoring enrollment
             criteria.

          5. Diagnosis of new BOS (i.e., &quot;new BOS&quot; is defined as within six weeks of enrollment)
             based on laboratory-based spirometric FEV1 measurements obtained on at least two
             separate occasions (i.e., at least 3 weeks apart) that have declined by more than 20%
             from post-transplant baseline values (i.e., using ISHLT definition). Inherent to the
             diagnosis of new BOS is the exclusion of other potential causes of allograft
             dysfunction such as acute rejection, respiratory tract infection, and airway
             anastomotic complications. Thus, sites are encouraged to conduct appropriate
             evaluation for declining allograft function including bronchoscopy with
             bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung biopsies if clinically appropriate to exclude
             other potential causes of allograft dysfunction.

          6. Achievement of a statistically significant rate of decline in lung function (FEV1) at
             the diagnosis of new BOS per the criteria in Section 3.6 as assessed by the following
             criteria:

             For patients who are monitored with laboratory based spirometry, at least five
             recorded FEV1 measurements obtained at intervals of at least two weeks apart, over the
             6 months preceding study enrollment accompanied by a statistically significant
             (p&lt;0.05) rate of decline of FEV1 that exceeds 30 mL/month; or For patients who are
             monitored with home Spirometry, the Standardized Home Spirometry Method will define
             the specific criteria that will be used for these patients.

          7. Documented clinical assessment including a physical assessment and a CBC with WBC
             within two weeks prior to enrollment.

        EXCLUSION Criteria (Subjects meeting any one of these criteria will be excluded)

          1. Current participation in another clinical treatment trial with an investigational
             agent.

          2. Any condition that may interfere with the subject's ability to perform pulmonary
             function testing.

          3. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to pharmacologic agents used during ECP

          4. Any condition that would significantly affect the participant's ability to adhere to
             the protocol, affect interpretation of the study results, or put the participant at
             unacceptable risk for study-related complications as judged by the referring
             clinician. This may include a) patients with a specific acute contraindication to
             receiving ECP due to any acute condition such as new or evolving myocardial infarction
             or central nervous system disorder, hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia, acute
             bleeding, respiratory distress; or b) patients with lupus erythematosus, porphyria
             cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, variegate porphyria, xeroderma
             pigmentosum, albinism, or other dermatologic or ocular condition that contraindicates
             the use of methoxsalen or markedly enhances photosensitivity in the investigator's
             judgment.

          5. Aphakia or absence of ocular lenses

          6. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test - a urine or blood pregnancy test must be obtained
             within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in women of childbearing potential)

          7. Inability to provide informed consent or to comply with study treatments or

         10. The most recent FEV1 &lt; 900 mL

         11. Rate of FEV1 decline within the last 6 months &gt; 300 mL/month.

             For patients under review for eligibility for RCT:

         12. any patient who at least one year after transplant is treated with either lymphocyte
             depleting therapy or with an escalated dose of steroids (i.e., prednisone greater than
             30 mg/day) for more than one month for an acute decline in lung function that is
             suspected to be secondary to acute cellular rejection.
