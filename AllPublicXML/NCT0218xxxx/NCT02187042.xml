    <textblock>
      100 patients with metastatic and/or advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib
      (Sutent) will be inclued and followed with standard care plus a call center

      Principal assumption : the proportion of patients presenting with at least one grade 3 or 4
      AE (whether related to sunitinib or not).

      RENACALL is a prospective intermediate care study whose main aim is to evaluate the impact of
      a therapy management platform on the management of patients suffering from
      advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma and receiving first line treatment with Sutent®.

      100 mRCC patients treated receiving first line Sutent® treatment shall be included in the
      study, and shall benefit both from conventional follow-up and from additional therapy
      management platform-based follow-up. Platform follow-up shall consist in regular phone calls
      to accompany patients in their real life home management of their treatment with sunitinib
      (prevention, advice and guidance of patients towards options)..

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life threatening; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. The severity was graded by NCI CTCAE v.4.03. Grade 1 was mild AE. Grade 2 was moderate AE. Grade 3 was severe AE. Grade 4 was life-threatening consequences and urgent intervention AE. Grade 5 was death related to AE.</description>

    <description>ORR used for the assessment of response to treatment. As per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1: Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimetre [mm]). No new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

          <title>Call Center</title>
          <description>Participants with advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (a/mRCC) being treated first line with sunitinib (dose as per the recommendations in the summary or product characteristics [SmPC]) were followed up conventionally and by call center. Participants were conventionally monitored at the end of Cycles 1, 2 and 4 of sunitinib treatment as routine consultation visit at the oncology care centers. In addition, the follow-up consisted of regular phone calls by the call center nurses using a computer-assisted telephone interview system; participants received 5 calls on Week 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Cycle 1 and 2 of sunitinib treatment and 2 calls on Week 2 and 4 of each Cycle 3 and 4 of sunitinib treatment. Each cycle was of at least 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life threatening; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. The severity was graded by NCI CTCAE v.4.03. Grade 1 was mild AE. Grade 2 was moderate AE. Grade 3 was severe AE. Grade 4 was life-threatening consequences and urgent intervention AE.

Participants were conventionally monitored at the end of Cycles 1, 2 and 4 of sunitinib treatment as routine consultation visit at the oncology care centers. In addition, the follow-up consisted of regular phone calls by the call center nurses using a computer-assisted telephone interview system; participants received 5 calls on Week 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Cycle 1 and 2 of sunitinib treatment and 2 calls on Week 2 and 4 of each Cycle 3 and 4 of sunitinib treatment. Each cycle was of at least 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were &quot;Adherent&quot; as Per 4- Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4)</title>
        <description>MMAS-4 is a self-reported measure of medication taking behavior, consisting of 4 questions based on forgetting taking medication, carelessness about taking medication, stopping medication when feeling better, or stopping medication when feeling worse. Each question has answer either &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;; &quot;Yes&quot; =1 and &quot;No&quot; =0. The sum of answer to all 4 questions resulted in total MMAS-4 score. Total MMAS-4 score ranges from 0 (best adherence) to 4 (worst adherence), a low score representing improved adherence. Adherent participants were defined as participants with an MMAS-4 score of 0.</description>

Participants were conventionally monitored at the end of Cycles 1, 2 and 4 of sunitinib treatment as routine consultation visit at the oncology care centers. In addition, the follow-up consisted of regular phone calls by the call center nurses using a computer-assisted telephone interview system; participants received 5 calls on Week 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Cycle 1 and 2 of sunitinib treatment and 2 calls on Week 2 and 4 of each Cycle 3 and 4 of sunitinib treatment.

Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.

        <description>Participants' satisfaction with call center was assessed via the self-administered questionnaire completed at the end of the study. Questionnaire evaluated 4 dimensions with total of 8 items. Dimensions were: 1) Satisfaction with advice: 3 item, 2) Satisfaction with care, 3) Satisfaction concerning the service: 3 items and 4) Overall satisfaction with support in management of sunitinib treatment: 1 item. Each item had 5 responses: very satisfied, satisfied, not very satisfied, not satisfied and no opinion equivalent to score of +2, +1, 1, -2 and no score respectively. A score was calculated for each dimension by calculating the mean scores obtained for each item if at least 50% of the items for the dimension had been completed (and are not &quot;no opinion&quot;). Overall possible mean score range for each dimension was +2 to -2, where higher scores signified higher satisfaction.</description>

        <description>Physician's satisfaction with call center service for participants' follow-up was assessed via the self-administered questionnaire completed at the end of the study.

Each item had 5 responses: very satisfied, satisfied, not very satisfied, not satisfied and no opinion equivalent to score of +2, +1, 1, -2 and no score respectively. A score was calculated for each dimension by calculating the mean scores obtained for each item if at least 50% of the items for the dimension have been completed (and are not &quot;no opinion&quot;). Overall possible mean score range for each dimension was +2 to -2, where higher scores signified higher satisfaction.</description>
