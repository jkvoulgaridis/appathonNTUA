      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of continuous wound infiltration with
      ropivacaine in comparison to standard pain management after elective distal metatarsal
      osteotomy for postoperative pain control. The primary outcome parameters of this study were
      average pain and peak pain level on the verbal numeric rating scale (NRS; 1-10, higher
      numbers indicating increasing pain level) during the first 48 hours after surgery. The
      secondary outcome parameters included postoperative rescue opioid consumption, clinical
      outcome (AOFAS forefoot score, ROM of MTP joint of the greater toe), incidence of
      postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction with surgery on a numeric rating scale
      (1-10).

    <description>The primary outcome parameters of this study were average pain and peak pain level on the verbal numeric rating scale (NRS; 1-10, higher numbers indicating increasing pain level) during the first 48 hours after surgery. NRS scores for pain were assessed by members of the nursing staff every 4 hours for 48 hours after the procedure (until discharge). Patients were instructed to rate their pain level on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. Average postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain was calculated for each group (Placebo, Ropivacaine) by adding all postoperative NRS scores of all patients in each group (Placebo, Ropivacaine) to obtain the mean postoperative NRS score.</description>

    <description>The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS-Score, Forefoot Version) is comprised of nine questions and coveres three categories: Pain (40 points), function (50 points) and alignment (10 points). These are all scored together for a total of 100 points. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values representing a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Average Postoperative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain</title>
        <description>The primary outcome parameters of this study were average pain and peak pain level on the verbal numeric rating scale (NRS; 1-10, higher numbers indicating increasing pain level) during the first 48 hours after surgery. NRS scores for pain were assessed by members of the nursing staff every 4 hours for 48 hours after the procedure (until discharge). Patients were instructed to rate their pain level on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;. Average postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain was calculated for each group (Placebo, Ropivacaine) by adding all postoperative NRS scores of all patients in each group (Placebo, Ropivacaine) to obtain the mean postoperative NRS score.</description>

InfiltraLong-Katheter 19G x 420mm, Pajunk: Wound catheter with multiple and laterally aligned holes is inserted through the intact skin via an 16G iv catheter 2 cm proximal-laterally from the proximal end of the dorsomedial skin incision and placed subcutaneously through the wound and medially around the first metatarsal so that the tip projects into the interdigital space 1/2.
NaCl 0,9%: The catheter is connected to the perfusor line filled with saline 0.9% to allow continuous wound infiltration at a rate of 2 ml/h for 24 hours.</description>
