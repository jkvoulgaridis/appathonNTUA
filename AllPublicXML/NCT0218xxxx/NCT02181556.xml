  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the treatments generally used to treat this disease is a chemotherapy called FOLFIRI.
      The purpose of this study is to improve the efficacy of the chemotherapy by adding a protein,
      similar to immunoglobulins, aflibercept, and to assess their tolerance.

      Aflibercept is a protein that has already been studied in the treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancers, in combination with a chemotherapy involving irinotecan in addition to
      5FU (FOLFIRI) as 2nd line treatment. It is marketed in Europe and it is authorized in the
      United States. Its addition to this chemotherapy combination has in fact brought about a
      benefit in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of this combination rather
      in the initial approach to the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers and hence to
      evaluate it as 1st line treatment
