      The primary objective of the study is:

      • To provide patients with CMSaccess to amifampridine phosphate therapy until the product
      becomes commercially available or development is discontinued.

      The secondary objective of the study is:

      • To assess the long-term safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients with CMS

    <description>Dosage form: tablets containing the equivalent of 10 mg amifampridine per tablet.
Amifampridine Phosphateis given based on Investigator assessment of optimal neuromuscular benefit. Doses range from 30 mg to 80 mg, divided into doses taken 3 to 4 times per day, with a maximum single dose of 20 mg.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female:

          -  Confirmed genetic diagnosis of CMS.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential at Screening.

          -  If sexually active and of childbearing potential, willing to use 2 acceptable methods
             of contraception from screening visit until 3 months after the last dose of
             investigational product. No adequate clinical data on exposed pregnancies are
             available for amifampridine. No nonclinical safety data are available regarding the
             effects of amifampridine on reproductive function. Amifampridine phosphate should not
             be used during pregnancy. It is unknown whether amifampridine is excreted in human
             breast milk. The excretion of amifampridine in milk has not been studied in animals.
             Amifampridine phosphate should not be used during breastfeeding.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has
             been explained and before the start of any research-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of epilepsy and on medication/treatment for the same.

          -  CMS subtypes including slow-channel syndrome, LRP4 deficiency, and
             acetylcholinesterase deficiency.

          -  Current use of dalfampridine (Ampyra®; 4-aminopyridine), and any form of 3,4 DAP other
             than the investigational product provided, such as amifampridine base and does not
             agree to discontinue use for the duration of the study.

          -  Use of guanidine hydrochloride within 7 days of starting amifampridine phosphate
             treatment.

          -  History of drug allergy to any pyridine-containing substances or any amifampridine
             phosphate excipients (i.e. microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide or
             calcium stearate).

          -  Use of any other investigational product (other than 3,4 DAP or amifampridine
             phosphate) or investigational medical device within 30 days before starting treatment
             or requirement for any investigational agent before completion of all scheduled study
             assessments.

          -  An electrocardiogram (ECG) within 6 months before starting treatment that shows
             clinically significant abnormality(ies), in the opinion of the patient's personal
             physician.

          -  Breastfeeding or pregnant or planning to become pregnant (self or partner). Male
             patients with breastfeeding partners are not excluded from the study.

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Principal Investigator, places the patient at
             high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.
