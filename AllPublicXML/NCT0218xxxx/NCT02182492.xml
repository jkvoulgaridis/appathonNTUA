  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is widely considered to be the gold standard in the surgical
      management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that has failed maximal medical therapy.
      Nevertheless, the postoperation medical therapy was considered as a crucial procedure for the
      success of ESS. Both glucocorticoids and macrolide antibiotics have been recommended for the
      treatment of CRS, but their effect as postoperation medical therapies of ESS need more
      clinical data to clarify.

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized,study is to determine the effect of
      glucocorticoids and macrolide antibiotics for the postoperation medical therapy of ESS in
      different subtypes of CRS.

    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a multifactorial inflammatory disorder that causes various
      symptoms including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, olfactory dysfunction, facial pain, and
      headache . Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is usually recommended for patients who do not
      response well to conservative treatments. Although surgery is effective to alleviate symptoms
      and improve the quality of life of CRS patients, a followed long-term postoperative medical
      treatment is indispensable. Current European and American guidelines recommend
      glucocorticoids and antibiotics as the primary pharmacotherapeutic approaches for CRS before
      and after ESS. However, there are a number of CRS patients not responding well to
      glucocorticoid treatment and conflicting results exist regarding the efficacy of long-term,
      low-dose macrolide treatment. One potential reason is that CRS is a heterogeneous group of
      disorders unified by similar clinical presentations and its phenotypes and/or endotypes may
      be important factors determining the efficacy of treatments.

    <description>The treatment will begin one week after ESS. Symptoms visual analog scores (VAS) were recorded just before ESS and at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up visit. All of the patients were assessed by using symptom questionnaire after enrollment and at follow-up visits. Subjective symptoms were scored by patients on a VAS of 0-10, with 0 being &quot;no complaint whatsoever&quot; and 10 being &quot;the worst imaginable complaint.&quot;Five major symptoms were focused on: nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, loss of sense of smell, facial pain or pressure, and headache. Total VAS score was calculated based on the sum of VAS scores of these five symptom domains. Total subjective symptoms VAS range: 0~50, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Nasal endoscopic evaluation was performed by the senior investigator who remained blinded to the treatment, including poly size: 0, absence of polyps; 1, polyps in middle meatus only; 2, polyps beyond middle meatus but not blocking the nose completely; and 3, polyps completely obstructing the nose; discharge: 0, no discharge; 1, clear thin discharge; 2, thick purulent discharge; edema: 0, no edema; 1, mild edema; 2, severe edema; crusting: 0, no crusting; 1, mild crusting; 2, severe crusting; scarring: 0, no scarring; 1, mild scarring; 2, severe scarring). Each side was graded separately, and the scores from both sides were added to determine the overall scores for a particular domain. The total endoscopy score was calculated based on the sum of scores of these endoscopic domains. Endoscopic scores were also recorded before ESS (baseline) and at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Total endoscopy score range: 0~22, with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

          <title>Total Subjective Symptoms Visual Analog Scores (VAS)</title>
          <description>The treatment will begin one week after ESS. Symptoms visual analog scores (VAS) were recorded just before ESS and at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up visit. All of the patients were assessed by using symptom questionnaire after enrollment and at follow-up visits. Subjective symptoms were scored by patients on a VAS of 0-10, with 0 being &quot;no complaint whatsoever&quot; and 10 being &quot;the worst imaginable complaint.&quot;Five major symptoms were focused on: nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, loss of sense of smell, facial pain or pressure, and headache. Total VAS score was calculated based on the sum of VAS scores of these five symptom domains. Total subjective symptoms VAS range: 0~50, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

Each side was graded separately, and the scores from both sides were added to determine the overall scores for a particular domain. The total endoscopy score was calculated based on the sum of scores of these endoscopic domains. Endoscopic scores were also recorded before ESS (baseline) and at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Total endoscopy score range: 0~22, with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>
