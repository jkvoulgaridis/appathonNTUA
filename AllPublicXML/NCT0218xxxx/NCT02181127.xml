      This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that
      automatically delivers glucagon only can prevent or treat hypoglycemia vs. usual care for
      people with type 1 diabetes &gt; 21 years old.

             per week

          -  Partial hypoglycemic unawareness (inconsistent symptoms with BG &lt; 50 mg/dl) or
             hypoglycemic unawareness (minimal or no symptoms with BG &lt; 50 mg/dl)

             1 diabetes

          -  End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).

          -  Any known liver or biliary disease including cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease,

             hepatitis.

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or
             orthopnea).

          -  Acute illness or exacerbation of chronic illness at the time of the study.

          -  Seizure disorder or history of hypoglycemic seizure in the last 1 year

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year).

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days) or substance
             abuse (any use within the last 6 months of controlled substances without a
             prescription).

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be
             susceptible to RF interference.

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting.

          -  Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the study period.

          -  Any factors that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with
