      This pilot study aims to establish that treatment with near infrared light (NIR) reduces
      diabetic macular oedema in patients suffering diabetic retinopathy by exerting a positive
      beneficial effect at retinal cellular level.

      Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of vision and the most common cause of
      blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries.Swelling
      of the central retina or &quot;macular oedema&quot;. Patients will be treated in an office clinic,three
      times a week for a treatment duration of 2 minutes per session, a total of 12 times over the
      duration of 4 weeks and will be assessed at 8 weeks to establish any change induced in
      retinal oedema. Safety follow up will be assessed at 3 and 6 months post treatment.

The laser light beam is 4.5mm in diameter with a central masked area of 1.0 mm diameter containing the central fixation target. In this way the central macula will be spared in the event of an adverse effect of the laser, which we do not anticipate.
The patient will be seated at the slit lamp laser delivery system and after the eye has been dilated and anesthetised with topical eye drops a standard fundus contact lens will be placed on the eye through which the post area pole will be visualised while the treatment is delivered. There will be 12 treatments administered over a 5 week period.</description>

        e) An ocular condition that would prevent visual acuity improvement despite resolution of
        oedema (such as foveal atrophy or substantial premacular fibrosis) f) Treatment with
        intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) within the last 6 months or peribulbar
        triamcinolone within the last 3 months, or anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
        drugs: ranibizumab and aflibercept, within the last 2 months.

        g) Cataract surgery within the last 3 months h) Retinal laser treatment within the last 4
        months i) Media opacity including cataract that already precludes adequate macular
        photography or cataract that is likely to require surgery within 6 months j) Intercurrent
        severe disease such as septicaemia, any condition which would affect follow-up or
        photographic documentation (e.g. geographical, psycho-social) k) History of chronic renal
        failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant l) Blood pressure &gt;180/100 m) Patient has a
        condition or is in a situation that in the investigator's opinion may put the patient at
        significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the
        patient's participation in the study

            <description>The Ellex Integre NIR (near Infrared Light) Laser dose of 25 milliwats(mW)/cm2 for 90 seconds for 12 treatments at 2 to 3 day intervals over 5 weeks.
Ellex Integre NIR laser: Each NIR light treatment will consist of a 90 second exposure of the macula of the study eye to the Ellex Integre NIR laser with the patient fixating on the central aiming beam. The laser light beam is 4.5mm in diameter with a central masked area of 1.0 mm diameter containing the central fixation target. In this way the central macula will be spared in the event of an adverse effect of the laser, which we do not anticipate.
The patient will be seated at the slit lamp laser delivery system and after the eye has been dilated and anesthetised with topical eye drops a standard fundus contact lens will be placed on the eye through which the post area pole will be visualised while the treatment is delivered. There will be 12 treatments administered over a 5 week period.</description>

Ellex Integre NIR laser: Each NIR light treatment will consist of a 90 second exposure of the macula of the study eye to the Ellex Integre NIR laser with the patient fixating on the central aiming beam. The laser light beam is 4.5mm in diameter with a central masked area of 1.0 mm diameter containing the central fixation target. In this way the central macula will be spared in the event of an adverse effect of the laser, which we do not anticipate.
The patient will be seated at the slit lamp laser delivery system and after the eye has been dilated and anesthetised with topical eye drops a standard fundus contact lens will be placed on the eye through which the post area pole will be visualised while the treatment is delivered.

          <title>NIR Laser Treatment 25 Miiliwatts (mW)/cm2 Dose</title>
          <description>The Ellex Integre NIR (near Infrared Light) Laser dose of 25 milliwats(mW)/cm2 for 90 seconds for 12 treatments at 2 to 3 day intervals over 5 weeks.
Ellex Integre NIR laser: Each NIR light treatment will consist of a 90 second exposure of the macula of the study eye to the Ellex Integre NIR laser with the patient fixating on the central aiming beam. The laser light beam is 4.5mm in diameter with a central masked area of 1.0 mm diameter containing the central fixation target. In this way the central macula will be spared in the event of an adverse effect of the laser, which we do not anticipate.
The patient will be seated at the slit lamp laser delivery system and after the eye has been dilated and anesthetised with topical eye drops a standard fundus contact lens will be placed on the eye through which the post area pole will be visualised while the treatment is delivered. There will be 12 treatments administered over a 5 week period.</description>
