  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether recombinant Alkaline Phosphatase (recAP) is
      effective and save, and to determine the most effective dose, in the treatment of patients
      with acute kidney injury caused by sepsis.

      Design:

      Adaptive trial with two stages and interim analysis

        -  Stage 1: four arms; three dose groups and placebo. n=30/arm. (n=120)

        -  Interim analysis based on 120 subjects, with continued recruitment, adding 11 subjects
           to Stage 1 safety population (n=131): to evaluate safety and select dose for stage 2

        -  Stage 2: one dose group and placebo. N=85/arm. (n=170) Total n in the study: 301.

      Primary objectives

        -  To investigate the effect of recAP on renal function (measured creatinine clearance
           D1-D7 period, incidence and duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) over 28 days,
           eGFR at D60 and D90) and related clinical parameters (ICU stay, Hospital stay,
           Mechanical ventilation over 28 days, SOFA and SAPS2 scores 28 days) in patients with
           SA-AKI.

        -  To determine effective therapeutic dose(s) of recAP.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of recAP in patients with SA AKI. (assessed
           by independent Data Monitoring Board, adverse events over 90 days study period,
           laboratory values, ECG, physical examniations, vital signs, Anti Drug Antibodies)

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of recAP in a subset of patients (part
           1, n=120) with SA AKI. (Population PK; AUC D1-7, Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, terminal T1/2)

        -  To investigate the immunogenic potential of recAP in patients with SA AKI. (anti-drug
           antibodies at D14, D28, D60 and D90)

        -  To investigate the effect on quality of life (using the EuroQol, EQ-5D) following study
           inclusion, at ICU discharge, and Day 90.

      Other objectives

      • To evaluate whether specific patient groups can be identified that benefit most from recAP
      treatment or patient groups that are non-responders

    <measure>Area Under the Time Corrected Endogenous Creatinine Clearance From Day 1 to Day 7 (AUC1-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint is calculated as the average of the standardized endogenous creatinine clearance values over the first seven days between the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg recAP arm.
Standardized endogenous creatinine clearance is assessed on each days from D1 to Day 7 during a 6 +/- 1 hour period and calculated in mL/min as the mean creatinine clearance over the period. The study started with 4 treatment arms of which 0.4 mg/kg recAP and the 0.8 mg/kg recAP were dropped after the interim analysis. The number of the patients in the dropped arm are respectively 30 and 32. Therefore the statistical analysis has been performed only on the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) During the Period Day 1 to Day 28, Inclusive</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>During the study the days on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) was recorded for each patients. During the first 7 days of the study (D1 to D7 included), patients were only allowed to receive continuous RRT, thereafter patients were also allowed to receive intermittent RRT. Standardization of RRT was attempted by providing guidelines to start and stop RRT (see protocol). Statistical analysis was only performed on the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg recAP arm due to the small number of patients treated with the doses of 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg recAP. Those two doses were dropped in part 2 of the study.</description>

Statistical analysis was only performed on the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg recAP arm due to the small number of patients treated with the doses of 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg recAP. Those two doses were dropped in part 2 of the study.</description>

          <title>APACHE II</title>
          <description>Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II) is a severity-of-disease used in adults upon admission to the ICU. A score of 0 to 71 is calculated based on 12 routine measurements and the higher scores corresponds to a more severe disease state and a higher risk of mortality. Parameters included in the score are the patient's age, AaDO2 or PaO2 (depending on FiO2), temperature (rectal), Mean arterial pressure, pH arterial, Heart rate, Respiratory rate, Sodium (serum), Potassium (serum), Creatinine, Hematocrit, White blood cell count and Glasgow Coma Scale</description>

          <title>SOFA score</title>
          <description>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA score) is used to track a person's status during the stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure. The SOFA score is composed of six different sub-scores, concerning respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems. Each of the six subscores can have a maximal score of 4. The higher the score the more severe the organ dysfunction is (SOFA score ranges theoretically from 0-30).</description>

        <title>Area Under the Time Corrected Endogenous Creatinine Clearance From Day 1 to Day 7 (AUC1-7)</title>
        <description>Primary endpoint is calculated as the average of the standardized endogenous creatinine clearance values over the first seven days between the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg recAP arm.
Standardized endogenous creatinine clearance is assessed on each days from D1 to Day 7 during a 6 +/- 1 hour period and calculated in mL/min as the mean creatinine clearance over the period. The study started with 4 treatment arms of which 0.4 mg/kg recAP and the 0.8 mg/kg recAP were dropped after the interim analysis. The number of the patients in the dropped arm are respectively 30 and 32. Therefore the statistical analysis has been performed only on the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg group.</description>
        <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
        <population>ITT combined includes all patients randomized in part 1 and part 2 of the study, excluding patients recruited whilst the interim analysis is performed to treatment arms not selected for Part 2. Some values were discarded by the adjudication committee.</population>

          <title>Area Under the Time Corrected Endogenous Creatinine Clearance From Day 1 to Day 7 (AUC1-7)</title>
          <description>Primary endpoint is calculated as the average of the standardized endogenous creatinine clearance values over the first seven days between the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg recAP arm.
Standardized endogenous creatinine clearance is assessed on each days from D1 to Day 7 during a 6 +/- 1 hour period and calculated in mL/min as the mean creatinine clearance over the period. The study started with 4 treatment arms of which 0.4 mg/kg recAP and the 0.8 mg/kg recAP were dropped after the interim analysis. The number of the patients in the dropped arm are respectively 30 and 32. Therefore the statistical analysis has been performed only on the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg group.</description>
          <population>ITT combined includes all patients randomized in part 1 and part 2 of the study, excluding patients recruited whilst the interim analysis is performed to treatment arms not selected for Part 2. Some values were discarded by the adjudication committee.</population>

Standardization of RRT was attempted by providing guidelines to start and stop RRT (see protocol). Statistical analysis was only performed on the placebo and 1.6 mg/kg recAP arm due to the small number of patients treated with the doses of 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg recAP.
