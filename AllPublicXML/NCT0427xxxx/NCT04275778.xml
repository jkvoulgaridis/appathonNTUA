  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by thrombosis or obstetric complication (≥ 3
      spontaneous miscarriages or fetal death or prematurity &lt;34 weeks gestation-related amenorrhea
      (SA)) associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. The rate of term pregnancies has been
      improved by conventional treatment (aspirin 100 mg / day with low molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH) in an isocoagulant dose) to almost 75%. In the PROMISSE study, when considering
      progressive pregnancies after 20 weeks, 19% of pregnancies presented at least one
      complication despite the treatment (maternal, fetal or neonatal complications) related to
      APS. In the European APS register, maternal complications and IUGR were observed in 13% of
      cases, and prematurity in approximately 14% of cases despite treatment. In a previous study
      of 72 pregnancies during a LAS, we observed, under aspirin and LMWH, 25% of fetal losses, and
      10% of at least one maternal and / or fetal complication or prematurity. The presence of
      lupus, a history of thrombosis, a circulating anticoagulant (ACC) and a triple positivity of
      antiphospholipids are considered to be factors associated with a poor obstetrical prognosis.
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. In vitro
      studies have shown that HCQ is able to restore the expression of placental annexin V, which
      has an anticoagulant effect and prevent the attachment of antiphospholipid antibodies to the
      placenta.

      HCQ during lupus decreases the thrombotic risk and its usefulness during thrombotic APS has
      been shown in a French series. In a European study, the addition of the HCQ to conventional
      treatment improved term pregnancies by 70% in the event of refractory APS. Its use during
      pregnancies of patients with lupus, the numerous data on tolerance during pregnancy and the
      follow-up of children born to mothers exposed to the HCQ demonstrates a reassuring tolerance
      profile for the mother and the fetus.

      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the benefit of addition or no of
      hydroxychloroquine to conventional treatment in obstetric APS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consecutive patientes with APS will be recruited in different ways based on daily
      practice; Patients fulfilling all criteria may be randomized following receipt of written
      informed consent.

      The randomization will be stratified by center and by, the presence of anticoagulant
      antibody.

      Te included patients will be randomized to receive conventional APS treatment (aspirin with
      low-molecular-weight heparin) combined with hydroxychloroquine or placebo.

      In the two groups, the hydroxychloroquine or placebo will be initiated in the patients with
      ongoing pregnancy (≤14 week of gestation).

      After the inclusion visit, the patients will be followed by the investigator every months
      until the end of the pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum.

      At each visit, a clinical examination, routine biological analysis, APL antibody and
      complement determination will be performed. Hydroxychloroquine blood levels, PFA, Xa
      inhibition,and treatment adherence will be assessed during pregnancy.

      At Inclusion :

      - Maternal blood samples 20 ml of blood will be collected at the same time as the sample
      routinely collected just before delivery when the women are perfused.

      At delivery

      - Cord fluid : will be collected at the same as cord fluid pH is routinely measured just
      after delivery. The aliquots previously labelled and stowed in the specific boxes for the
      study will be stored locally and will be transported to the &quot;Centre de Ressources
      Biologiques&quot;(CRB) of the Saint Antoine Hospital. Last visit for children : At 12 months The
      patient will be contacted by phone by the local medical team to collect the following data:
      Children's anthropometric data; safety data ; possible hospitalization..

aspirin 100 mg/day will begin , the preference at the preconception, and continued during pregnancy and will be stopped at 35 weeks of gestation.
LMWH enoxaparin 4000 UI/day will begin as soon as possible after confirmation of the pregnancy, and will be continued during 6 weeks postpartum.</intervention_model_description>
