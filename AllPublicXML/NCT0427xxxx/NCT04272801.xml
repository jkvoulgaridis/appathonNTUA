  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm pilot study evaluates the use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in women with
      early stage ER+ breast cancer who are 70 years or older and are scheduled to have breast
      conservation surgery (BCS). The purpose of this study is to see if tolerance of neoadjuvant
      endocrine therapy helps inform decisions on whether or not to omit radiation. Participants
      will be treated with the novel approach of 3 months of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, so that
      the participants and providers will have some indication of tolerance prior to making a
      decision about radiation omission. Tolerance of the endocrine therapy will be assessed by
      patient reported outcome (PRO) measures during neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy
      treatment periods. Breast cancer participants and their surgical oncologists will be asked
      their preference regarding radiation therapy before starting endocrine therapy and again
      post-operatively. They will make a determination regarding radiation therapy as per standard
      care. The hypothesis is that knowledge of tolerance of endocrine therapy will influence the
      decision by the patient and the surgical oncologist whether or not to elect radiation
      omission.
