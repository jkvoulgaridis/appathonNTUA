    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial (Phase IV trial) to evaluate the short-term efficacy and
      long-term health economic impact of a dietary intervention compared to pharmacotherapy with a
      musculotropic spasmolytic (otilonium bromide) agent for 470 newly diagnosed or newly treated
      irritable bowel syndrome patients in primary care.

      The primary objective of this trial is to study treatment efficacy (IBS-SSS responder rate)
      with diet versus medication after 8 weeks of therapy.

      The secondary endpoint is to study the quality of life and health economic impact over six
      months after the start of the initial treatment with diet versus medication.

      Finally, patient satisfaction during and after the different treatment modalities, HRU and
      WPAI-IBS score in subgroups according to IBS stool pattern subtype, faecal microbiota and
      serotonin synthesis genetic polymorphisms will also be investigated

    <time_frame>1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-SSS: IBS symptom severity score
The maximum achievable score is 500. Mild, moderate and severe cases were indicated by scores of 75 to 175, 175 to 300 and &gt;300 respectively.
Controls scored below 75 and patients scoring in this range can be considered to be in remission.
Efficacy of treatment will be assess by calculating the proportion of patients in each arm with a drop of 50 points or more on the IBS-SSS. The higher the drop, the more the patient has improved.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment efficacy in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done with the IBS-QoL questionnaires before and during the study.
This includes IBS generic functional status and well-being, perceived quality of life specific to IBS, and work disability.
Quality of life and health economic impact over 6 months after the start of the initial treatment with diet versus medication will be studied.
Questionnaire includes a 5-point Likert response scale: not at all, slightly, moderately, quite a bit, and extremely or a great deal.
All items were sum-scored to calculate total scores.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life in IBS</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>Euro-Qol quesrionnaire. This questionnaire includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems.
Additionallty, a VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.
All the scores are taken into account.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment in IBS</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) Levels of work productivity will be assess before and after treatment. The change of work productivity levels before and after treatment will be studied.
WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes, as follows:
Questions:
= currently employed
= hours missed due to health problems
= hours missed other reasons
= hours actually worked
= degree health affected productivity while working
= degree health affected regular activities
Scores:
Multiply scores by 100 to express in percentages. Percent work time missed due to health: Q2/(Q2+Q4) Percent impairment while working due to health: Q5/10 Percent overall work impairment due to health: Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4)))x(Q5/10)] Percent activity impairment due to health: Q6/10</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depression levels in IBS</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ: patient health questionnaire
This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of ―not at all,‖ ―several days,‖ ―more than half the days,‖ and ―nearly every day,‖ respectively.
PHQ-9 total score (sum) for the nine items ranges from 0 to 27.
Scores represent: 0-5 = mild 6-10 = moderate 11-15 = moderately severe 16-20 = severe depression
Levels of depression will be assess before and after treatment. The change of depression levels before and after treatment will be studied.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Somatic levels in IBS</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ: patient health questionnaire
This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, and 2 to the response categories of ―not at all‖, ―bothered a little‖, and ―bothered a lot‖, for the 13 somatic symptoms and 2 items from the depression module (sleep and tired) are scored 0 (―not at all‖), 1 (―several days‖) or 2 (―more than half the days‖ or ―nearly every day‖).
PHQ-15 scores (sum of scores) of 5, 10, and 15 represent cutpoints for low, medium, and high somatic symptom severity, respectively.
Levels of somatization will be assess before and after treatment. The change of somatization levels before and after treatment will be studied.</description>

    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Health resourse utilisation in IBS with the HRU questionnaire. Both direct and indirect health costs, including self-costs to patients, will be compared at the different time points (2,4,6 months). They will also be compared to the (retrospective) cost assessment at baseline. The total direct costs of the utilization of healthcare resources associated with IBS will be calculated in terms of (additional) primary care visits, secondary care visits, hospitalizations, diagnostic tests and procedures, prescription and non-prescription medication and complementary therapies.</description>
