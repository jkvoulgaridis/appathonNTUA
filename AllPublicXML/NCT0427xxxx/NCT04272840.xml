  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) incidence is increasing worldwide, and within Canada, the
      Atlantic provinces statistically have been found to have highest prevalence of diabetes.
      Increasing evidence supports the benefit of following a low glycaemic index (GI) diet in GDM
      and the Canadian Diabetes Guidelines recommends replacing high GI foods for low GI foods.
      Despite recommendation to adapt a low GI diet in GDM, there are limitations and barriers
      recognized to GI utility largely focused on knowledge translation. There is sufficient
      research to support a low GI diet in benefiting outcomes of GDM, therefore the GI in GDM
      Online trial will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a distance low GI
      education intervention, adapted from Diabetes Canada's GI materials, on producing a
      difference in average dietary GI between a group with the intervention and standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) has been progressively increasing
      worldwide, with a global prevalence of gestational hyperglycaemia estimated at 16.9%. In
      Canada, Atlantic provinces have been recorded with the highest prevalence of diabetes at 6%.
      The Diabetes Canada Practice Guidelines recommends the low glycemic index (GI) diet to type 1
      and 2 diabetes mellitus and has recently updated its guidelines to include a recommendation
      for GDM. This said, barriers to GI knowledge translation have been identified. This study
      uses a prospective parallel randomized control trial design. Procedures and materials have
      been adapted from NCT01589757. The Kirkpatrick Model (Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, and
      Results) informed intervention development and evaluation strategies. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate whether a distance low GI education intervention, adapted from Diabetes
      Canada's GI education materials, will significantly yield a lower average GI (primary
      outcome) in participants than traditional standard care medical nutrition therapy for
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. We hypothesize that participants who receive the low GI
      intervention will have a lower dietary GI than those who received usual IWK standard care for
      GDM.
