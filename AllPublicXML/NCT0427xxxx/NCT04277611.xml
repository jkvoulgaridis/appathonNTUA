      comparing the subcostal oblique Quadratus Lumborum block and the Erector Spinae plane block
      in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy operation to get the best and longest
      postoperative analgesic effect.

      Here the investigators are going to compare between the Anterior approach for the subcostal
      oblique Quadratus Lumborum block (QLB) and the Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) to determine
      their level of spread and their value in controlling postoperative pain in patients scheduled
      for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy surgery. We hypothesized that quadratus lumborum could
      provide a longer duration of analgesia when compared to erector spinae in patients undergoing
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy under general anesthesia.

    <description>The patient is in the prone position. A low-frequency convex probe is placed in a transverse, oblique, and paramedian orientation approximately lateral to the posterior axillary line. The needle is then inserted in-plane from the medial side of the transducer and advanced laterally to enter the interfascial plane between the Quadratus Lumborum muscle and the kidney. We confirmed that the local anesthetic appeared to press down the kidney in the ultrasound image</description>

    <description>Using aseptic technique, a high frequency linear array transducer was placed at the T9 vertebral level. After identifying the ribs and sliding towards the midline in a longitudinal parasagittal orientation, the overlying Erector Spinae is identified by visualization of the transition between the rib and transverse apophysis a block needle is inserted in plane with ultrasound beam and is advanced in a cephalo-caudal direction until the tip contacted the transverse process.</description>

    <description>patients undergo general anesthesia,will be put in prone position.In case of Quadratus Lumborum block1-3 mLof bupivacaine 0.25% is injected to produce LA spread cranially between the QL and kidney muscles towards 12th rib.The corresponding ultrasonographic sign is a lunar-shaped hypoechoic fluid collection observed between the long axis of the kidney and QL muscle.After incremental injection of a total of 15 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. In case of Erector Spinae Plane Block, The location of the needle tip is confirmed by hydro dissection and after visualizing the fluid spread lifting the Erector Spinae off the transverse process.20 mL of 0.25% Bupivacaine is injected. Neruromuscular block will be reversed with 0.04 mg.kg−1 of neostigmine and 0.02 mg kg−1 of i.v. atropine and patients will be extubated and transferred to the recovery room (RR) when adequate muscle strength is returned. No peritoneal (puff or injection) or surgical site anesthesia is performed.</description>
