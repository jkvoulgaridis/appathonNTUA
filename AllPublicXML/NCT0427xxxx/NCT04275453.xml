  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test different methods of preparation that can be used prior
      to a test called an FDG PET/CT scan. FDG PET/CT scans are routinely done for evaluation of
      heart inflammation. Standard preparation for the scan includes a ketogenic (high fat and low
      carbohydrate) diet for 24 hours and overnight fasting to help suppress the amount of sugar
      taken up in the heart muscle. However, Investigator still do not know if this preparation is
      the most effective method. So the Investigator, want to investigate alternative methods for
      decreasing the amount of sugar uptake seen in the heart during FDG PET/CT scan, thus,
      investigator will have participants try up to 3 different methods of preparation prior to the
      FDG PET/CT scans to see which type of preparation works the best.

    <measure>Comparing the myocardial glucose suppression in Ketogenetic diet vs. external Ketone supplement by looking at the FDG uptake using PET/CT</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing the myocardial glucose suppression in Ketogenetic diet vs. external Ketone supplement by looking at the FDG uptake using PET/CT. Images will be qualitative and semi-quantitatively assessed. The entire right and left ventricular walls will be contoured in a dedicated nuclear medicine workstation (MIM Software) to create volume of interest s(VOI) and derive the maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUV) and total glycolytic activity (TGA), all measures of glucose utilization. Blood pool activity within the left ventricular cavity will be used as reference. Complete myocardial suppression will be defined as FDG activity (by any measure) in the left ventricular wall lower than blood pool activity in the ventricular cavity.</description>

    <description>Understanding the relationship between serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels and myocardial glucose by looking at the FDG uptake using PET/CT by comparing the data out of keto diet Arm versus Ketone supplement Arm by measuring serum levels of BHB, free fatty acid, acylcarnitine, glucose, and insulin at each FDG PET/CT visit. Approximately 15 mLs of blood will be drawn and used to measure B-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acylcarnitines, insulin, glucose and free fatty acid and other targeted metabolomics</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>comparing the transthoracic echocardiogram changes before and after the Ketone supplement drink to assess the effect of Ketone supplement. Transthoracic Echocardiogram: Ultrasound will be used to create an image of the internal parts of the heart. This test is being done to assess any changes in cardiac function with the ketone drink. We will perform echocardiography before and approximately 30 minutes after the drink.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo FDG PET/CT after 1 dose of ketone drink administration after 12 hours of fasting prior to FDG injection. The dosing of ketone drink administration (approximately 65 mL) will be weight based (714 mg/kg), which is crucial to replicating ketone levels between participants. The KE drink will be administered approximately 45 minutes prior to FDG injection as concentrations of ~3 mmol/L are reached within 60 minutes . By way of comparison, website marketing of the commercial drink recommends ingestion 30 minutes prior to athletic performance. We will also perform echocardiography immediately before and 30 minutes after the drink.</description>
