  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In breast reduction surgery, delayed wound healing may increase surgical site infections,
      cutaneous necrosis and may be related to psychological harm.Some risk factors have been
      identified : smoking, diabetes, overweight. A normal healing involve cellular and biochemical
      reactions in which iron plays an important role such as cellular respiration, redox reactions
      and regulation of genes involved in the cell cycle. This trial will study the relationship
      between iron stores and postoperative wound healing after bilateral breast reduction surgery
      in patients without preoperative anaemia.The primary outcome of this trial is the comparison
      of wound healing at post operative day 15, between patients with and without iron deficiency.
