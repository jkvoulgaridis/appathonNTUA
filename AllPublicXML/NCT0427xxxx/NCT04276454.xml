      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the result of treatment for neck lymphedema on
      throat pressure in patients who have received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a failure of lymphatic system to transfer fluid from the connective tissue to
      the circulatory system. The lymphedema seen in patients treated for head and neck cancer can
      be seen externally on the neck and face, as well as internally in the lining of the throat.
      In this study, the investigators plan to treat the external lymphedema with a device called
      the Flexitouch Plus, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      lymphedema treatment, and to measure the degree of internal lymphedema using a pressure
      sensor to detect throat muscle pressure before and after the treatment with the Flexitouch
      Plus device.
