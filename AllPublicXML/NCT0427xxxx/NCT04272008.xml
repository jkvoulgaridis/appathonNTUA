      This study will evaluate the effect of Annovera and tampon co-usage on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of segesterone acetate (SA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE).

      This is an open label, randomized, crossover PK study. Participants will be randomized to one
      of two treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of two cycles of treatment — one
      with tampon use and one without tampon use. Tampon use will occur on Days 2 to 5 of
      contraceptive vaginal system (CVS) use and a new CVS will be used for each treatment cycle.
      Before starting Annovera use, each subject will use a combined oral contraceptive (COC) for
      one cycle.

        Inclusion Criteria

        All of the following criteria must be met for the participants to be eligible for the
        study:

          1. Healthy women, sterile or at risk of becoming pregnant, inclusive of ages 18 to 35*
             years at the enrollment visit.

          2. Intact uterus and both ovaries.

          3. Prior history of regular menstrual cycles that usually occur every 28 ± 7 days when
             not using hormonal contraception; if postpartum or post-abortal, history of regular
             menstrual cycles of 21 to 35 days in length and resumption of at least one cycle with
             a cycle length consistent with her past cycles.

          4. In the opinion of the Investigator, able to comply with the protocol, eg, live within
             the study site catchment area or within a reasonable distance from the study site.

          5. Willing to use oral contraception for one month prior to the initial insertion of
             Annovera.

          6. Willing to abstain from tampon use except during the prescribed time of the trial.

          7. Willing to abstain from sexual intercourse during tampon use.

          8. Signed informed consent prior to entry into the trial.

               -  Upper age limit based on normal ovarian changes (ovarian reserve) prevalent in
                  women with advancing age (&gt; 35 years of age) that may alter patterns of follicle
                  development and/or confound interpretations of data regarding patterns of
                  follicle development

        Exclusion Criteria

        Contraindications for enrollment will be the same as those for use of CHCs and additional
        criteria important to the objectives of this study and include:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to estrogens or progestins.

          2. Pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

          3. Known hypersensitivity to silicone rubber.

          4. Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.

          5. Undiagnosed vaginal discharge, vaginal lesions or abnormalities. Participants
             diagnosed at screening with a chlamydia or gonococcus infection may be included in the
             trial following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Investigators should
             make a determination if participants are at high risk for reinfection, eg, multiple
             sex partners, untreated partner, and whether such participants can be included.

          6. History of pelvic inflammatory disease since the participant's last pregnancy.

          7. History of toxic shock syndrome.

          8. In accordance with the Bethesda system of classification: Women with a current (within
             the last 20 months) abnormal Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear) suggestive of high-grade
             pre-cancerous lesion (s), including high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

          9. Cystoceles or rectoceles or other anatomical abnormality that would preclude use of a
             vaginal ring.

         10. Women planning to undergo major surgery during the trial.

         11. Women who smoke 15 cigarettes or more per day must be evaluated by the Principal
             Investigator (PI) for inclusion based on risk factors that would increase their risk
             for cardiovascular disease and thromboembolism, eg, lipid levels, glucose level, blood
             pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), family history of cardiovascular disease at a
             young age.

         12. Current or past thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders.

         13. History of venous thrombosis or embolism in a first-degree relative, &lt; 55 years of age
             suggesting a familial defect in the blood coagulation system, which in the opinion of
             the PI, suggests that use of a hormonal contraceptive could pose a significant risk.

         14. Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.

         15. History of retinal vascular lesions, unexplained partial or complete loss of vision.

         16. Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast.

         17. Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia.

         18. Past history of any other carcinoma unless in remission for more than five years.

         19. Current or history of medically diagnosed severe depression, which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, could be exacerbated by the use of a hormonal contraceptive.

         20. Has a Type D personality type as assessed by the DS14 test (Standard Assessment of
             Negative Affectivity, Social Inhibition and Type D Personality).

         21. Headaches with focal neurological symptoms.

         22. Severe constipation in the opinion of the Investigator.

         23. History of cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior steroid use.

         24. Benign or malignant liver tumors; active liver disease.

         25. Diastolic BP &gt; 85 mm Hg and/or systolic BP &gt; 135 mm Hg after 5 to 10 minutes rest (at
             Screening).

         26. Known or suspected alcoholism or drug abuse within their lifetime. aa. Elevated serum
             fasting clinical chemistry values or complete blood count (CBC) values designated
             clinically significant by the Investigator and/or medically qualified
             Sub-Investigator.

        bb. Screening hemoglobin levels less than 12.5 g/dL or hematocrit less than 38%.

        cc. Participation in another clinical trial involving an investigational drug within the
        last 30 days (prior to Screening). dd. BMI &gt; 29 kg/m2. ee. Use of liver enzyme inducers on
        a regular basis. ff. Use of monthly injectable contraceptives, unless suspended 2 months
        before initiation of the treatment. Use of Depo-Provera® [depot medroxyprogesterone
        acetate] unless suspended 9 months before treatment.

        gg. Current use of implanted hormonal contraceptives, including Mirena® [progestin
        containing intrauterine system], Jadelle®, Norplant®, Implanon® or Nexplanon (if now
        available in the USA).** hh. Known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection. ii. History
        of frequent vaginal infections in the opinion of the PI. jj. Use of any oral medications or
        supplements during the trial that could interfere with the metabolism of the contraceptive
        hormones. Use of any vaginal preparations during Treatment Cycle 1 or Treatment Cycle 2.
        Use of any medication during the study must be reviewed and approved by the Medical Monitor

        *Women using non-hormonal intrauterine devices are permitted to enroll in the study.

        **Participants using any of the implanted hormonal methods who request removal for reasons
        unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study may be considered for participation.
