  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease is usually managed by vascular medicine
      physicians (VMP). The national OPTIMEV study, conducted more than 12 years ago among VMP
      practicing in hospital and in the community described the management of VTE in routine
      clinical practice. Since then a large number of practice changing studies have been
      published. This includes trials that have validated the use of direct oral anticoagulants
      (DOAC), the new standard of care of VTE, as per new national and international guidelines.
      Management of VTE in 2019 appears to be significantly different from the one that prevailed
      more than 10 years ago when the last national survey was conducted. It is therefore important
      to have an update on the routine clinical practice management of VTE by VMP. In this
      perspective the investigators aim to conduct a national survey among VMP practicing in France

        Vascular medicine physicians (VMP) practicing in the hospital and in the community
        settings.

        Participating VMP will prospectively collect data on the management of incident venous
        thromboembolic (VTE) disease cases.

        After that, vascular medicine physicians will answer a phone questionnaire on their general
        VTE management
