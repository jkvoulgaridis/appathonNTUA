      The trial is a placebo-controlled, double-blinded within cohorts, randomized, multiple
      ascending dose trial with a sequential trial design. The primary outcome is to investigate
      the safety and tolerability of ascending s.c. weekly doses of NNC0361-0041 plasmid in
      patients with T1D.
