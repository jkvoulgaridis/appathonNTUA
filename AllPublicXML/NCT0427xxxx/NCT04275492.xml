      The main purpose of In two kinds of fasting and postprandial Chinese healthy subjects with
      Boehringer represent Ingelheim company production of hydrochloric acid Pramipexole zyban
      (specification: 0.26 mg/piece, in Pramipexole, commodity name: Siforl ®) as the reference
      preparation, study a single oral dose of macro crown biological pharmaceutical co., LTD.
      Production of Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Sustained Release Tablets (specification:The
      pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug were calculated after the time course of the drug in
      vivo (0.375mg/ tablet, as measured by pramipexole hydrochloride), and the human relative
      bioavailability of the two preparations were compared to evaluate their bioequivalence.

      A secondary purpose To evaluate the safety of fasting and postprandial oral test preparations
      and reference preparations.

      In this study, a single-center, randomized, open, two-cycle, self-crossover, single-dose
      administration design was used to evaluate the bioequivalence of the tested preparations and
      reference preparations given to Chinese healthy subjects with single-dose, fasting and
      post-meal administration of Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Sustained Release Tablets.

      This study was divided into two parts: fasting administration and high-fat post-meal
      administration.The healthy subjects were randomly divided into two groups with the same
      number of patients in each group. The washing period was 7±1 days.

      In this study, venous blood was collected at 18 time points (fasting and postprandial) within
      1h (0h) before administration and at 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h, 4.0h, 5.0h, 6.0h, 7.0h, 8.0h, 9.0h,
      10.0h, 11.0h, 12.0h, 16.0h, 36.0h, 48.0h, and 72.0h after administration.

      A total of 60 healthy subjects were enrolled into the equivalence test, among which:

        1. Study on human bioequivalence of drug administration on an empty stomach: 30 healthy
           subjects (male and female).

        2. Human bioequivalence of high-fat post-meal administration: 30 healthy subjects (male and
           female).
