  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      14 participants residing in a forensic psychiatric hospital completed 15 Heart Rate Variance
      (HRV) biofeedback sessions. They completed 4 psychometric questionnaires, pre, during and
      post biofeedback training.

      This study aimed to establish whether Heart Rate Variance (HRV) biofeedback improved HRV
      coherence as well as psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, emotion regulation, and
      mindfulness) over the course of 15 biofeedback sessions in a sample of 14 patients with
      varying diagnoses; Paranoid Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Personality Disorder or
      Mixed Diagnosis. All 14 participants (n=10 male, n=4 female) participated in 15 biofeedback
      sessions. The study was researched and treatment was facilitated by a trainee forensic
      psychologist working with both male and female offenders residing within a Forensic
      Psychiatric Hospital, on both low and medium secure wards. An average coherence percentage
      was captured using the Wild Devine Programme® Relaxing Rhythms software for each session.
      Quantitative data were collected and analysed before, during and after biofeedback treatment
      to assess whether there was improvement in psychometric measures of depression, anxiety,
      emotion regulation and facets of mindfulness. A quasi experimental 'A-B-A design' was
      employed to assess the research questions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difficulties in Emotional Regulation (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes (pre, during and post biofeedback training)</time_frame>
    <description>a 36 item self-report questionnaire developed to assess adult difficulties in emotional regulation. six specific dimensions which include; difficulties accepting emotional responses (acceptance), controlling impulse behaviours (impulse), emotional awareness (awareness), emotional clarity (clarity), assessing emotion regulation strategies (strategies) and engaging in goal oriented behaviour when emotionally aroused (goals). Internal consistency for Cronbach's alpha was .93 for the total scale and for DERS-A, .85, DERS-I, .89, DERS-A, .86, DERS-C, .80, DERS-S, .88, and DERS-G, .84</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes (pre, during and post biofeedback training)</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 39 items assessing five facets of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The FFMQ has been shown to have good internal consistency and significant relationships in the predicted directions with a variety of constructs related to mindfulness. The internal consistencies (Cronbach α) for these facets have been reported as 0.75 for FFMQ-NR, 0.83 for FFMQ-O, 0.87 for FFMQ-A, 0.91 for FFMQ-D, and 0.87 for FFMQ-NJ</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Becks Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes (pre, during and post biofeedback training)</time_frame>
    <description>A 21‐item self‐report scale that surveys common symptoms of depression on a 4‐point scale ranging from 0 to 3. Internal consistency of the BDI‐II was demonstrated to be good (Cronbach's α=.91; Beck, Steer, Ball et al., 1996) and the 1‐week test‐retest reliability was shown to be high.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Becks Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes (pre, during and post biofeedback training)</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 21 statements used to measure the severity of an individual's anxiety. When completing the BAI, individuals rate the severity of each symptom on a 4‐point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely—I could barely stand it). Good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=.92) and test‐retest reliability (r=.75).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Variance (HRV) biofeedback</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes per session</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate coherence scores were assessed using the IoM butterfly Grapher. The coherence score is based upon a composite score of 0-100%; 0 being no coherence, 100% being perfect coherence.</description>
