  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different manual therapy techniques and conservative therapy have been used separately for
      alleviation of pain and improvement of physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis
      (KOA). However, no study has reported the effect of combination of these treatment modalities
      in the management of KOA. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of end-range
      mobilization added to conservative therapy versus conservative therapy alone on decrease of
      pain and improvement of functional status in KOA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition affecting older people. It is
      characterized by pain and loss of physical function, which has a negative impact on patients'
      quality of life. The different international guidelines recommend several non-invasive
      treatment modalities for the management of KOA. Conservative therapy including land-based
      exercises, aquatic exercises, Transcutaneous Electro Neuro Stimulation (TENS) therapy and
      balneotherapy has been reported positively in the management of patients with KOA (1, 2).
      Manual therapy is also a preferred treatment modality with the aim of alleviation of pain,
      improvement of joint mobility and therefore the physical condition (1, 2). Out of manual
      therapy techniques, end-range mobilization is a well applied treatment technique in the
      management of different musculoskeletal conditions (3). Till date, the effect of end-range
      mobilization has not been investigated so far in knee OA.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of end-range mobilization
      added to conservative therapy versus conservative therapy alone on decrease of pain and
      improvement of functional status in KOA.
