  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label, single arm study in which ARQ-151 cream 0.3% is applied QD for
      2 weeks to adolescent subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis involving at least 10% body
      surface area (BSA) and adult subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis involving at least 20%
      BSA (excluding scalp).

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the exposure and characterize the plasma
      pharmacokinetic profile and to assess the safety and tolerability of ARQ-151 cream 0.3%
      administered once daily for 2 weeks to adolescent and adult subjects with chronic plaque
      psoriasis.
