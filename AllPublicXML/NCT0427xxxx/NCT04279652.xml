  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental
      disorder characterized by carelessness, hyperactivity and impulsivity, in which genetic,
      social and physical factors play an important role. Few studies have revealed the physical
      activity levels and importance of children with ADHD, but there is no consensus on the
      components of the physical activity program such as intensity, frequency, and severity. The
      aim of our study is to investigate the effect of combined exercise training on motor
      proficiency, physical fitness and cognitive status in children with ADHD.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of combined exercise training on motor
      proficiency, physical fitness and cognitive status in children with ADHD. Children will be
      randomly divided into 3 groups, for 8 weeks the first group will undergo a combined exercise
      training under the supervision of a physiotherapist, while the second group will receive a
      home exercise program. children included in the third group will form the control group.

      The following assessments will be applied at the beginning and end of treatment.

        1. Revised Conners Parent Rating Scale Short Turkish Form

        2. Powers and Challenges Survey

        3. Edinburgh Hand Preference Survey

        4. Ten meter walking test

        5. Two-minute walking test

        6. Bruininks-Oseretsky Motor Proficiency Test-2

        7. Muscle strength evaluation

        8. Munich Physical Fitness Test

        9. Dynamic Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment

       10. Open-ended evaluation questions

    <description>Motor proficiency will be evaluated The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency Second Edition (BOT™-2). t contains subtests and challenging game-like tasks and is very easy to administer. the score of this test ranges from 0 to 322. Higher score indicates better motor proficiency</description>

    <description>Individuals' physical fitness assessments will be made with the Munich Physical Fitness Test.
This test consists of six different parameters, including ball bounce, target hit, forward bend, vertical jump, hanging and step test. The time for individuals to carry out these tests will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Conners Parent Rating Scale consists of 27 items in total. In this scale, questions are answered on a 4-point Likert scale. &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;often&quot; and &quot;always&quot; options are; It is scored as &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. High scores from the scale show the intensity of symptoms specific to destructive disorders</description>

    <description>Strength and Difficulties Questionniare - (SDQ) &quot;contains 25 questions, some of which question positive and some negative behavior characteristics. Each sub-title can be evaluated within itself and a separate score can be obtained for each, as well as the sum of the first four titles and the&quot; Total Strength Score &quot;.</description>

    <measure>Hand dominance</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Edinburgh Hand Preference Questionnaire was developed to determine the hand preferences of the persons.The sum of the right and left hand scores gives &quot;Cumulative Total (TC)&quot; and subtracting the left hand score from the right hand score gives &quot;Difference score (F)&quot;. The result score is obtained by dividing the difference score by the cumulative total score and multiplying it by the face. Result score; It can be interpreted that if the person is less than 40, the person is left dominant, and between -40 and 40, each bilateral dominant, and if greater than 40, the person is right dominant.</description>

    <time_frame>4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>2-minute walking test will be used to determine walking endurance. In this test, a distance of 50 feet (15.2 meters) in length is determined first. The evaluator marks each 10 foot long distance with markers, leaving a cone at the beginning and end of the total distance.</description>
