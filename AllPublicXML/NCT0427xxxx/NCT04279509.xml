  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre study based on the Simon 2-stage optimax design: 12 patients will be
      enrolled initially (Stage I), which will then be expanded to a further 13 patients (Stage II)
      if 3 or more patients enrolled in stage I of the study achieve an objective response with the
      chemotherapeutic agent selected by the drug screen assay. A total of 25 patients will be
      included in both stages of study.

      Patients enrolled on study will undergo a fresh biopsy of tumour lesion to obtain cells that
      will be used to generate patient-derived tumour organoids based on the Invitrocue technology.
      Organoids will then be subjected to a 10-drug panel screening including: 5-fluorouracil,
      carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin,
      paclitaxel and vinorelbine. A further 5 drugs (etoposide, ifosfamide, methotrexate,
      pemetrexed and topotecan) will be screened if sufficient organoids are grown from the biopsy
      samples within the screening period.

      Physicians will be informed of the results, and choice of chemotherapy will be based on an
      IRS score of 70% or above. If more than 1 candidate drug with IRS of 70% or above is
      identified, the physician will exercise his/her discretion to select the most suitable drug
      based on patient's comorbidities and organ function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that high-throughput screening on patient-derived tumour organoids
      can be used as an adjunct tool to aid treatment selection in patients with cancer. Using the
      IRS, drugs with high IRS (defined as a score of 70% and above) will have a high probability
      of inducing objective response (either a complete or partial response by RECIST criteria) in
      patients with refractory cancers. Conversely, IRS of drugs for which the patients have been
      treated and experienced clinical progression on will be low (defined as a score of 50% or
      below).

      Primary Objectives

      -To prospectively determine if a high-throughput drug screen assay using patient
      tumour-derived organoids can accurately select a chemotherapeutic agent that results in
      objective response in patients with refractory solid tumours

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the IRS measured on tumour-derived organoid drug screen assay of
           chemotherapeutic agents to which patients had previously progressed on clinically

        -  To assess changes in IRS pre and post-chemotherapy treatment
