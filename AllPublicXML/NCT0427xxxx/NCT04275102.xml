    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of three times weekly symptom reporting by guardians
      and children using the SPARK platform for 12 weeks. SPARK is a web-based application that
      promotes symptom screening for children receiving cancer therapies and enables access to
      clinical practice guidelines for symptom management. Newly diagnosed and relapsed patients
      with cancer will be enrolled within 28 days after treatment initiation. Guardians, children
      or both will be prompted to complete symptom screening three times weekly via SPARK with
      corresponding feedback sent to their healthcare providers with each completed assessment.
      Symptom reports will contain links to clinical practice guidelines for symptom management.
      Active intervention will last for 12 weeks starting from the date of enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to determine the feasibility of three times weekly symptom reporting by
      guardians and children using the SPARK platform for 12 weeks. Feasibility will be evaluated
      by compliance with symptom screening and the investigators anticipate that at least 75% can
      achieve compliance with at least 60% of symptom evaluations.

      Newly diagnosed and relapsed patients with cancer 4-18 years of age will be enrolled within
      28 days after treatment initiation. Guardians, children or both will be prompted to complete
      symptom screening three times weekly via SPARK with corresponding feedback sent to their
      healthcare providers with each completed assessment. Symptom reports will contain links to
      clinical practice guidelines for symptom management. Active intervention will last for 12
      weeks starting from the date of enrollment.

      Guardian or patient-reported outcomes will be obtained at baseline, and weeks 4, 8 and 12.
      These outcomes will include the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi),
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue scale, Faces Pain
      Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Acute Cancer
      Module. Data from health records will be abstracted for all enrolled participants to evaluate
      symptom documentation and intervention provision at times symptom screening is completed as
      well as emergency room visits, clinic visits and hospitalizations.

      Analyses are descriptive. The investigators' primary outcome is feasibility, sample size
      justification will focus on having sufficient number of guardians and children to optimize
      study processes and to describe the number of completed symptom assessments. The
      investigators will enroll up to 20-30 guardians and children for each proxy/SSPedi (8-18
      years) and proxy/mini-SSPedi (4-7 years) and anticipate the investigators can enroll this
      number over one year. The 95% confidence intervals assuming 60% compliance will be 36-81% and
      41-77% for 20 and 30 participants respectively; this precision is adequate for our purposes.

    <description>The primary endpoint is feasibility, defined as at least 75% achieving compliance with at least 60% of symptom evaluations among guardian and self-report populations separately.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total SSPedi symptom or Mini -SSPedi symptom scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Total SSPedi symptom or Mini-SSPedi score, which is the sum of each of the 15 SSPedi item's Likert scores, resulting in a total score that ranges from 0 (no bothersome symptoms) to 60 (worst bothersome symptoms). The recall period is yesterday or today (SSPedi) or today (mini-SSPedi).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale. The minimum value on the self-report version is 25 and maximum value is 125. The minimum value on the proxy version is 23 and maximum value is 115. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Acute Cancer Module. The minimum value on the scale is 0 and maximum value is 100. PedsQL uses reverse scoring thus a higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Pain as measured by FPS-R</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FPS-R consists of a series of horizontal faces that depict a neutral facial expression of &quot;no pain&quot; at the left and &quot;most pain possible&quot; expression at the right.</description>
