    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators seek for a better way to identify the potential pathologic
      complete response (pCR) patients form non-pCR patients with locally advanced rectal cancer
      (LARC), based on their post-neoadjuvant treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.

      Previously, a post neoadjuvant treatment MRI based radiomics AI model had been constructed
      and trained. The predictive power of this artificial intelligence system and expert
      radiologist to identify pCR patients from non-pCR LARC patients will be compared in this
      randomized controlled, prospective, multicenter, observational clinical study.

      This is a randomized controlled, multicenter, prospective, observational clinical study for
      seeking out a better way to predict the pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with
      locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) based on the post- neoadjuvant treatment Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Patients who have been pathologically diagnosed as rectal
      adenocarcinoma and defined as clinical II-III staging without distant metastasis will be
      enrolled from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Sir Run Run Shaw
      Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College. All participants
      should follow a standard treatment protocol, including neoadjuvant treatment, total
      mesorectum excision (TME) surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with LARC who received
      neoadjuvant treatment will be randomly assigned into two arms, and their post-neoadjuvant
      treatment MRI images will be used to predict their pathologic response (pCR vs. non-pCR).
      Patients in arm A assign to the artificial intelligence prediction system. While in group B,
      the patients assign to the expert radiologist prediction. The pathologist will provide the
      final pathology report of TME surgery specimen (pCR or non-pCR) as a standard. The predictive
      efficacy of these two arms will be compared in this randomized controlled, multicenter
      clinical study among patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

    <description>Previously, the post-neoadjuvant treatment MRI radiomics based AI prediction model had been constructed, optimized and fixed at a training set, which recruited neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy treated LARC patients from different hospitals. The tumor region of interest (ROI) within the MRI images were manually outlined for radiomics features extraction and model construction. In this study, the tumor ROI in the post- neoadjuvant treatment MRI images will be manually delineated in the same way, and further subjected to the AI prediction system arm to verify the predictive accuracy of this AI prediction system in identifying the pCR individuals from non-pCR patients with LARC.</description>

    <description>In this arm, prior to this prospective study, the expert radiologists would receive a critical training to discriminate the pCR patients from non-pCR individuals by reviewing a huge amount of pCR and non-pCR patient's post-neoadjuvant treatment MRI. In this study, a group of patients will be assigned to the trained experienced radiologists arm to validate their predictive accuracy in identifying the pCR individuals from non-pCR patients with LARC.</description>
