  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label whole-body PET/CT study for investigating the value of 68Ga NEB PET
      imaging in the diagnosis and evaluation of lymphatic disorders including lymphedema,
      lymphangioma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, plastic bronchitis, lymphadenopathy caused by
      rheumatoid arthritis, etc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No fasting, hydration or other specific preparation was requested on the day of imaging.

      Patients for lymphatic drainage disorders imaging underwent whole-body PET/CT acquisitions
      20-40 min after subcutaneously injected into first and second interdigital spaces of both
      feet or hands of 74-111 MBq (2-3 mCi) 68Ga-NEB with each bed position lasted for 2 min.

      A MIM workstation was used for post-processing. The visual method was used to evaluate the
      lymphatic system, including the morphology and the distribution of the lymphatic system.
      Semiquantitative methods were applied for image analysis.
