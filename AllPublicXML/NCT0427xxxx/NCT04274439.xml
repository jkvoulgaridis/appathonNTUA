    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to develop and test the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of an internet-based self-management program based on pain education and
      exercise for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a major burden on the individual and society. It is estimated that about one
      third of the adult population worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with higher prevalence
      rates reported for low-income countries. Internet-based self-management programs have grown
      with the development of new technologies and have been extensively used for delivering
      healthcare in many areas. However, there is still little research on the development and
      testing of remotely-delivered programs for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain,
      especially in low and mid-income countries. The aim of this clinical trial is to develop and
      test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an internet-based self-management program
      based on pain education and exercise for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

    <description>Patients allocated to the intervention group will receive a login and password for individual access to the website designed for the study. The content of this intervention will include videos and animations based on pain education, physical activity promotion and general exercises. The pain education component will be based on the E-pain intervention developed by Reis et al (2017), which includes nine main features: (1) acceptance, (2 and 3) education about pain, (4) sleep hygiene, (5) recognizing stress and negative emotions, (6) increasing positive coping in lifestyle, (7) exercises, (8) communication and (9) relapse prevention. The exercise component will include general exercises aiming to improve strength, flexibility, control and coordination.
Patients in this group will also receive weekly text messages and a health coaching over the telephone. The text messages will include information on the benefits of exercises, motivation, and positive messages about dealing with pain.</description>

    <description>Telerehabilitation is defined as providing techniques for therapeutic rehabilitation remotely or off-site using telecommunication technologies. Thus, our intervention will be based on the use of a website created and registered especially for the study that will have the shooting of 1 video of pain education and 1 video of exercises for the subjects of the study, totaling 8 videos of pain education and 8 exercise videos. We will provide complimentary materials along with the triggered videos and a booklet of chronic pain information. We will also make weekly calls for a health coaching service and the sending of smartphone messages for the motivation and accountability of the subjects.</description>
