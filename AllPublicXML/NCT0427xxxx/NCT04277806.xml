      The investigators plan to use a new process to shorten the time of attaining full oral
      feeding in preterm infants less than 30 weeks gestational age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the neonatal intensive care unit, the attention of oral feeding of premature infants is
      far less than that of mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and other medical treatment, the
      use of parenteral nutrition, etc., and it is often not until the premature infants are enough
      mature and stable, or even before discharge that the caregivers pay attention to the problem
      of oral feeding. At this time, the corrected gestational age of premature infants is almost
      36 weeks, but in fact the study shows that preterm infants have the ability of self feeding
      when they are about 32 weeks old. And oral feeding is very helpful to improve their
      nutritional status, reduce the use of parenteral nutrition and other forms of enteral
      nutrition, prevent complications and shorten the length of stay. Therefore, this study plans
      to use a new process to promote oral feeding and to verify whether it is feasible to earlier
      attainment of full oral feeding in premature infants.

    <description>From the beginning of 32 weeks, try oral feeding once a day, suck pacifier for 10 minutes before feeding. When she/he can finish 50% of the amount of one meal in consecutive two days, and there is no adverse events happened, then we will try oral feeding twice a day. In the same way, in the oral feeding she/he can finish 50% of this meal in consecutive two days, there is no adverse events happened, then we will try three oral feedings three times a day. We wil continue the process until the infant can be fully oral fed by herself/himself.</description>
