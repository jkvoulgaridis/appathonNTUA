  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasingly, patients are keen to record aspects of their medical care, especially in
      obstetrics and paediatrics. The knowledge of patients and staff in relation to this area is
      thought to be variable. In addition, the attitudes of patients and staff regarding this
      practice has not been well studied. This study aims to gather information on patients' use of
      recording devices to capture audio recordings, photographs or videos. Furthermore it aims to
      assess patient and staff knowledge and attitudes in relation to this area.

      This study will involve patients who have recently delivered a baby on the maternity unit or
      obstetric theatre completing a questionnaire. They will be approached by a study investigator
      and the study explained. They will then complete a consent form if they are happy to proceed.
      Following this they will complete the questionnaire.

      It will also involve the surveying of staff, who will be approached by a study investigator
      when not directly involved in the clinical care of patients. They will also complete a
      consent form if they are happy to proceed and then complete the questionnaire.

    <measure>Knowledge and attitudes of both patients and staff towards the recording by patients/relatives/friends within the maternity unit and obstetric theatre environment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional design: Participants are expected to be in the study for 15 minutes approx.</time_frame>
    <description>Staff and patients will be asked to complete an unvalidated questionnaire titled &quot;Recording by patients and relatives/friends in the maternity unit&quot;, which is expected to take 10-15 minutes to complete. Please note that one questionnaire has been adapted for patients and another one for staff. Both contain 4 sections. The sections in the patients' questionnaire are: Background, Your experience of recording, Guidelines on recording and Your opinions regarding recording. The sections in the staff's questionnaire are: Background, Your experience of recording, Knowledge and Attitudes.
Data will be presented using descriptive statistics: Number (%) Â± 95% CI for nominal data and median (IQR [range]) for ordinal data as appropriate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Group differences between the knowledge and attitudes of patients and staff regarding what is acceptable to record and appropriate uses of recordings.</measure>
    <time_frame>Data analysis will be completed and reported within an average of one year.</time_frame>
    <description>Analytic statistics will be performed to compare differences in the results of the unvalidated questionnaire between the two groups (patients and staff) using the chi-squared/Fisher's exact test for nominal data and Mann-Whitney U-test for ordinal data, taking p &lt; 0.05 to denote statistical significance.</description>

    <description>The participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their knowledge of, and attitudes towards the recording of patient care by patients or relatives/friends in the maternity unit. An investigator will be immediately available to facilitate completion of the survey and assist with understanding of the questions. The data recorded will be a mixture of nominal data (selections from a number of options using a tickbox) or ordinal (as above, but graded e.g. yes / yes with qualifiers / no). Free text will be coded and presented as nominal data or presented verbatim to illustrate points that arise.</description>
