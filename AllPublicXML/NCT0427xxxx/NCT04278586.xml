  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-site RCT designed to compare M-ROCC with GBOT on the primary outcome of
      number of biochemically confirmed opioid negative abstinent periods (two-week periods of
      opioid abstinence during 24 weeks of treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a multi-site randomized comparative effectiveness trial
      comparing Mindful Recovery Opioid Care Continuum (M-ROCC), a 24-week
      motivationally-responsive, trauma-sensitive, Group-Based Opioid Treatment (GBOT) program to
      standard GBOT, on number of biochemically confirmed opioid negative abstinent periods during
      24-weeks of primary care buprenorphine treatment.

      Clinical secondary outcomes include number of biochemically-confirmed substance negative
      abstinent periods (twelve two-week periods of abstinence from all substances not including
      marijuana and tobacco during 24 weeks of treatment) and level of anxiety measured by the
      PROMIS-SF Anxiety 8a. Other secondary outcomes will be level of anxiety measured by Beck
      anxiety inventory, treatment retention, as well as mechanisms of self-regulation assessed by
      self-report and behavioral measures (emotion regulation, cognitive control, interoception,
      and self-compassion) and their mediating effects on anxiety and opioid abstinence. Finally,
      exploratory outcomes of stigma, interpersonal conflict, shared identity within group, and
      GBOT implementation factors including site data, additional psychopharmacology, and adverse
      events will be measured.

    <measure>Pain Interference PROMIS (PROMIS-PISF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Pain Interference instruments measure the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. Pain Interference also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life, though the item bank only contains one sleep item. The Pain Interference short form is universal rather than disease-specific. It assesses pain interference over the past seven days. each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five (for pediatrics and parent proxy it is 0 to 4). To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For example, for the adult 6-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 6; the highest possible raw score is 30. A higher PROMIS T-score represents higher consequences of pain.</description>

    <description>The current standard of care for OUD treatment at CHA involves intake assessment by an office-based addiction treatment nurse care manager, then an intake with a buprenorphine prescriber. Once started on buprenorphine in primary care or outpatient addictions services, then patients are encouraged to participate in a GBOT group for 3-24 weeks, but often GBOT will continue for years as the patient draws support from the ongoing group. If the patient is not a good fit for group or is struggling with maintaining abstinence in primary care, then referral for psychotherapist-led GBOT or individual psychotherapy might be considered when staff are available. At CHA, GBOT represents the standard of care and first line at both primary care centers. This study would integrate into the current standard of care by adding a mindfulness curriculum as the educational focus within the group-based opioid treatment model.</description>
