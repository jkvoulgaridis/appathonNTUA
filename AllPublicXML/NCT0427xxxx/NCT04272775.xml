    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      ixazomib alone or in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), and antitumor
      activity of ixazomib in participants with RRMM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. This study will evaluate the
      tolerability, safety, and PK of ixazomib administered alone or in combination with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple
      myeloma.

      This study will enroll approximately 24 participants (3 to 6 participants in each
      dose-escalation cohort). Participants will be assigned to receive treatment in one of the
      four treatment cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Ixazomib 4.0 mg

        -  Cohort 2: Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

        -  Cohort 3: Ixazomib 5.5 mg

        -  Cohort 4: Ixazomib 5.5 mg + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 7 years. Participants will make a final visit 29 days after receiving
      their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
