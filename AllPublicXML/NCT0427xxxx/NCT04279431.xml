  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to validate the clinical outcome in patients with closed head
      injuries (GCS 14-15, ages 18-85) who are being evaluated for head trauma, integrating the
      BrainScope One structural injury classifier (SIC) algorithm, with focus on SIC negative
      classification. In addition, to assess functional impairment (concussion) in these patients,
      results from Brain Function Index (BFI) or Concussion Index (CI) algorithms will be used for
      analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BrainScope One incorporates brain electrical activity (EEG, a proven electrophysiological
      core technology) and other multimodal assessment capabilities in a portable, point-of-care,
      non-invasive device containing algorithms designed to improve early identification, staging,
      and optimization of treatment for head injured patients (GCS 13-15) who are suspected of a
      brain injury. Structural Injury Classifier (SIC) provides objective results that indicate the
      likelihood of a structural brain injury being present, potentially visible on CT Scan. Brain
      Function Index (BFI) provides an objective measurement to determine the likelihood and
      severity of brain function impairment such as that seen in concussion/mTBI. The BFI is
      presented as a percentile compared to a normal corresponding population. Lastly, the
      Concussion Index (CI) was derived in the most recent BrainScope concussion assessment
      clinical study, and it is defined as a multivariate, multimodal index to assess the presence
      and severity of concussion and has been demonstrated to reliably reflect change over time.

      The present study population targets those patients who sustained a head injury, have high
      GCS scores (14-15) and present mild symptoms, for whom the suspicion of structural brain
      injury is therefore low. Having a rapid, reliable, and sensitive assessment tool to aid in
      the triage of patients who are suspected of a traumatically induced structural brain injury
      could aid in appropriate and timely diagnosis and subsequent medical care. It may also result
      in more appropriate utilization of medical imaging (potentially having associated health
      risks) and reductions in hospitalizations. Patients discharged from the ED who were deemed to
      not require a CT scan will be followed-up for outcome.

        An estimated total of 660 patients (with target of 330 SIC negative patients) who are
        suspected of a traumatic, closed head injury within 3 days of injury, will be recruited
        from patients who enter the participating Hospital ED's as clinical sites for this study.
        Potential study subjects will be identified by the research staff based on the stated
        inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine their eligibility. Once identified, the
        research staff will recruit the subject for the study through an informed consent process.
        Participation in the study will not interfere with standard of care at the clinical sites.
