      The aim of the present study is compare the frequently used pain and disability assessment
      questionnaires before and after 5 sessions of standard treatment for patients admitted to the
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation outpatient clinic for plantar fasciitis and who were
      queued to receive extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) treatment.

      The study was designed as prospective observational research. Between December 2019 and May
      2020, 90 patients who were admitted to the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation outpatient
      clinic for ESWT were planned to be included in the study. Pre-treatment pain values of
      patients with 3 different examination methods (visual analog scale, numerical pain scale and
      heel sensitivity index), 3 different disability index Foot function index, Foot and Ankle
      Outcome Score, The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Score
      will be used.

      These methods will be evaluated before and after ESWT treatment and the responsiveness and
      minimal clinically important difference of the questionnaires will be compared.

    <measure>Foot Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>A Foot Function Index was developed in 1991 to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. It is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales. Both total and sub-scale scores are produced. The patient has to score each question on a scale from 0 (no pain or difficulty) to 10 (worst pain imaginable or so difficult it requires help), that best describes their foot over the past week. Higher scores show higher disability and worst outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot and Ankle Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score is an adaption of Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score that assesses patient pain (9 items), other symptoms (7 items), function in daily living (17 items), function in sport and recreation (5 items), and foot/ankle related quality of life (4 items). Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating the worst possible foot/ankle symptoms and 100 indicating no foot/ankle symptoms.</description>

    <measure>American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire includes nine items that can be divided into three subscales (pain, function and alignment). Each of the nine items is scored, accumulating to a total score ranging from 0 points (indicating severe pain and impairment) to 100 points (no symptoms or impairment).</description>
