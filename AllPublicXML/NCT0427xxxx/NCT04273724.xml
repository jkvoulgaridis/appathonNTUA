  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a set of tests used to evaluate a patient's
      medical, social, and functional status, and can identify impairments in these domains that
      may not be noticed otherwise. Prior studies have shown that a CGA can accurately predict
      which patients are more likely to have serious side effects from cancer treatment. However,
      it is unknown whether interventions can be done to address the impairments found during a CGA
      in order to reduce the risk of these side effects. This pilot study will test the feasibility
      of targeted interventions for deficits identified during a CGA in patients 65 years or older
      with bladder cancer that have not yet started treatment.

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer that have not yet started
      systemic cancer treatment. The participants will complete a CGA and patient-reported outcome
      (PRO) measures at baseline. Based on any impairments found during the CGA, participants will
      be referred to specialists to help address these difficulties. Participants will complete the
      CGA and PRO measures again at 3 months and 1 year after the initial assessment. The goal of
      this study is to see if patients with advanced bladder cancer are interested in referrals to
      specialists to address their impairments, and whether participants attend those appointments.
