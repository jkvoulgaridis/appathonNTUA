      Clinical trial to demonstrate whether, in patients with moderate asthma, to treat with IC /
      LABA a medium dose, but not controlled, to achieve a similar degree of control by making a
      progressive increase of that treatment (CI / LABA a high dose) versus switching to
      fluticasone / Formoterol K-Haler at medium dose, under conditions of usual clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease that affects about 300 million people
      worldwide. Although knowledge about asthma and its treatment has improved over the past
      decade, morbidity and mortality remain considerable.

      Inhaled therapy is the treatment of choice in persistent asthma. Lower doses of drug are used
      that maximize the therapeutic effect and minimize side effects.

      Inhaled therapy is administered primarily through inhalers. The goal is to deliver the
      maximum amount of medication to your therapeutic target in the lungs → lung deposit Each
      inhaler offers a different lung deposit figure (data in ideal conditions). However, asthma
      control also depends on other factors (inhalation technique, adhesion, asthma severity, drug
      dose, etc.).

      The K-haler® inhaler device has obtained a high lung deposit (≈45% of the emitted dose) and
      an easy-to-use device.

      In general, the rest of the CI / LABA inhalers offer lower deposit figures. They are between
      ≈10-40% of the dose.

      Taking into account all that has been said in the introduction section, it has been decided
      to design this low-intervention clinical trial, to verify whether, those technical benefits
      of K-haler®, control asthma in a similar way using lower doses of IC .

      If these hypotheses were confirmed, it would allow for an effective therapeutic option in the
      control of asthma using a lower therapeutic dose, saving IC and a lower probability of
      producing side effects.

      Demonstrate whether, in patients with moderate asthma, to treat with IC / LABA a medium dose,
      but not controlled, to achieve a similar degree of control by making a progressive increase
      of that treatment (CI / LABA a high dose) versus switching to fluticasone / Formoterol
      K-Haler at medium dose, under conditions of usual clinical practice.
