    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label extension Study 3151-202-008 is to permit participants who
      previously completed or discontinued participation due to lack of efficacy after Week 10 in
      the double-blind Study 3151-201-008 to receive brazikumab, allowing for long-term observation
      of safety and efficacy in these participants treated with brazikumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Successfully completed or discontinued participation due to lack of efficacy after
             Week 10 in the lead-in Study 3151-201-008, and who have not been unblinded to study
             intervention in Study 3151-201-008.

          -  No prior history of active TB and meets all TB-related criteria.

          -  Agree to comply with contraceptive requirements for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any participant with an ongoing clinically significant unresolved AE from the lead-in
             study, that, in the investigator's or sponsor's opinion, would limit the participant's
             ability to participate in or complete the study.

          -  Current diagnosis of fulminant colitis, Crohn's disease or indeterminate colitis,
             presence of a fistula consistent with Crohn's disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis,
             celiac disease, or toxic megacolon.

          -  Any other condition or finding that, in the investigator's or sponsor's opinion, would
             either confound proper interpretation of the study or expose a participant to
             unacceptable risk.

          -  Participant meets criteria for discontinuation of study intervention during prior
             lead-in study.

          -  Participant requires additional immunosuppressive therapy (aside from permitted
             concomitant medication), biological treatment or prohibited treatment.

          -  Participant has received an investigational product after discontinuation from Study
             3151-201-008 and prior to enrolling in this study or participant is planning to
             receive an investigational drug (other than study intervention) or investigational
             device at any time during Study 3151-202-008.

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy during the study.

          -  Organ or cell-based transplantation (eg, islet cell transplantation or autologous stem

          -  Evidence of intestinal epithelial dysplasia on endoscopy and confirmed on biopsy.

          -  Any diagnosis of malignancy that requires discontinuation of study intervention from
             lead-in study or any new diagnosis of malignancy after completion of lead-in study.
