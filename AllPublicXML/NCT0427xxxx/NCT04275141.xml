  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mauriac syndrome (MS) is an entity of individuals combining poorly controlled diabetes
      mellitus type 1, short stature and glycogenic hepatopathy. Thus, the functional significance
      of Mauriac syndrome for glucose metabolism remains disputed, and whether genetic defects in
      glycogen metabolism contribute to glycogenic hepatopathy in MS remains to be
      clarified.Coupling the genetic analysis of targeted genes involved in glucose regulation with
      a dynamic exploration will eventually determine if a genetic abnormality leads to the disease
      and explains the nature of the phenotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of glucose homeostasis in MS, after an oral glucose load followed by exercise,
      using a quantitative measurement of the substrate flux. This dynamic in vivo kinetics can be
      explored using stable, nonradioactive tracers with the help of gas or liquid chromatography.

      Investigation of genetic factors associated with MS phenotype. Molecular analysis will be
      performed by next generation sequencing (exome or whole genome sequencing). In addition, a
      targeted analysis for pathogenic variants in genes implicated in homeostasis regulation will
      be done.
