  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a parent-only, group-based
      intervention intended to treat youth with chronic, unexplained medical symptoms such as (but
      not limited to) chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, headache, and abdominal pain. Prior to
      and following the intervention, the child and parent(s) will be asked to participate in a
      one-hour evaluation and complete several questionnaires about their well-being and
      functioning. The investigators predict that participation in this intervention will lead to
      change in relevant outcomes, including youth symptoms and functional impairment, and
      parenting stress and accommodation of symptoms. The investigators also predict that this
      group will be acceptable and feasible for parents.

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Attkisson &amp; Greenfield, 1996)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CSQ-8 is an 8-item self-report questionnaire that assesses satisfaction with (i.e., acceptability of) services received. Questions are rated on a response scale of 1(&quot;Quite dissatisfied&quot;) to 4(&quot;very satisfied&quot;). An overall score is calculated by summing the respondent's score for each scale item. Scores range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction with/acceptability of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Client Credibility Questionnaire (CCQ; Borkovec &amp; Nau, 1972)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st group session (1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>The CCQ will be used to assess parent expectancies about treatment. To do so, it will be administered to all parents at the end of the first intervention session, after the treatment rationale has been presented. Parents will be asked to make ratings using a scale of 0 to 2 (None, Some, A lot) about: (1) how logical the treatment seems; (2) how confident they are the treatment will be successful, and (3) how confident they would be in recommending the treatment to a friend.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Disability Inventory (FDI; Kashikar-Zuck et al., 2011)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The FDI is a 15-item rating scale that assesses functional disability (i.e., physical and psycho-social functional impairment) in children and adolescents with chronic pain and related conditions. The FDI has a parent form and a child/adolescent form. Items are rated on a scale of 0 (&quot;No trouble&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Impossible&quot;). Total scores range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater functional disability, categorized as No/Minimal (0-12), Moderate (13-29), and Severe (30) Disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL; Varni, Seid, &amp; Kurtin, 2001)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a modular, youth- and parent-report questionnaire assessing health-related quality of life in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales contain 23-items about quality of life in physical, emotional, social, and school domains. Response options are on a five-point scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;almost always&quot;). Items are summed and higher scores indicate higher well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Symptom Impact Questionnaire-Revised (SIQR; Bennett, Friend, Jones, Ward, Han, &amp; Ross, 2009)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SIQR is used to measure physical function, overall impact of the syndrome, and symptom severity in youth (self- and parent-report). Respondents are asked to rate items on scales such as &quot;no difficulty&quot; to &quot;very difficult&quot; (physical function), &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot; (impact of the syndrome), or &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;unbearable pain&quot; (example of symptom severity). Total scores range from 0 (indicating no symptom impact) to 100 (extreme symptom impact). A 14% change in scores has been empirically determined to represent minimal clinically significant difference following treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI; National Institutes of Mental Health, 1985)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a clinician-rated measure that assesses overall severity (CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I) of child symptoms following treatment. CGI-S scores range from 1 (&quot;normal, not at all ill&quot;) to 7 (&quot;extremely ill&quot;). CGI-I scores of 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) or 2 (&quot;much improved&quot;) indicate a positive treatment response; all other responses (3 &quot;minimally improved&quot; to 7 &quot;very much worse&quot;) are considered negative responses to treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED; Birmaher, Khetarpal, Brent, Cully, Balach, Kaufman, &amp; Neer, 1997)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SCARED is a 41-item self- and parent-report questionnaire assessing a range of anxiety symptoms. It is appropriate for children and adolescents ages 8-18. Items are rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not true or hardly ever true&quot;) to 2 (&quot;very true or often true&quot;). Items are summed and total scores above 25 indicate the likely presence of an anxiety disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Depression Inventory (CDI-2; Kovacs, 2011).</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDI-2 is a 28-item questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms. There are child- and parent- report versions. Respondents are asked to rate symptoms they have experienced (or observed, for parents) over the past two weeks. Each item contains 3 statements scored in order of increasing severity from 0 to 2. Higher total scores indicate greater depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is a parent-report questionnaire used for screening and assessing a wide range of emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents. It includes 113 items that contribute to three broad scales (internalizing, externalizing and general problems), eight specific syndrome scales (e.g., anxious/depressed, somatic complaints), and six DSM-oriented scales (e.g., Anxiety problems, Oppositional Defiant problems). The t-scores obtained are based on norms that are adapted for age and sex, and can fall into either normal, borderline, or clinical range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Accommodation Scale - Somatic Problems (FAS-SP; Lebowitz &amp; Gale, in preparation)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The FAS-SP is a questionnaire used to measure family accommodation of children's somatic symptoms. It is an adaptation of the Family Accommodation Scale- Anxiety (Lebowitz et al., 2019), which is a 13-item parent- and child-report scale that assesses family accommodation of child anxiety symptoms. The FAS-SP asks respondents to rate: (1) the frequency of parental accommodation, (2) the participation of parents in child's somatic symptoms, and (3) the changes that parents make in routines and schedules due to child's somatic symptoms. Items are rated on a 5-point response scale. Together, these items generate the total accommodation score, with higher scores indicating greater frequency and intensity of accommodation. One additional item assesses the degree of distress the accommodation causes the parents/child, and 4 additional items assess the short-term, negative consequences of not accommodating.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Stress Index, short-form (PSI-4-SF; Abidin, 2012)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of group (each group is 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI-4-SF is a 36-item parent-report scale that assesses three domains of parenting stress, including Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child, which combine to form a Total Stress scale. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;), with higher scores indicating more parenting stress.</description>
