      Spending time on intensive care can affect people in many different ways. Ability to move,
      walk, concentrate and remember events can all be affected. People may find their mood is
      altered and anxiety, stress and reduced confidence are common. These symptoms are frequently
      grouped together in a term called 'post intensive care syndrome'. Recovery often takes time
      and can be challenging.

      Returning to driving is an important milestone and can enable individuals to return to
      important activities such as work and hobbies. As a complex task, driving requires
      individuals to do many things at once which initially can be demanding. Currently there is
      limited guidance about driving after a period of time on intensive care.

      This study is being carried out to increase understanding of driving difficulties after a
      stay on intensive care and how successful and safe return to driving can be ensured. It is
      known that a stay on intensive care can have many effects on the body but currently the best
      advice to give to patients about returning to drive is unknown. The investigators would like
      to gather information on how many people do and do not return to driving and the reasons for
      this so people can be provided with more accurate information in the future. Additionally, it
      is important to find out if the driving assessment is practical and achievable for
      individuals who have had a stay on intensive care.

      Recovery from critical illness is often prolonged and challenging due to a combination of
      acquired physical, psychological and cognitive impairments, which have been termed Post
      Intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments are common, slow to recover and have
      cumulative effects on patients' personal, social and financial wellbeing. An increasing
      awareness and recognition of PICS has prompted commitments to enhance multidisciplinary
      aftercare with the overall goal of improving patient-centred outcomes and health-related
      quality of life.

      For many adult ICU survivors, resumption of driving is perceived as an important milestone in
      their recovery pathway. Driving is an advanced task reliant on complex physical and mental
      functioning. It also necessitates independence, self-confidence and motivation. As such
      clinicians may view the return to driving as an objective marker of recovery.

      Furthermore, returning to drive accelerates resumption of &quot;normal life&quot;, enablement of social
      interactions, hobbies, leisure activities, and most vitally, returning to work. This is not
      only because of its enabling effect on commuting to place of work. Approximately one million
      people in the UK are employed primarily as drivers, or are required to drive or operate
      motorised vehicles as part of their job. Thus driving after ICU is important for the UK
      economy as well as for patients' wellbeing and that of their loved ones. Reducing avoidable
      delay to driving ought therefore to be viewed as a low-cost high-impact intervention to
      enhance health-related quality of life.
