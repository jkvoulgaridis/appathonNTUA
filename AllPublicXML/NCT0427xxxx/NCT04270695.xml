  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transverse abdominis (TrA) is the deepest muscle layer of lateral and anterior abdominal
      wall and also known as a significant component of core stability. Abdominal draw-in maneuver
      (ADIM) is the main for the strengthening of the deep muscle, however, sufficient activation
      of TrA by ADIM is limited. Blood flow restriction (BFR) training is a technique combined with
      low intensity exercise that produces similar results to high intensity training. However,
      there is few evidences for BFR training on core muscles.

      Healthy adults (age ranged 18-34 years and BMI between 18.5~24.99) were randomly recruited in
      the study. For the intervention group, an inflatable cuff (14 cm in width * 84 cm in length)
      is warped around abdominal muscles below ribs which may cause to at least 60% restriction of
      blood flow detected by Power Doppler ultrasonography. All participants are instructed to
      perform ADIM both condition of BFR and BFR-free twice a week, for six weeks. Outcome
      measurements include Double leg lowering test (DLLT) for muscle strength, brightness mode
      ultrasound (USD) for muscle hypertrophy and electromyography (EMG) muscle activation. The
      same physical therapist will do the measurement at first week, third week and the sixth week.

      This study expects to provide a new alternative way to improve the muscle activation,
      strength and activation of transverse abdominis in abdominal draw-in maneuver combined with
      blood flow restriction
