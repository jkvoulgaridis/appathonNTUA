      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with placebo in SSc
      patients. This study consists of a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed
      by a 24-week active drug treatment period.

    <description>Absolute change from pre-treatment observation period in skin sclerosis at week 24 of treatment in the double-blind phase, assessed by mRTSS. mRTSS ranging from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe skin thickening) across 17 different body parts. The total score is the sum of the individual skin scores for all these sites, and ranges from 0 to 51 units.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Fulfill the diagnostic criteria for systemic sclerosis defined in the 2016 edition of
             the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Systemic Sclerosis and have an mRTSS of 2
             (moderate) or higher for skin sclerosis

          2. Aged 20 or older and younger than 80 at the time of consent

          3. Have an expected survival of at least 6 months (and expected to allow 6 months of

               -  Not received antifibrotic agents (like nintedanib, pirfenidone, tocilizumab),
                  other investigational products, immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide,
                  mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, azathioprine, and mizoribine),
                  high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, or imatinib 4 weeks prior to the start of

             *: The patient will undergo echocardiography during the pre-treatment observation
             period to exclude pulmonary hypertension. The patient will be required to undergo
             examination by an expert (eg, at the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine) if
             systolic pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 35 mmHg.

          2. Have serious complications (eg, renal crisis) associated with systemic sclerosis
             (excluding interstitial pneumonia**)

             **: Patients with interstitial pneumonia will be excluded if the criterion 3) below is
             met.

          3. Have only poor respiratory reserve (%VC or %DLco, both calculated using the
             &quot;estimation equation more suitable for Japanese,&quot; is less than 60% or 40%,
             respectively)

          5. Have a positive result for any of the following: HBs antigen, HBs antibody, HBc
             antibody, and HCV antibody (this criterion does not apply to a positive test for
             hepatitis B clearly attributable to hepatitis vaccination)

          6. Have serious bacterial/fungal infections

          7. Have a serious liver disease (AST [GOT] or ALT[GPT] of â¥ 300 IU)

          9. Have severe heart disease

         10. Have active tuberculosis

         11. Have any known malignancy or a history of malignancy within the past 5 years

         12. Have a history of serious infections

         13. Have a history of serious hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions to any component
             of rituximab or to mouse proteins

         14. Pregnant, postpartum, and lactating women

         15. Refuse to practice contraception from the time of consent to at least 12 months after
             study completion

             difficult/inappropriate

         17. Received other investigational products within 12 weeks prior to the study treatment
             or are participating in other clinical research/studies

         18. Smoked within 12 weeks prior to the date of consent

         19. Is determined by the investigator (or sub-investigator) to be ineligible for the study
