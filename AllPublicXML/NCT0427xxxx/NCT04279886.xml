  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, three-dimensional scanning of the torso has been proposed as an alternative for
      two-view chest radiographies and computed tomography to determine the severity of pectus
      excavatum without exposure to ionizing radiation. The range of three-dimensional scanning
      systems is broad with even varying systems being used within hospitals. Most of these
      scanning systems have been validated for accuracy and reproducibility, no comparison between
      these systems is known. In addition, severity measures of pectus excavatum, as well as other
      research outcomes, surgical planning techniques, and analysis methods are based on a single
      imaging system. It is subsequently essential to determine whether different imaging systems
      can be used interchangeably regarding accuracy and reproducibility.

      The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and accuracy between three commonly
      used three-dimensional scanning systems.
