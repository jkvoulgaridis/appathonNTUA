  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether administration of levetiracetam (LEV), a
      commonly used anti-epileptic that alters neurotransmitter release, can reduce hippocampal
      hyperactivity. Specifically, we will utilize two functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      techniques: 1) blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) contrast will assess activity with a
      visual scene processing task that engages the anterior hippocampus and 2) arterial spin
      labeling (ASL) will assess baseline activity. This study will also assess whether patients
      have improvement in their symptoms after receiving LEV. Previous studies in people with
      psychotic disorders have shown that the hippocampus is hyperactive and more activity
      correlates with worsening of clinical symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this study is to use an
      intervention to further understand the underlying mechanisms of the hippocampus in psychosis.
