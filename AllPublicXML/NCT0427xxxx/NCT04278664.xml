    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that co-managing pregnant type 1 diabetics with telemedicine will have at
      least equivalent outcomes to those managed with standard care. Comparison of outcomes between
      pregnant type 1 diabetics being co-managed with telemedicine compared to those receiving
      conventional care will help us identify unanswered clinical questions and areas for
      improvement in regard to standards of care for pregnant type 1 diabetics. The data we
      generate from this analysis will help us determine whether telemedicine can be an effective
      additional means of care for pregnant type 1 diabetic patients.

      Few studies have researched the use of telemedicine in the management of type 1 diabetes
      during pregnancy. These studies are additionally limited due to number of patients as well as
      number of secondary outcomes reported. Therefore, this study will enroll 100 participants to
      reach a power of 81.8% with HbA1c as a primary outcome and secondary outcomes related to
      diabetic management such as frequency of hypoglycemia, antenatal hospital stay (percentage
      requiring admission, length of stay), miscarriage, cesarean section rates, induction of
      labor, fetal birth weight, gestational age at birth or preterm birth (&lt;34 weeks, &lt;37 weeks),
      frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal death, major and minor
      anomalies, and neonatal intensive care admission.

        Maternal glycemic control in Type I Diabetics during pregnancy will be studied by enrolling
        patients in two different groups: one will be treated with the current standard of care for
        a type 1 diabetic pregnancy and the other group will receive the same standard of care in
        addition to utilizing telemedicine communication of glucose and insulin readings during
        weeks when there are no recommended physician visits. All participants will be monitored
        throughout their pregnancy and clinical outcomes will be reviewed upon delivery and a
        6-week postpartum visit. This study is important in adding to current literature regarding
        the role of telemedicine in pregnant type 1 diabetic care as it could potentially lead to
        changes in the current standard care for pregnant type 1 diabetics.
