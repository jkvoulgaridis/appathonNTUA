      This is an open label, single institution, dose-escalation phase 1 study designed to assess
      the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of oxaliplatin administered via Pancreatic Retrograde
      Venous Infusion (PRVI) using Pressure Enabled Drug Delivery (PEDD) technology. Oxaliplatin
      PEDD-PRVI is administered with systemic FOLFIRI followed by FOLFIRINOX therapy for the
      treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment period consists of 6 cycles. Cycles 1 and 2 involve the regional administration
      of oxaliplatin via PEDD-PRVI with systemic FOLFIRI. During cycles 1 and 2, patients are
      evaluated on days 1, 2, 4, and 8. Cycles 3 through 6 include the systemic administration of
      standard of care FOLFIRINOX. During cycles 3 through 6, patients are evaluated on days 1 and
      8.
