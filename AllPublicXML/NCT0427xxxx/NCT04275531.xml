  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      for the last 20 years, the increasing reports from non-human studies have raised suspicion
      that general anesthetics may cause neurotoxic changes in the developing brain that lead to
      adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life.there are several case reports of
      reversible smell and taste dysfunction following exposure to general anesthesia suggesting a
      possible relationship between anesthetic agents and olfactory dysfunction.

      this study is to assess the possible neurotoxicity of sevoflurane,isoflurane,and propofol
      based anesthesia guided by olfactory changes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is found in neuronal synapses involving
      olfactory bulb. So, the involvement of common GABA pathway implies a possible interaction of
      general anesthetics with olfactory function.

      olfactory identification is an associative memory which is found to be facilitated by action
      of melatonin. involvement of GABA receptor in the transfer of light information from
      suprachiasmatic nuclei to pineal gland suggests possible interaction of melatonin and
      anesthetic agents.

      the aim of the study is to evaluate the possible neurotoxicity of sevoflurane,isoflurane,and
      propofol based anesthesia guided by olfactory changes

    <description>we will use (10 dilutions) of 4% n‑butyl alcohol. The odorant and a blank will be presented to the participant. The test will be progressed from weaker‑to‑stronger concentrations of odorant. Two bottles will be presented to each participant, an odorant bottle and an identical bottle filled with distilled water. The participant will sniff each one for 9 seconds and then will chose which one smelled stronger. If the participant is incorrect at one concentration, the next higher concentration will be presented. When the correct choice is made, the same concentration of odorant will be presented to the participant until four consecutive correct responses are given.</description>
