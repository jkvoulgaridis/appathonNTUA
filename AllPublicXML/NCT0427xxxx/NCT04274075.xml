  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, three-period, six-sequence crossover study of
      GDC-9545 administered to healthy females of non-childbearing potential to determine the
      relative bioavailability of the Phase 3 capsule formulation to the Phase 1 tablet formulation
      in the fasted state and the effect of food on the Phase 3 capsule formulation.
