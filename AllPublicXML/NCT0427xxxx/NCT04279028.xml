  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a novel behavioral treatment - Adapted
      Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (ACBT) - against standard Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). The
      goal of the study is to determine if ACBT confers improved outcomes for women with depression
      and low literacy. Depression is a serious women's health issue. According to the World Health
      Organization, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide with females reporting
      symptoms of depression at almost twice the rate of males. This study will provide pilot data
      to enable us to determine the effect size needed to detect a between-groups change in
      depression scores. The overall impact of this study will be empirical support for a novel
      form of treatment for women with depression, who also may lack adequate literacy,
      educational, or cognitive ability required to benefit from standard CBT.

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D): Post-treatment (defined as completing 12 sessions of therapy; this will occur an estimated 12-14 weeks after initial intake interview)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment which is within 2 weeks after final therapy session (i.e. estimated 12-14 weeks after initial intake interview)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is an interview-based assessment of the severity of depression. The post-treatment HAM-D will occur after the last (i.e., 12th) session of cognitive behavior therapy. This will occur an estimated 12-14 weeks after initial intake interview). The HAM-D at post-treatment will compared to baseline to measure the reduction in depression.
High scores mean a higher level of depression.
Scores on the HAM-D are based on 17 items and range from 0-52.</description>

    <description>The HAM-D is an interview-based assessment of the severity of depression. The 3-month follow-up will occur 3 months after the last (i.e., 12th) session of cognitive behavior therapy. The HAM-D at 3-month follow-up will compared to baseline to measure the reduction in depression.
High scores mean a higher level of depression.
Scores on the HAM-D are based on 17 items and range from 0-52.</description>

    <description>The 12-item WHODAS 2.0 is a measure of functional impairment. Higher scores indicate a higher level of impairment.
The scores for each item range from 0-4; the WHO scoring algorithm converts the summed score to a 0-100% score.
The post-treatment score will be compared to baseline to quantify reduction of impairment after treatment.</description>

    <description>ACBT is derived from traditional CBT principles, but eliminates the text-heavy requirements. Traditional CBT incorporates the use of complex worksheets and a lengthy workbook, whereas ACBT replaces these skill learning activities with simpler, straightforward exercises that are practiced in session along with the therapist. This &quot;real world&quot; practice eliminates the need for reading and writing as part of CBT while simultaneously recapitulating how the patient would actually implement CBT procedures. In session exercises will mirror that of standard CBT practices. For example, they could include lessons in goal setting, distinguishing situations, moods, and thoughts, and experiments to test underlying assumptions. Participants will be assigned paper-free homework assignments.</description>

    <description>CBT involves the therapist and client working to identify and change negative beliefs and thoughts, replacing them with more accurate and balanced thoughts. CBT for Depression will be conducted according to standard manuals and incorporate the use of a common workbook used within CBT sessions. As per standard practice, participants will be assigned worksheets from their workbook used both in session and as homework assignments.</description>
