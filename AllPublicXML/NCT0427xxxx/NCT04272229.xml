      Individuals with migraine have impaired cognitive function and worse autonomic function
      compared to individuals without migraine. Objective: To evaluate the autonomic function and
      cognition in young individuals with migraine compared to healthy individuals without
      migraine. Methods: Cross-sectional study will be carried out at University of Fortaleza with
      individuals with previous migraines diagnoses and healthy volunteers without migraines.
      Volunteers of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years, clinically diagnosed with migraine or
      not, who have not undergone any type of drug treatment for at least three months and who
      accept to participate in the research will be enrolled in the research. Individuals who have
      comorbidities such as hypertension and Diabetes mellitus (type I and II), respiratory,
      cardiac and/or chronic vascular diseases, have suffered any significant facial trauma, have a
      cognitive problem or dysfunction associated with cognition, or have suffered any episode of
      stroke or transient ischemic attack prior to conducting this research will not be enrolled.
      Participants will be assessed through cognitive tests, and autonomic function such as Neck
      Disability Index, Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire, Stroop Colo test, digit
      symbol substitution test, Addenbrooke's cognitive examination, mini-mental state examination,
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test A and B and reaction time test and by
      MindWave Mobile® devices and Polar V800®.

      The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for responding to stressful situations with
      involuntary actions, which will increase the neuronal activity in order to maintain body
      homeostasis. Stress is one of the most common causes of migraines. When it occurs for a
      prolonged period, there will be an over-stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system that
      will lead to dysautonomia, generating the rapid consumption of the neurotransmitter
      norepinephrine at the same time that adenosine, dopamine. It is believed that before the
      headache, the levels of norepinephrine are elevated, causing a vasoconstriction of
      extracranial vascularization, followed by a vasodilation resulting from the release of the
      other hormones previously mentioned, thus instituting the painful phase of migraine. Thus,
      migraine acts on the vascular system through changes in its homeostasis, predisposing the
      occurrence of future ischemic and/or hemorrhagic episodes to the brain and cardiac levels.
      The disruption of this system with the multifactorial mechanisms of migraine manifestation
      can then result in an increased risk of coronary heart disease and other changes in cardiac
      functioning, acquiring highly harmful potential for the human body. The interest in this
      study started in view of the numerous uncertainties within the scientific sphere regarding
      the possible systemic impacts caused by migraines after detailed research on the subject. The
      same becomes relevant, as it will contribute to the development of knowledge about headaches.
