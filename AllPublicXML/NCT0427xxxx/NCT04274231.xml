      We performed targeted-capture sequencing of 127 known and putative cancer-related genes of
      patients who best effect to TKIs ,or intolerance to TKIs,or resistance to TKIs by

    <description>TKI best effect was defined achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR)after 3 months of treatment and the level of BCR/ABL&lt;10% after 3 months of treatment,the level of BCR/ABL&lt;1% .</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>TKI resistance group</arm_group_label>
    <description>TKI resistance was defined as the lack of a complete hematologic response (CHR) after 3 months of TKI treatment, the lack of any cytogenetic response after 6 months of treatment, the lack of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (Ph-positive cells &gt; 35%) after 12 months of treatment, an increase of white blood cell (WBC) count in at least two consecutive samplings (with a doubling of the count from the nadir to ≥ 20×109/L or an absolute increase of ≥ 50×109/L), or a relapse after a CHR or MCyR.</description>
