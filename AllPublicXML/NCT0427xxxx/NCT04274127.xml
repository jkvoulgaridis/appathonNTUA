  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early screening for Autism Spectrum Disorder has been validated using different screening
      tools, in particular M-CHAT-R and ITC in different countries. Unfortunaltely, in France, they
      are not often used. Thus, medium age for diagnosis in France is late. Yet, early
      interventions has shown efficiency (grade B of HAS 2010 recommendations, HAS 2018) . The
      American have described an efficient method using partnership between pediatricians and
      autism specialists (Miller et al). Autism Spectrum Disorders concern 1% of population. The
      third Autism Plan in France then HAS 2018 Recommandations and The 2018 National Strategy for
      Autism have propose to implement three levels for early diagnostic : the frontline is
      constituted by professionals who can detect the firsts signs ( in nurseries, general
      practice, pediatric practice, early childhood centers), the second line is constituted by the
      proximity network of professionals who can diagnose &quot; simple &quot; autism ( CMP, CAMSP,
      neurologic pediatricians), the third line is constituted by expert teem in specialized
      hospital centers for neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic.

      This organization is, for now, not efficient. First lines professionals are not always formed
      to autism detection. When the screening is efficient, professionals have difficulties to
      address children to proximity teem trained to autism diagnostic because of delays or lack of
      professionals. The second line professionals are note always trained to use diagnostic tools
      and tend to address all the children to the third line, even when the diagnostic is not
      complex. The third lign is saturated by all these requests.

      The investigator propose to improve autism screening in our region of Rhône-Alpes basing on
      the detection in nursery, and by first line doctors in order to diagnose autism before 3 year
      of age. After screening, a specialized teem will realize a follow-up by phone to guide
      practitioners to a diagnostic teem in proximity. Early screening realized near family house
      is compulsory to facilitate accessibility and collaboration between professionals. Diagnostic
      should be realized in a three month delay, conform to the recommendations. Our project
      proposes to screen the general population of children who hasn't been screened yet for
      autism.
