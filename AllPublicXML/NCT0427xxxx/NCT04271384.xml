      Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carries up to 30% chance of relapse in 5 years.
      This a phase 2 study that aims to determine the pathological complete response of the
      combination of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) plus nivolumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The patients will receive standard SABR
      + nivolumab at a dose of 360 mg every 21 days for 3 doses. The patient will undergo surgery
      10 weeks after the last radiotherapy dose.

    <textblock>
      Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carries up to 30% chance of relapse in 5 years.
      Surgery is standard-of-care for this population. For patients who are not candidate for
      surgery, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is standard, with good local control but
      locoregional and distant failure. The use of preoperative SABR leads to a pathological
      complete response rate (pCR) of 60%. Anti-PD-1 has the ability to provoke a pCR in around 20%
      of patients as a single agent. Moreover, it has synergic activity with radiotherapy.

      This a phase 2 study that aims to determine the pathological complete response of the
      combination of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy plus nivolumab as neoadjuvant treatment in
      early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The patients will receive standard SABR, given either
      as 3, 5 or 8 fractions (depending on tumor size and location) + nivolumab at a dose of 360 mg
      every 21 days for 3 doses. The patient will undergo surgery 10 weeks after the last
      radiotherapy dose. We will measure translational biomarkers associated with either pCR or
      resistance to therapy.
