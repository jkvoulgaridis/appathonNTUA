  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab compared to
      panretinal photocoagulation laser (PRP) in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy
      (PDR). This evaluation will provide information that brolucizumab is non-inferior to PRP with
      respect to the change in best corrected visual acuity at Week 54.
