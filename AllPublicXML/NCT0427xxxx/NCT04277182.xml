  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental study will be carried out at Ege University Laboratory Animals Application
      and Research Center to identify the efficacy of 10% propolis and 15% propolis on wound
      healing in a second-degree superficial burn wound.

      In the study, 36 adult (8-12 week old) Wistar-Albino rats with a weight of 200-300 grams will
      be used in each group. Each group will include 6 rats. Stratified randomization will be used
      to randomize rats according to their gender and weight. After randomization, a burnt area
      will be created on the back of the rats and dressings will be made every day.

      Following the creation of the burn, biopsy samples will be taken on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and
      21st days and at the light microscopic level; bulla, erythema, oedema, burn depth,
      inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, ulceration, angiogenesis, neovascularization,
      fibroblast proliferation, collagenization, epithelization, fibrosis, the number of hair
      follicles and damage to the skin attachments.

      In the immunohistochemical examination of biopsy samples, samples will be taken for the
      evaluation of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase in the evaluation of the
      tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1β and oxidative stress in the EBB period in order
      to evaluate the acute phase reactants. Fungal and gram staining will be done in order to
      determine the pathogen reproduction in biopsy samples taken on the 3rd and 7th day. Masson
      trichrome in order to detect fibrosis in biopsy samples taken on the 14th and 21st day;
      Hydroxyproline examination will be examined in order to evaluate collagen formation.
