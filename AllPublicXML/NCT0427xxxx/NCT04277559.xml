      patient and classical music on postoperative anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety can be detected via structured and standardized screening by the
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) I and II. 225 patients scheduled for inguinal hernia
      surgery for any reason in the age range of 18-70 will be included in our study. Preoperative
      STAI I and II score (anxiety questionnaire) will be applied to each patient. The patients
      will be divided into three groups as preoperative patient preferential music, classical music
      and not played. The patient favorite music track and singer without limiting the kind of
      music or classical music will be played through the headphones. The STAI will be repeated at
      postoperative, the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and patient satisfaction will be measured at
      postoperative.

    <description>The quality of postoperative functional recovery will assess using the QoR-40, which assesses physical comfort (12 items), emotional state (9 items), physical independence (5 items), psychological support (7 items), and pain (7 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale: none of the time, some of the time, usually, most of the time, and all the time. The total score ranges from 40 (poorest quality of recovery) to 200 (the best quality of recovery). The QoR-40 will administer one day before surgery in outpatient clinics of anesthesiology, 6 hours after the surgery, and before discharge from hospital on the first postoperative day.</description>
