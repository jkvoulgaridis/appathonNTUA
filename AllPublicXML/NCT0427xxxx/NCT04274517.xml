  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The usage of splash basins in the setting of total knee arthroplasty and total hip
      arthroplasty presents a risk of contamination and subsequent periprosthetic joint infection.
      Previous studies have investigated the efficacy of multiple antimicrobial irrigants for
      preventing periprosthetic joint infection, but the results are varied.

      Despite several noteworthy studies on the appropriate usage of different antiseptic solutions
      in surgical splash basins, the current literature has several limitations. First, there are
      no head-to-head clinical trials comparing betadine and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) usage
      with relation to periprosthetic joint infection and splash basin contamination rates. Second,
      the in vitro studies directly cultured splash basin antiseptic solutions rather than
      culturing surgical instruments.

      The objective of this study is to compare the microbial contamination rate of total joint
      arthroplasty instruments that have been placed in surgical splash basins filled with either
      sterile water, 3.5% betadine, or 0.05% CHG. The overall purpose of the study is to
      investigate the efficacy of 0.05% CHG and determine if it is an appropriate solution to use
      in surgical splash basins for joint replacement surgeries.

      A prospective clinical trial will be conducted. Patients treated at the Keck Hospital of USC
      or USC Verdugo Hills Hospital for primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty will be
      screened for inclusion in our study. All primary surgeries will be performed according to the
      preferences of the operating surgeon. No deviations from standard surgical care will be made
      based on inclusion in this study. However, prior to surgery, patients who elect to
      participate will be randomized to one of three groups: (1) sterile water, (2) 3.5% betadine,
      or (3) 0.05% CHG.
