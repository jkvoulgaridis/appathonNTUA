      The test subjects were selected from patients with clinical manifestations in muscle tone and
      healthy volunteers. Target muscles includes elbow flexor, elbow extensor, plantar flexor and
      ankle dorsi flexor. Thirty patients and 10 healthy subjects were given three assessment
      methods to measure muscle tension: modified Ashworth rating scale, elastic ultrasound
      technology and surface electromyography, and the data obtained by these three methods will be
      statistically analyzed and discussed.
