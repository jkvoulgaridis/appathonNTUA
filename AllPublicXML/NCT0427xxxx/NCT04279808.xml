  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For safe central catheterization, clinicians must be aware of adequate dilator insertion
      depth not to directly dilate the venous wall. The purpose of the study is to find out
      adequate insertion depth of the dilator during central venous catheterization through the
      internal jugular vein with the aid of real-time ultrasonography.

    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is to compare the distance between the skin puncture site
      and the outside of anterior wall of the internal jugular vein measured by real-time
      ultrasonography with the conventional method which is routinely used in common clinical
      practice.

    <description>For soft tissue dilation just after guidewire insertion in central venous catheterization through the right internal jugular vein, investigators will measure the distance between the skin puncture site and outside of anterior wall of the vein with real-time ultrasonography in the measured depth group. Next, practitioner will insert the dilator by the measured length and continue to insert the central venous catheter. For the conventional group as a control group, practitioner will perform the central venous catheterization with a manner used routinely by the practitioner.</description>
