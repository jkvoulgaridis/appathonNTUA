  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of social cognition, and empathy more specifically, are at the heart of
      schizophrenic pathology in that they are strongly linked to the social handicap of patients.
      It is therefore necessary to refine our knowledge of the cognitive and affective processes
      behind this empathic disorder and to identify objective and easily measurable markers
      (related to brain functioning collected by electroencephalography) of these processes with
      the subsequent aim of improving their management. It is also relevant to question the
      trait/status nature of these empathic disorders by studying these markers in individuals
      presenting more or less marked schizotypic traits and therefore more or less at risk of
      developing schizophrenia. Studying the possibility that empathy disorders may be part of the
      factors of developmental vulnerability for schizophrenia and identifying objective markers of
      this vulnerability could allow, in case of development of the pathology, a more rapid
      diagnosis and a more effective management.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Common to all: good command of the French language, right-handed.

          -  Specific to patients: diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, clinical
             state stabilized according to the treating psychiatrist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Common to all: having suffered a head injury with loss of consciousness lasting more

             presenting an addiction to a toxic substance (excluding tobacco), presenting a mental
             retardation or neurological disorder (verified by a pre-recruitment interview and the
             administration of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for control
             subjects and on the basis of the information in the medical file for patients).

             previous month, currently hospitalized.

          -  Specific to controls: taking a psychoactive drug, having a mental disorder, being
