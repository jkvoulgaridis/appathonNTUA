    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial in
      Chinese population with stable angina pectoris. The purpose is to determine the efficacy and
      safety of Xueshuanxinmaining tablet in the treatment of stable angina pectoris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xueshuanxinmaining tablet is a Chinese patent medicine composed of Ligusticum chuanxiong,
      Salvia miltiorrhiza, borneol and Toad puff, etc. It has been widely used in cardiovascular
      diseases in China. Clinical application suggested that Xueshuanxinmaining tablet was safe and
      effective in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. However, it still needs to be further
      confirmed by high-quality, large sample randomized controlled trials. This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of
      Xueshuanxinmaining tablet in the treatment of stable angina pectoris.
