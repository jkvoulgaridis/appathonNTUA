      primary schools and local food producers evaluating two interventions designed to improve
      primary school children's knowledge of and interest in food and where it comes from, with the
      ultimate aim of driving improvement in health, well-being and educational status.

      Project Daire is a randomised-controlled factorial design trial working in partnership with
      primary schools and local food producers evaluating two interventions designed to improve
      primary school children's knowledge of and interest in food and where it comes from, with the
      ultimate aim of driving improvement in health, well-being and educational status. Key Stage 1
      and 2 pupils will be recruited from 15 primary schools in the North West of Northern Ireland
      and will be randomised to one of four intervention arms: i) 'Engage', ii) 'Nourish', iii)
      'Engage' and 'Nourish' and iv) Delayed of duration up to 6 months. Study outcomes include
      food knowledge, attitudes, trust, diet, behaviour, health and wellbeing and will be collected
      at baseline and six months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in KIDSCREEN-10 score at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Validated well-being questionnaire for children. Completed by KS1 and KS2 pupils.This is an 11-item instrument answered on a 5-point scale and results in one global HRQoL score. Most of the items are formulated positively and in concordance with the scoring, which means a higher score reflects a higher HRQoL. However, some items are formulated negatively and as a consequence the scoring has to be recoded. The scoring method results in T-values with scale means around 50 and standard deviations around 10 with higher values indicating higher HRQoL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire score at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Validated brief behavioural screening questionnaire. Completed by teachers. This 25-item instrument incorporates 5 scales of 5 items, with each item answered on a 3 point scale. All scales represent a negative trait, with the exception of the ProSocial Scale which indicates a positive trait. For each of the 5 scales the score can range from 0 to 10 if all items were completed. A Total Difficulties score is the final score and indicates poorer behaviour. Therefore the lower the score, the better the outcome in terms of behaviour.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24 Hour Dietary Record</measure>
