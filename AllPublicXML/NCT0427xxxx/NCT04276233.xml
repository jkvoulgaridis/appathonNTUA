  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa) that blocks interleukin-5 (IL-5)
      thus inhibits production and survival of eosinophils. The aim of this phase 4, open-label,
      single-arm study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mepolizumab 100 mg SC administered
      every 4 weeks in Indian subjects aged 18 years or above with severe eosinophilic asthma
      requiring oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment to maintain asthma control. The study consists
      of four phases, OCS Optimization Phase (Week -8 to Week -3), an Induction Phase (Week 0 to
      Week 4), OCS Reduction Phase (Week 4 to Week 20) followed by Maintenance Phase (Week 20 to
      Week 24). In the Induction Phase subjects will be administered mepolizumab 100 mg
      subcutaneously every 4 weeks along with their Baseline asthma medications. This phase will
      allow sufficient time for subjects to achieve a decrease in the eosinophilic inflammation
      prior to the reduction in OCS. During the Optimization Phase, the investigator will adjust
      the OCS (prednisone/prednisolone) dose according to the Optimization titration schedule based
      on a review of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 score and exacerbation. During the
      Reduction Phase, subjects will continue to receive 100 mg mepolizumab every 4 weeks and the
      OCS dose reduction will be done every 4 weeks using the reduction titration schedule based on
      a review of eDiary parameters recorded by the subject, the subjects' exacerbation history,
      and a review of the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. In the Maintenance Phase,
      subjects will be maintained during the last 4-weeks of the study without any further OCS dose
      adjustment.
