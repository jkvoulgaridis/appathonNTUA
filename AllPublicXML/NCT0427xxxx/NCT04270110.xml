      This study aims to recognize the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism on bone mineral
      density, Not many studies were done on this subject

      A lot of different factors are necessary for the harmonious development as well as normal
      functioning of skeleton: genetic conditions, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis, balanced
      diet, mechanical load. Any disturbances of those agents can lead to serious and dangerous
      consequences like length reduction, deformations, and fractures. Their results depend,
      between other, on one's age, type of disorder and its duration.

        -  There are a lot of endocrinological reasons of secondary osteoporosis (for example:
           Cushing's syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, hypogonadism, acromegaly, diabetes mellitus,
           hypothyroidism etc..

      Any changes of normal thyroid function and Thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) directly
      affects the remodeling of bone through TSH receptor found on osteoblast and osteoclast
      precursor cells.

      TSH has a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI) in women; though, this correlation
      is insignificant in male. Women having subclinical hypothyroidism have reduced femoral neck
      bone mineral density (BMD). The variations in thyroid function are primary, while changes in
      body weight and bones are secondary. The physiological variation of thyroid hormones is
      associated with changes in BMD and non vertebral fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal
      women.

      The definition of osteoporosis by the world health organization (WHO) is densitometric and
      non-clinical and is based on the measurement of bone mass and dexa method in the spine or
      hip. There is still controversy about the relation between thyroid hormones, osteoporosis and
      BMD in female hypothyroid patients. This study aims to fill the gaps in our understanding of
      impact of subclinical hypothyroid disorder on bone densitometry.

    <description>association of Subclinical hypothyroidism which represents a state with increased values of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal values of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The disorder is asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is made based on the results of laboratory findings when the level of TSH reaches values above 4.0 mU/ with osteoporesis disorder on bone densitometry. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is currently the standard for assessing bone mineral density (BMD), in this study dxa scan will be used on the forearm to assess T score and Z score.</description>
