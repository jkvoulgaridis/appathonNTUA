  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), formulation
      (liquid and solid oral forms) and food effect of ABI-H3733 in healthy participants. Part 1
      includes evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and PK of ABI-H3733 during single ascending
      dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) administration of the oral liquid formulation.
      Part 2 includes assessment of a solid dosage formulation of ABI-H3733 in participants under
      fasted conditions or after a high-fat meal. Optional cohorts may be enrolled in Parts 1 and 2
      of the study to explore additional dose levels, solid oral dosage formulations, or for cohort
      expansion.
