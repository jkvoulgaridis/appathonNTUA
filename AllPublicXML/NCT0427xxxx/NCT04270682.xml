    <textblock>
      The study is made up of two cohorts: a randomized double-blind crossover (placebo withdrawal
      with rescue) study among patients ≥ 16 years of age (adult cohort) and an open-label dose
      titration study among pediatric patients ≥1 month and &lt;16 years of age (pediatric cohort)
