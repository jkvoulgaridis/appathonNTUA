  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if circulating HPV DNA (cHPVDNA) can be used as a
      noninvasive biomarker for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3 in hopes of reducing
      procedures and costs for patients, as well as personalize their treatment plan.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      cHPVDNA is detectable in plasma of patients with invasive disease and CIN 1-3, and with the
      development of a highly sensitive and specific droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR) assay, it is hoped to be identified more prevalently and thus can improve risk
      stratification and help produce personalized treatment decisions and may be more
      cost-efficient. Plasma samples and cervical swabs will be collected from patients in
      University of North Carolina (UNC) Gynecology clinics. Those receiving biopsies or
      colposcopies and will come back to clinic 2-4 weeks post-excision for collection of another
      blood specimen. Using plasma samples and pathology results, we will characterize the
      relationship between plasma cHPVDNA levels and 1) CIN 1 versus CIN 2-3 pathology 2) CIN 2-3
      pre-excision and 2-4 weeks post-excision. We will accrue three cohorts of 25, 30, 30 patients
      corresponding to 1) Control 2) CIN 1 3) CIN 2-3. The control cohort will establish background
      signal in the assay. We will compare the proportion of detectable cHPVDNA levels between CIN
      1 and CIN 2-3 cohorts using Fisher's exact test with 80% power, significance level of 10%.
      Paired t-test will be used to compare pre- and post-excision cHPVDNA levels.
