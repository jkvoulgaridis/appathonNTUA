  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine what patients and clinicians consider to be the most
      important outcomes to be expected after undergoing treatment for trigeminal neuralgia and how
      this could be measured in all studies relating to this condition. This would enable different
      treatments to be compared using the same standards.

    <textblock>
      Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) is a rare chronic condition that causes agonizing, unpredictable,
      short-lasting electric shock-like one-sided facial pain and is commonly provoked by triggers
      such as light touch. This debilitating chronic pain disorder has a significant impact on the
      quality of life of patients with increased risk of depression and suicide. The current varied
      outcome measures make it difficult for patients to make decisions about choice of treatments
      which was highlighted in a study among 156 United Kingdom (UK) patients with TN who completed
      an adapted time-trade - off utility measure to ascertain how they valued the potential
      outcomes from various surgical and medical treatments.

      Patients can be managed with a range of anticonvulsants or by several types of neurosurgical
      interventions. To successfully compare the effectiveness and tolerability of various
      treatment options data is needed from well designed and conducted randomised controlled
      trials (RCTs) and prospective cohorts which use the same outcome measures. Apart from pain
      relief only a handful of other outcome measures have been used. It has to date not been
      possible to compare medical versus neurosurgical treatments and yet this is one of the most
      frequently asked patient questions. The impact of complications on ability to return to
      normal activities and improvement in mental health needs to be determined. The development
      and implementation of Core Outcome Sets (COS) and measures in clinical practice across the UK
      and in future trials would allow standardised outcome data, thereby facilitating
      meta-analysis and thus clinical decision-making.
