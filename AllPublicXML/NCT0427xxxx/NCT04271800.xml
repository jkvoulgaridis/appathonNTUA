  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19-targeted CAR-T cells
      therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and
      Lymphoma. CD19 is expressed on most CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma cells so it is an
      ideal target for CAR-T. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      CAR-T targeting CD19 in patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma.
      The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse events and disease
      status after treatment.
