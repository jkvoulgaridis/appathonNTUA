    <description>The intervention will consist of six sessions on six different days. Sessions will be held at VCU or at one of VCU's community partners. Each session will last for around 2 ½ hours (around 15 hours total). There will be breaks and food will be provided. During the sessions the facilitators will provide education on a variety of topics, including economic services that are available to people living in Richmond, job skills (such as creating a resume and dealing with discrimination at work), personal finance education, gender transition ideas, and HIV prevention. The sessions will occur in a group of about 4-10 transgender women.</description>
