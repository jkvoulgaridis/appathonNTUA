  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      failed and Difficult tracheal intubation after direct laryngoscopy is a dreaded complication
      of general anesthesia as it is associated with serious morbidity and mortality. There are
      several conventional clinical airway assessment parameters such as the modified Mallampati
      classification,thyromental and hyomental distance, interincisor distance, neck movementsand
      neck circumference, which are usually used to predict a difficult airwayand are components of
      multivariate risk indices. Despite the use of these parameters, the diagnostic accuracy of a
      preanesthetic airway assessment in predicting difficult intubation is very low. Ultrasound
      has been evolving as a useful device for airway assessment,and sublingual ultrasound has been
      used for this purpose.

      By an anesthesiologist who is experienced in airway ultrasound, patients will preoperative
      sonographic assessment . the patient will lie in the ramped up position , with head in the
      neutral position.The linear probe of the ultrasound machine will be used. Under the patient's
      chin, The probe of ultrasond will be placed , at different levels, to get the of the
      submandibular area in transverse view and the upper part of the neck. The transverse view
      will be used for measuring the the skin to hyoid, tongue volume,and the skin to epiglottis
      distance. The mid-sagittal view will be used for measuring the distance between epiglottis
      ,pre-epiglottic space , vocal cords, and the neck fat volume .
