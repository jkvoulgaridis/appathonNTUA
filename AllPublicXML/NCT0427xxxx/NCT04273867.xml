      The objective of this study is to administer and validate a disease specific health related
      quality of life (HRQOL) survey for patients with Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (CHP).
      The survey items have been developed and revised from prior qualitative research with CHP
      patients. All participation for this research study will take place remotely via telephone,
      Zoom, email, REDCap, and/or mail in order to minimize non-essential clinical exposure and to
      maximize patient health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients will be recruited
      from WCMC and outside physician referral for the study. Patients will be asked to sign
      informed consent for participation. At the initial visit patients will be asked to complete
      the survey and two additional PROs needed for concurrent validity testing. Participants will
      then be asked to complete the HRQOL survey under study a second time 2 weeks after the
      initial visit for test-re-test reliability testing. Pulmonary function testing and six minute
      walk test results will be collected from the electronic medical record. Pertinent demographic
      and clinical information will be collected from the patients and their medical records.
      Psychometric testing will be performed on the overall survey instrument and the individual
      items in order to test validity and reliability. The goal is that the survey developed will
      be a reliable and valid measurement tool for use in both clinical practice and research
      settings.

        Patients will be recruited in many ways including i2b2 search in Electronic Medical Record
        (EMR) (EPIC) for patients with diagnosis code for Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, or
        Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis (ICD 10: J67.9), weekly review of scheduled office visits in
        the EMR for patients with diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, multi-disciplinary
        conference discussions of patients with a diagnosis of Chronic Hypersensitivity
        Pneumonitis, physician Referrals from both WCM and local outside institutions, recruitment
        flyers, and patient support groups
