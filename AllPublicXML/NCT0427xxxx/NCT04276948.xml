      This is a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in middle-aged and
      older male and female subjects from Ohio. Subjects will take an over-the-counter dietary
      supplement or a placebo for 12 weeks. Outcome measures will include body weight, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure, standard blood chemistries (e.g. chemistry panel, lipid panel, CBC
      with differential), changes in mood, vitality, energy, fatigue, productivity, digestive
      wellness (via anchored Visual Analogue Scales).

             chemistries.

          -  Age between the ages of 40 and 60 (inclusive).

             the subject will be given a brief (5 minute) rest period, and two more measurements
             will be taken. The average of all three measurements will be used to determine
             eligibility.

          -  Normal supine, resting heart rate (&lt;90 per minute).

          -  Willing to duplicate their previous 24-hour diet, and fast for 10 hours prior each of
             the treatments.

          -  Other known gastrointestinal or metabolic diseases that might impact nutrient
             absorption or metabolism, e.g. short bowel syndrome, diarrheal illnesses, history of
             colon resection, gastro paresis, Inborn-Errors-of-Metabolism (such as PKU).

          -  Chronic inflammatory condition/disease or unstable medical condition (e.g. rheumatoid
             arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Lupus, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, etc.).

             days prior to screening.

          -  Subjects who (for whatever reason) have been on a self-restricted diet, controlled
             diet or special therapeutic diet, or who have had substantial changes in eating habits
             within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Donation of blood within 30 days or plasma within 7 days, prior to screening.

          -  History or presence of clinically significant diseases or conditions (e.g.,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory, hepatic, renal, hematological,
