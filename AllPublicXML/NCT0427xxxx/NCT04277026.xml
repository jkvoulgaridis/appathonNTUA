  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindful walking is a meditation practice that combines physical activity and mindfulness
      practice. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based
      interventions provided for increasing physical activity among adults with low physical
      activity levels. A randomized controlled trial design will be utilized, with an intervention
      and waitlist control group (N = 160). Outcomes measured include physical activity, sleep
      quality, and functional fitness. Participants will receive a total of eight sessions of
      60-minute mindful walking training within four weeks. The intervention group will receive the
      training in Weeks 1-4 and the control group will receive the training during Weeks 5-8. Each
      training group will consist of up to 20 individuals. Data will be collected at baseline, four
      weeks, and eight weeks to determine the efficacy of the intervention.
