  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures the effect of exercise on a variety of biomarkers in blood and urine
      selected to evaluate the physiological pathways of hemolysis, myolysis, thrombosis,
      inflammation, and renal function in subjects with sickle cell trait. These pathways have been
      shown to be associated with adverse events in athletes and warfighters with SCT upon
      protracted, repeated, strenuous exertion. Changes in biomarkers post-exercise compared to
      pre-exercise (and compared to healthy controls) suggest activation of the associated
      pathway(s) which may contribute to exercise-related events in athletes and warfighters and
      subclinical complications in non-athletes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with sickle cell trait and healthy controls will be subjected to a single bout of
      moderate, controlled exercise on a treadmill. Blood and urine samples will be collected
      before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 24 hours after exercise. Fifteen biomarkers,
      three selected to evaluate each of the five physiologic pathways previously listed, will be
      tested at each of the three time points. Abnormal biomarkers before exercise suggest chronic
      pathway activation while exacerbated levels after exercise suggest further activation
      stimulated by exercise. Biomarker levels 24 hours post-exercise will be used to evaluate
      continued pathway activation or pathway recovery. By definition, 95% of health controls will
      show normal biomarker levels pre-exercise and biomarker patterns post-exercise will serve as
      the expected standard by which to compare the test subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in erythrocyte morphology amounts</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before, immediately after, &amp; 24 hours after a single bout of submaximal exercise on a treadmill</time_frame>
    <description>Blood collected in EDTA will be smeared on a microscope slide, stained with Wright stain, and analyzed for abnormal morphologic forms with a particular interest in sickle cells. Each abnormal erythrocyte morphologic form will be reported on a Likert scale from 1-4+ as follows: 1+ (few abnormal cells); 2+ (approximately 1/3 abnormal cells); 3+ (approximately 1/2 abnormal cells); 4+ (&gt;1/2 abnormal cells). Increasing numbers of sickle cells in response to exercise may be associated with increased hemolysis, myocyte destruction, inflammation, initiation of coagulation, and renal dysfunction.</description>

    <ipd_description>A final de-identified database of study data will be generated and used for data sharing. Written data sharing requests from outside researchers will be reviewed by the PI and other members of the research team. Sharing will require a written agreement between the involved parties, which specifies the following: (1) what data will be shared, (2) who will have access to the shared data, (3) how the data will be shared and where the shared data will be stored (including details about security for data transfer and storage), (4) when the data will be shared, and (5) details about the data (i.e. data formats/transformations for sharing, meta-data to be included, etc.). The agreement will also require a commitment to using the data only for the specified research purposes and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Before sharing occurs, the written agreement will also be reviewed and approved by the the appropriate University units.</ipd_description>
