      1. To evaluate whether residual chemical additives at a level that may induce Type IV
           allergy in the unsensitized general user population are present in a finished rubber
           containing medical device.

        2. To meet requirements for claim: This product demonstrated reduced potential for
           sensitizing users to chemical additives as described in Guidance for Industry and FDA
           Staff - Medical Glove Guidance Manual9. Supporting Test Data: A negative skin
           sensitization test (Modified Draize-95 Test) on a minimum of 200 non-sensitized human
           subjects.
