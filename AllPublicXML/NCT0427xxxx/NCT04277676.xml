      Approximately 120 patients who have been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis but have not
      previously operated due to this disease and who are in Kellgren Lawrence stage 2 and 3 will
      be compared with the KOOS scale and Short Form-36 (Short Form-36: SF-36) scales to
      investigate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of KOOS-12.

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease characterized by the loss of articular
      cartilage, causing destruction in periarticular bone tissue, leading to a decrease in daily
      life and quality of life due to pain despite its slow progression.

      When the knee osteoarthritis Looking at the prevalence among people living in Turkey,
      compared to males more can be seen, 14.8% of the 50 and older population in knee OA
      incidence, 22.5% of the incidence in women, while men were determined to be 8%.

      Risk factors that affect the development of knee OA include obesity, traumas,
      chondrocalcinosis, nutritional factors, genetics, smoking, estrogen replacement, muscular
      weakness, and professional or sports activities. The individual with knee OA especially; It
      is applied to the physician with the complaints of increased pain during walking, climbing
      and climbing stairs, stiffness in the joint, crepitation and limited range of motion.

      Diagnosis is determined based on knee OA, clinical and radiological evaluations; According to
      the radiological changes seen, the stage of the disease is determined by Kellgren Lawrence
      staging (Stage 0-4). Purposes in the treatment of knee OA; patient education, pain control,
      increasing functionality and reducing the impact of disability on daily life. The optimal
      treatment approach involves the application of non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      treatments together.

      Functional evaluation methods are of great importance in planning the right treatment
      approach and evaluating treatment effectiveness due to the negative impact of individuals on
      daily life activities. Functional evaluation of the individual; daily life activities,
      professional activities, leisure activities, social relationships and their skills in
      performing these tasks are carried out with objective, generic or disease-specific scales.
      Various scales have been developed in individuals with knee OA that allow an objective
      evaluation of functions. Among these scales, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index: WOMAC),
      Lequesne Index, Knee-Hip Osteoarthritis Life Quality Scale (Osteoarthritis of Knee Hip
      Quality Of Life Questionnaire: OAKHQOL), Knee osteoarthritis and Knee Injury and Knee Injury
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score: KOOS.

      These questionnaires, which are reported by the patients, are not routinely used in the
      clinic due to the length of the questionnaires, which are used to determine the problems
      caused by joint problems in daily life and quality of life. Therefore, patient-based scales
      that can be used in the clinic should be short, and include questions that can evaluate pain,
      function and quality of life. Although the short form of the KOOS questionnaire has been
      developed, KOOS-PS only measures the effects of knee osteoarthritis on physical function.
      Consisting of 12 questions considering that the KOOS scale is long in routine, clinic use; A
      short form of KOOS-12 was created, which included the assessment sections of pain, function
      and knee-specific quality of life. The application of the KOOS-12 scale takes 2 minutes. The
      short form of KOOS-12 was found to be a valid and reliable scale in individuals who underwent
      total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of our study; Turkish reliability and validity of the
      Knee Osteoarthritis and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Result Score-12 scale.

    <description>Scale; It consists of three parts: pain (4 items), function (4 items) and knee-specific quality of life (4 items). KOOS-12; in pain sub-item; In the sub-item of walking on a flat ground, going up and down stairs, sitting-reaching, function and daily life; There are patient-specific questions in the sub-item of quality of life, sitting up, standing, getting in and out of the car, turning the affected knee. The total scores obtained from the items in the KOOS-12 scale are calculated and the average of the total score is taken from the three sub-dimensions. If any of the three sub-item scores are missing, the average score cannot be calculated.</description>

    <description>It is a questionnaire designed by Roos et al. From the Likert 3.0 version of the WOMAC osteoarthritis index to evaluate the pain, functional status, daily life activity and quality of life of patients with knee osteoarthritis (Roos EM. et al. 1998). Scale; consists of five subgroups and 42 questions: pain, string-related quality of life, daily life activities, sports and leisure activities. Individuals score the questions between 0-4 according to the 5-point Likert scale, based on the symptoms felt in the knee, taking into account the past week. While 100 points indicate that there are no symptoms in the scale, 0 points indicate that there are severe symptoms. The subscale score is calculated by dividing the average scores of each sub-dimension separately into 4. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted. (Sabırlı F. et al. 2007). It takes 10 minutes to apply the scale (Roos EM. et al. 2003, Paker N. et al. 2007).</description>

    <description>It is a scale that is used to evaluate the overall quality of life consisting of eight sub-scales and 36 questions and allows the individual to evaluate himself. Scale; physical function, physical role, emotional role, pain, vitality, general health and mental health sub-dimensions. Each subscale is scored between 0-100 and &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest and &quot;100&quot; shows the best quality of life. The questionnaire has Turkish validity and reliability (Kocyigit H. et al. 1999).</description>
