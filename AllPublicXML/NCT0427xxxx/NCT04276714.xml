  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the early stage of the amputation, the residual limb presents post-surgical fluctuations
      related to post-operative phase, which would need a frequent prosthetic adjustment. In most
      cases, the volume of residual limb is constant from 12 to 18 months after surgery. However,
      some daily fluctuations could appear due to an underlying vascular disease for example, which
      could be painful and impact the quality of life with a constant need of prosthetics
      adjustment. The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a system-adjusted
      fitting in comparison with a standard fitting.
