  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death by infectious disease in the world,
      responsible for 1.6 million deaths in 2017. The treatment of active TB requires at least a
      6-month combined antibiotic regimen and can cause heavy side effects. As a consequence,
      treatment adherence is not optimal, particularly in primary care settings. Rapid and reliable
      monitoring of anti-TB treatment adherence and efficacy is critical to provide adequate
      patient care and curb relapse episodes and acquired drug resistance.

      Investigators propose to evaluate the performance in terms of diagnosis accuracy and outcome
      prediction of four new biomarkers of active TB: 1) a double IGRA (Interferon Gamma Release
      Assay) including QuantiFERON-Gold Plus® and HBHA; 2) a whole blood transcriptomic analysis of
      mRNA (messenger Ribonucleic acid) expression of a panel of 150 genes; 3) a whole blood
      proteomic analysis; 4) an ex vivo immunophenotyping using flow and mass cytometry to
      characterize the lymphocyte populations.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a composite outcome. Evolution of the disease is defined by clinical status, radiological computed tomography evolution and negation of the mycobacterial culture of routine respiratory samples.
The biomarkers assessed are:
1) a combination of IGRAs test (QuantiFERON-Gold Plus and HBHA); 2) a transcriptomic signature; 3) a protein signature; 4) a phenotypic signature (by implementing an immunomonitoring approach).</description>

    <description>Measurement of gamma interferon responses induced by different conditions of ex-vivo stimulation of the blood sample by specific Mtb peptides.

    <measure>Performance of an immunomonitoring test by mass or flow cytometry in the diagnosis / prognosis of tuberculosis by measuring the dynamics of the blood population of T lymphocytes over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the different subpopulations of immune cells (CD4 + T cells, CD8 +(cluster of differentiation 8) T cells, MAIT, Th1, Th2, Th1, Tfh, Treg, naive, effector and memory cells) during anti-tuberculosis treatment will be carried out. The analytical characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, VPN and VPP) of this immunomonitoring tool will be determined by comparing the abundance of different cellular phenotypes with the evolution of the disease as defined in the primary outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the performance of a test based on the interpretation of a transcriptomic signature in plasma in the diagnosis / prognosis of TB.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A transcriptomic signature in plasma is a set of genes involved in the immune response specifically deregulated during the different stages of infection and disease progression.
This assessment will be made from blood samples. The transcriptomic signature composed of 16 genes will be evaluated during the anti-tuberculosis treatment and confronted with the evolution of the disease as defined in the primary outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the performance of a test based on the interpretation of a protein signature in the diagnosis / prognosis of tuberculosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A protein signature is composed of cytokines and chemokines, also deregulated during the various stages of infection and progression of the disease.
This assessment will be made from blood samples. The protein signature composed of cytokines / chemokines of interest (ie IP-10, TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor - a), IL-1(interleukin - 1), IL-18, IL-12, CCL4, IL-2, IFN-g (interferon - g),…) will be evaluated during the anti-tuberculosis treatment and confronted with the evolution of the disease as defined in the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>To determine the achievement of target concentrations of rifampicin the pharmacokinetic profile of rifampicin will be evaluate by a combination of parameters such as the area under the curve, maximum and minimum concentration, clearance, volume of distribution, modeled from three concentration measurements at each visit. (V2, V3 and V4).</description>
