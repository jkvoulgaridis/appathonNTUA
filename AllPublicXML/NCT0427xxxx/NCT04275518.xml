  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia is a malignant disorder characterized by the rapid, uncontrolled
      proliferation of malignant clonal hematopoietic stem cells that accumulate as immature,
      undifferentiated cells (blasts) in the bone marrow and circulation.

      APG-115 is a potent and orally active small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor, it binds to MDM2 protein
      and shows potent cell growth inhibitory activity in vitro with low nanomolar potencies in a
      subset of human cancer cell lines. APG-115 has demonstrated its strong antitumor activities
      with either daily or less frequent dosing-schedules in the acute leukemia xenograft models.

      This is a phase 1b, open-label, three-stages study that will initially evaluate the safety
      and PK/PD profile of APG-115 as a single agent, followed by a combination of APG-115 +
      azacytidine or cytarabine in R/R AML or MDS subjects.

      Patients will continue treatment for maximally 6 cycles or until progression of disease or
      unacceptable toxicity is observed or administrative discontinuation whichever occurs first.
      Patients who continue to be benefit after 6 cycles' treatment will receive additional cycles
      of treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity is observed or
      administrative discontinuation. (As long as it is proven safe).

      Stage 1: This will be a 3+3 dose escalation to determine the DLTs and MTD/RP2D of APG-115
      given according to the different dose levels once daily from Days 1 to 7 every 28 days.

      Stage 2: After stage 1 of APG-115 single agent dose escalation first cycle is completed,
      stage 2 can be initiated with the combination regimen. This will be a 3+3 dose escalation to
      determine the MTD/RP2D and DLTs of APG-115 + AZA(arm A)/Cytarabine (arm B)combination.

      Stage 3: dose expansion of the combination regimes.
