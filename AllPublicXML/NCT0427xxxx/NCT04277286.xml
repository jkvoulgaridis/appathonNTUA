  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Transend&quot; is a program designed to promote the transition of young patients with endocrine
      or metabolic diseases when they arrive in the adult sector at La Pitié-Salpétrière hospital.
      The main objective of the study is to compare the rate of patients lost to follow-up at 24
      months after the transfer of pediatrics between the Transend group and the (historical)
      control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence and early adulthood represent important periods for young people suffering from
      chronic diseases. Several observational studies show needs not covered by care services at
      this period and significant lost to follow-up rates. &quot;Transend&quot; is a program designed to
      promote the transition of young patients with endocrine or metabolic diseases when they
      arrive in the adult sector at La Pitié-Salpétrière hospital (Paris, France). Since September
      1, 2016, approximately 500 patients benefited from it.
