  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of diffuse
      reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) at detecting treatment-resistant
      disease when DRS and RS are used together to measure treatment-induced reoxygenation and
      molecular changes in tumors of the oral cavity. This study will be performed in a total of 90
      patients that have Stage 3 or 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with primary
      tumors located in the larynx or one tonsil.

      The objective of this pilot study is to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of diffuse
      reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) at detecting treatment-resistant
      disease when DRS and RS are used together to measure treatment-induced reoxygenation and
      molecular changes in tumors of the oral cavity. This study will be performed in a total of 90
      patients that have Stage 3 or 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with primary
      tumors located in the larynx or one tonsil.

      This study is a single-arm, single-center observational pilot study of the accuracy of DRS+RS
      at distinguishing early between treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive disease in
      study-eligible subjects undergoing first-line chemoradiation therapy for Stage 3 or 4 HNSCC
      of the larynx or tonsil.

      Three (3) optical spectra each will be collected from the tumor, an adjacent normal site, and
      a normal tissue site on the buccal mucosa prior to treatment. The subject will undergo 4
      repeat post-treatment measures taken after radiation therapy begins (marked as Day 1). Repeat
      measures will be taken on Day 2(+1), Day 4(±1), Day 7(±1), and Day 10(±1). The probe will be
      performed at the beginning of the radiation therapy visit, prior to the radiation dose that
      day.
