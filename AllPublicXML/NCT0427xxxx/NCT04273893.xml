  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell (WBC) found in the participant's blood. During
      radiation treatment, moving blood is exposed to radiation. This may cause a decrease in the
      amount of lymphocytes. A researcher at UVA has created a system to predict the amount of the
      decrease in lymphocytes in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The predicted
      decrease of lymphocytes will be compared to the actual decrease in lymphocytes found in
      blood.

      Researchers have found a way to give radiation that they think will result in a smaller
      decrease in lymphocytes after radiation. There will be two groups in this study, about half
      of the participants will have their radiation designed to decrease radiation to organs with a
      lot of blood and the other half will receive standard radiation therapy.

      Participants are being asked to take part in this study because the participants have been
      diagnosed with NSCLC and will be receiving a type of radiation therapy called stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) where high doses of radiation will be delivered to the tumor,
      while minimizing damage to healthy surrounding tissues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphopenia, a known consequence of radiation therapy to virtually every part of the body,
      was first described in the early 20th century shortly after the discovery of X-rays.
      Radiation therapy (RT) can induce lymphopenia in the absence of concomitant chemotherapy or
      steroids and even when neither bone marrow nor lymphatic tissue is included in the treatment
      field. It is highly possible that irradiation of blood rich organs such as the great vessels,
      would reduce the lymphocyte count significantly. Given this known radiation-induced toxicity,
      circulating blood should be considered an organ at risk during irradiation, and efforts
      should be made to understand the toxicity from radiation to circulating blood -normal tissue
      complication probabilities (NTCP) so that this may be included in the optimization strategy
      during radiation treatment.

      Additionally, recent data have suggested that lymphocyte subsets exhibit differential
      sensitivity to radiation, with helper CD4+ T cells being more sensitive than cytotoxic CD8+ T
      cells in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with RT and temozolomide, and naïve T cells more
      sensitive than memory T cells in prostate cancer.

      Based on existing data on the effects of irradiation on total lymphocyte count and the
      effects on subsets of T cells, the investigators have created a lymphodepletion predictive
      algorithm. In this clinical trial, the investigators will test whether optimized SBRT plans
      lead to lower lymphocyte depletion and whether the algorithm can accurately predict
      lymphocyte decreases following SBRT. Optimized SBRT plans will meet all standard of care
      dose-volume objectives for SBRT and for protection of organs-at-risk (OAR), but will also
      reduce radiation to the regional great vessels, lungs, and heart beyond what is currently
      optimized to reduce the integral dose to circulating blood/lymphocytes. This study will allow
      us to evaluate the performance of our predictive algorithm for post-SBRT decrease in
      lymphocyte count and to determine whether additional steps in SBRT planning will deliver
      lower risk of post-SBRT decreases in lymphocyte count.
