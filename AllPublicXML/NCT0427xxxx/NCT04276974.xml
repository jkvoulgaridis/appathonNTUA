  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work have shown that consumption of foods rich in polyphenols, such as berries and
      cocoa, led to beneficial changes in the gut microbiota composition, as well as improvements
      in biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in healthy volunteers. In addition, recent
      studies suggest that pesticide exposure has a detrimental effect on the gut microbiome in
      human populations and laboratory animals.The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the
      effects of short-term consumption of an organic and a non-organic plant rich diet on urinary
      polyphenol and pesticide levels, gut microbiome and selected biomarkers of cardiovascular
      health in a group of young healthy individuals.

      Healthy men and women participants (10) will be recruited for a 2-arm randomised crossover
      controlled trial. Urinary polyphenol and pesticide levels after consumption of an organic and
      non-organic plant rich diet for 4 days will be analysed. Changes in gut microbiome
      composition and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk (flow-mediated dilation, blood
      pressure and arterial stiffness) will also be investigated.
