  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of topical anesthetic combined with
      psychological interventions for pain control due to peripheral venipuncture in children and
      adolescents.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous infusion is the main route of drug administration for hospitalized children.
      Therefore, venipuncture has become a major source of pain. Without pain management can lead
      to moderate to severe pain and can cause fear, tension and anxiety in children. The current
      pain relief form include pharmacologic(i.e. topical anesthetic) and psychological(i.e.
      distraction) interventions. Psychological interventions are not as good as pharmacologic
      methods in terms of pain relief, but it is more conducive to relieve children's distress
      reactions such as fear and anxiety. There are less high qualified evidences supporting that
      pharmacologic combined with psychological interventions can enhance children's abilities to
      cope with painful procedures successfully. The hypothesis of the current study is that
      topical anesthetic combined with psychological interventions can decrease children's pain and
      distress.

      The current study adopts a randomized, blind, controlled intervention trial. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to three groups: a lidocaine group, a psychological interventions
      group, or a combined group(lidocaine plus psychological interventions). The outcomes include
      self-reported pain, observer-reported pain, salivary cortisol and physiological measurement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Child self-reported pain: Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after completing peripheral venipuncture.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain outcomes are assessed by child himself or herself using Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale. The scale includes 6 facial expressions with correlating numbers of 0-10 (0 being 'no hurt' and 10 being 'hurts worst'). Children pick a facial expression, that corresponds with their pain and see a number that matches it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observer reported pain (parents): revised Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability behavioral Pain Rating Scale (r-FLACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after completing peripheral venipuncture.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain outcomes are assessed by parents using the r-FLACC scale. The r-FLACC is a tool which evaluates pain-related behavior on facial expression, leg movement, activity, cry and consolability. Total score of the scale is summed in range 0 to 10. 0=relaxed and comfortable; 1-3=mild discomfort; 4-6=moderate pain; 7-10=severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Observer reported pain (outcomes assessor ): revised Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability behavioral Pain Rating Scale (r-FLACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after completing all participants' interventions.</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness is analyzed by outcomes assessors using r-FLACC via video taken during the procedure. The outcomes assessor is blind for the study design. The r-FLACC is a tool which evaluates pain-related behavior on facial expression, leg movement, activity, cry and consolability. Total score of the scale is summed in range 0 to 10. 0=relaxed and comfortable; 1-3=mild discomfort; 4-6=moderate pain; 7-10=severe pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration of salivary cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after children reporting pain score.</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological stress levels are measured by means of salivary cortisol as an indicator. The salivary samples (1-2 milliliter) are taken with sterile collection devices immediately after children reporting pain score. The salivary samples are immediately stored at −20℃ freezer. Cortisol levels are determined by human salivary cortisol ELISA Kit (Jianglai, Shanghai, China).</description>
