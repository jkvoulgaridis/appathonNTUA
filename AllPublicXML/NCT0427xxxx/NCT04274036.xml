      Stigmatization is especially studied in mental disorders such as schizophrenia. In recent

      Stigmatization is especially studied in mental disorders such as schizophrenia. In recent
      years, different chronic diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and diabetes have also been
      shown to decrease in quality of life due to the &quot;stigma&quot; of these patients. Fibromyalgia
      patients with chronic widespread body pain and accompanying subjective fatigue, depression,
      and anxiety; Although there is no objective pathology from the outside, it can be stigmatized
      in family life, work-life and health institutions they apply for the diagnosis of pain due to
      the intensive complaints. The fact that the subjective complaints seen without an objective
      pathology are so severe makes the management of these patients difficult. To reveal the
      presence of stigma in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia compared with the healthy control
      group is the main aim of this study. It is the secondary purpose of this study to determine
      related factors such as gender, age, educational status, marital status, employment status,
      income level, pain duration, pain intensity, medications used, and social support received
      from patients' family and the environment. We hypothesize that this group of patients suffers
      more stigma and the quality of life decreases due to this stigma.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Discomfort Intolerance Scale is brief, self-report index of the degree to which individuals tolerate physical discomfort including pain. Items for this scale were developed by experts in pain and anxiety. Participants rate the questions on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all like me) to 6 (extremely like me). Higher points show worst outcomes.</description>

    <measure>The Distress Tolerance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Distress tolerance is defined as the capacity to experience and withstand negative psychological states. Distress may be the result of cognitive or physical processes but manifests in an emotional state often characterized by action tendencies to alleviate the emotional experience. Distress tolerance is considered a meta-emotion construct that consists of one's evaluations and expectations of experiencing negative emotional states in respect to tolerability and aversiveness, appraisal and acceptability, tendency to absorb attention and disrupt functioning, and regulation of emotions, specifically, the consequent strength of action tendencies to either avoid or immediately attenuate the experience</description>
