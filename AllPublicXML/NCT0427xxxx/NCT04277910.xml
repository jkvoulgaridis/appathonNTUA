  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single dose of
      MT2004 following oral single and multiple ascending dose administration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 48 subjects will be evaluated with 36 subjects randomized to receive active drug
      and 12 subjects randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion (eight subjects per
      each dose cohort, six subjects randomized to active drug and two subjects randomized to
      placebo). A separate open panel of 8 subjects will receive a single dose of MT2004 under fed
      conditions following the last of the SAD dose escalation cohorts. The dose level will be
      selected by the sponsor based upon the safety and PK data generated in each dose escalation
      cohort of the SAD part of the trial. A total of 24 subjects will receive MT2004 (8 subjects
      in each dose cohort for a total of 3 cohorts, 6 subjects randomized to active drug and 2
      subjects randomized to placebo per cohort). MT2004 dosing regimens (dose levels and duration
      of administration) will be determined based on the collective SAD PK and safety data from
      Part 1 and nonclinical data of MT2004 (pharmacology and toxicology). Tentative dosing regimen
      is once daily for a consecutive 14 days.
