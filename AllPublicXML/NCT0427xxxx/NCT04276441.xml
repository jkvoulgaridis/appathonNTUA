  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to identify and diagnose Atrial Fibrillation (AF),
      evaluate improvement in cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, improve direct oral anti-coagulant
      (DOAC) adherence and persistence, and better characterize participants and identify
      predictors of disease.
