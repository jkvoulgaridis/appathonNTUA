        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have read, understood, and signed the informed consent form (ICF).

          2. Be a male or female aged ≥18 years at the time of enrolment.

          3. Have stage 2 moderate (PED) or stage 3 severe (corneal ulcer) NK involving only 1 eye
             (study eye) and of at least 2 weeks duration. Patients with Stage 1 NK in the fellow
             eye can be enrolled.

          4. Have no objective clinical evidence of improvement in the PED or corneal ulceration
             within the 2 weeks prior to study enrolment despite use of conventional non-surgical
             treatment (eg, nonpreserved ocular lubricants, nonpreserved topical antibiotics, oral
             doxycycline, patching, serum tears, and/or therapeutic contact lenses) as determined
             by the investigator's or referring physician's medical record.

          5. Have decreased corneal sensitivity (≤ 4 cm using the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer)
             within the area of the PED or corneal ulcer and outside of the area of the defect in
             at least one corneal quadrant.

          6. Have a BCDVA score ≤ 75 ETDRS letters in the study eye, due to NK.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have stage 2 or 3 NK affecting the fellow eye.

          2. Have any active ocular infection (bacterial, viral, fungal or protozoal) or active
             inflammation not related to NK in the affected eye(s).

          3. Have any other ocular disease requiring topical ocular treatment during the course of
             the study treatment period.

          4. Receive topical ophthalmological treatments other than the study medications provided
             by the study sponsor and allowed by the study protocol (eg, preservative-free
             artificial tears; preservative-free topical antibiotics, other than tetracycline, See
             section 9.6.1).

          5. Have a Schirmer test result without anaesthesia of ≤ 3 mm/5 minutes.

          6. Have a history of uncontrolled glaucoma. (

          7. Have severe blepharitis and/or severe meibomian gland disease.

          8. Have severe vision loss in the affected eye with no potential for visual improvement
             in the opinion of the investigator as a result of the study treatment.

          9. Have evidence of corneal ulceration/melting involving the posterior third of the
             corneal stroma, or perforation in the affected eye.

         10. Have a history of any ocular surgery (including laser or refractive surgical
             procedures) within 3 months before study enrolment in the study eye. An exception to
             the preceding statement will be allowed if the ocular surgery is considered to be the
             cause of the stage 2 or 3 NK.

         11. Have a history of corneal transplantation in the affected eye.

         12. Have a history of ocular cancer.

         13. Have had prior surgical procedures for the treatment of NK (eg, tarsorrhaphy,
             conjunctival flap, etc.) except amniotic membrane transplantation, if at least 2 weeks
             after the membrane has disappeared within the area of the PED or corneal ulcer (and at
             least 6 weeks after the procedure) in the study eye.

             Patients previously treated with Botox (botulinum toxin) injections used to induce
             pharmacologic blepharoptosis are eligible for enrolment only if the last injection was
             given at least 3 months prior to enrolment in the study.

         14. Use therapeutic contact lenses or wear contact lenses for refractive correction during
             the study treatment periods in the eye(s) with NK.

         15. Have had prior treatment with Oxervate® (cenegermin eye drops).

         16. Have an anticipated need for punctal occlusion during the study treatment period.
             Patients with punctal occlusion or punctal plugs inserted prior to the study are
             eligible for enrolment provided that the punctal occlusion is maintained during the
             study.

         17. Have participated in any clinical trial with an investigational drug/device within 2
             months prior to the screening and throughout the study duration.

         18. Have a known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study drug or procedural
             medications (eg, fluorescein), including to a compound chemically related to MT8.

         19. Have a presence or history of any ocular or systemic disorder or condition that might
             hinder the efficacy of the study treatment or its evaluation, could possibly interfere
             with the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the investigator to be
             incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct (eg, progressive or degenerative
             corneal or retinal conditions, lagophthalmos, uveitis, optic neuritis, poorly
             controlled diabetes, autoimmune disease, systemic infection, neoplastic diseases, or
             that may compromise the safety of the patient.

         20. Have a significant history of alcohol abuse or drug/solvent abuse (within the last 2
             years).

         21. Be unwilling to comply with any study assessments or procedures.

         22. Be a woman who is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy.

             birth control. Be a male patient who is not permanently sterile and who is not willing
             to use condoms during the study and for 4 weeks after the end of study treatment.
