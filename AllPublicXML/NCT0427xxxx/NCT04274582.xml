  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study included 16 handball players, aged 16-24 years , of handball club &quot;Novi Beograd&quot;.
      All study participants were apparently healthy, had no active sports injuries, did not use
      any medications, and were non-smokers. Standardized questionnaires conducted under the
      supervision of a trained nutritionist were used to collect general data, nutritional habits
      and use of dietary supplements. The athletes who used any dietary supplements at least a
      month before the study, were excluded. All participants (or their parents if they were under
      the age of 18) signed an informed consent document. The study was approved by the Ethical
      committee of The Military Medical Academy, Belgrade.

      The study was conducted during regular competition season, and lasted for twelve weeks. All
      participants had the same training and nutritional regime, which excluded intake of berries.
      The players received 30 mL of liquid chokeberry extract, in the morning before training, once
      per day for 12 weeks. For the preparation of chokeberry extract (liquid form) was used fruit
      (berries) of Aronia melanocarpa Elliot, Rosaceae. The extract was donated by Pharmanova
      Belgrade, Serbia. Process of extraction is performed under specific conditions which are
      subject of technical patent (producer EUHEM), for the purpose of production of extract with
      high concentration of polyphenols. The design of the product included few demands: sufficient
      daily dose of polyphenols to be dietary supplement, small volume which can be consumed as
      shot and acceptable taste for most consumers. Compliance was monitored by the trainers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Superoxide anion radical</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of O2- was measured after the reaction of nitro blue tetrazolium in TRIS buffer with plasma at 530 nm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>hydrogen peroxide</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>The determination of H2O2 concentration is based on oxidation of phenol red using hydrogen peroxide, in reaction catalyzed by enzyme peroxidase from horse radish (POD). The level of H2O2 was measured at 610 nm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>nitrites</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>Nitric oxide (•NO) decomposes rapidly to form stable metabolite nitrite/nitrate products. The method for detection of the plasma nitrite levels is based on the Griess reaction. Nitrites (NO2−) were determined as an index of NO production with Griess reagent (forms purple diazocomplex). Nitrites were measured at 550 nm.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>index of lipid peroxidation</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of lipid peroxidation in the plasma was estimated by measuring the TBARS using 1% thiobarbituric acid in 0.05 NaOH, incubated with plasma at 100 C for 15 min, and measured at 530 nm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Superoxide dismutase</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>SOD activity was determined by the epinephrine method of Beutler. 100 μl lysate and 1 mL of carbonate buffer were mixed; then 100 μl of epinephrine was added. Detection was performed at 470 nm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduced glutathione</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of GSH was determined based on GSH oxidation with 5.5- dithio-bis-6.2-nitrobenzoic acid using the method reported by Beutler.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catalase</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>CAT activity was determined according to Aebi. Lysates were diluted with distilled water (1:7 v/v) and treated with chloroform-ethanol (0.6:1 v/v) to remove haemoglobin; then 50 ll of CAT buffer, 100 μl of sample, and 1 mL of 10 mM H2O2 were added to the samples. Detection was performed at 360 nm.</description>
