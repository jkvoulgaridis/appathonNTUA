  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to learn more about inflammation in the brain using
      Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging in people with Alzheimer's
      Disease/Mild Cognitive Impairment or healthy controls.

      If the subject agrees to be in this study, she/ he will have two types of PET/CT scans on the
      same day. The subject may have a screening visit before the PET/CT scan visit if the
      investigator needs to confirm the subject is able to be in the study.

      A blood sample will be taken before the scans. Additional blood samples will be taken during
      the PET scans. Subjects must also agree to have an MRI scan for this research study if she/he
      has not had a recent scan that the study doctor decides can be used for this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>understanding the uptake of [18F]NOS in the human brain in AD/MCI and Healthy Controls and compare to same-day [11C]PBR28 uptake using PET/CT scan</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be comparison of whole brain GM binding between controls and the MCI/AD group. the investigator will compare groups with a t-test. the investigator will evaluate the correlation of whole brain GM binding of 11C-PBR28 and 18F-NOS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparing the patterns of [18F]NOS and [11C]PBR28 brain uptake with patterns of cerebral amyloidosis and neurodegeneration using PET/CT</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures for will include regional and voxel-wise comparisons between binding of the tracers. Correlation between regional 11C-PBR28 or 18F-NOS binding and either amyloid PET SUVR (calculated with cerebellar gray matter reference) or GM volumetric measurements will be evaluated using Pearson's r and rank sum correlation initially using false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected&lt;0.05 statistical thresholds.</description>

    <description>PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate neuroinflammation in the brain using the investigational radiotracer [11C]PBR28 followed by a second investigational radiotracer [18F]NOS. Each subject will have two positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan sessions performed on the same day, first with [11C]PBR28 followed by [18F]NOS.</description>
