  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In determining respiratory muscle strength, mouth pressure measurement is most frequently
      used in the clinic. Determination of respiratory muscle strength loss provides benefits such
      as taking the decision to use individual rehabilitation methods, making the decision for
      extubation in patients with mechanical ventilation. But Turkey normative values, these values
      are not available. In the investigator's country, the respiratory muscle forces of the cases
      are evaluated by comparing them with the normal / expected values of the Scandinavian races
      that do not have similar anatomical features with the Turkish society, which causes errors in
      diagnosis.

      The 250 healthy cases, whose age ranges are between 20-70, 20-29, 30-40, 40-49, 50-59 and
      60-70, will be examined by a pulmonologist and asked if they have any disease that may affect
      respiratory muscle strength. Mouth pressure measurements will be made for healthy and
      inclusion criteria, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure distributions will be
      examined.

    <description>Maximum inspiratory pressure—maximum expiratory pressure. The mouth pressure measurement was performed with the Micro-RPM® instrument from SensorMEDIC. Patient placed a rubber mouthpiece with flanges, on the device, sealed their lips firmly around the mouthpiece, exhaled/inhaled slowly and completely and then tried to breath in as hard as possible. The patient was allowed to rest for about a minute and the maneuver was repeated.</description>
