    <textblock>
      Older adults having chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher rate of fracture than those
      without CKD. Osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease mineral-bone disorder (CKD-MBD) are risk
      factors for skeletal fractures. In addition, CKD-MBD is also a risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy are both important to prevent
      complications of CKD and osteoporosis. Therefore, a prospective intervention study is
      purposed to investigate the effect of a multifaceted intervention including exercise, diet
      modification, and pharmacological therapy on their outcomes. Patients who are older than 50
      years old and have CKD G3-G4 (eGFR &gt; 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2) with a high risk of fracture
      (screening by FRAX®) are enrolled. Baseline questionnaire, clinical, laboratory and
      radiologic examination are performed. If CKD-MBD or osteoporosis are revealed, the
      intervention will be given accordingly. All examinations will be repeated every 3 months,
      except bone mineral density and x-ray film for the spine to investigate the effect of the
      intervention. After one-year, primary outcomes including mortality, cardiovascular events,
      subsequent fracture, and fall rate will be examined. The secondary outcomes include changes
      in biochemistry laboratory data before and after interventions (pharmacological therapy and
      lifestyle modifications). The bivariate analysis will be performed using the t-test or
      Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables with normal or non-normal distribution,
      respectively. Chi-squared test for categorical variables will be used to test correlations
      between baseline characteristics, change of laboratory results and outcomes. The paired
      t-test will be used to examine the difference between before and after the interventions.
      Stepwise multivariate logistic regression models will be used to identify the correlates of
      outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders.

      Background: Older adults having chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher rate of fracture.
      Osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease mineral-bone disorder (CKD-MBD) are risk factors for
      skeletal fractures. However, most CKD patients did not have data of bone mineral density
      before the recommendation of KDIGO guideline. The correlation of the CKD-MBD and osteoporosis
      was not fully elucidated. Also, the effect of a multifaceted intervention on those having
      both diseases was less studied.

      Aims: To observe the clinical outcomes and the trends of biochemistry laboratory data before
      and after the multifaceted intervention Method: Sixty subjects with CKD stage 3-4, and eGFR
      &gt;20 mL/min/1.73m2 and high risk of fracture (FRAX screening: risk of hip fracture (HF) and
      major osteoporotic fracture (HF: men&gt;6%, women &gt;7%; MOF: men&gt;15%, women&gt;12.5%) are enrolled.

      Subjects received CKD-MBD and osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultation on
      diet, medications, exercise. Followed assessments and interventions are conducted every 3
      months.

      Primary outcomes include one-year mortality, cardiovascular events, subsequent fracture, and
      fall events during the one-year intervention.

      Secondary outcomes include trends of biochemistry laboratory data before and after
      interventions.
