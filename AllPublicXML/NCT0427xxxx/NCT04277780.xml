  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality measures and cost-reduction methods are a high priority in the United States health
      care system. This includes the high burden of patients with uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes.
      Innovative ways to better understand and implement diabetes management plans to reduce the
      burden of this disease on the system are a necessity. Use of FDA-approved continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) sensors have shown benefit in better management plans in the outpatient
      setting. Hence, this study hypothesizes that using CGM sensors starting in the inpatient
      setting will provide better and quicker understanding of the disease to make expedited
      changes to management plans thereby improving blood glucose control and mitigating some of
      the health care burden by means of reducing E.D visits and hospital re-admission rates. The
      study will randomly assign patients to either receive a CGM sensor plus the standard diabetes
      management and instructions or who will only receive the standard diabetes management. The
      patients will be followed in the outpatient endocrinology clinic 1-month, 3-month, and
      6-month from the time of hospital discharge.

      Rationale: Quality measures and cost-reduction methods are a high priority in the United
      States health care system currently. This includes the high burden of patients with
      uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes on the system especially given the continued dramatic rise in
      the prevalence of these patients. Innovative ways to better understand and implement diabetes
      management plans to reduce the burden of this disease on our health care system are a
      necessity. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors have already shown benefit
      in better management plans in the outpatient setting. Hence, this study aims to assess the
      use of CGM sensors starting in the inpatient setting and whether they will help provide
      better and quicker understanding of the disease to make expedited changes to management plans
      thereby improving blood glucose control and mitigating some of the health care burden by
      means of reducing E.D visits and hospital re-admission rates.

      Objectives: To determine whether the use of CGM sensors in patients with uncontrolled type 2
      diabetes at the time of hospital discharge leads to improved glucose control and a reduction
      of E.D visits and hospital readmission rates.

      Trial Design: The trial design will be a randomized, non-blinded prospective study; a 1:1
      comparison of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients who receive CGM sensors + conventional
      diabetes management at the time of discharge versus uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients who
      receive only the conventional diabetes management.

      Study Setting: Study setting will be at the Albert Einstein Medical Center (AEMC),
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the inpatient type 2 diabetes population who will be followed
      at the AEMC endocrinology clinics.

    <description>Subjects will receive the Libre Pro Freestyle continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensor that will be applied to their upper arm at the time of hospital discharge. They will be asked to peel off the sensor after 14 days and mail it to the endocrinology clinic in a stamped envelope that will be provided. They will also be provided the conventional diabetes management which will include instructions on fingerstick blood glucose monitoring and logging which they will start after the CGM sensor is removed. The sensor data will be analyzed by a clinician who will call the subject regarding any changes to their diabetes management. The subject will then be asked to follow-up at the endocrinology clinic 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month from the time the sensor is placed for further management of their diabetes.</description>
