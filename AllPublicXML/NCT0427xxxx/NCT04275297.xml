  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a severe pain condition affecting 3-8
      million people in the United States lacking treatments that work. Emotional suffering is
      common in IC/BPS and known to make physical symptoms worse, and studies show patient
      sub-groups respond differently to treatment. By creating and testing a psychosocial
      intervention specific to IC/BPS, we will learn if this intervention improves patient
      wellness, who the intervention works best for, and how the body's pain processing influences
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a debilitating, incurable, and costly
      pain condition affecting approximately 3-8 million individuals in the United States and is
      extremely challenging to treat. Evidence suggests psychosocial factors accompany and
      intensify the illness.

      Unaddressed psychosocial co-morbidities are associated with reduced functionality and poorer
      outcomes, which suggests that psychosocial symptoms and bladder-specific symptoms reinforce
      each other. While psychosocial self-management interventions have demonstrated efficacy for
      other pain conditions, the IC/BPS field lacks the gold standard - randomized controlled
      trials - studying these interventions. At the same time, the chronic pain field is adopting a
      new approach driven by mechanisms of illness and treatment. Growing evidence suggests that
      subgroups (called &quot;phenotypes&quot;) of patients with IC/BPS respond differently to medical
      intervention. Presence of central sensitization (CS) largely defines patient subgroups and
      may be a biological factor affecting response to medical treatment. The overall goal of this
      project is to fully develop, optimize, and evaluate a patient-centered CBT self-management
      intervention specific to IC/BPS. To achieve this goal, we will develop (Aim 1) and test (Aim
      2) an empirically-based psychosocial treatment for IC/BPS compared to attention control,
      while examining pain mechanisms and subgroup characteristics that may alter treatment
      response (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a) inclusion of a self-management intervention will be
      more effective than a control treatment for IC/BPS, and that b) treatment effects will be
      moderated by degree of psychological co-morbidity, presence of chronic overlapping pain
      conditions, and elevated central sensitization. Successful completion of these aims will
      determine whether the addition of a tailored self-management intervention for IC/BPS will
      improve outcomes compared to control, whether particular subgroups are more responsive to
      this intervention, and whether a biological mechanism (CS) influences treatment
      responsiveness.

    <description>Psychophysical testing methods will replicate existing protocols used at VUMCand include the following elements: 1) an evaluation of temporal summation (as a biomarker for central sensitization), 2) thermal pain threshold and tolerance, and 3) pressure pain threshold. Regarding temporal summation: in each sequence, immediately after each heat pulse, subjects provide a verbal numeric pain intensity rating on a 0-100 scale (0 = &quot;No Pain or Warmth&quot; and 100 = &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;). The standardized slope of the line fitted to the series of 10 pulses at each temperature indexes temporal summation and serves as a quantitative marker of central sensitization</description>

    <description>The RICE scale is an 11-item self-report measure designed to identify women with IC/BPS symptoms and describe their symptoms. The high sensitivity definition (81% sensitivity, 54% specificity) includes the following two criteria: (1) pain, pressure, or discomfort in the pelvic area and (2) daytime urinary frequency 10+ or urgency due to pain, pressure, or discomfort, not due to fear of wetting Interstitial Cystitis. Women who screen positive for both of these items will meet high sensitivity criteria for IC/BPS</description>
