  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freeline is developing adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for a number of diseases and is
      actively advancing its Haemophilia B programme. The background prevalence of neutralising
      antibodies to the vector capsid necessitates screening before eligibility for gene therapy
      protocols can be fully assessed.

      This study is being conducted to screen patients for antibodies to a novel AAV vector and
      determine potential eligibility for gene therapy clinical trials.

      This study will also be used to collect observational data relevant to the condition under
      study. This data maybe used to establish a baseline for patients who go on to receive a gene
      therapy on a subsequent clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients providing consent will attend a screening/baseline visit at the study site where a
      blood sample will be drawn to establish AAV neutralising antibody (NAb) status. Demographic
      data and relevant information to characterise the patient's disease status and potential
      trial eligibility will also be captured. This will include completion of questionnaires.
      Research blood samples for biomarker and pharmacogenomic testing will be collected from
      consenting patients. Following the initial study visit, patients will complete a diary
      recording bleeding events and factor IX (FIX) usage for up to 18 months or until they enrol
      into a treatment study.

      This is a prospective, screening study and does not confer any additional risk above the
      normal course of the disease and treatment practices. Patient management will be in line with
      normal standards of care according to the physician treating the patient. No treatment
      intervention will occur as part of this study.

          1. Male adults aged 16 years of age or older.

          2. Able to give full informed consent or obtain full informed consent from the patient's
             legally acceptable representative (as appropriate) and able to comply with all
             requirements of the trial.

          3. Interested in participation in gene therapy clinical trials.

          4. Confirmed diagnosis of Haemophila B defined as one of the following:

               1. Documented severe Factor IX (FIX) deficiency with plasma FIX activity of &lt; 1% of
                  normal or

               2. Moderately severe FIX deficiency with plasma FIX activity level between ≥ 1% and
                  ≤ 2% and a severe bleeding phenotype defined by 1 of the following:

             (i) On prophylaxis for a history of bleeding, or (ii) On-demand therapy with a current
             history of 4 or more bleeding episodes/year on average over the past 3 years, or (iii)
