  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is highly prevalent in US adults and is a major cause of missed work
      days and disability. While several treatment options exist, chronic opioids are commonly used
      for these conditions even though there are limited data supporting efficacy, and clear
      evidence of harm associated with chronic opioid administration.

      Virtual reality has been proposed as a treatment option that may lead to decreased pain and
      improved physical functioning, while avoiding the harms associated with medication
      management. This study is intended to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data to guide
      the design of a larger clinical trial.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Kauruna Virtual Reality
      program for the treatment of chronic low back pain. This study is intended to document the
      safety and efficacy of the use of virtual reality for the treatment of chronic low back pain.
      The primary outcome measure will be physical functioning as measured by the PROMIS 6.
      Secondary outcome measures include patient-reported pain intensity, adverse side effects,
      disability as measured by the Oswestry Low back disability questionnaire, and mental
      functioning as assessed using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Finally, impact on opioid use in patients
      on chronic opioids will be assessed by documentation of daily opioid dose in oral morphine
      equivalents.

      Forty adult patients with chronic low back pain who are receiving care through the Penn Pain
      Medicine Center are eligible to participate in the study. The study will consist of a
      screening visit, followed by randomization into 1 of 2 study groups. Both study groups will
      participate in two 20-minute virtual reality sessions a week for 8 weeks. Study group 1 will
      participate in 20 minutes of mindfulness mediation. Study Group 2 will undergo initial
      sessions focused on graded motor imagery, followed by sessions focused on graded exposure.
      Patient-reported outcomes data will be obtained at baseline, then weekly during the 8-week
      study period, then 4 weeks following completion of the study sessions.
