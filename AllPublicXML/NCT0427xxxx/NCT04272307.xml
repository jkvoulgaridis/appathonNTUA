  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot prospective study will investigate the role of microbiota and known
      enteropathogens in Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC). Investigators will compare a group
      of patients hospitalized for an ASUC with patients experiencing a Non-Severe Ulcerative
      Colitis (NSUC) flare by investigating microbiome, metabolome and transcriptome and
      integrating this data through a multi-omic framework. This systems biology approach aims at
      enhance our understanding of this severe event, define diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers to
      improve medical therapy and avoid colectomy and/or death.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is one of the two entities of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), along
      with Crohn's disease. One in 4 patients experiences an Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC)
      during the disease course, defined as a severe flare with systemic inflammation. ASUC is a
      medical and surgical emergency as complications and death may occur when patients do not
      respond to medical therapy and require salvage colectomy. Little is known about the
      pathophysiology and specifically the triggers of ASUC. At baseline, investigators will
      investigate the presence of a microbiome signature in patients with an ASUC compared with
      patients with a non-severe UC flare (NSUC). To identify the role of microorganisms,
      investigators will look specifically for known enteropathogens, i.e. Clostridium difficile
      and Cytomegalovirus. Investigators will investigate the impact of microbiota disruptors, such
      as antibiotics, NSAIDs and diet on microbiota and patients' outcomes. To evaluate the role of
      the host inflammatory pathways, investigators will study the colonic mucosa transcriptome and
      the host metabolome, focusing on anti-microbial defence pathways, regarding the suggested
      role of defective immune defence pathways in IBD pathogenesis. Investigators will focus on
      the IL23 and Jak pathways, since new drugs targeting these molecules are now available for
      IBD patients but still not recommended in the ASUC setting. Our last approach will be to
      evaluate the predictability of the response to therapy according to baseline and early
      changes of stool microbiome and host metabolome.

    <description>One stool sample will be taken at baseline, day 5, day 42 and at 3 months and frozen at -80°C and divided in 2 aliquots.
One stool aliquot will be used for metabolomics. Polar metabolites, lipids, free fatty acids and bile acids will be identified and quantitated using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry method. The other one will be used for microbiota analysis. Samples will be sent to the McGill University (Prof. SALEH's lab) for extraction and then, Génome Québec Innovation Centre (McGill University, Montréal, Canada) for sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene on Illumina MiSeq in paired-end mode.</description>

    <description>During routine flexible sigmoidoscopy, 6 biopsies will be collected with a 5 mm biopsy forceps at baseline and at 3 months. Biopsies will be placed into a sterile vial containing RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored at -80°C. Two biopsies will be used for mucosal microbiome analysis in the same way as the stool sample. Four biopsies will be used for RNAseq. Samples will be shipped to Prof. SALEH's lab in Montréal for nucleic acid extraction. The McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre (McGill University, Montréal, Canada) will provide library preparation and next generation sequencing. The average number of uniquely mapped reads per sequencing run will be 30 million reads per sample.</description>
