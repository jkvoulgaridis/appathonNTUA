  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a blind randomized clinical study on patients with midface maxillofacial
      fractures coming to Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The subject is the fracture line who met the
      inclusion criteria and randomly allocated into the study (locally-made miniplate and screw)
      and control (BIOMET® miniplate and screw) group through a predetermined randomization list.
      The healing process is follow up using non-contrast head computed tomography immediately
      after surgery as a baseline, and 3 months post-op. Afterward, a radiologist consultant as a
      blinded evaluator will evaluate the score of bone density, and screw loosening, while local
      tissue reaction after fixation evaluates during the patient's visit outpatient clinic. All
      scores from points of the evaluation group will be collected and going to statistically
      evaluated using independent t-test or Mann Whitney test depending on the distribution of the
      data

    <description>The investigators define Biomet® miniplate 1.5 as miniplate produced by Biomet, included in the Lorenz® Plating System Midface. The particular plate that is using in the study is a straight plate with 4 holes, 17mm length and 0.6mm thick, coded 01-7047 in the catalog.
The investigators define Biomet® screw 1.5 as screw produced by Biomet, included in the Lorenz® Plating System Midface. The dimension of the screw is 4mm length, 1.5 mm diameter, and coded 91-6104 1.5 mm X-Drive Self drilling screws.</description>

    <intervention_name>ORIF (Open reduction internal fixation): locally-made miniplate and screw</intervention_name>
    <description>&quot;Open reduction&quot; implies that broken bone is being realigned using surgery (as opposed to a closed reduction performed without surgery). &quot;Internal fixation&quot; refers to the hardware used to ensure that the bone is stabilized and held in place so that it is able to heal.
Sample of the study is the midface fracture line founds on patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bone density of each subject will be evaluated and recorded in Hounsfield Unit (HU). the Bone density between the sample (fracture line) received either Imported miniplate and screw and locally made miniplate and screw will be compared
the subject about to received whether the imported or locally-made miniplate and screw will be randomized using predetermined randomization list</description>
