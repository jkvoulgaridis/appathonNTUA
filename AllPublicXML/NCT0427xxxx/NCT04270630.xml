  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, prospective, un-blinded, randomized controlled trial
      evaluating a decision aid tool for older patients considering left heart catheterization
      (LHC) as treatment for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The study population
      is 50 total inpatients (25 per study arm) with NSTEMI eligible for elective LHC. The first
      arm is the control group that will receive standard of care, while the second arm will have
      access to the decision aid and shared-decision making conversation with one of the
      co-investigators. Baseline characteristics and surveys/questionnaire data will be collected
      after study intervention (as applicable), and prior to final decision regarding LHC.
      Statistical analyses will be conducted on the primary endpoint, decisional conflict score, as
      well as on various secondary endpoints.

      A single-center, prospective, un-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Primary objective: To
      pilot a coronary revascularization decision aid in older adults with NSTEMI who are
      candidates for elective LHC in order to determine its effectiveness in lowering decisional
      conflict by the decisional conflict scale (DCS).

      Secondary objectives: To determine decision aid feasibility by measuring time of
      administration and percentage of patients agreeing to use. Also, to assess efficacy of the
      decision aid in decreasing patient feelings of anxiety and depression (by the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale), increasing decision self-efficacy (by the Ottawa Decision
      Self-Efficacy Scale), and increasing medical knowledge.

    <intervention_name>Shared Decision Aid</intervention_name>
    <description>The decision aid was developed by this study group based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration's minimum standards for quality, and the Ottawa Framework (a process by which patients' and clinicians' decision determinants are assessed, a decision aid is developed that is tailored to these needs, and the quality of the decision-making process with the aid is evaluated). The aid then underwent an iterative feedback process with a patient advisory panel. Adjustments to format, length, and readability were made. A final feedback session occurred with three patients over the age of 70, after which point the paper decision aid was digitalized. The intervention will be delivered in-person by one of the co-investigators of the study. The intervention will occur once, prior to the patient making a final decision regarding undergoing left heart catheterization as treatment for NSTEMI. The approximate duration of the intervention is 30 minutes.</description>
