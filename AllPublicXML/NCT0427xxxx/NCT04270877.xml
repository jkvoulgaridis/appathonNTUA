  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of low dose naltrexone (LDN) on pain in women with
      fibromyalgia (FM). The study is designed as a parallel randomized (1:1) double blind,
      placebo-controlled superiority trial. Half of the participants will receive treatment with
      LDN while the other half will receive treatment with placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low dose naltrexone (LDN) is used widely as off label treatment in patients with
      fibromyalgia, despite the lack of larger randomized controlled trials (RCT) supporting an
      effect.

      LDN has antagonistic effect on both opioid receptors and on toll-like receptors in glia
      cells. Mediated via those receptors, LDN can potentially reduce neuroinflammation and induce
      homeostasis in the endorphin system in patients with fibromyalgia.

      The aim of the trial is to investigate whether treatment with LDN has a superior effect
      compared to placebo on pain among female patients with fibromyalgia, evaluated after 12 weeks
      of treatment. The study is also exploring secondary aims regarding a possible improvement of
      other fibromyalgia core symptoms and a possible improvement of global assessment, daily
      functioning and health-related quality of life. Among the exploratory secondary objectives
      are changes in muscle exhaustion, physical fitness, pain sensitivity, inhibition of pain,
      augmentation of pain, and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

    <measure>Average pain during the last 7 days</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline when assessed after 12 weeks of treatment with LDN or LDN-placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by asking the participants about the level of average pain during the last 7 days on a 11 point rating scale, ranging from 0-10 (0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 = &quot;unbearable pain&quot;) using the first item from the symptom part of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised. A lower score indicates lower severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in overall fibromyalgia symptoms from baseline when assessed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment with LDN or LDN-placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Patient Global Impression of Change on a 1-7 Verbal Rating Scale. The participants are asked how they rate their overall fibromyalgia symptoms after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment compared with before treatment. A score of 4 indicates &quot;no change&quot;, a score of 1 is characterized by &quot;a lot worse&quot; and a score of 7 is characterized by &quot;a lot better.&quot; A higher score indicates higher degree of improvement.</description>

    <measure>Impact of fibromyalgia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline when assessed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment with LDN or LDN-placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) total score. The FIQR asks patients to rate how difficult it is to perform a list of 9 common activities over the previous 7 days on an 11 point scale, ranging from 0-10 (0 = &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 10 = &quot;very difficult&quot;). The FIQR then asks patients to indicate how often their fibromyalgia impacts their quality of life over the last 7 days on an 11 point scale, ranging from 1-10 (0 = &quot;never&quot; and 10 = &quot;always&quot;). Finally, the FIQR asks patients to assess the severity of 10 different symptoms on an 11 point scale, ranging from 0-10 (0 = &quot;no symptoms&quot; and 10 = &quot;extreme symptoms&quot;). These three sub-scales are summed to represent an overall FIQR score. A lower score indicates lower severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline when assessed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment with LDN or LDN-placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a diary of daily average pain rated on an 11 point rating scale, ranging from 0-10, during 7 days before visits at baseline, and after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment.

    <measure>Muscle exhaustion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline when assessed after 12 weeks of treatment with LDN or LDN-placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by an isometric muscle exhaustion test of the deltoid muscle. Measured by asking the participant to complete an isometric muscle exhaustion task by maintaining 90° shoulder abduction (dominant arm) for as long as possible with the elbow extended and the hand pronated (hand facing downwards). Task failure (test position can no longer be maintained) defines the test duration. The participants are instructed to maintain the position until they feel maximal muscle exhaustion (corresponding to a score of 10 on a 0-10 scale with 0 being &quot;no muscle fatigue&quot; and 10 being 'maximal muscle fatigue/exhaustion'). Surface electromyography (EMG) will be recorded from the anterior, middle and posterior deltoid muscle at 3000 Hz during the entire test. A longer duration of test is indicative of lower levels of exhaustion.</description>

    <description>Measured by the 30-second chair stand test. The test starts with the subject seated on a chair with her back touching the backrest. Subjects rise to a full stand with the back straight and then sit down again to regain this cycle as many times as they can within 30 seconds. A higher number of cycles is indicative of better physical fitness.</description>
