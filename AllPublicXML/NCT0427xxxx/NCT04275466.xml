  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) should be treated by debridement and drainage. In
      recent years, the results of clinical research show that minimally invasive debridement such
      as video-assisted (laparoscope, nephroscope, endoscopy, etc.) and total laparoscopic
      debridement can significantly improve the prognosis of IPN patients. After a long period of
      clinical practice, laparoscope-assisted debridement was selected as the main surgical method
      in our center. In many large-scale clinical studies, patients after surgery underwent
      necrotic cavity lavage (such as small omental sac lavage, retroperitoneal space lavage,
      peripancreatic lavage, etc.), but its necessity and clinical significance were not clearly
      stated in the guidelines. At present, the clinical research mainly focuses on the improvement
      of minimally invasive debridement, and less on the necessity of lavage. In the past, necrotic
      cavity lavage was performed in IPN patients, but long-term clinical observation showed that
      lavage may lead to spread of infection and increase the incidence of lower extremity venous
      thrombosis which is not accorded with ERAS(Enhanced Recovery After Surgery). Therefore, since
      2012, our center has stopped necrotic cavity lavage for IPN patients after debridement. We
      retrospectively analyzed the therapeutic effect from February 2014 to August 2017 and found
      that even without necrotic cavity lavage, better therapeutic effect could be achieved.
      Meanwhile it can simplify the operation process and avoid infection spread. This treatment
      method provides a new idea. However, it is a retrospective study not a randomized controlled
      trials(RCT) which is low effectiveness of proof. Therefore, we design this RCT to verify the
      necessity of necrotic cavity lavage after laparoscope-assisted debridement for patients with
      infected pancreatic necrosis.

    <description>At least two 30- to 36-Fr drainage tubes will be placed into each necrotic cavity. One of these drainage tubes will be used as the lavage tube; the other tube is designed for drainage.
Lavage will begin on the first day after debridement, and the relevant indices will be evaluated every 7 days to decide whether to continue the lavage.
1200 mL of normal saline will be lavaged into each necrotic cavity every day at a speed of 200 mL/h for 3 hours each time and for a total of two times. The start times of lavage will be 08:00 and 20:00.
The lavage and drainage volumes of the first hour and second hour of each lavage session will be calculated. The lavage of the next hour will be stopped if the lavage volume minus the drainage volume is &gt;100 mL.
Lavage will be suspended if abdominal pain and distention occur, the maximum body temperature is &gt;38.5ºC, or the abdominal pressure is ≥15 mmHg during the lavage procedure.</description>
