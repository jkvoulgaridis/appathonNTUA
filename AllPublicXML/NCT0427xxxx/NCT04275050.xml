  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB3303 tablet is a small molecule oral drug inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6
      (CDK4 / 6). Based on current research, overexpression of positive regulatory proteins in the
      cell cycle is one of the important reasons for resistance to endocrine therapy. CDK4 / 6 is
      the key regulators of the cell cycle inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.
