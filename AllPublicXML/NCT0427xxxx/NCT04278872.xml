                  necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets.

               3. Severe: Sensation of heat with sweating causing disruption of current activity;
                  if at night, wake up hot and sweating and need to take action (eg, removing layer
                  of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).

          7. Have an endometrial thickness â‰¤4 mm by transvaginal ultrasound at Screening.

          8. Be willing to undergo an endometrial biopsy at Screening and at Week 12 (EOT) in the
             event that the subject's transvaginal ultrasound shows endometrial thickness &gt;4 mm.
