                  necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets.

               3. Severe: Sensation of heat with sweating causing disruption of current activity;
                  if at night, wake up hot and sweating and need to take action (eg, removing layer
                  of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed).

             Investigator, at Screening or within 12 months before Screening.

          7. Have an endometrial thickness ≤4 mm by transvaginal ultrasound at Screening.

          8. Be willing to undergo an endometrial biopsy at Screening and at Week 12 (EOT) in the
             event that the subject's transvaginal ultrasound shows endometrial thickness &gt;4 mm.
