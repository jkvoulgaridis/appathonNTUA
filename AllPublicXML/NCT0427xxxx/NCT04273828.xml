  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical interventions for the removal of intervertebral disc fragments or to enlarge a
      narrow spine canal are commonly performed worldwide and are considered efficient. Concomitant
      low back pain is not uncommon among patients with lumbar nerve compression and neurological
      symptoms. When present, controversy persists in the literature regarding its ideal
      management. Although neurological symptoms improve after decompressive surgery, the presence
      of residual chronic low back pain may worsen satisfaction scores and cause functional
      disability.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that the presence of atrophy of the paraspinal and
      trunk muscles predicts chronic low back pain after lumbar neural decompression. If confirmed,
      this finding will aid in better planning of physical rehabilitation strategies for this group
      of patients, as well as a clearer prediction regarding surgical treatment outcomes for
      patients and health professionals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study. Patients with lumbar degenerative diseases and symptoms
      of nerve compression (radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication) who will undergo surgical
      treatment for neural decompression (discectomy, foraminotomy or laminectomy).

      The cohort will be followed by a team researcher (not blinded to the purpose of the study) at
      preoperative (up to 1 month before surgery), immediate postoperative (12 to 24 hours after
      procedure), 06, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Imaging tests will be performed on the
      preoperative evaluation and at six months follow-up after the operation.

      The treatment will consist of lumbar decompression surgery, which may consist of discectomy,
      foraminotomy or laminectomy, according to the type and location of the compression. The
      choice of surgical technique will be made by the assistant surgeon.

      Patients will be divided into four groups regarding the type of soft tissue retractor and
      image magnification:

      Group 1: (minimally invasive microdiscectomy): surgeries performed with loupes or microscope
      plus minimally invasive soft tissue retractors (tubular or &quot;Caspar&quot;).

      Group 2: (open microdiscectomy) surgeries performed with loupes or microscope plus
      conventional soft tissue retractors (auto static, &quot;Taylor&quot; or &quot;McCulloch&quot;).

      Group 3: (endoscopic discectomy): surgeries performed by means of the &quot;full endoscopic&quot;
      technique;

      Group 4: (open discectomy &quot;with the naked eye&quot;): surgeries performed without image
      magnification. Use of conventional soft tissue retractors (auto static, &quot;Taylor&quot; or
      &quot;McCulloch&quot;).

      Image Evaluation:

        1. X-Rays (anteroposterior, lateral, dynamic lateral films) - to evaluate and measure the
           presence of scoliosis, spondylolisthesis or Degenerative vertebral dislocations.

        2. MRI: to detect and to grade the presence of fat infiltration of the Psoas and Multifidus
           muscles (Arabanas et al); to grade Modic Signal and facet joint degeneration (Weishaupt
           et al).

      Sample size:

      To calculate the sample size, we considered the main outcome of the study: proportion of
      patients with residual pain (VAS ≥ 2) six months after surgery, and we assumed that around
      15% of patients with fat infiltration (grades 1, 2 or 3) should remain with residual pain and
      that the proportion of patients without fat infiltration (grade 0) who remain with residual
      pain should be less than 15%.

      Considering a test power of 80%, significance level of 5%, and two-tailed test, 138 patients
      in each group (presence of pain and muscle degeneration and presence of pain without muscle
      degeneration) will be necessary, totaling 276 patients. That would be the number required to
      detect a 10% difference in the proportion of residual pain between the groups with and
      without fat infiltration.

      Statistics:

      Numerical variables with normal distribution will be described by means and standard
      deviations and variables with non-normal distribution by medians and interquartile ranges, in
      addition to the minimum and maximum values. The distributions of numerical variables will be
      verified by histograms, boxplots and, if necessary, Shapiro-Wilk normality tests. Categorical
      variables will be described by absolute frequencies and percentages. The analyzes will be
      performed with the SPSS26 program, considering a 5% significance level.
