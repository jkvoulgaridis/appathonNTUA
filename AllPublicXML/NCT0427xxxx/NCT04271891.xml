    <textblock>
      Whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) is a head-to-toe movement. The function WBPA works as
      adding pulses to the circulation. This motion increases shear stress to the endothelium,
      which stimulates increased release of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (eNO), prostaglandin
      E-2, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) into the circulation, and these substances are
      cardioprotective and contribute to vasodilatation. The WBPA were not well studied than whole
      body vibration (WBV), a vertical rocking training machine, and most researches focused on
      cardioprotective effects. A study revealed the effect of Moderate-Intensity Exercise and
      Whole-Body Periodic Acceleration on Nitric Oxide release was the same. This instrument is
      quite safe and was applied to patients with varied diseases in previous study. No sound
      contraindication was mentioned till now.

      Our hypothesis is assuming that the circulation of brain could improve after the intervention
      of WBPA, and stroke recovery and cadio-pulmonary function will improve subsequently.

      So the investigators will recruit subacute stroke patients as our subjects. The patient who
      is booked to our rehabilitation ward for further rehabilitation programs is eligible for our
      study. the investigators will recruit 30 patients, and randomize them to experimental and
      control group. This study is going to be single blinded, which the evaluator is blinded to
      the condition of the subjects. Whether experimental or control groups will received the same
      intensive rehabilitation programs (6 days a week). The experimental group will receive
      additional WBPA treatment. The duration will be 30 minutes a time, and the frequency will be
      5 days a week, and the treating period will be 3 weeks. The evaluator will assess twice,
      before and after the experiment period. The measurements include: muscle power, brunnstrom
      stages, Barthel Index, functional independence measure (FIM), time up and go test, 6 minutes
      walk test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, berg balance scale, cardio-pulmonary test. In addition, to
      confirm the immediate effect of WBPA over brain circulation, the investigators will choose 6
      patients to received carotid ultrasonography before and immediately after the WBPA treatment.
