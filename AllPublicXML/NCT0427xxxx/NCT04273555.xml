    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new group of imaging tests can help identify
      response to stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer
      before and during treatment. This study will test a new method for monitoring treatment. The
      investigators will use [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at previously diagnosed stage IV breast cancer
      and image up to three times during therapy. FDG is a non-natural amino acid with a
      radioactive tag that is used clinically for staging of disease. However, the role of
      FDG-PET/MRI for imaging response in breast cancer is not currently clear. PET/MRI is a new
      imaging technique that combines PET and MRI into a single study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 75 years old

          -  Patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer

          -  HER2-positive breast cancer prospectively determined on the primary tumor by a local
             pathology laboratory and defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or
             positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) (defined by ISH ratio of ≥ 2.0 for the number
             of HER2 gene copies to the number of chromosome 17 copies). Only one positive result
             is required for eligibility

          -  Estrogen/progesterone receptor positive OR negative disease allowed

          -  Patients must have measurable disease in one metastatic lesion per RECIST v 1.1

          -  Stage IV HER2+ breast cancer patients eligible for a new therapeutic regimen that
             includes HER2-targeted treatment who are naïve to that regimen

          -  Estimated life expectancy of greater than six months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children, less than 18 years of age, will be excluded from this study

          -  Metastatic breast cancer patients who are HER2 positive and have already started their
             current HER2-targeted therapy regimen for metastatic disease

          -  Patients who have not recovered from grade 2 or higher toxicities of prior therapy to
             the point that they would be appropriate for re-dosing will be ineligible for study
             treatment

          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 7 months
             after the last dose of study treatment

          -  Patient is considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease or active infection that requires systemic
             therapy. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, active, non-infectious
             pneumonitis; uncontrolled major seizure disorder; unstable spinal cord compression;
             superior vena cava syndrome; or any psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that
             would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study (including
             obtaining informed consent).

          -  Patients found to have constitutionally present non-magnetic resonance (MR) compatible
             ferromagnetic materials

          -  Unable to lie still on the imaging table for one (1) hour

          -  Inability to receive gadolinium-based contrast agent

          -  Patients for whom a PET/MRI is technically not feasible (e.g. breast volume, obesity,
             &gt; body mass index (BMI) 36)
