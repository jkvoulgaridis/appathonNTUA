  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous motion analysis studies have demonstrated excellent ability to distinguish subtle
      differences in gait between normal subjects and those suffering from arthritis. With proper
      techniques and analysis differences between osteoarthritis patient groups can be
      distinguished. Previous research has indicated that subjects who received a single-radius
      design total knee replacement have superior gait performance that those who received a
      multi-radius design total knee replacement. The DJO Global Empowr PS Knee System is a
      single-radius lateral pivot design. This design should achieve reproducible more natural knee
      function and improved patient outcomes and satisfaction. A motion analysis laboratory will be
      used to collect gait data from patients who are going to receive a Empowr PS knee device and
      also from age-matched control subjects. These data will be compared with data previously
      collected from patients who received Stryker Triathlon devices, Biomet Vanguard devices and
      age-matched healthy control subjects.

  <detailed_description>

      Thirty subjects who are scheduled to receive an Empowr PS Total Knee Replacement device will
      be consented to be in the prospective component of the study. Twenty of these patients will
      participate in motion data collection. These patients will all be scheduled to undergo
      primary total knee replacement using the Empowr device. All surgeries will be performed using
      computer navigation. Patients will receive standardized physical therapy to insure
      consistency of rehab protocols and discharge from physical therapy criteria. Specifically,
      patients will be monitored for visit compliance, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in seconds, AROM
      in degrees, and walking un-aided.

      Data were previously collected preoperatively, at 6 months and 1 year post-operatively for 16
      patients who received a Stryker Triathlon total knee replacement and preoperatively and 1
      year post-op for 16 patients who received a Biomet Vanguard total knee replacement. Data were
      also previously collected for 20 age matched healthy controls subjects. Data will be
      collected for an additional 20 control subjects. Knee Society Score (KSS) and Knee Injury and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be collected at pre-op, 6 months, 1 year, and 2
      years post-op. Gait analysis data will include kinetic, kinematic, temporal spatial, and
      electromyographic (EMG) data throughout the gait cycle for both research subjects and
      controls. Reflective markers will be placed on subject's anatomical landmarks, and ten
      surface EMG electrodes placed according to published standards (8). Subjects will walk at a
      self-selected speed down a runway embedded with force plates while 10 Eagle-4 digital
      infrared cameras record their movement. In addition to the level surface walking, additional
      data on more complex activities of daily living will be collected for potential future
      analysis. This would include: sit-to-stand, balance, and stair-climbing measurements also
      using the force plates, camera system and EMG data collection.

        Controls:

          1. At least 50 years of age.

          2. Subjects who provide signed and IRB approved informed consent for gait analysis data
             collection

        Retrospective subjects:

          1. Subjects who had primary total knee replacement with either Stryker Triathlon Total
             Knee System or Biomet Vanguard Complete Knee System.

          2. Subjects at least 50 years of age at the time of the surgery.

          3. Subjects who previously provided signed and informed consent for gait analysis data
             collection under approval of the Sun Health Institutional Review Board

          4. Cases that followed product labeling.

        Prospective subjects:

          1. Subjects who are eligible for DJO Global's Empowr total knee replacement.

          2. Subjects at least 50 years of age at the time of the surgery.

          3. Subjects who are willing to provide signed and IRB approved informed consent for gait
             analysis data collection.

          4. Cases that followed product labeling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Controls:

          1. Controls with any musculoskeletal injury or disorder.

          2. Controls that are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant.

          3. Controls with a BMI&gt;40

        Retrospective subjects:

          4. Subjects who had an active infection or suspected latent infection in or about the
             joint at the time of surgery.

          5. Subjects whose bone stock was compromised by disease, infection or prior implantation
             which could not provide adequate support and/or fixation of the prosthesis.

          6. Subjects who had any mental or neuromuscular disorders which created an unacceptable
             risk of prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure, or complication in
             postoperative care.

          7. Subjects with severe instability of the knee joint secondary to the absence of
             collateral ligament integrity and function.
