    <textblock>
      This observational study documented outcomes resulting from qigong practice as a
      complementary self-care practice. All subjects continued with their usual medical care.
      Recruitment was passive, and participants consisted of those who encountered the practice as
      part of an earlier clinical trial, or entered the program prior to the observational period
      (posted information, word-of-mouth), or entered during the observational period (posted
      information).
