      Vikocoolant spray, also known as cold spray; It is a form of cryotherapy (cold treatment)
      used in sports medicine, athletic training, sports competitions and rehabilitation
      environments. It has been demonstrated in the literature that local cold application may
      cause increased resistance to movement. It has been reported in some studies that muscle can
      change its mechanical properties in a short time. However, the effect of cold spray
      application on the mechanical properties of the muscle is unknown. Therefore, in the current
      study proposal, the investigators aim to investigate the acute effect of cold spray
      application on the mechanical properties of the quadriceps muscle in athletes.

      Tissue cooling (cryotherapy treatment) is a long-standing pain therapy for the treatment of
      acute injuries and during rehabilitation. It is used in addition to other treatments . The
      main purpose of cryotherapy is to cool the tissue temperature and is used in the clinic in
      the form of various cryotherapy modalities such as whole body cryotherapy, cold spray,
      cryotherapy clamps, frozen peas, cold water immersion, ice and cold packs . The first
      physiological response of cooling is a decrease in tissue temperature . Studies have shown
      that local cold application causes increased resistance to movement . Although it has been
      reported in animal studies conducted in vitro that muscle tissue shows high resistance to
      stretching after cooling down , only one study evaluating direct mechanical responses to
      muscles in human studies There. In this study carried out by Mustalampi et al., Parameter
      measurements indicating the mechanical properties of the muscle immediately after applying
      the cold pack applied locally to the quadriceps muscle for 20 minutes and after 15 minutes.
      As a result of the study, the muscle has become stiffer, less elastic in terms of mechanical
      properties and it has been shown that these changes do not completely recover after 15
      minutes. It was also stated that careful warm-up should be recommended after cooling to
      normalize the mechanical properties of the muscle and prevent injury .

      Also known as cold spray, vikocoolant spray is a form of cryotherapy used in sports medicine,
      athletic training and rehabilitation environments and is widely used in the world .
      Especially in field medicine, it is frequently used as the first treatment of sports
      injuries. However, as is often done, returning to the game and competition with the help of
      the emerging analgesia is inconvenient in terms of the treatment of injury . However, it is
      still used frequently due to ease of application. The use of cold spray as a therapeutic
      method is of particular interest, as it is typically applied for a much shorter time than
      other cryotherapy modes . It has been shown in the literature that local cold application can
      cause increased resistance to movement and it is reported that it can change the mechanical
      properties of the muscle in a short time. However, the effect of cold spray application on
      the mechanical properties of the muscle is unknown. Therefore, in the current study proposal,
      the investigators aim to investigate the acute effect of cold spray application on the
      mechanical properties of the quadriceps muscle in athletes.

    <description>23 volunteer athletes who are studying at the Faculty of Health Sciences of Acıbadem University, between the ages of 18-23, with a subcutaneous fold thickness of the quadriceps muscle between 5 mm and 15 mm (Shadgan et al., 2015).
From the anterior superior of the dominant legs to the spinal iliac, the upper part of the patella will be measured and the center point will be marked. Cold spray will be applied to this point and its surroundings. The ethyl chloride spray bottle will be kept approximately 30 cm from the skin. An ethyl chloride stream will be applied at a 45 ° angle for 15 seconds (Shadgan et al., 2015). Skin temperature and mechanical properties of muscle; will be measured before, immediately after, 2 minutes, 5 minutes and 15 minutes after cold application.</description>
