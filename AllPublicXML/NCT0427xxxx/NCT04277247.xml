      To study the effects of Botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) in the treatment of foot
      dystonia-associated pain in Parkinson's disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia-associated pain, particularly in the lower limbs is the second most common type of
      pain in Parkinson's disease (PD). Involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow repetitive
      movements or abnormal postures are common. The movements may be painful and present in
      different ways, from just foot inversion or hallux extension to complex forms. They may
      affect the quality of life of patients in different ways during both ON and OFF periods.
      Cures for foot dystonia symptoms in PD are not yet available. Yet, improving pain symptoms
      can improve patients' quality of life. BTXA has been proposed as a safe and useful option for
      the treatment of PD patients affected by foot dystonia as it could improve symptoms locally
      without modifying any antiparkinsonian medications. Injected into muscles, BTXA could reduce
      rigidity, stiffness and improve abnormal postures that may cause foot pain. Recognizing
      different uses of BTXA will help to understand the symptomatic treatment for each patient in
      any stage of the disease. The results will help doctors to use new tools to treat
      foot-dystonia pain in patients with PD.

    <masking_description>Upon entry to the study, all subjects will be assigned to a subject number. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either BTXA injections or placebo on VISIT 1 in a double-blind manner according to a randomization schedule using computerized randomization tables as prepared by a blinded clinical nurse. All patients will receive BTXA injections on VISIT 4 in an open-label phase. The specific type of randomization used will be block randomization to ensure equal sample sizes of the BTXA and placebo groups.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in King's Parkinson's disease pain scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks during the parallel group phase and at 24 weeks during the open-label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The measure foot dystonia-associated pain change perceived by the patients. The scale is composed of 14 questions exploring the frequency and severity of different pain syndromes that are frequently observed in Parkinson's disease patients, which can be summed to form an overall pain intensity score. Each item is scored by severity (0-3) multiplied by frequency (0-4), resulting in a subscore of 0 to 12, with a total possible score range from 0 to 168. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Likert Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks during the parallel group phase and at 24 weeks during the open-label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of foot dystonia-associated pain change perceived by the patients. The most simple Likert Visual Analogue Scale is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (symptom, pain, health) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). There are no numerical values on this scale however, a positioning towards the left of the scale indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks during the parallel group phase</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).CGI scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4 (unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the therapeutic effects). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Parts 1-4 (MDS-UPDRS) ON medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks during the parallel group phase</time_frame>
    <description>Measures changes of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments. Part 1 (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part 2 (motor experiences of daily living), Part 3 (motor examination) and Part 4 (motor complications). The maximum score for all the parts is 272. Higher scores are indicative of worse outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gait</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks during the parallel group phase</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in gait will be assessed according to the sections Postural Instability/Gait Difficulty sub-score of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS UPDRS) part 3. Higher score indicative or worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parkinson's Disease 39 item Quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks during the parallel group phase</time_frame>
    <description>This 39 - item questionnaire assesses Parkinson's disease-specific health-related quality over the last month. It assesses how often patients experience difficulties across 8 quality of life dimensions including functioning and well being. Scores can range from 0 to 100. The higher score is indicative of worse quality of life.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with PD according to the MDS Clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's
             disease

          -  Participants with foot dystonia not responding to antiparkinsonian agents or changes
             in antiparkinsonian medications schedule sufficiently as per Movement Disorders
             Specialist. Subjects with bilateral foot dystonia will be injected in the side where
             the symptoms are more severe.

          -  BTXA treatment naïve subjects or not received any within the last six months
             (including other indications).

          -  Stable PD and pain medications for at least 30 days.

          -  Competence to self-report pain severity in the King's Parkinson's disease pain scale
             (KPPS) and a Likert Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a primary cause of pain in the lower limbs unrelated to PD foot dystonia
             and associated with another medical condition, e.g. severe arthritis.

          -  Subjects that because of the severity or refractory pain are under an unfixed
             analgesic schedule.

          -  Subjects who are unable to self- report pain severity in the selected scales. Patients
             that may require a translator or are illiterate will be included as long as they can
             self-report pain severity.

          -  Subjects who are undergoing acute infections or other acute intercurrence.

          -  Any contraindication to receiving BTXA injections:

               1. Subjects who are hypersensitive to any BTXA or any ingredient in the formulation
                  or component of the container (Clostridium Botulinum toxin type A neurotoxin
                  complex 900 kD, Human Serum Albumin and Sodium Chloride).

               2. The presence of infection at the proposed injection site(s).

        We decided to exclude patients with high risk cardiovascular disease in the case of severe
        orthostatic hypotension occurring secondary to the BTXA injections (reported in less than
        1% of treated cases). Systemic toxic effects of BTXA are rarely reported and most of the
        cases in the literature are children. In order to absolutely avoid this potential
        complication, we will exclude patients who report sickness/infections during the study
        visit
