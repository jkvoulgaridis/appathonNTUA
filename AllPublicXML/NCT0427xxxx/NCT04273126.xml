  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to pilot an adapted family resilience program among families with a
      recent history of homelessness and parental substance use disorders in Los Angeles County and
      to assess for feasibility and acceptability. The investigators have adapted a family
      resilience program called Families Overcoming Under Stress (FOCUS), a trauma-informed
      intervention designed for families experiencing trauma, for families experiencing
      homelessness and parental substance use disorders. Our primary hypothesis is that the adapted
      family resilience program will be feasible and acceptable to families with a recent history
      of homelessness and parental substance use disorder. Families that are eligible to
      participate in the study will be assigned randomly to one of two groups, 1) adapted family
      resilience intervention group; 2) treatment as usual group. For the intervention group, the
      program consists of around 8 sessions lasting up to one hour each. The program provides
      psychoeducation and teaches resilience skills including communication, problem solving, goal
      setting, and how to deal with stress. For the families assigned to the treatment as usual
      group, they will continue to receive case management services from their residential
      facilities. Families in both groups will be asked to fill out 3 surveys (one at the beginning
      of the program, one at the end of the program, and at 6 months follow-up). Some families in
      the intervention group may also be asked to participate in a hour long interview after the
      completion of the program for feedback on the program.
