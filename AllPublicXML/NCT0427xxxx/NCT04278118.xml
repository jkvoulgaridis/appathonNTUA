  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy
      works in treating patients with brain tumors. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers
      higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor
      cells. A shorter duration of radiation treatment may avoid some of the delayed side effects
      of radiation while providing a more convenient treatment and reducing costs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To report 3 year local tumor control of moderately hypofractionated proton or photon
      therapy for benign intracranial tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate feasibility of moderate hypofractionation pencil beam scanning proton
      therapy for intracranial tumors.

      II. To report physician reported acute and late toxicity of moderate hypofractionation pencil
      beam scanning proton therapy for intracranial tumors according to Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

      III. To report neurocognitive effects, health related quality of life, and patient reported
      toxicity for moderate hypofractionation pencil beam scanning proton therapy for intracranial
      tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients with benign and radiographically diagnosed intracranial tumors undergo
      hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy daily, Monday-Friday over 17 fractions
      for 3.5-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients with pathologically confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2-3
      meningiomas undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy daily, Monday-Friday
      over 20 fractions for 3.5-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Will assess local tumor control rate. Local tumor control is defined as freedom from progressive disease (PD). Will be calculated as the proportion of patients who did not experience PD within 3-year follow up with 95% binomial proportion confidence interval for the entire population and each cohort independently. The same calculation will be repeated for the entire study population and each cohort separately. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the local control rates for the entire population and each cohort independently.</description>
