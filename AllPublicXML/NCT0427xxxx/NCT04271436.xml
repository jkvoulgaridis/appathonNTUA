  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, advanced positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and
      positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging methods will be used to
      validate the hypothesis that participants receiving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy,
      who ultimately achieve clinical benefit, will show an increase, or &quot;FLARE&quot;, in tumor FLT
      and/or FDG uptake from baseline, as seen after cycle#1 of treatment, and that after 2 cycles
      of treatment responders will have a decline in FLT and FDG uptake, in comparison to the
      participants classified as &quot;non-responders&quot;.

    <description>-Eligible patients will have imaging assessments (as part of the study) performed at three time-points: pre-treatment, following cycle 1 of treatment, and following cycle 2 of treatment. Baseline FDG PET/CT will be a standard-of-care procedure. If possible, PET/CT imaging will be performed, followed immediately by PET/MR imaging during each imaging session. At minimum, PET/MR should be obtained at least once during each time-point (i.e. either during the FDG or FLT procedure). FDG imaging and FLT imaging should be performed at least 24 hours apart and no more than 7 days apart.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer.

          -  Patients who are planned to receive checkpoint blockade therapy, per referring
             oncologist.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months and &lt; 5 years.

          -  Disease that is measurable per RECIST 1.1.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urinary or serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of each imaging time point.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient receiving other investigational radiotracers within 14 days prior to FLT and
             FDG imaging time points.

          -  Patients receiving ICB in combination with chemotherapy.

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy including systemic corticosteroids except for maintenance
             dosing for adrenal insufficiency. Patients requiring immunosuppressive therapy during
             the study will no longer be eligible.

          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment with the
             exceptions of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, autoimmune diseases, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients with a pacemaker, stainless steel aneurysm clip or any other magnetic
             resonance (MR) contraindicated implant or foreign body would warrant exclusion from
             this study. Pacemakers may be reprogrammed or turned off by the strong MRI magnetic
             field. Radio-frequency (RF) fields in MR can also cause severe heating of pacemaker
             lead tips. Steel aneurysm clips are prone to torque in the strong MR field which can
             displace the clips and may damage the vessel, resulting in hemorrhage, and/or death.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study
