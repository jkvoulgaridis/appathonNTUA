  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of
      NKG2D-based CAR-T cells infusion in the treatment of relapsed/refractory NKG2DL+ solid
      tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preclinical study clarified that NKG2D-based CAR-T cells showed strong cytotoxicity
      against NKG2DL+ cell lines in vitro as well as a therapeutic effect against NKG2DL+ cell
      xenografts in vivo. In addition, the data also demonstrated the safety of NKG2D-based CAR-T
      therapy. NKG2D-based CAR-T represent a potentially effective and safety therapeutic approach
      for patient with relapsed/refractory NKG2DL+ solid tumors. In this trial, the investigators
      researched the safety of administering NKG2D-based CAR-T which generated with CD8 hinge
      region and transmembrane region, 4-1BB costimulatory region and CD3 zeta region. The
      investigators also assessed that disease response was determined within the context of a
      phase I trial.
