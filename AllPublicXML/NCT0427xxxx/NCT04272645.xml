  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is studying two experimental drugs, abemaciclib and atezolizumab, alone and in
      combination with each other, to learn about the safety and effectiveness of these treatments
      and their side effects. This is an investigational study treatment for adult men with
      metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressive disease despite
      previous treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). One group of men (men without a
      genetic mutation called &quot;CDK12 loss&quot;) will receive abemaciclib therapy alone. Two other
      groups of men (men with CDK12 loss in one group and men without CDK12 loss in the other) will
      receive the combination of abemaciclib and atezolizumab. Another group of men with CDK12 loss
      will receive atezolizumab therapy alone.

             immunosuppressive drugs). Patients with conditions requiring replacement therapy
             (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) are permitted to enroll.

          -  Live vaccine within 30 days of registration.

          -  Evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis. Patients with a history of
