  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, head-to-head, age de-escalation dose-escalation, partially
      randomized trial to study the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate rabies vaccine
      ChAdOx2 RabG in healthy adults (age 18-45 years) and young children (age 1-6 years). The
      vaccine will be administered intramuscularly.

             planned administration of the vaccine candidate.

          -  Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
             product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned use during the study period.

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C (HCV IgG).
