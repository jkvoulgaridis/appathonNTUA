  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor tumor oxygenation (hypoxia) is an established negative prognostic and predictive factor
      in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Hypoxia-modifying measures implemented in the
      clinic are lacking.

      Metformin is a well-known, well-tolerated and low-cost drug used for decades in the treatment
      of type 2- diabetes. Recent studies suggest an improved tumor oxygenation by metformin
      potentially improving radiotherapy response and patient outcome.

      This study is a randomized, phase II, open label study in patients with LACC where patients
      are randomized to standard cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy +/- Metformin.

      Metformin will be started one week prior to the start of chemoradiotherapy, and will be
      continued throughout the entire radiation treatment.

      Tumor oxygenation will be evaluated by gene signatures and MRI- parameters.
