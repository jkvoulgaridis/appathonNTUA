  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the
      United States (U.S.) and is responsible for a wide range of conditions, including cancers
      within the anogenital tract and the oropharynx. In just the U.S. alone, it's estimated that
      HPV causes 330,000 cases of precancerous cervical dysplasia and 12,000 cases of cervical
      cancer. The investigators propose a 2-dose HPV vaccination study in women seeking postpartum
      care at Johns Hopkins University. The investigators will measure the immunogenicity and
      acceptability of the vaccine in the postpartum setting.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, non-inferiority clinical trial using historical controls. Participants will
      have whole blood drawn at 0 months, 6 months, and 7 months and receive the HPV vaccine at 0
      months, 6 months, and 12 months. Each blood draw will consist of one 15mL red top tube to
      measure HPV serologies and hormone levels. All blood samples collected will be analyzed at
      the end of the study.

    <measure>Immunogenicity of a two-dose 9-valent HPV vaccination as assessed by antibody titer</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the study, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the immunogenicity of a two-dose 9-valent HPV vaccination regimen in postpartum women previously unvaccinated against the HPV virus. Immunogenicity will be assessed by the antibody responses. Antibody titers will be measured using the Geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio for each HPV type between the 2-dose and the 3-dose historical controls. The Geometric mean titers will be measured using milli Merck units (mMU)/mL.</description>
