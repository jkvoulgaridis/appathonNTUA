  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Florida Pancreas Collaborative wants to partner with individuals who are known to have,
      or are suspected to have a pancreatic lesion, tumor, cyst, mass, cancer, or pancreatitis and
      are undergoing diagnosis and treatment at a participating institution. The goals of this
      project are to build a large database of information obtained from blood, tissue, medical
      images, surveys and information from routine care to develop noninvasive diagnostic
      approaches that could be used as decision-making tools to effectively personalize clinical
      care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Predictive value of CT Radiomic features vs conventional radiologic features</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative CT images will be evaluated for a retrospective cohort of at least 254 pathologically-confirmed IPMN cases (approximately 190 malignant characterized by high-grade dysplasia or invasion and approximately 64 benign characterized by low- or moderate-grade dysplasia). 3D-radiomic features will be extracted with the new Quantitative Imaging Decision Support (QIDS)â„¢ platform (Healthmyne, Inc.) and associations will be evaluated with pathology.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of Clinical Decision Making Models for Predicting IPMN Pathology</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will develop the first prototype preoperative 'omics'-based nomograms to predict IPMN pathology by integrating radiomic features, the MGC, and other covariates. Emphasis will be placed on developing nomograms for individuals whose IPMNs appear to have 'worrisome' radiologic features which are very challenging to manage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiogenomic Analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will conduct the first radiogenomic analyses of IPMNs by evaluating the relationship between radiomic features and tissue and circulating levels of candidate biomarkers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
