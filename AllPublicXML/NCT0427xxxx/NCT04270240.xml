  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an important morbidity of that the diagnosis and treatment
      is controversy in premature infants. A number of scoring systems have been developed,
      including the findings of echocardiography on the diagnosis and treatment of PDA. This study
      aimed to develop a new clinical scoring system that will enable the rapid, standard and
      noninvasive evaluation of hemodynamically significant PDA earlier, without relying on
      echocardiographic findings in premature babies with extremely low birth weight, and to
      determine the role of this scoring system in early diagnosis and treatment.
