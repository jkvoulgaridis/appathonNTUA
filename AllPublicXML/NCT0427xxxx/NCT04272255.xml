  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and
      open label active-controlled study to identify the safety and efficacy of a repeated-dose
      regimen of DPI-386 nasal gel (intranasal scopolamine gel) for the prevention and treatment of
      motion sickness. The study will be conducted aboard Navy fleet or Marine ships undergoing
      military operations to obtain data in an operationally relevant real world environment.

    <textblock>
      The study will have three arms: DPI-386 nasal gel, placebo nasal gel, and Transderm Scop®
      (1.5 mg/72 hours; transdermal scopolamine patch [TDS], the current standard of care for the
      treatment of motion sickness). The study will include 100 subjects per arm, for a total of
      300 subjects (n=300). Multiple ships and ships' crews will be used, until the required
      enrollment is completed. The DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo nasal gel arms will be
      double-blinded, whereas the TDS arm will remain unblinded. Both DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo
      nasal gel will be administered twice daily over the six consecutive Treatment Days. The two
      daily doses of DPI-386 Nasal Gel or placebo nasal gel will be separated by a minimum of six
      hours ± 15 minutes, and will occur during the subject's on-duty period. The TDS patch will be
      administered on Treatment Days 1 and 4.

    <description>Compare the efficacy of DPI-386 Nasal Gel (0.2 mg scopolamine HBr per dose, maximum of two doses per day, for a maximum of six doses over three consecutive days) with that of the TDS patch and placebo nasal gel in the prevention and treatment of nausea associated with motion sickness. The efficacy endpoint will be determined by comparing the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) scores over the treatment period across all three treatment arm. Sixteen symptoms are listed, with symptoms differentiated along four dimensions: gastrointestinal, central, peripheral, and sopite-related. Each symptom is scored from 1 to 9 in severity and scores then calculated. All 16 items were collected from the general public instead of experts, allowing for a more accurate wording of the symptomology experienced by persons outside of hysiological sciences.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of DPI-386 and severe nausea</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the efficacies of DPI-386 Nasal Gel, TDS patch, and placebo nasal gel in severity of nausea. Respondents specify their degree of nausea by indicating a point along a continuous 100mm line between two end-points; left one is for &quot;No nausea&quot; and the right one for &quot;Very severe nausea&quot;. Scoring is based on the length from left point and a higher score means more severe degree of nausea. Severity of nausea will measured by the Nausea Assessment (Visual Analog Scale) (VAS)) over the treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Safety of DPI-386 Nasal Gel in terms of cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the safety of DPI-386 Nasal Gel with that of TDS patch and placebo nasal gel in terms of cognition as measured by the Psychomotor Vigilance Tests (PVT). The (PVT) is a neurocognitive assessment that measures alertness and tests sustained attention and reaction time. It was originally developed for sleep studies, and involves simple reaction time testing by requiring the participant to push a button as soon as the stimulus (a light) appears. After a response, the reaction time (in ms) is displayed. The inter-stimulus interval varies from two to 10 seconds, so it is not predictable, and the entire task takes 10 minutes.</description>
