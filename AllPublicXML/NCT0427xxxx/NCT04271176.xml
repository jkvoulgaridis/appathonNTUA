      The aim of this study is to evaluate patients with hepatic hydatidosis whose symptom at
      diagnosis was obstructive jaundice. As well as analyzing, the rate of performing preoperative
      ERCP, the results after surgery and morbidity

      Retrospective study of patients operated on for liver hydatidosis and whose initial symptom
      was obstructive jaundice Study period: January 2006 to September 2018

      The preoperative diagnosis was based on abdominal ultrasound (US), CT scan or magnetic
      nuclear resonance

      Surgical technique Precautions are taken to avoid the spillage of the parasite in the
      abdominal cavity. The peritoneal cavity is liberally protected with scolicidal agents. All
      patients have intraoperative ultrasound. Ultrasound is performed to locate the presence of
      any cysts which might not be seen by the preoperative imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound is
      also used to find out the relation of the cyst to the big vessels. Depending on the
      intraoperative findings, the location and size of the cyst will be considered the type of
      surgery to be performed. Radical surgery (closed and open total cystopericystectomy, or liver
      resection) or conservative surgery (partial cystopericystectomy, removal of the vesicles with
      external or internal drainage). When the cyst affects a total lobe and / or the main
      pedicles, a hepatectomy is performed.

      The demographic data of the patients will be taken from their clinical histories. It included
      age, sex, medical history of hidatidosis, clinical findings, laboratory data, radiological
      findings, endoscopic treatment, surgical treatment.

      The investigators will analyze postoperative mortality and morbidity. Complications' ranking
      according to the Clavien-Dindo score, 'severe complication' is defined as greater or equal to
      IIIa

      Follow-up The follow-up of these patients will be performed with ultrasound or CT and hydatid
      serology. The minimum follow-up of the patients is six months. Relapse is defined as the
      appearance of new active liver cysts after the patient had undergone surgery.
