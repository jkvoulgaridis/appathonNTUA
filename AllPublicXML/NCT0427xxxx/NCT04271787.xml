  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new classification system of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions was
      proposed by consensus of world experts in 2017. Since then there has been ongoing debates
      among periodontists regarding the application of the new classification. This study aims to
      shed light on the current understanding of the new classification among Egyptian
      periodontists.

      This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Faculty of Dentistry Beni-Suef
      University (ID #FDBSUREC/27022019/AM) and was conducted in full accordance with the World
      Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 1975, revised in 2003. The questionnaire was
      anonymous with no personal identification data. Completion and submission of the
      questionnaire was considered an approved informed consent to participate in the study by the
      Research Ethic Committee.

      The questionnaire was designed by the authors and pilot tested among a group of 12
      periodontists for validation. Afterwards, adjustments were made to ensure a clear and
      comprehensive version of the questionnaire. The questionnaire had a cover letter explaining
      the nature and purpose of the survey and comprised 15 questions. The first six statements of
      the questionnaire were descriptive in nature addressing the participant's demographics, and
      the seventh was a question whether the participant is aware of the new PDL classification or
      not. Only those who were aware of it were asked to proceed to 13 multiple choice questions
      using Likert scale; ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree or from excellent to
      poor, in addition to &quot;I don't know&quot; option (8). There were also three open ended questions
      for further comments at the end of the questionnaire.
