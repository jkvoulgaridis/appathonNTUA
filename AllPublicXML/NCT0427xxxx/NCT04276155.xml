  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome associated with de novo atrial fibrillation are
      randomized to benefit from either a conventional therapy associating dual antiplatelet
      therapy (DAPT) and anticoagulant or DAPT and an implantable monitoring device with a
      follow-up by telecardiology

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Coronary Syndrome associated with de novo atrial fibrillation is not uncommon. It
      worsens the short-term, medium-term and long-term prognosis. It is then usual, according to
      ESC recommendations, to add to the DAPT, an anticoagulant treatment, which is a source of
      iatrogenic events, in particular hemorrhagic events. However, recurrence is not a certainty.
      Albeit variable, its highest rate is estimated to be 38%. Consequently, a well-conducted
      screening of atrial fibrillation recurrence could allow to treat only selected recurrent
      patients. At present, this screening can be carried out in a reliable and minimally invasive
      way with an implantable device with telecardiology. We propose a study for these patients
      with ACS associated with de novo AF. The study will be multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      with two arms: patient conventionally treated (DAPT + AC) and patient treated by DAPT +
      implantable device and followed for two years by telecardiology. This patient will only
      reintegrate the first arm in case of AF recurrence.

    <description>To show that the introduction of an anticoagulant treatment in patients with ACS and de novo AF based on the data furnished by an implantable holter with remote monitoring is safer in terms of occurrence of hemorrhagic events than the systematic introduction of an anticoagulant treatment associated to DAPT based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score.
CHA2DS2-Vasc score, derived from CHADS2 score. It assesses the risk of a person with atrial fibrillation (AF) without associated valve pathology, to experience an ischemic stroke, in other words, to assess the need for anticoagulant treatment. It ranges from 0 to 10. A score of 0 is considered a low risk. A score greater than or equal to 2 is considered a significant risk of embolic complication and should lead to discussion of the introduction of oral anticoagulant therapy.</description>
