  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human beings are able to produce precise and smooth movements despite varying demands thank
      to the nervous system plasticity. Primastic exposure is a method that allows to easily study
      these sensorimotor plasticity processes in a laboratory context. In a typical protocol,
      participants wear prismatic goggles that induce a lateral deviation of the visual field while
      performing a goal directed motor task (e.g. pointing). During the first trials, participants
      make errors in the direction of the deviation and correct them trial-by-trial. Finally,
      participants go back to baseline performances after a few dozen of trials. Upon goggles
      removal, participants make mistakes toward the direction opposition to the initial prismatic
      deviation. These after-effects reflect adaptive processes that occurred to counteract the
      perturbation. The way that these after-effects can be transferred to other situations which
      have not been exposed to the prismatic perturbation bring crucial information about the
      nature of the processes involved. Additionally, these transfer properties might be of great
      interest in the field of neuro rehabilitation. In fact, the purpose of therapeutic strategies
      is to induce compensations that can be transferred to daily life situations.

      In previous studies, the investigator showed that expertise on the exposed had a notable
      influence on transfer properties. However, these studies did not allow to identify the
      cerebral regions involved in transfer.

      The cerebellum is described as a major area implied during motor adaptation and the
      occurrence of after-effects, while the primary motor cortex might play a crucial role in the
      formation of motor memory. As such, these two regions are likely to be involved in transfer
      properties.

      The objective of this project is to identify the roles of the cerebellum and the primary
      motor cortex in the transfer of visuomotor compensations acquired during prism exposure to
      task that has not been practiced under the perturbation. To do so, the investigator will use
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which is a non-painful and non-invasive
      functional brain stimulation method. Several groups will be constituted to test if
      stimulation (inhibitory and excitatory) of the cerebellum or the primary motor on the
      transfer of prism acquired compensations to a non-exposed task. More precisely, the
      investigator aim to study the influence of different stimulation modalities (cerebellum vs
      MA, inhibitory vs excitatory vs sham) on the error reduction during prism exposure, on the
      amount of after-effects and on the amount on transfer to the non-exposed task.

      On a fundamental level, this project will allow a better understanding of the sensorimotor
      plasticity processes involved to counteract a perturbation and about mechanisms underlying
      transfer properties. Future results would allows to shed light on the conditions necessary to
      give rise to transfer as well as the implied brain regions. On longer-term these results will
      be used to optimize rehabitation strategies in motor function recovery in order to favour the
      transfer of acquired compensations to daily life situations.

    <description>Primary outcome measure will be the endpoint lateral error for each trial, that will be expressed in degrees. The distance between the aimed target and either the final position of the index (pointing trials) or the ball impact (throwing trials) will be recorded with a motion capture system and expressed in centimeters. Then, they will be converted into degrees through trignometric rules, taking in account the distance between the eyes and the target.</description>
