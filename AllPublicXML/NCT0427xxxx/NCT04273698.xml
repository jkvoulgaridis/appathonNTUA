  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Can a method of working therapeutically with parents and children (under the age of five) be
      made use of in a Child and Adolescent Mental Health team, in which this kind of work does not
      regularly take place? I hope to understand whether this model of work can be helpful to the
      children and their families and to look at how this method was received by the team.

      It is hoped that by working with the parents and child together, the families will be able to
      think about both the child's presenting difficulty, but also the relationship between the
      parents and their child and how the parents' own experiences and difficulties might impact on
      the present situation.

      The primary aim of this research is to trial an under-fives' service, in a Child and
      Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) team which has not offered this kind of work
      specifically before. The project would involve recruiting families, with children under the
      age of five years old, who are experiencing one or more difficulties, and these families
      would be offered five sessions, with the option of an additional five sessions, should this
      be required.

      The work will broadly follow the Tavistock's model of parent-infant psychotherapy and the
      sessions will be centred within a psychodynamic psychotherapeutic framework. I hope that this
      trial will enable to me to learn more about this model of work, in terms of the processes
      involves and the themes that emerge. I hope to see how possible it is for this kind of work
      to be adopted within a generic CAMHS team, and how it is received by the families involved.

      Due to this method of working being new to the team, it will be interesting to see how my
      colleagues respond to the model. It is likely that trying to gather full qualitative or
      quantitative data in this area would be beyond the scope of this piece of research, but I
      hope to make some reflections on how the model was received by the team. I hope to present
      the plan of work to the team prior to the treatment stage, and then share some of the
      findings from the research, after treatment. I also hope to conduct some form of
      consultation, with a staff group, following the treatment stage, in order to hear about their
      experiences of this method.

    <description>Each family was asked to set a goal which addressed the current problems or difficulties that they wanted to focus on during the therapy sessions. They were asked to rate their goal from zero to ten, zero representing that the goal is currently not being achieved at all, and ten meaning the goal has been entirely met. These goals were set at the start of treatment and reviewed and re-rated at the end.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participants in this trial were children under the age of five years old, who had
             been referred to the CAMHS clinic.

          -  The child could have been experiencing a range of difficulties, including issues with
             sleeping, feeding or attachment, which were having an impact on their, or their
             families, functioning and wellbeing.

          -  The work involved working with the referred child and their parent(s) or carers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Families involved in court proceedings

          -  Families where there were safeguarding concerns

          -  Families currently experiencing domestic violence

          -  Families for whom severe parental mental health difficulties were indicated at the
             point of referral.

          -  Families who were already been accessing mental health support

          -  If the child had severe developmental difficulties and would require a specialist
             service

          -  Families requiring an interpreter in order to participate, I would have been unable to
             involve them, owing to the level of complexity this would have added in terms of the
             communication.
