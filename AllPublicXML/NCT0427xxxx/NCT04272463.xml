  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, Italian multi-center, retrospective cohort study with enrollment
      visit on patients suffering from severe eosinophilic asthma who started benralizumab in the
      Sampling Program or as per normal clinical practice in Italy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study design involving secondary data collection was chosen to
      appropriately address the primary objective in a relatively short period of time after
      enrollment phase initiation: in fact, since the Italian Sampling Program on benralizumab was
      active since July 2018, clinical data on patients exposed to benralizumab are already
      available. No treatments will be administered per protocol requirement, but instead according
      to normal clinical practice; since benralizumab first administration occurs before inclusion
      in the study (as per chosen study design), the decision to include the patient in the study
      is clearly separated from the prescription of benralizumab, in accordance with the
      observational nature of the study. In order to be eligible for the study, for each patient,
      the index date shall be at least 3 months prior to enrollment.

        The study will enroll patients with severe eosinophilic asthma treated with benralizumab.
        Patients can be enrolled if they received benralizumab either within the sampling program
        or as per routine clinical practice.

        Participating sites will enroll patients in a consecutive manner when patients come for
        their regular visit, in order to minimize the risk of selection bias.

        A total of 200 patients are expected to be included in the study by around 20 sites,
        corresponding to approximately 10 patients/site: it is estimated that the study will enroll
        approximately 25 patients per month in the around 20 centers involved (approximately 1.3
        patients/month/center). This target sample size is expected to be reached durin
