  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the safety of using pressure controlled ventilation with a positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during induction of general anaesthesia immediately after
      apnoea to a standard method starting ventilation manually without PEEP immediately after
      apnoea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a continuous positive pressure (CPAP) during preoxygenation, followed by pressure
      controlled ventilation with PEEP after apnoea during induction of general anesthesia, might
      offer several benefits but safety issues needs more investigation. This study compares the
      safety of using pressure controlled with PEEP during induction of general anesthesia
      immediately after apnoea to a standard method starting ventilation manually without PEEP
      immediately after apnoea.
