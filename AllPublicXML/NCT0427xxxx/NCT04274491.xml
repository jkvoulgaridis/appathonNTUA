  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence a person's expectations
      regarding recovery from pelvic organ prolapse surgery. This is important because a person's
      expectations regarding recovery from surgery help to predict how a person will actually
      recover. Our hypothesis is that women with multiple roles will have expectations of a longer
      surgical recovery time after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse after controlling for known
      predictors of recovery expectancies. Participants will complete a preoperative online survey.
      Additional online surveys will be send on postoperative days 14 and 42 to measure
      postdischarge surgical recovery.
