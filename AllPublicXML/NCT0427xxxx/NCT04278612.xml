    <textblock>
      This rigorous evaluation demonstrated that implementation of a time-limited quality
      improvement strategy effectively improved coverage of some components of an integrated
      maternal and child health service in a complex health environment, but we were unable to
      achieve the changes needed to provide a comprehensive package of care for mothers and
      children.

      Background: Despite policies and guidelines recommending integration of health services in
      South Africa, provision of maternal and child health services remains fragmented. This study
      evaluated a rapid, scaleable, quality improvement intervention to improve integration of
      maternal and child health and HIV services at a primary health level, in KwaZulu-Natal, South
      Africa.

      Methods: A three-month intervention comprised of six quality improvement mentoring visits,
      learning sessions with clinic staff to share learnings, and a self-administered checklist
      aimed to assist health workers monitor and implement an integrated package of health services
      for mothers and children. The study evaluated 27 clinics in four sub-districts using a
      stepped-wedge design. Each sub-district received the intervention sequentially in a randomly
      selected order. Five waves of data collection were conducted in all participating clinics
      between December 2016-February 2017. A multi-level, mixed effects logistic regression was
      used to account for random cluster fixed time and group effects using Stata V13.1.
