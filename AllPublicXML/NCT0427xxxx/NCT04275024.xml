  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Adipose derived
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AD-MSCs) plus Calpocitriol Ointment and PSORI-CM01 Granule with
      moderate to severe psoriasis. Any adverse events related to AD-MSCs infusion will be
      monitored.The primary outcome is the reduction rate of PASI(Psoriasis Area and Severity
      Index) and treatment response will be computed from PASI before and after treatment.
