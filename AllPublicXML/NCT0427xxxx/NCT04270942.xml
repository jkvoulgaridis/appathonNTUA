  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an extension of the NIH-sponsored AT-Risk (TN-10) type 1 diabetes study (NCT
      01030861). Teplizumab-treated and placebo-treated participants in the NIH trial who develop
      clinical type 1 diabetes after the conclusion of that trial, are eligible to enroll and
      receive teplizumab treatment within one year of diagnosis of clinical type 1 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial. All participants will
      receive a 12-day course of teplizumab given through daily IV infusion and will be followed
      for 78 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of teplizumab treatment,
      administered intravenously (IV) to participants in the NIH-sponsored trial who have developed
      type 1 diabetes and are able to start teplizumab treatment within 1 year of diagnosis of type
      1 diabetes. Whether teplizumab treatment reduces the loss of insulin-producing pancreatic
      beta cells will also be evaluated.
