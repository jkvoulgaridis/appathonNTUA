  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taurine supplementation researches have increased due to its antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory actions, and its ability to modulate lipid metabolism by stimulating the
      expression of proteins that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and increases respiratory
      function (PGC-1α and PPAR) and irisin release when associated to exercise. Since obesity can
      induce metabolic disorders including abnormal production of adipokines and activation of
      pro-inflammatory signaling pathways also mitochondrial metabolism dysfunction in the adipose
      tissue, the use of taurine would be a new strategy for obesity prevention and treatment.
      Moreover, the association of taurine and exercise could improve exercise effects, promote
      higher energy expenditure and increase mitochondrial respiration, consequently resulting in
      weight loss. Therefore, the present investigation aims to evaluate the effects of the
      association of taurine supplementation and a combined exercise training protocol (aerobic and
      strength) on resting energy expenditure, weight, body composition, blood markers of
      inflammation and oxidative stress, telomeres length, and mitochondrial function and the
      expression of genes that regulates energy metabolism and lipid oxidation in the white adipose
      tissue in obese women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted with 24 obese women (32.9±6.3 years).
      Capsules of taurine (3 grams) (GTau) or placebo (GP) were daily supplemented 2 hours before
      training. The training program was composed of aerobic and strength exercises during one
      hour, 3 times a week, for an 8-week period (intensity of 80% heart rate). The taurine
      supplemented group received only taurine capsules (3g/day) during 8 weeks. Measurement of
      weight, hip and waist circumference, and body composition (by Deuterium oxide) were performed
      before and after the intervention. Resting energy expenditure and nutrients oxidation were
      assessed by calorimetry.

      In order to check the effects of the intervention, abdominal tissue biopsy will be performed
      for white adipose tissue analysis, evaluation of mitochondrial function and quantification of
      the expression of genes related to energy metabolism and lipid oxidation and taurine pathway;
      blood collection will be done for quantification of taurine levels, inflammatory (IL-10,
      IL-15, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, and CRP), adipokines (adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, fetuin and
      leptin) and oxidative stress (GPx, SOD and MDA) markers. Also, evaluation of telomere length
      was performed. Body composition was evaluated by deuterium oxide method, weight, waist and
      hip circumference were accessed. All the measurements were performed before and after the
      intervention period.
