  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial polyps are one of the main causes of infertility in women. In this work we
      propose an alternative, effective, economical and safe treatment: the use of misoprostol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of uterine polyps has been estimated in the general population at 10-15%,
      while in infertile patients it ranges from 6-32%. Its etiology is considered as
      multifactorial. Polyps induce a local inflammatory response in the endometrial cavity,
      causing infertility. The treatment of choice considered &quot;gold standard&quot; is the excision by
      hysteroscopy, however, improvement has been shown in patients with conservative management
      due to the regression rate of 27%. There are no recommended drugs to provide a definitive
      treatment for uterine polyps. Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue derived from prostaglandin
      E1 that has stimulating effects on the smooth muscle fibers of the uterus, causing
      contractions of the myometrium, which cause endouterine evacuation. The present study shows a
      possible utility of misoprostol for the conservative treatment of uterine polyps.
