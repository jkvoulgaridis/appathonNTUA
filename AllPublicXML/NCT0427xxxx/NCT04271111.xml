    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether a brief computerized intervention can decrease perceived
      hostility of interpersonal situations. Participants will be randomized into an active
      treatment or control condition. We hypothesize that participants in the treatment condition
      will have lower perceived hostility at post treatment than those in the waitlist condition.
