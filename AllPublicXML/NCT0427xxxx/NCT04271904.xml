  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the effects of a placebo diet vs an anti-inflammatory diet in
      individuals with spinal cord injury. It is being performed to ensure that the placebo diet
      does not also induce reductions in inflammation and also adequately conceals group
      allocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-inflammatory diet is a novel treatment that may be beneficial for managing neuropathic
      pain (NP) after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). NP is a common complication following SCI that
      significantly decreases quality of life. Treatment options are limited, and current
      treatments can have significant side effects. Those with SCI have identified a need for
      additional treatment options, particularly those that are not medications.

      As pain is a subjective outcome, awareness of group allocation could influence treatment
      expectations and participant rated scores of neuropathic pain. It is therefore important to
      ensure that an adequate placebo intervention is utilized. This pilot study will assess
      whether the placebo diet to be used in an upcoming RCT provides sufficient group allocation
      concealment (i.e. ensure participants are unaware of whether they are on the
      anti-inflammatory diet or placebo diet). This pilot study will also assess whether the
      placebo diet is in fact inflammation neutral (ie. induces no reductions in inflammation).

Those on the anti-inflammatory diet or placebo diet will be given respective meal plans and recipes while the non-dieting control group will be asked to continue eating as usual.

    <description>Changes in neuropathic pain from baseline to post intervention will be measured using the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). This questionnaire consists of 32 items which are each ranked on a scale of 0 - 100 whereby 0 indicates the absence of pain and 100 indicates the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>Diet Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Week-5 (post measures collected following 1-week group allocation period and 4-week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Diet compliance will be assessed following the intervention. Compliance to the specific diet will be assessed by a detailed analysis of all diet records. Each food item will be categorized as either a &quot;food to consume,&quot; a &quot;food to avoid,&quot; or a &quot;neutral food&quot; based on the parameter of the diet participants who were instructed to follow. Food will also be categorized into servings in accordance with Canada's Food Guide. Therefore, compliance score will be based on standard servings of foods subjects were instructed to eat vs. foods they were instructed to avoid. To account for differences in total energy intake, compliance scores will be expressed as a ratio of the servings of foods to consume over the total servings of food (avoid + consume) multiplied by 100. The percent compliance will then be generated.</description>

    <description>Those on the anti-inflammatory diet will be given a meal plan and recipes to be followed at home after consultation with the study dietitian. In brief, this meal plan will eliminate foods that have been established as pro-inflammatory (e.g. processed foods, refined sugars, refined wheat products, etc.) as well as foods that are commonly associated with even mild intolerances (e.g. cow's milk) and those that negatively impact cardiovascular health (e.g. hydrogenated oils, refined sugars and wheat, etc.). In their place, the meal plan will consist of foods with established anti-inflammatory properties (e.g. (Oily fish, lean poultry, dark leafy greens, etc.). Participants will also be given a list of foods that they are allowed on the anti-inflammatory diet, and a list of foods to avoid so that they can make informed substitutions to the meals and ingredients that they are given. The study participants will be given a one-week meal plan with accompanying recipes.</description>

    <description>Participants on the placebo diet will be given a meal plan and recipes by the study dietitian. The dietitian will assist in developing a diet that is isocaloric to the anti-inflammatory diet and healthy (for the sake of the participants' well-being, and to blind participants), while allowing many foods that are (counterintuitively) pro-inflammatory (e.g. whole wheat bread, white beans, oats, soy, eggplant, raspberries, pumpkin seeds, popcorn, etc). There are many counter-intuitive restrictions in the anti-inflammatory diet that we will be using (banned foods include white beans, soy, eggplant, oats, raspberries, strawberries, prunes, walnuts, cashews, soy milk. Allowed foods include maple syrup, honey, lean beef, lamb, brown rice, feta cheese, butter). Therefore, even fairly astute and educated participants may have trouble discerning which diet they are consuming (anti-inflammatory or placebo).</description>
