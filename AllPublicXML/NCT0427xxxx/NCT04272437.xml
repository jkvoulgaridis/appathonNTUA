  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infection in nursing home residents,
      and symptomatic UTI in the nursing home setting is the most frequent reason for
      hospitalization and antimicrobial therapy in Taiwan. Increasing antimicrobial resistance has
      stimulated interest in non-antibiotic prophylaxis of UTI. The primary aim of this study is to
      test the efficacy of standardized concentrated herbal extract granules TRA in the reduction
      of the incidence of symptomatic UTI and associated hospitalization in high-risk nursing home
      residents. These aims were accomplished by conducting a double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled efficacy trial of TRA daily versus placebo granules in a cohort of
      Changhua County nursing home residents in Taiwan.

      A total of 164 nursing home residents at high risk for UTI were be enrolled. A permuted block
      design with a block size of 6 were conducted. And a Stratification by nursing home accounted
      for potentially different standards of care. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      either TRA (10 g) or the placebo two times per day for 42 consecutive days. All subjects in
      both groups will also continuously receive their daily medication without any dose or
      medicine change. Urinalysis was evaluated before and after administration. Independent
      statisticians performed the data analysis at the end of the trial.

      The standardized concentrated herbal extract granules TRA were the combination of &quot;Tokoro
      Combination(Pi-Hsieh-Fen-Ching-Yin Extract Granules)&quot; and &quot;Rehmannia and Akebia Formula (Dao
      Chi San Extract Powder)&quot;. &quot;Tokoro Combination&quot; and &quot;Rehmannia and Akebia Formula&quot; in each one
      batch number were used, manufactured by Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a famous
      GMP manufacturer of concentrated herbal extract granules in agreement with international
      standards. The TRA was prepared in small granules, including concentrated herbal extract
      granules of &quot;Tokoro Combination&quot;(50%) and &quot;Rehmannia and Akebia Formula&quot; (50%). Both
      medicines have already been approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan as
      ethical drugs. TRA granules were packed in oblique glassine packages. The placebo was also
      prepared as granules by Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and the packaging of the
      placebo was identical to that of TRA. The chemical composition of TRA was analyzed and
      profiled by using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The major components were
      diosgenin, yamogenin, betulin, oleanolic acid, hederagenin, akeboside, Î²-sitosterol,
      stigmasterol, inositol, catalpol, glycyrrhizin, etc.

    <masking_description>Participants were randomly assigned to take either TRA or placebo. Participants in the two groups orally ingested one package of granules (5 g/package) two times daily after lunch and dinner. The placebo was prepared as granules by Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, and the packaging of the placebo was identical to that of herbal extract granules. During the trial, neither the care providers(including family numbers and nursing-home colleagues) nor investigators ( assist doctors or nurses ) were aware of the group.</masking_description>
