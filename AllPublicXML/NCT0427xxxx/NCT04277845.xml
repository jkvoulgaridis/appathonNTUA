    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in elderly
      frail patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma

        1. Primary Study Objective

           - Progression-Free Survival

           : The time from randomization into the date of first observation of documented disease
           progression or any-kinds of death.

        2. Secondary Study Objectives 1) Complete Response (CR)

             -  Response will be determined by the International Myeloma Working Group Response
                Criteria

             -  CR is defined as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance
                of any soft tissue plasmacytoma and &lt; 5% of plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates

             -  The determination of stringent CR and Imaging will be done 2) Overall response rate
                consisting of complete response, very good partial response, and partial response
                3) Overall survival (OS)

                  -  The time from randomization into the date of any-kinds of death. 4) Time to
                     next treatment

                  -  The time from randomization into the first date of second-line treatment. 5)
