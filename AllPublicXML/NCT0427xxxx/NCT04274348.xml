  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease. Clinical studies
      have demonstrated a link between staphylococcal skin colonization and the pathogenesis of AD,
      but the implication of bacterial virulence factors remains largely uncharacterized. Finally,
      AD is often associated with herpes simplex skin infections. The aim of this project is to
      investigate the role of staphylococcal toxins in the exacerbation and maintenance of atopic
      skin inflammation and in the occurrence of infectious complications such as eczema
      herpeticum.
