  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a dietary regimen involving the consumption of food and
      liquids within a defined time window with or without additional restriction on dietary
      composition. TRF has been associated with improvements in inflammation, host metabolism,
      autophagy, gut microbial composition, and gut permeability. Crohn's disease is an
      inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology that likely results from a combination of
      genetic and environmental factors. This proposed study will test the hypothesis that a
      time-restricted feeding regimen will improve clinical outcomes and favorably influence the
      gut microbiome in patients with active Crohn's disease. If time-restricted fasting proves
      beneficial to this patient population then it will pave the way for larger, prospective
      studies and clinical trials.

    <description>This will be measured to assess clinical response as determined by a reduction of either 8 or more points or a total PRO2 score of less than or equal to 8 points. The PRO2 score scale ranges from a score of 0 as the minimum and has no maximum limit. A score below 8 is considered remission; a score less than 14 is considered mild; and a score greater than 34 is considered severe.</description>

    <description>The counseling on the regimen will involve instructing the subjects on study compliance and fasting times. Subjects will be instructed to choose an eight-hour eating window (e.g., 11:00am - 7:00pm) during which the patient will be able to eat his/her normal diet. During the 16-hour fasting window (e.g., 7:00pm - 11:00am), the participant will be able to drink regular water and black coffee.</description>
