      This study will randomize women who are undergoing fertility treatment and put them either in
      an intervention group or standard care. This study should help us learn if diet and exercise
      changes oocytes gene expression and follicular fluid content.

    <intervention_model_description>This research will last up to 12 weeks. The participant will attend two research study visits and will be asked to donate oocytes and follicular fluid to the study team during their oocyte retrieval procedures. They will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to either a standard of care group or an intervention group. If they are in the intervention group, they will also be asked to follow a Mediterranean diet (all meals will be shipped to their home weekly) and exercise at least 3 times a week at a gym or at their house. If they are in the control group, they will follow the normal fertility clinic procedures.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Group 1 = Diet Intervention group: They will be asked to follow a personalized diet during study period and record what they eat. The meal plan for this study is Mediterranean style and nutritionally complete for 8 to 12 weeks or until oocyte retrieval procedure. Exercise Intervention: Exercise 3 times/week at a gym of their choice or at home for 8 to 12 weeks or until oocyte retrieval procedure. Exercises will be light intensity and short duration at first and will gradually increase to moderate intensity and longer duration during the first 3 weeks. They will also be encouraged to walk an average 10,000 steps per day and wear a pedometer to monitor progress.</description>
