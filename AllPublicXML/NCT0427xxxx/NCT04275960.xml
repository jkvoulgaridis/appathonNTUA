  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study want to gather information in healthy adult male participants
      about how the human body absorbs, distributes and excretes the drug selitrectinib including
      the effect of the interaction of food with the study drug on the human body. Selitrectinib is
      a new drug under development for the treatment of patients with solid tumor caused by a
      genetic abnormality known as an NTRK gene fusion which cannot be cured by currently available
      treatment options or has spread to other parts of the body. The drug blocks the action of the
      NTRK gene fusion and prevents the activation of certain proteins (TRK fusion proteins), which
      can cause cancer cells to multiply and form a tumor. Researchers also want to find out if the
      participants have any medical problems during this study.

      Participants in this study will receive the study drug twice with at least 6 days in between.
      The study drug will be taken orally as a liquid before or after meal. Observation will last
      for up to 8 weeks, and blood samples will be taken from the participants to measure the blood
      levels of the study drug.

      The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the pharmacokinetics and the effect
      of food on the pharmacokinetics of selitrectinib after a single dose of the drug.

      Secondary objective is to assess the safety of selitrectinib after a single dose.
