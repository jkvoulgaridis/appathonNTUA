  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study is a single arm, multi-dose study that will evaluate steady-state apixaban
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in subjects with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) vs
      healthy control subjects. This study will enroll 20 subjects diagnosed with NS and 10 healthy
      control subjects. Comparing differences in steady-state apixaban PK/PD parameters between
      subjects with NS and healthy volunteers will be essential to identifying a safe and effective
      apixaban dose and dose administration schedule for future randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs).

          -  Evidence of acute kidney disease by the KDIGO criteria (&gt;1.5 x baseline SCr, or &gt;0.3
             mg/dL increase in SCr, over past 48 hours
