    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a musculoskeletal disorder which is characterized by pain,
      muscle spasms and muscle tenderness, as well as a limited range of motion, weakness, and
      rarely, autonomous dysfunction.

      The occurrences of morbidity of the neck after cancer therapy were considerable and consisted
      of neck pain, loss of sensation, and decreased range of motion. Extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy (ESWT) is one of the treatment options used for patients with myofascial pain
      syndrome through elimination of ischemia and modulation of vasoneuroactive substance (two
      major causes of trigger pathophysiology) and mechanical transduction as a cellular response
      to external stimulation. the aim of this study was to investigate efficacy of extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy (ESWT) on cervical myofascial pain following neck dissection surgery.

    <measure>Cervical range of motion assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical range of motion device (CROM; Performance Attainment Associates) was used for assessment of neck lateral flexion and rotation of both sides. The CROM instrument contains a plastic frame put on the head above the nose and ears, attached at the head back by a Velcro strap to allow precise measure, re-measure and rotational motion in an upright place to avoid individual errors. Two independent inclinometers are connected to the frame and point the head position in relation to the gravity line. Another inclinometer indicates the head position in rotation in relation to a reference position.</description>

    <description>Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) has been introduced efficiently for more than twenty years as a treatment modality in orthopedic and musculoskeletal disorders. ESWT has mechanical and cellular impacts on tissues regeneration and pain management through cavitation bubbles, acoustic micro streaming, and hyper-vascularity that can directly affect tissue calcifications, and modulate cell activity.</description>
