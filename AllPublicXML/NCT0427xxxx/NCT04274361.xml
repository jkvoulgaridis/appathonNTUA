      This study evaluates if the early utilization of ketamine infusion therapy among adult trauma
      patients with an ISS &gt;15 will decrease the amount of opioid pain medication used as compared
      with placebo group. Ketamine infusion therapy will lead to decreased total opiate consumption
      (standardized to oral morphine equivalent units) in the first 24 and 48 hours compared to
      controls.

      Patients aged 18 - 64 will be enrolled into the study. The patients randomized to the
      experimental arm will receive early ketamine infusion therapy at a rate of 3 mcg/kg/min. All
      ketamine infusions will be calculated based on ideal body weight (IBW), unless actual body
      weight is less than ideal. IBW will be calculated for males as 50kg + 2.3*(number of inches
      above 5 feet) and for women as 45.5kg + 2.3*(number of inches over 5 feet). The 65 patients
      randomized to the control arm will receive placebo saline solution at a rate equivalent. Time
      zero will be defined as the time at which the &quot;ketamine / placebo&quot; infusion is begun. For
      inclusion in the study, initiation of ketamine / placebo infusions must take place within 12
      hours of presentation to Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital (FMLH).

      Prior to starting the investigational infusion, a single IV push of ketamine/placebo (Dose
      0.2mg/kg) over 5 min (MAX 20mg) will be administered to any patient with a numeric pain score
      between 7-10. This is done to achieve more rapid pain control as poor pain control has been
      shown to lead to higher rates of chronic pain and PTSD.

      Patient controlled analgesia will be provided using either morphine or hydromorphone with an
      initial starting dose of Morphine (1.5mg bolus, 12 min lockout, no continuous rate) or
      Hydromorphone (0.2mg, 12 min lockout, no continuous rate). Dose or lockout adjustments to the
      PCA should be done only after first adjusting the Investigational Drug dose. For example, if
      a patient continues to complain of severe pain (â‰¥6) after 2-4 hours of initiation of the
      Investigational Drug then the rate of the infusion should be increased (as described below).
      The adjustments can be initiated by either the RAAPS team or Trauma service. No more than 1
      change to PCA or Investigational Drug rate should be performed every 4 hours (ie if PCA was
      adjusted at midnight, then an adjustment to the Investigational Drug should not be made
      before 4 am).

      At the completion of the 48-hour infusion the inpatient team has the option of transitioning
      the patient from the PCA to oral pain medications. Additional adjuncts to pain control
      including epidural or other regional techniques are at the discretion of the primary team but
      ideally would be delayed until the investigational infusion is completed.

      Ketamine infusions will be prepared by the IDS service but will be hung and administered by
      the inpatient nursing staff. Ketamine infusion therapy will be continued for 48 hours. At 2-4
      hours post-infusion the patient's pain will be reassessed. If the NPS is more than 5 the
      infusion will be increased to 5mcg/kg/min. Following each change in the infusion rate the
      patient's pain will be reassessed at 2-4 hours and adjustments made accordingly. Maximum
      infusion rate will be set at 9mcg/kg/min. Conversely, The RAAPS team should be notified if
      neurologic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disturbing dreams, vertigo) are developing
      and, at the discretion of the RAAPS service, a single dose of lorazepam or midazolam may be
      utilized. The infusion can be decreased from in 2 mcg/kg/min increments if there are symptoms
      believed to be related to the infusion that do not respond to benzodiazepines.
