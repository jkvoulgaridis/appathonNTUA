  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is single arm study to evaluate an escalation anti-fungal prophylaxis protocol for
      patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. For all patients without documented
      proven or probable invasive fungal disease (IFD), patients will receive fluconazole during
      the treatment in the laminar air flow units (LAF). After discharged from LAF units, patients
      will receive anti-mold prophylaxis in case of haplo-identical or HLA-matched unrelated donor
      transplantation to d+100 without active acute GVHD (aGVHD). In case of active aGVHD, the
      prophylaxis treatment will be extended until recovery of aGVHD and tapering of
      immunosuppression. In case of HLA-matched sibling donor, fluconazole will be continued to
      d+100 and anti-mold prophylaxis will be given in case of active aGVHD.

    <textblock>
      Based on CAESAR study, the IFD incidence increased significantly in patients with unrelated
      donor or hallo-donor HSCT after patients being discharged from LAF units. The overall
      incidence of IFD in patients with HLA-matched sibling donor remain low unless in patients
      with active aGVHD. In this single-arm prospective study, we plan to evaluate the feasibility
      and effect of an escalation anti-fungal prophylaxis protocol for patients undergoing
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. For all patients without documented proven or probable
      invasive fungal disease (IFD), patients will receive fluconazole during the treatment in the
      laminar air flow units (LAF). After discharged from LAF units, patients will receive
      anti-mold prophylaxis in case of haplo-identical or HLA-matched unrelated donor
      transplantation to d+100 without active acute GVHD (aGVHD). In case of active aGVHD, the
      prophylaxis treatment will be extended until recovery of aGVHD and tapering of
      immunosuppression. In case of HLA-matched sibling donor, fluconazole will be continued to
      d+100 and anti-mold prophylaxis will be given in case of active aGVHD.
