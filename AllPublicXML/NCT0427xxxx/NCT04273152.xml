    <textblock>
      Food allergy (FA) is &quot;an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that
      occurs reproducibly&quot; according to the 2010 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIAID/NIH)-supported Guidelines for the Diagnosis
      and Management of Food Allergy in the United States (Boyce et al. 2010).

      Studies have suggested that the natural history of FA has changed during the last two
      decades, with a dramatic rise in the prevalence, severity of clinical manifestations, and
      risk of persistence into later ages, leading to an increase in hospital admissions, medical
      visits, treatments, and burden of care on families and to an important economic impact, with
      significant direct costs for the families and healthcare system (Skripak et al. 2007; McBride
      et al. 2012; Gupta et al. 2013).

      In Europe, around 17 million of people suffer from challenge-proven FA. If this prevalence is
      projected onto the world's population of seven billion, it translates into 63 million-1.16
      billion of potential food-allergic people, with a greater incidence in children (5-8%) than
      in adults (1-2%) (Fiocchi et al. 2010).

      Food allergy derives from a breakdown of immune tolerance. Current knowledge suggests that
      the development of FA might be influenced by genetics, environment, and genome-environment
      interactions, leading to immune system dysfunction, mediated at least in part by epigenetic
      mechanisms (Berni Canani et al. 2015; Paparo et al. 2018). Many factors have been postulated
      to contribute to the onset of FA. Among dietary factors, it has been hypothesized that
      advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), present at high level in junk food, could be involved
      in FA pathogenesis. AGEs are a heterogeneous group of compounds deriving from a non-enzymatic
      reaction between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids.
      This reaction is also known as the Maillard or browning reaction. The formation of AGEs is a
      part of normal metabolism, but if excessively high levels of AGEs are reached in tissues and
      the circulation they can become pathogenic. AGEs also exist in foods. AGEs are naturally
      present in uncooked animal-derived foods, and cooking results in the formation of new AGEs
      within these foods. In particular, grilling, broiling, roasting, searing, and frying
      propagate and accelerate new AGE formation. Consumption of AGE-rich diets is associated with
      elevated circulating and tissue AGEs and an increase of their pro-inflammatory and
      pro-oxidant effects. On the other hand, restriction of AGEs prevents inflammation.

      AGEs not only exert their deleterious actions due to their biological properties per se, but
      also through their interaction with specific receptors (RAGE). AGEs are able to activate mast
      cells and stimulate the release of histamine. The continuous stimulation of mast cells
      induces a chronic inflammatory state that promotes a Th2 type response.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the AGEs levels in FA children compared with healthy
      controls and subjects with other allergic diseases.

        Children with confirmed diagnosis of allergy and healthy controls consecutively observed at
        our tertiary center for pediatric allergy will be evaluated for inclusion in the study.
        Only subjects who will meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the
        study. Written informed consent will be obtained from the parents/tutors of each subject.
        Anamnestic, demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data, as well as information on use
        of drugs, pre-, pro- or symbiotic products will be collected. Also dietary habits will be
        evaluated, particularly number, place and time of meals, special diets or elimination
        diets, frequency of consumption of cereals and derivatives, meat products, fish, eggs,
        dairy products, fruit and vegetables, legumes, sweets, sweetened beverages and possibly
        alcoholic drinks and the corresponding cooking methods.
