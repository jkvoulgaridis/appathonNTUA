  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mental health of new parents around the time of the birth of their baby has been
      identified as a key priority in the NHS (National Health Service) Long Term plan. At present,
      there is no nationally implemented method for monitoring parents' mental health, although the
      use of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) has been recommended. This is a paper
      based questionnaire administered by health visitors in the postnatal period. For the purposes
      of this project, the investigators contacted health visitors in Manchester to find out how
      they use EPDS in practice. Currently, health visitors only use the questionnaire if they feel
      there is a need during visits, and the questionnaire is not kept (only the overall score).
      Since almost 20% of mums develop postnatal depression, more systematic and thorough screening
      is needed.

      The investigators developed an app version of the EPDS which takes less than 2 minutes to
      complete on a smartphone. It is anticpated that this will be a more accessible and practical
      method of conducting this important assessment. This project is a feasibility study to find
      out whether an app would be a feasible, acceptable, valid and safe way to monitor perinatal
      mental health in women and their partners.

      The investigators aim to recruit 20 women and their partners in late pregnancy (after 36
      weeks gestation) and ask them to use the app. The app will prompt completion of the EPDS once
      per day until 6 weeks postnatally. Participants' responses on the app will be transferred to
      a secure server at the University of Manchester. Participants will be invited to complete a
      paper version of the EPDS at the beginning and end of the study to check validity. They will
      also be asked to complete a questionnaire measuring the acceptability of the app and to take
      part in a brief qualitative interview at the end of the study.
