      This study will evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between dolutegravir (DTG) and
      steady state rifapentine (RPT) when RPT is given with isoniazid (INH) daily for 4 weeks (1HP)
      as part of treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) in HIV-1 and LTBI co-infected
      individuals.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between
      dolutegravir (DTG) and steady state rifapentine (RPT) when RPT is given with isoniazid (INH)
      daily for 4 weeks (1HP) as part of treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) in HIV-1 and LTBI
      co-infected individuals.

      Participants will receive study-provided INH and RPT once daily for 4 weeks (1HP). During the
      1HP treatment, DTG will be administered twice daily in Arm 1, and once daily in Arm 2.

      At study entry, all participants must also be on DTG-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatment
      with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (excluding tenofovir alafenamide
      [TAF]) during the study. In Arm 1 participants, DTG 50 mg will be administered twice daily;
      the morning dose from non-study ARV supply and the evening dose from study supply. In Arm 2
      participants, DTG 50 mg will be administered once daily, in the morning, from non-study ARV
      supply.

      Participants must receive pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with each dose of INH based on the current
      local, national, or international dosing guidelines. NRTI therapy and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
      will not be provided by the study.

      The study will begin enrollment with Arm 1. Opening of Arm 2 will depend on assessment of DTG
      pharmacokinetics (PK) data from participants in Arm 1.

      The majority of participants will be on study for 6 weeks (a 4-week on-study treatment period
      and a 2-week follow-up period). Some participants may be on study for up to 11 weeks if the
      on-study treatment duration has been extended or if participants need to have additional
      follow-up visits to measure viral load.

          -  Males and females at least 18 but no more than 65 years of age at study entry.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent.

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 infection status, as below:

               -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV-1 E/CIA test
                  kit at any time prior to entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a
                  second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA,
                  or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Two or more HIV-1 RNA viral
                  loads of &gt;1,000 copies/mL are also acceptable as documentation of HIV-1
                  infection.

                  (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all investigational new drug (IND)
                  studies, or for sites that are located in countries other than the United States,
                  a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that

               -  At non-US sites: Indication for LTBI treatment according to WHO latent TB
                  guidelines (Note: TST/IGRA results not required).

               -  with no gaps in self-reported DTG and NRTI adherence of more than 3 consecutive
                  days in the 28 days prior to study entry

               -  with no intention to change ART for the duration of the study

               -  NOTE A: Participants who switch from another ART regimen to DTG to meet

             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any network approved
             non-US laboratory that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practice
             (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;750 cells/mm^3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥7.4 g/dL

             clinic that operates in accordance with GCLP and participates in appropriate external
             quality assurance programs.

               -  NOTE A: If screening visit occurs within 48 hours prior to entry, only one test
                  will occur prior to entry.

               -  NOTE B: Urine test must have a sensitivity of 15-25 mIU/mL.

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in the

               -  NOTE A: Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent are not
                  acceptable, as they are not sufficiently reliable.

               -  NOTE B: Participant-reported history is acceptable documentation of menopause
                  (i.e., at least 1 year amenorrheic), hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or
                  bilateral tubal ligation; these candidates are considered not of reproductive
                  potential and are eligible without the required use of contraception.
