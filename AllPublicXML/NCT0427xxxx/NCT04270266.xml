    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a mind-body intervention works in improving overall quality of
      life in adolescents and young adults with Hodgkin lymphoma. A meditation based mind-body
      intervention may help lower distress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety in adolescents and
      young adults coping with Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Examine the feasibility of the mind-body intervention in adolescents and young adults
      (AYAs) with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Establish the initial intervention efficacy regarding psychological distress and cancer
      symptoms (tertiary objective) relative to an attention control (AC) group.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Explore mediation (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, social connection, inflammatory
      processes) and moderation (e.g., demographic and medical factors) of the intervention
      effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients attend meditation group sessions over 75 minutes once weekly for up to 5
      weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients attend educational group sessions over 75 minutes once weekly for up to 5
      weeks.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks.
