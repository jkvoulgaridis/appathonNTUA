  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study at Activated Family Chiropractic &amp; Wellness, is being proposed to test the
      efficacy of a novel electrical stimulation platform named the Pro-Sport Ultra® designed by
      AVAZZIA to relieve pain and improve mobility in patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients with a prior diagnosis (Dx) of CTS and have had a trial of
      conservative treatment for a minimum of 4 weeks without successful results due to continuing
      symptoms that interfere with normal function.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the changes obtained in CTS that have not
      successfully responded to non-surgical management by incorporating PRO-Sport Ultra® as
      opposed to an inactive device. This study aims to compare improvement obtained in CTS using
      the new therapy.

      All participants will be randomized into two treatment groups and receive treatment with both
      active and inactive devices during the study. During the first 2 weeks, one group will
      receive treatment with the active device and the other group will receive treatment with the
      inactive device. At the end of week 3 (no treatment week), participants will return to the
      clinic and will be crossed over for the next 2 weeks of treatment.

      The Avazzia PRO-Sport Ultra® and BEST-RSI® devices are non-invasive, hand-held, battery
      operated microcurrent devices that are FDA-cleared for the symptomatic relief and management
      of chronic, intractable pain and adjunctive treatment in the management of post-surgical and
      post-traumatic pain.
