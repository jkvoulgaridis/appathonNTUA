    <textblock>
      Acutely, during different bouts of passive stretching (PS), blood flow (Q ̇) and shear rate (
      ) in the feeding artery of the stretched muscles increases during the first two elongations
      and then it reduces during the following bouts. This hyperemic response during the first two
      elongations is mediated by the local release of vasoactive molecules (e.g. nitric oxide, NO).
      This phenomenon disappears during the following elongations due to the NO and other
      vasoactive molecule depletion. The relaxation phase between stretching bouts, instead, is
      always characterized by hyperemia as results of stretch-induced peripheral resistances
      decrease. Whether chronic PS administration may influence vascular function is still a matter
      of investigation. The hypothesis is that repetitive PS-induced Q ̇ and changes may be an
      enough stimulus to provoke increments in NO bioavailability, thus improving vasomotor
      response.

    <textblock>
      Vasomotor response is an important marker of cardiovascular health and has been related to
      cardiovascular co-morbidity. An alteration of vasomotor response, indeed, often precedes an
      increase in arterial stiffness. By improving and/or maintaining this vascular function,
      therefore, plays a pivotal role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The overall
      control of the vasomotor response and, in turn, of blood flow distribution in the human body
      is regulated by two main mechanisms: a systemic control given by the sympathetic nervous
      system that acts on the arterial smooth muscle fibers causing vasoconstriction, and a local
      action of vasoactive molecules released by the endothelial cells, such as nitric oxide (NO),
      leading to vasodilation.

      Recent studies report that acute passive stretching (PS), a well-established practice in
      rehabilitation and sport environments to increase range of motion, may influence the
      vasomotor response. Specifically, PS provokes two conflicting events: (i) a vasoconstriction
      with blood flow reduction in the feeding artery of the stretched muscle, triggered by the
      systemic increase in sympathetic neural tone due to the PS-induced stress on the muscle
      mechano- and metaboreceptors, and (ii) a vasodilation and subsequent increase in blood flow
      in the feeding artery due to the prevalence of local vasoactive factors release as a result
      of the stretch-induced stress applied to the vessel wall, which overwhelms the systemic
      sympathetic activation. Interestingly, throughout several stretch-shortening cycles, the
      first acute hyperemic response to stretch described above seems to progressively attenuate
      until its disappearance during the subsequent stretching cycles, possibly due to NO and other
      vasoactive molecules depletion.

      The shortening phase in between two stretch bouts, instead, is always characterized by
      hyperemia due to a reduction in the peripheral vascular resistance after the stretch-induced
      vessels deformation. Possible explanation of these phenomena involves the shear rate, which
      is the frictional or drag force acting on the inner lumen of the vessels that can trigger a
      chain of reactions, possibly leading to higher endothelial NO-synthase activity. Continuous
      and repetitive increases in shear rate induced by PS have been observed to act as vascular
      training to modulate endothelium remodeling and to improve vasomotor response.

      Interestingly, during an acute PS administration, a reduction in blood flow during stretching
      was described in the contralateral, no-stretched limb. Such a reduction was promptly
      recovered during the shortening phase. The authors suggested that this occurrence was induced
      by a systemic sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction, which was activated by the
      stretch-induced mechanoreflex.

      However, whether chronic PS administration may also affect the vasomotor response in the
      feeding artery of the contralateral muscle, which was not directly involved in the stretching
      maneuver, is still an open question.

      Together with the changes in local control mechanisms, also possible PS-induced changes in
      the systemic autonomic control of blood flow has been reported (i.e., reduction in blood
      pressure and aortic wave reflection magnitude, although its effectiveness remains a matter of
      debate With this in mind, this study aimed to investigate the effect of PS on the vasomotor
      response and the stiffness of the arteries directly involved (i.e., femoral and popliteal
      arteries) and not directly involved (i.e., contralateral femoral and popliteal arteries and
      brachial artery) with the maneuver applied on the plantar flexors, knee extensor and hip
      flexor muscles. To this purpose, vasomotor response and arterial stiffness were assessed by
      Doppler ultrasounds and applanation tonometry, respectively, before and after 12 weeks of PS
      administration. Hypothesis has been made that repetitive PS bouts, with consequent changes in
      blood flow and shear rate, may be an effective stimulus to (i) enhance local vasoactive
      molecules bioavailability in the arteries involved with PS; and (ii) induce a systemic
      re-modulation of the sympathetic autonomic activity, thus improving arterial compliance and
      vasomotor response even in those districts not directly involved with PS.

    <description>The radial artery pressure wave and amplitude were recorded non-invasively by means of applanation tonometry of the radial artery. Twenty sequential waveforms covering a complete respiratory cycle were acquired from the system and used by the software to generate an average peripheral and corresponding central waveform. The systolic part of the wave form was characterized by two pressure peaks of the central waveform. The first peak results from the left cardiac ventricle ejection while the second one results from the wave reflections from the periphery. The difference between these two peaks represents the degree of the central arterial pressure augmentation due to wave reflection (i.e., the augmentation index, mmHg)</description>

    <description>Flow mediated dilation was performed at brachial artery level. An arterial pressure cuff was placed around the forearm immediately distal to the olecranon process to provide an ischemic stimulus when inflated. Following baseline assessment, the blood pressure cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg. Artery diameter was and blood flow were resumed at baseline, 30 s prior to cuff deflation and continued for 2 min post-deflation by a linear array transducer attached to a high-resolution ultrasound machine. When an optimal image was obtained, the probe was held stable and longitudinal in B-mode, acquiring images of the lumen-arterial wall interface. Continuous Doppler velocity assessments were also obtained and collected using the lowest possible insonation angle (&lt;60°). Data were exported and analyzed using commercially available software. Flow mediated dilation was quantified as the maximal change in artery diameter after cuff release, expressed as a percentage increase above baseline (%).</description>

    <time_frame>Before, after 6 weeks, at the end (12th week), and after 6 weeks (Follow-up) of PS training</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum isometric voluntary contraction of the knee extensor muscles was measured with the participant laying supine on an ergometer with the knee flexed at 90° and firmly secured at the ankle level by a Velcro® strap to a load cell for the force signal detection. Hip and shoulders were also firmly secured to the ergometer. After a warm-up (10 x 2-s contractions at 50% maximum isometric voluntary contraction), three maximum isometric voluntary contraction attempts were performed, interspersed by at least 3 min of recovery. The participants were instructed to push as fast and hard as possible for 3 s. The maximum isometric voluntary contraction (N) was identified as the highest force produced during contraction.</description>

    <description>PSBil and PSMono underwent 12 weeks of PS training, 3 sessions per week (36 sessions in total). In PSBil, each session lasted 40 min and included two maneuvers for both the knee extensor and plantar flexor muscles with the following protocol: 45 s elongation and 15 s recovery in the resting position, all the cycle repeated for five times 7. In PSMono, exercises were performed only on the right limb and each session had a duration of 20 min. Ctrl did not underwent any PS exercise throughout the study. To promote participants' compliance, daily classes were held at different day time (morning and afternoon) at the University Sports Centre gym. Each class was supervised by an expert operator, which monitored the attendance, the correct exercise execution and the intensity exerted during the exercise (80% of the point of discomfort). The participants not attending at least the 80% of classes were excluded from the study, and a new participant was recruited to substitute the drop out.</description>
