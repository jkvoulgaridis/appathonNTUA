  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feedback delivered during motor practice can help promote motor skill learning and promote
      confidence. However, the optimal way to provide feedback to promote learning and confidence
      is unknown. This project will study how the feedback that is provided during practice of a
      movement skill can help people learn and build confidence. The investigators will measure
      motor skill performance and confidence before and after a session of motor practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feedback may be a useful tool to optimize motor learning during practice. For example,
      feedback during practice that indicates the learner is performing above average (i.e.
      positive social comparative feedback) enhances motor skill learning and self-efficacy in
      healthy adults. While this type of feedback is hypothesized to promote learning in some
      tasks, no studies have examined whether positive social comparative feedback during practice
      promotes motor learning in a traditional motor sequence task. Therefore, the aim of the
      proposed project is to investigate the effect of positive social comparative feedback on the
      learning of a joystick-based motor sequence task in healthy adults. The study aims to recruit
      60 participants who will be randomized into 1 of 3 feedback groups (control group,
      performance feedback, and performance plus positive feedback). Participants will practice a
      motor sequence task on a single day and then return for retention performance testing about
      24 hours later. Changes in performance (response time to complete a sequence) and
      self-efficacy will be measured from baseline to 24 hours later at retention.

    <description>Participants will be seated at a laptop with the right hand on a standard joystick. The movement of the joystick will move a cursor on the computer screen. Targets will appear on the laptop screen as a circle in one of twelve spatially distinct locations. The learner must move the joystick &quot;cursor&quot; to inside the target before the next target will appear.</description>
