  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Project aims to provide social workers and relevant human service professionals with a
      comprehensive, scientific, and validated service model and suggest a sustainable support
      framework on the working process of helping and empowering family caregivers of frail elders,
      reducing caregiving distress, and enhancing caregivers' quality of life.

      The proposed Project consists of two parts to be conducted in 1 year. The first part focuses
      on the development and validation of Caregiver Support Model (CSM) with a Randomized
      Controlled Trial (RCT) study. The second part develops and validates a psycho-education
      program on empowering family caregivers with another Randomized Controlled design. In the
      first year, the Project Team have (1) developed and designed different components of the
      Caregiver Support Model (CSM), including a comprehensive need assessment tool, personalized
      Caregiver Intervention Plan Guidelines and Template, and online database on caregiver
      services and community resources, (2) designed a five-session psycho-education program on
      empowerment. The Caregiver Needs Assessment (CNA) tool was also pilot-tested with 320
      community caregivers. Results from the survey, together with the systematic review on
      caregiver support, will form the backbone of the later CNA implementation. The working model
      will be validated using RCT design with 400 family caregivers recruited through 4
      collaborating NGOs. At the same time, a psycho-education program on empowerment will be
      developed and validated using RCT design with another 190 caregivers.

      Participants of CSM will be randomly assigned to CSM intervention and non-CSM intervention
      which is the usual practice of case handling by centre staff. Randomization will be based on
      centres to prevent exchange of information between the two groups, and thus causing
      contamination. Outcome data will be measured at 3 time-intervals: case intake, 3-month, and
      6-month.

      Participants of the psychoeducation program on empowerment (PPE) will be randomly assigned to
      the program group and the non-program group. For the former a 5-session psychoeducation
      program will be administered. For both groups, outcome measures will be collected at pre,
      post, and 3-month after post test.

For PPE, there will be no masked information but exchange of information and cross discussion between two groups will be discouraged. For outcome assessment, a coordinator will be used and assessors will not know beforehand whether the case to assess is from treatment or control group.</masking_description>
