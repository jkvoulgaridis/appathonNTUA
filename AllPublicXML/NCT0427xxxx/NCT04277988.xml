  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if sitting in flexed cross legged position for neuraxial techniques in term
      pregnant patients widens the size of the ultrasound acoustic window as measured by the
      visualized posterior longitudinal ligament length, during lumbar spine ultrasonography using
      longitudinal paramedian view, in comparison to the standard sitting flexed position.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study involving a total of 30 healthy term gestation
      pregnant patients with singleton fetuses.Patients will be randomly allocated to sit crossed
      leg or in standard position first. Using ultrasonography, the acoustic window for lumbar
      spinal anesthesia at L3-4 will be evaluated in both traditional sitting and crossed leg
      positions. Ultrasonography will be performed sequentially to measure the best visualized
      length of posterior longitudinal ligament,ligamentum flavum and interlaminar distance in the
      paramedian view.The scanned image will be saved to be remeasured by a third observer.
      Patients will be asked to score their comfort level while sitting in both positions.
