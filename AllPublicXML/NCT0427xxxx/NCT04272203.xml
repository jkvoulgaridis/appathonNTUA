  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce
      uncontrollably. This study focuses on two types of cancers: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). AML (blood cancer) is cancer of the white blood cells
      (WBC). NSCLC (solid tumor) is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the
      lung. The purpose of this study is to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to see if
      the study drug is safe and able to treat patients who have AML and NSCLC.

      ABBV-184 is an investigational drug being developed for treatment of cancer. The study has
      two arms and two phases: AML arm and NSCLC arm; dose escalation and dose expansion phase.
      Adult participants with diagnosis of AML or NSCLC will be enrolled. In dose escalation phase,
      around 36 participants will be enrolled in each arm. In dose expansion phase, around 20
      participants will be enrolled in each arm. The study will be conducted in approximately 50
      sites across 10 countries.

      Participants will receive weight based intravenous (IV) infusion of ABBV-184 once a week. At
      the beginning of the study, visits will occur daily during hospitalization followed by less
      frequently over time.

      There will be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or
      clinic. The effect of treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking
      for side effects, and questionnaires.
