  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the role of low-gamma activity in phonemic encoding and its
      implication in dyslexia. Indeed, a phonological deficit, i.e. a difficulty in perceiving the
      sounds of speech, is strongly suspected in dyslexia but has never been conclusively
      associated with a specific underlying mechanism.

      The study employs transcranial alternating current stimulation in adults with and without
      dyslexia to exploit the effect of the stimulation on phonemic processing and neural activity
      measured with electroencephalography. In doing so, it would be possible to establishing a
      causal link between gamma oscillations and the phonological deficit in dyslexia.

    <masking_description>One of three different tACS conditions is administered to all participant during three experimental days. The conditions differ in the frequency of stimulation (condition 1 and 2) and in whether the stimulation is active or faked (sham). The order of the three stimulation conditions is counterbalanced across participants, who are not aware of which tACS condition they are undergoing.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>6 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Auditory-steady state responses to auditory stimuli are measured to assess specific differences between individuals with dyslexia and normo-readers, and between the different tACS stimulation conditions before, after and 1h after the 20 min. tACS stimulation.
These neural correlated are estimated by considering the power of EEG signal at the frequency used to modulate the auditory stimuli.</description>

    <description>Focal transcranial stimulation over auditory cortex by means of 5 electrodes delivering an electric current (max. 2mA). In addition to active stimulation, also a placebo (sham) stimulation is employed as a control condition. All subjects included in the study receive all tACS stimulation conditions.</description>
