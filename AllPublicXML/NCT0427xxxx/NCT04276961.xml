  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of
      refractory irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The investigators will include 170 participants to
      receive acupuncture plus usual care or sham acupuncture plus usual care. Twelve sessions of
      acupuncture will be delivered to participants over a period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome
      is defined as proportion of participants with adequate relief of global IBS symptoms at week
      12, which is defined as &gt;50% reduction in IBS-SSS scale.

    <description>Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (IBS-QOL) is a condition-specific measure for assessing health-related QoL among persons with irritable bowel syndrome. The IBS-QOL had eight subscales. The IBS-QOL and its subscales were both scored on a range of 0-100 with higher scores suggestive of better QOL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), week12</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale, or HADS, was designed to provide a simple yet reliable tool for use in medical practice. The HADS consists of 14 items, divided into two 7 item subscales: Anxiety (HADS-A); items reflect a state of generalized anxiety Depression (HADS-D); focus on the concept of anhedonia. The respondent rates each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>
