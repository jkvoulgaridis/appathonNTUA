      This study evaluates and compares the effect of two types of calcium- and
      phosphate-containing fluoride varnishes to conventional fluoride varnishes in preventing
      early childhood caries.

      Fluoride vanish is the most commonly used professionally applied topical agent. Traditional
      fluoride vanish application has been reported to exhibit significant caries inhibiting effect
      in both permanent teeth and primary teeth. The greatest advantage of fluoride vanish is its
      ability to adhere to tooth tissues for a longer period of time that enables improved fluoride
      uptake. It allows continuous release of fluoride ions into enamel, dentine, plaque, and
      saliva.The main action of topical fluoride is to retard demineralization and promote
      remineralization of enamel by the uptake of calcium and phosphates from saliva. The proposed
      mechanism of action of topical fluoride is the formation of intraoral calcium fluoride
      reservoirs, which are retained on enamel and slowly released to inhibit mineral loss during
      demineralization.

      However, the formation of the intraoral calcium fluoride reservoirs is limited by the
      availability of intraoral calcium and fluoride ions. Low concentration of salivary calcium
      and phosphate ions leads to mineral deposition only at the surface of enamel as a result of
      low ion concentration gradient. Deposition of minerals at the surface of enamel alone may not
      improve the structural properties of the deep part of the incipient carious lesions. Hence,
      many manufacturers have modified fluoride vanish to include calcium and phosphate ions in an
      attempt to further improve efficacy of fluoride varnishes.

      The in vitro remineralizing effects of calcium- and phosphate-containing fluoride vanishes
      are encouraging and scientifically sound, a longitudinal, high quality clinical study is
      needed to verify the laboratory findings.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Generally healthy children age between 3-4 of age with unremarkable medical history
             and at high caries risk with at least one carious lesion (precavitated or cavitated)
             (Agouropoulos et al 2014). The high caries risk children are chosen because it is
             anticipated that they will benefit more from the topical fluoride varnish application
             than the low caries risk children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had received professional fluoride application in the past 6 months

               -  Patients with underlying medical history or special health care needs

               -  Patient who are uncooperative or refuse the treatment

               -  Patient who are allergic to milk protein (as MI VarnishTM contains &quot;casein, a
                  milk protein)

               -  Patient with contraindication for fluoride varnish e.g. hypersensitivity to
                  colophony and/or any other constituents

               -  Patient who have primary teeth with enamel hypoplasia
