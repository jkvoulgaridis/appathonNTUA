  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Western diet pattern or standard American diet is a modern dietary pattern that is
      characterized by high intakes of meat, pre-packaged foods, fried foods, high-fat dairy
      products, eggs, refined grains etc. When considering the role of saturated fat, it may be
      prudent to advise limiting all foods that contain saturated fats, including traditional foods
      such as unprocessed/minimally processed meat, eggs, whole dairy in addition to processed,
      pre-packaged foods; however, this reductionist approach fails to take into account the food
      matrix and overall diet in which these nutrients are consumed.

      Traditional nutrient-dense whole food sources such as beef, poultry, whole dairy, and eggs
      have increasingly been replaced by processed, pre-packaged foods and refined oils in the
      Western diet pattern. Epidemiological evidence suggests that increased modern, pre-packaged
      food consumption is a major risk factor for metabolic disease by promoting inflammation.
      Based on these data, the investigators hypothesize that the pro-atherogenic effect of the
      Western diet is caused by the pro-inflammatory effects of consuming large amounts of modern
      pre-packaged foods, and that consumption of a similar amount of total and saturated fat from
      whole foods such as beef, poultry, whole dairy and eggs confers no cardio-metabolic risk.
