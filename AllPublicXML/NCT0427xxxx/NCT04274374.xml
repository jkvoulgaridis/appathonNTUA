  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subclinical intestinal inflammation and gut dysbiosis have been reported in patients with
      spondyloarthritis (SpA). In common practice, rheumatologists are increasingly confronted with
      patients with inflammatory rheumatism who are on gluten-free diets (GFDs), despite the lack
      of reliable data from controlled studies. This study aims to determine the impact of a GFD on
      the quality of life of patients with axial SpA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GlutenSpA study is a 24-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      trial. Patients with axial SpA (n=200) will follow a 16-week GFD and be randomly assigned
      (1:1) to an experimental or control arm. In the experimental arm with receive at least 6
      gluten-free breads per day + 200 g of gluten-free penne pasta per week + 6 rice flavor
      capsules per day. The control arm will receive at least 6 gluten-containing breads per day +
      200 g of gluten-containing penne pasta per week + 6 vital gluten-containing capsules per day.

      At baseline, the dietician will explain to the patients how to properly follow a GFD during a
      face-to-face interview. The patient's compliance to the GFD will be evaluated by the
      dietician at S2, S16, an S24 using an online 3-day alimentary questionnaire.

      The bread and penne pasta were chosen for their visual resemblance and similar taste to
      maximize the blindness of the study. In order to reach the daily amount of gluten in a
      standard diet (estimated in France between 10 and 15 g/d) in the control arm, each day
      patients will have to ingest six capsules of vital gluten wheat made for the study. Vital
      gluten flour is an over-the-counter food supplement used to enrich a protein diet or as a
      base for making products, such as seitan. Capsules will be made using commercially available
      vital gluten and contain 0.35 g of gluten per capsule. The total amount of gluten in the
      control arm will be approximately 10.5 g/day.

      After the 16-week GFD, patients will be offered to follow or not follow the GFD according to
      their own decision for an 8-week open-labelled follow-up period. The study duration for each
      patient is 24 weeks. The patient recruitment is expected to last 2 years

    <time_frame>Change from baseline ASAS HI score at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The self-report questionnaire measures functioning and health across 17 aspects of health and 9 environmental factors (EF) in patients with SpA. The total sum of the ASAS HI ranges from 0-17, with a lower score indicating a better health status.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline BASDAI score at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI consists of a 0 - 10 scale measuring discomfort, pain, and fatigue (0 being no problem and 10 being the worst problem) in response to six questions. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final 0 - 10 BASDAI score. Scores of 4 or greater suggest suboptimal control of disease,</description>

    <measure>effects of a 16-week GFD versus placebo diet on parameters of inflammation evaluated by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline ESR at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An ESR is a type of blood test that measures how quickly erythrocytes settle at the bottom of a test tube that contains a blood sample. Normally, red blood cells settle relatively slowly. A faster-than-normal rate may indicate inflammation in the body.</description>

    <measure>effects of a 16-week GFD versus placebo diet on parameters of inflammation evaluated by the C-reactive protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline CRP at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A c-reactive protein test measures the level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. CRP is a protein made by your liver. It's sent into your bloodstream in response to inflammation. Normally, you have low levels of c-reactive protein in your blood. High levels may be sign of a serious infection or other disorder.</description>

    <description>The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. Score range 0-52. A score of less than 30 indicates severe fatigue. The higher the score, the better the quality of life</description>
