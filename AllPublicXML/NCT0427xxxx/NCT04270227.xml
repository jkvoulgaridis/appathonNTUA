  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18-25 who will not have any problems preventing
      physical activity will be included among the university students. The criteria for not being
      included in the study were determined as being diagnosed with any disease that impedes
      physical activity and not wanting to participate in the study. Participation in the
      investigator's study is completely voluntary. Individuals who do not wish to participate in
      the study will be excluded. Cases with missing survey and demographic information will be
      excluded from the study. The planned study is a cross-sectional study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body awareness scale (Body awareness questionnaire-Turkish)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire consisting of four subgroups (changes in the body process, sleep-wake cycle, prediction at the onset of the disease, prediction of body responses) and a total of 18 expressions aimed at determining the normal or abnormal sensitivity level of the body composition. The participant is asked to score between one and seven numbers for each statement. In the survey, the ratings are made as total points. The high score shows that body sensitivity is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 43-item questionnaire using the 4-item Likert scale. The score varies between 43 and 172. High scores on the benefits scale show the perceived benefits of physical activity, while high scores on the barrier scale show that perceived barriers to physical activity are low.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity levels of the participants according to the total physical activity score; It was classified as physically inactive (3000MET-min / hf) and low physical activity level (600-3000 MET-min / hf) with sufficient physical activity level (&gt; 3000MET-min / hf).</description>
