  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging the amount of slow wave sleep decreases drastically and this disruption is
      markedly exaggerated in older adults suffering from mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's
      disease. Critically, the disruption of slow wave sleep and cognitive decline seem
      bidirectionally linked forming a vicious cycle. In the long run, improving slow wave sleep
      might be a useful intervention tool to delay the onset of cognitive decline. The present
      study aims at improving slow wave sleep and memory functions through a closed-loop acoustic
      stimulation approach. A closed-loop algorithm is used that detects slow waves in the
      electroencephalogram and is programmed to present short tones (50 ms) in the rhythm of these
      waves. This procedure has shown to boost both slow wave sleep as well as memory performance,
      mainly in young adults and when applied for one night. Here, the investigators apply tones
      via multiple consecutive nights and assess memory performance during this 3-night
      intervention.

    <measure>Change from baseline episodic memory performance after three nights of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in memory performance will be assessed between the baseline measurement (evening before the first intervention night) and on the morning of the last intervention night (1 hour after waking), 3 days after initial encoding</time_frame>
    <description>Face-occupation associative memory task: encoding of 40 faces coupled with 40 occupations takes place on the evening of the first intervention night followed by a retrieval session (BASELINE). Feedback-based retrieval sessions take place on the following mornings and evenings of three consecutive intervention nights (4 feedback-based encoding sessions). After the last intervention night a retrieval session without feedback is performed upon waking (ASSESSMENT OF CHANGE)</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline performance in computer-based verbal new learning task (episodic memory) after three nights of intervention</measure>

    <description>Verbal associative memory task: a list of 30 moderately associated word pairs (e.g. balloon-air) are presented on a screen. The respective word pairs are displayed for five seconds each and participants are asked to memorize them. After a one-minute break, a cued recall follows in which one word of each pair is randomly shown and participants are prompted to name the matching second word (BASELINE). After the last intervention night a different list of 30 word pairs is used for another session of encoding and retrieval (ASSESSMENT OF CHANGE)</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of three consecutive nights of closed loop acoustic stimulation during slow wave sleep. An established closed-loop algorithm is utilized that detects slow oscillations in the electroencephalogram and is programmed to present short tones (50 ms) into their up-states. Tones will be presented via a headband with integrated speakers. The procedure does not wake participants</description>
