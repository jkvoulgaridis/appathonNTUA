    <textblock>
      Main objective: To evaluate the bidirectional relationships between physical exercise and
      sleep parameters, as a part of multimodal prehabilitation intervention, on pre- and
      postoperative outcomes in surgical patients with colorectal cancer, in an RCT.

      Secondary objective: to determine whether the levels of anxiety and depression affect these
      relationships.

      Objectives are based on the overarching hypothesis that is sleep and physical activity
      influence each other through complex, reciprocal interactions including multiple
      physiological and psychological pathways. To achieve this, providing a multimodal
      prehabilitation, specifically physical exercise, involved in mental and physical health
      through different mechanisms, i.e., improving physical functioning and fitness, reducing side
      effects of cancer treatments, preventing bone loss and weight gain, improving the quality of
      life and sleep, decreasing symptoms of fatigue and depression.

      The present is a pilot study aiming to evaluate the bidirectional relationships between sleep
      and physical exercise, and the preliminary outcome has important implications for informing
      both clinical and public health practice.

      Research question: Does a multimodal intervention including physical exercise improve sleep
      quality and duration compared to standard of care, during the perioperative period?
      Conversely, does a better sleep quality and duration increases the level of physical exercise
      during the perioperative period? How the level of anxiety and depression will affect these
      relationships? If the Prehabilitation program specifically physical exercise will positively
      affect sleep quality and duration after surgery, in the way to be a protective factor of
      sleep to not be reduced by up to 55% compared to those receiving standard of care?

      Participants will be referred by colorectal surgery of the MUHC-Montreal General Hospital;
      100 participants will be studied. Inclusion: adult patients aged 18 years and older, of
      either sex undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. All adult persons scheduled for resection of
      malignant colorectal lesions will be included. Exclusion criteria: a compromised health
      status (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class 4-5) or comorbid medical conditions
      interfering with the ability to perform an exercise. Patients are unable to understand the
      information given, insufficient understanding of English or French language to provide
      informed consent or who are considered unable to perform study-specific procedures. Patients
      that diagnosis of a sleep disorder other than insomnia (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) or
      received psychotherapy specifically for insomnia, as well as a night-shift worker in the past
      3 months or the next 18 months will be excluded.

      Study Design: Randomized controlled trial of two parallel arms: prehabilitation program and
      standard of care (SOC). Informed consent forms will be signed and dated before the conduct of
      any study-specific procedures. After baseline assessment, participants will be random, by a
      computer program, allocated to either an intervention or a control group. Duration and
      follow-up. The intervention will last for 4 weeks pre- and 8 weeks post-surgery, for a total
      of 12 weeks. Site visits will occur weekly before surgery and every 4 weeks after surgery. In
      that period, weekly phone calls will reinforce compliance and provide tips to help patients
      adhere to the treatment protocol. A dedicated and specially trained research team lead by a
      physician, a kinesiologist, a nutritionist and a psychologist will perform the measurements
      and collect the demographic and surgical details of all the patients, recording daily
      detailed information of clinical outcomes up to 8 weeks after surgery.

      Interventions: Common to both groups: as part of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)
      protocol as the standard of care in our institution. All participants will wear an actigraphy
      to objectively assess their daily physical activity and their sleep behavior. The following
      outcomes will be assessed for all participants, at the baseline and will be repeated after 4
      weeks, before and after the surgery: sleep behaviors included sleep quality and duration,
      assessed subjectively and objectively. Self-reported and objective outcome measurements will
      be assessed from all participants such as the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), daily activity
      counts, exercise tolerance (CPET) and handgrip strength, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),
      Chronotype, health-related quality of life assessed by using the Medical Outcomes Study
      36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
      used to assess emotional distress.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized controlled pilot trial of patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for major abdominal surgery. The prehabilitation intervention group will be compared with the usual care for an average of 4 weeks before planned surgery. All participants will wear an actigraphy to objectively assess their daily physical activity and their sleep behavior.
The intervention will last for 4 weeks pre- and 8 weeks post-surgery, for a total of 12 weeks. Site visits will occur weekly before surgery and every 4 weeks after surgery. In that period, weekly phone calls will reinforce compliance and provide tips to help patients adhere to the treatment protocol. A dedicated and specially trained research team lead by a physician, a kinesiologist, a nutritionist and a psychologist will perform the measurements and collect the demographic and surgical details of all the patients, recording daily detailed information of clinical outcomes up to 8 weeks after surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>At the baseline, it will be repeated the week of the surgery and at 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was developed to assess the global subjective sleep disturbances of the previous month. The PSQI is a 19-item self-report measure of broad sleep disturbances over the past month and yields 7 component scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction), which are added to create a total score. Each score ranging from 0 to 3 and a total score range of 0-21, a score of 0 indicated no sleep problems and 3 indicated serious sleep problems.</description>

    <measure>The oxygen peak during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET): &quot;change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline, it will be repeated the week of the surgery and at 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>CPET has a growing role in major abdominal surgery to guide decision-making by clinicians and to evaluate the consequences of neo-adjuvant therapies and prehabilitation programs.
The term 'peak VO2' is used as a synonym for VO2 max throughout this text. Peak VO2 is considered abnormal when below 85% of the predicted value.</description>

    <measure>Pulmonary ventilation measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET): &quot;change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline, it will be repeated the week of the surgery and at 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary ventilation (VE): Ventilation increases continuously during progressive effort on CPET and undergoes additional increases influenced by the anaerobic metabolism resulting from the accumulation of lactic acid, well defined as the first and second ventilatory thresholds. Periodic (or oscillatory) ventilation is defined as the resting oscillatory pattern that persists in ≥ 60% of the effort with an amplitude of ≥ 15% as compared to mean resting values.</description>

    <description>Respiratory coefficient or respiratory exchange ratio (R): expresses the ratio between CO2 production and O2 consumption (VCO2/VO2). It is currently the best non-invasive indicator of maximal or quasi-maximal exercise intensity. Values above 1.0 can reflect intense exercise, but those ≥ 1.10 are those searched on CPET, and have been accepted as a parameter of exhaustion or quasi-exhaustion.</description>
