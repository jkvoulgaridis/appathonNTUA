  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that insufficient sleep has a negative impact on children's physical
      and psychological health. Napping was found to decrease sleepiness and improve daytime
      functioning in adults and adolescents. The effects of napping on children, however, is
      unknown. The current study aims to test the effects of short daytime classroom naps on
      daytime functioning and behaviour in elementary school children.

      This study is an interventional study testing the effects of short daytime nap on children's
      cognitive functioning and daytime behaviour. Primary school children will be randomised to
      either experimental (nap) or control group (no nap) by class. Measurements include
      parent-report questionnaires, children's self-report questionnaires, and cognitive tasks.
