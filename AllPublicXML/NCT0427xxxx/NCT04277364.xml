  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are indications that phosphatidic acid (PA) supplementation is capable of enhancing
      gains in strength and muscle mass in response to strength training, although the literature
      is still incipient and controversial. Given the possible benefits in terms of maintenance and
      increased skeletal muscle mass, which still need confirmation, this study aims to examine the
      effectiveness of PA supplementation in two different doses in increasing skeletal muscle mass
      and strength in adult men undergoing to 12 weeks of strength training. For this, about 45 men
      will be randomly allocated to one of three treatments at a ratio of 1:1:1: PA 750mg per day,
      PA 375mg per day, or placebo (cornstarch, 750mg per day). All participants will undergo a
      12-week strength training program, 3 times a week, totaling 36 sessions, which will begin
      with the start of supplementation. Individuals will be assessed for maximum dynamic strength
      of upper and lower limbs, resistance to dynamic strength of upper and lower limbs, body
      composition, muscle cross-sectional area and food consumption. Samples of venous blood will
      also be collected to determine the concentration of creatine kinase (CK), lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH), testosterone, insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), growth hormone
      (GH) and cortisol. These evaluations will be carried out before (PRE) and after (POST) the
      period of supplementation and training. Additional blood samples will be taken 48 hours after
      the first and last training sessions, for specific determination of blood muscle damage
      markers: CK and LDH.

      There are indications that phosphatidic acid (PA) supplementation is capable of enhancing
      gains in strength and muscle mass in response to strength training, although the literature
      is still incipient and controversial. The present study will adopt a randomized,
      double-blind, parallel group and placebo-controlled design, with the objective of evaluating
      the effectiveness of chronic phosphatidic acid supplementation in gaining maximum dynamic
      muscle strength, body composition and muscle cross-sectional area in trained adult
      individuals submitted to a strength training program.

      About 45 men will be randomly allocated to one of the three treatments, in the proportion 1:
      1: 1: PA 750mg per day, PA 375 per day, or placebo (corn starch, 750 per day), for 12 weeks.
      The allocation of participants to the experimental groups will be randomized using software
      (www.random.org). In addition to the pairing, the groups will be equalized by the maximum
      dynamic force (sum of the upper and lower limb loads) of the participants at the PRE moment.
      For randomization, proportional distribution between groups and equalization by maximum
      force, participants will be recruited in blocks of 6 or 9 participants, which will be ranked
      based on their maximum strength, with these procedures being carried out within each block.
      Random sequences of numbers 1, 2 and 3, representing the treatments PA high dose, PA low dose
      and placebo, will be randomly distributed to each three participants within each block,
      respecting the ranking by maximum force.

      All participants will be submitted to a 12-week strength training program, 3 times a week,
      totaling 36 sessions, which will start at the beginning of supplementation. The training will
      follow the daily wavy periodization model. In this model, the weekly training sessions are
      called A, B and C, with the total volume changed at each session, as follows: in sessions A,
      participants will do 3 sets of each exercise, in sessions B, 4 sets of each exercise and, in
      sessions C, again 3 sets of each exercise. Participants will perform the following exercises:
      bench press, 45ยบ leg-press, pulley pull, squat on the guided bar and leg extension in the
      extension chair. The interval between sets will be 60 seconds and, between exercises, 90
      seconds. The loads will be individually adjusted for each series, in such a way that the
      participants are able to perform between 8 and 12 maximum repetitions (until the concentric
      failure or until the participant cannot maintain an adequate pattern of movement).

      Before and after treatments, participants will be evaluated for the following parameters:
      body composition by hydrostatic weighing, maximum dynamic strength of upper limbs (1RM
      supine) and lower limbs (1RM leg-press), dynamic strength resistance of upper and lower
      limbs, cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles via
      ultrasound.The following blood parameters will also be evaluated: CK, LDH, free testosterone,
      IGF-1, GH and cortisol through immunoenzymatic, colorimetric enzymatic or fluorimetric
      enzymatic assays. Additional blood collections will be performed 48 hours after the first and
      last sessions training for specific determination of blood muscle damage markers: CK and LDH.

      The assessment of maximum strength will be performed on leg-press equipment, for the lower
      limbs, and supine, for the upper limbs. The tests for assessing maximum dynamic strength
      (1RM) will follow methods proposed by the American Society for Exercise Physiology (Brown &amp;
      Weir, 2001). The evaluation of dynamic strength endurance will be performed in leg-press and
      bench press exercises where the volunteers must perform repetitions until fatigue with a load
      equivalent to 70% of 1RM, which will be previously determined in the maximum strength test.
      Participants will have to perform the maximum number of repetitions until reaching the
      concentric failure. Each individual will perform 3 sets with an interval of 2 minutes between
      them.

      Body composition will be assessed by hydrostatic weighing. The body volume will then be
      calculated according to Wilmore and Behnke (1969) and the fat percentage according to Siri
      (1961). The residual lung volume will be estimated according to Goldman and Becklake (1959).

      The architecture of the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles will be evaluated with a
      B-mode ultrasound, with a linear vector transducer and a frequency of 7.5 MHz (Samsung,
      Sonaance R3). The images obtained will be assembled in such a way that the cross-sectional
      area of the vast side is established, which will be subsequently evaluated by the Madena
      3.2.1 free-use image digitization software.

      The evaluation of food consumption will be carried out through food diaries of 3
      non-consecutive days, two of which are weekdays, and one weekend. Energy and macronutrient
      consumption will be calculated using the Nutritionist Pro software.

      The data obtained in the PRE-intervention period will be compared between the groups using
      one-way ANOVA after confirmation of the normality of the data distribution, which will be
      done using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the distribution is not normal, the Kruskal-Wallis
      non-parametric test will be used. All study variables will be evaluated following the mixed
      2-factor model (time and group), with two levels in the time factor (PRE vs. POST) and three
      levels in the treatment factor (high dose vs. low dose BP vs. Placebo). Participants will be
      random factors. Four different covariance matrix structures will be tested and the one that
      demonstrates the best fit to each data set will be used (lowest BIC, or Bayes information
      criterion). If there is a statistically significant interaction effect, a hypothesis-guided
      contrast analysis of degree of freedom will be conducted to locate intra- and inter-subject
      differences.

      Post-pre deltas will also be calculated, both in percentage and absolute terms, for all
      variables. These data will be compared between groups by means of one-way ANOVA, or by
      Kruskal-Wallis test, if they do not present a normal distribution. The data will be presented
      in mean and standard deviation. The analyzes will be made using the SAS 9.3 software. The
      level of significance adopted will be 5%.

      The sample size was determined with the aid of the G-Power software (v. 3.1.9.2) considering
      the F test model (ANOVA with repeated measures), with comparisons within and between, with
      three groups being evaluated twice in time. The input parameters were: significance level =
      5%; effect size = 0.25 (small); power (1-ฮฒ) = 0.8, which resulted in a total sample size of
      42 participants. To account for probable sample losses and dropouts, around 45 participants
      will be recruited for this study.

    <description>Assessments of the maximum dynamic strength and the dynamic strength resistance of the upper and lower limbs will be performed before and after treatment. The evaluation of the maximum dynamic strength will be performed on leg-press equipment, for the lower limbs, and bench press, for the upper limbs. The tests for assessing maximum dynamic strength (1RM) will follow methods proposed by the American Society for Exercise Physiology (Brown &amp; Weir, 2001). After determining the 1-RM, the test will be repeated 5 days later to confirm the maximum loads. The tests will be repeated as many times as necessary until the difference between charges is less than 5%. The evaluation of dynamic strength endurance will be performed in leg-press and bench press exercises where the volunteers must perform repetitions until fatigue with a load equivalent to 70% of 1RM. Participants will have to perform the maximum number of repetitions until reaching the concentric failure.</description>

    <measure>Compare muscle hypertrophy responses</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The architecture of the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles will be evaluated with a B-mode ultrasound, with a linear vector transducer and a frequency of 7.5 MHz (Samsung, Sonaance R3).For this, the volunteers will be placed in the supine position with legs extended. An experienced researcher will delimit, with semi-permanent ink, the point on which the measurements will be taken. The skin will then be marked transversely (angle of 90 with the lateral epicondyle of the tibia) every 2 cm for measurements. The transducer, aligned perpendicular to the muscle, will be moved from a central position to a lateral position along the pre-established boundaries. The contact pressure will be kept minimal and stable during each measurement. Finally, the images obtained will be assembled in such a way that the cross-sectional area of the vast side is established, which will be subsequently evaluated by the Madena 3.2.1 free-use image digitization software.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess effects on body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be assessed by hydrostatic weighing before and after the treatment period. The participant must wear only swim trunks and must fast for 4 hours, having not ingested water in the last 4 hours before the test. The individual will enter the pool, sit on a chair and leave only his face out of the water. Then you should sink your head completely in the water, breathing out all the air in your lungs. The procedure should be repeated about 10 times, until we obtain a stable measure of the weight in the water. The body volume will then be calculated according to Wilmore and Behnke (1969) and the fat percentage according to Siri (1961). The residual lung volume will be estimated according to Goldman and Becklake (1959). The fat free mass and fat mass data will be determined in units of kilograms (kg) and percentage (%), in addition to the value of total body mass (kg).</description>
