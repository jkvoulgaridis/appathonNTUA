  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-079 in
      participants with persistent/chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to treat
      people who have primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This study will evaluate the safety
      and biologic activity of TAK-079 or matching placebo in combination with stable ITP
      background therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 54 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups in the Part A double blind
      treatment period. Those who received placebo in this period will have choice to receive study
      drug after a safety follow-up period and upon randomization to either of the two open-label
      treatment arms.

      Upon investigators decision, Part B will randomly assign participants to one of two treatment
      groups in Part B double blind treatment period. Those who received placebo in this period
      will have the choice to receive study drug after safety follow-up period in a single
      open-label treatment arm.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. It does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of other outcomes listed in definition above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. Severity grade for AE will be determined using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been diagnosed with ITP that has persisted for ≥3 months, diagnosed in accordance
             to The American Society of Hematology 2011 Evidence-based Practice Guideline for
             Immune Thrombocytopenia or the International Consensus Report on The Investigation and
             Management of Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia as locally applicable.

          -  Has mean platelet count of &lt;30,000/μL for the 4 weeks before the first study dose. The
             mean platelet count is based on at least 2 platelet counts within 4 weeks of dosing,
             including the value obtained at screening. No individual platelet count &gt;35,000/μL
             during these times is allowed.

          -  Has had 1 prior platelet response to any standard of care treatment to achieve a
             platelet count of ≥50,000/μL. Any standard treatment in this context may include
             therapies that are not permitted concomitant therapies during the study.

          -  If receiving standard background treatment for ITP, treatment should be stable in dose
             and frequency for at least 4 weeks before dosing.

               1. Permitted standard background treatments may include: 1 oral corticosteroid; ±1
                  immunosuppressant from the following list: azathioprine, danazol, dapsone,
                  cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium; ±1 thrombopoietin
                  receptor agonist (TPO-RA) (romiplostim, eltrombopag, avatrombopag);
                  ±fostamatinib. Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, must be given as oral,
                  daily therapy as opposed to pulse therapy. High-dose pulse steroid therapy is not
                  allowed within 14 days before Day 1.

               2. The dose of any permitted standard background therapy must be expected to remain
                  stable through the study, unless dose reduction is required because of
                  toxicities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uses anticoagulants or any drug with antiplatelet effect (such as aspirin) within 3
             weeks before screening.

          -  Has a history of any thrombotic or embolic event within 12 months before screening.

          -  Has a history of splenectomy within 3 months before screening.

          -  Uses intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), subcutaneous immunoglobulin or anti-D
             treatment within 4 weeks of screening.

          -  Is diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, and a
             prebronchodilatory forced expiratory volume in 1 minute (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted
             normal.

          -  Uses rituximab or any monoclonal antibody (mAb) for immunomodulation within 4 months
             before first dosing.

          -  Uses immunosuppressants (such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine) other than permitted
             oral immunosuppressants within 6 months before first dosing.

          -  Is diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome.

          -  Has received vaccinations within 4 weeks before screening or has any vaccinations
             planned during the study.

          -  Has had an opportunistic infection ≤12 weeks before initial study dosing or is
             currently undergoing treatment for a chronic opportunistic infection, such as
             tuberculosis (TB), pneumocystis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus,
             herpes zoster, or atypical mycobacteria.
