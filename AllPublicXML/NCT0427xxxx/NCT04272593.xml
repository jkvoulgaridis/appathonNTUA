    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether simultaneous electromyographic (EMG)-based pattern
      recognition control of an upper limb prostheses increases wear time among users. In contrast
      to conventional, seamless sequential pattern recognition style of control which only allows a
      single prosthetic hand or arm function at a time, simultaneous control allows for more than
      one at the same time. Participants will wear their prosthesis as they would normally at home
      using each control style for an 8-week period with an intermittent 1-week washout period (17
      weeks total). Prosthetic usage will be monitored; including, how often participants wear
      their device and how many times they move each degree of freedom independently or
      simultaneously. The primary hypothesis is that prosthetic users will prefer simultaneous
      control over conventional control which will result in wearing their device more often. The
      secondary hypothesis is that simultaneous control will result in more efficient prosthesis
      control which will make it easier for participants to perform activities of daily living. The
      results of this study will help identify important factors related to prosthetic users'
      preferences while freely wearing their device within their own daily-life environment.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized crossover home trial consisting of two 8-week periods with an intermittent 1-week washout period (17 weeks total). Participants will use either simultaneous control or convention seamless, sequential control in the first 8-week period followed by using the opposite control style in the second 8-week period.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in prosthetic wear time</measure>
    <time_frame>We will record total prosthetic wear time during the course of each 8-week period.</time_frame>
    <description>We will record each instance participants turn on or off their pattern recognition device throughout the home trial. Prosthetic wear time is defined as the cumulative amount of time participants keep their pattern recognition device turned on during the course of each 8-week period. We will perform a statistical analysis to compare wear time when using each type of pattern recognition control (simultaneous and seamless, sequential). We will complete a repeated measures analysis of variance with subject as a random factor, order of control style used as a fixed variable, and wear time as a fixed variable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in classification accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>We will record classification accuracy at the start (0-months), mid-point (1-months) and end (2-months) of each 8-week period.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to use their pattern recognition device to make a set of motions (either independent or simultaneous motions) and hold each motion for 3 seconds. For each motion, we will record the output motion class determined by the classifier every 50 ms. We will measure the performance of the classier for each motion by computing the classification accuracy which is defined as the number of correct classifications over the total number of classifications. We will perform a statistical analysis to compare classification accuracy when using each control type (simultaneous and seamless, sequential). We will complete a repeated measures analysis of variance with subject as a random factor, order of control style used as a fixed variable, and classification accuracy as a fixed variable.</description>

    <measure>RIC's Orthotics Prosthetics User Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete the OPUS at the start (0-months) and end (2-months) of each 8-week period.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Upper Extremity Functional Status module from RIC's Orthotics Prosthetics User Survey (OPUS). The OPUS asks prosthetic users to rate the level of difficulty (from very easy to very difficult) in performing upper arm/hand functions using their pattern recognition device. Survey data will be evaluated using rating scale analysis (Rasch model).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in virtual game performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete the virtual test at the start (0-months), mid-point (1-months) and end (2-months) of each 8-week period.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a virtual game called Simon Says using the Coapt Complete ControlRoom desktop application. Simon Says is a Fitt's Law-style test that measures how well participants control each motion using their pattern recognition device by moving a virtual arm on a screen. Participants will be instructed to match and hold the position of a virtual arm in a target position for 1 second. Participants will complete each motion (either independent or simultaneous motions) 3 times. We will measure their overall performance by computing completion rate, movement time, path efficiency. We will perform a statistical analysis to compare virtual game performance when using each type of pattern recognition control. We will complete a repeated measures analysis of variance with subject as a random factor, order of control style used as a fixed variable, and each performance metric as a fixed variable.</description>
