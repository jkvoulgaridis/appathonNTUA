  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to discontinuation of the Codman C3000 pump, an alternate device is necessary to continue
      serving patients in need of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. This study aims to test
      the safety of hepatic artery infusion pump placement, a standard surgical procedure, and
      intraarterial chemotherapy initiation with the standard medication floxuridine (FUDR), using
      the Medtronic Synchromed II pump combined with the Codman arterial catheter in patients with
      unresectable (not removable by surgery) liver metastases from colorectal cancer and
      unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This study will determine if complication and
      pump loss rates will be similar to previously published rates for the Codman system.

             problems which may preclude receiving this type of treatment

          -  Patients with history or known presence of primary CNS tumors, seizures not
             well-controlled with standard medical therapy, or history of stroke

          -  Serious or non-healing active wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to
             interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the HAIP chemotherapy (i.e.,
             investigational regimen)

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements. Examples include: active substance abuse, active severe EtOH
             abuse, etc.

          -  Inability to reliably commit to traveling to Lexington, KY every 2 weeks for duration
             of the study treatment (6 months). Patient must have readily identifiable, reliable
