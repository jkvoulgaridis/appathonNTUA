  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of nasal high flow in patients undergoing oesophagectomy is a novel technique that
      has not been previously studied.

      Nasal high flow will be delivered postoperatively to patients undergoing oesophagectomy in a
      tertiary cancer referral centre. This single-centre cohort study will evaluate the safety of
      using nasal high flow in oesophagectomy patients. Physiological parameters, adverse events
      and clinical outcome will be recorded in consecutive patients undergoing oesophagogastric
      surgery.

      This study will challenge the hypothesis that the use of nasal high-flow will lower the rates
      of breathing complications such as pneumonia thereby reducing the demands on intensive care,
      shortening hospital stay and improving patient quality of life. The results will inform the
      design of a larger multicentre clinical trial comparing nasal high flow to conventional
      methods by facilitating sample size calculation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory complications including pneumonia, pleural effusion, adult respiratory distress
      syndrome and pulmonary embolism will be recorded. The primary endpoint will be the rate of
      postoperative respiratory complications within 30 days of oesophagectomy. Technical
      complications related to nasal high flow administration will be recorded and reasons for
      discontinuing nasal high flow documented. Other outcome including mortality, hospital stay,
      surgical complications and respiratory complications within 90 days of surgery will be
      considered as secondary endpoints. These data will assess the feasibility and safety of using
      nasal high flow in patients undergoing oesophagectomy. The rate of respiratory complications
      will be determined in a cohort of consecutive surgical patients together with other measures
      of outcome to form the basis of a series worthy of reporting. This may help gain insight into
      whether using nasal high flow could benefit patients, and whether further research to compare
      nasal high flow to conventional respiratory support would be of value.

    <description>Following consent, the participant will undergo Oesophagectomy as per routine care. During surgery, prior to trial participation and as per standard of care at the site, a nasogastric tube will be placed into the gastric conduit and secured to the nose. This tube will be left on free drainage and aspirated every 4 hours to check for inadvertent insufflation.</description>

    <description>If the patient is successfully extubated within 4 hours following surgery and meets the post surgery inclusion/exclusion criteria, Nasal high flow oxygen will be administered continuously using a humidifier machine for 5 days. Breathing circuits and nasal cannulae will be connected to the machine to deliver oxygen at 20L/min to the patient.</description>
