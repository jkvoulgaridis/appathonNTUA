  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common childhood-onset disability associated with motor and
      cognitive impairments, however most research is focused on motor outcomes. The aim of this
      study is to determine the effects of Amantadine, a dopaminergic agonist, on cognitive
      function in adolescents and adults with CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CP is a heterogeneous condition due to injury to the developing brain. It is a condition that
      is often marked by both cognitive and motor disorders as well as increased prevalence of
      depression and anxiety. While most studies have focused on improving motor dysfunction, fewer
      have investigated cognitive impairments associated with CP. Dedicating a study to research
      the pharmacotherapeutic effect of Amantadine on cognitive function in adolescents and adults
      with cerebral palsy fills an important gap in development of a potential innovative treatment
      for cognitive deficits. The investigators hope to determine the effects of Amantadine on
      cognitive function in adolescents and adults with CP. The investigators will also evaluate
      secondary goals of improving gross and fine motor skills and mood.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oral Symbol-Digit Modalities Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) detects cognitive impairment in less than 5 minutes. This simple, economical test is an ideal way for busy clinicians to screen for organic cerebral dysfunction in both children (8 years and older) and adults.The final score is the correct number of substitutions in 90 seconds, and scores range between 0 and 110. A lower score indicates greater cognitive impairment (worse outcome).
Outcome measures will be assessing a change in scores pre- and post- prescription of Amantadine.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroop Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is a neuropsychological test. It assesses the ability to inhibit cognitive interference, which occurs when the processing of a stimulus feature affects the simultaneous processing of another attribute of the same stimulus.
Subjects are required to read three different tables as fast as possible in 45 seconds. For the first two, participants are required to read names of colors printed in black ink (W) and name different color patches (C). In the third, color-words (CW) are printed in an inconsistent color ink (for instance the word &quot;red&quot; is printed in green ink). Participants are required to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word.
Interference score (IG) = CW − [(W × C)/(W + C)]
A greater IG score indicates a higher ability to inhibit cognitive interference (better outcome).
Word, color, and color-word T-Scores above 40 or are considered &quot;normal&quot;, while below 40 is considered &quot;low&quot;.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) is a measure of verbal fluency and is a subtest of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination. The COWAT uses the three letter set of C, F, and L to assess phonemic fluency. Individuals are given 1 minute to name as many words as possible beginning with one of the letters. The procedure is then repeated for the remaining two letters.
The higher the overall score, or number of words listed for each letter, the better their ability to retrieve specific information.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuo-constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes.
The total possible score is 30 points and can range from 0 to 30; a score of 26 or above is considered normal (high score is a better outcome).
Outcome measures will be assessing a change in scores pre- and post- prescription of Amantadine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PHQ-9 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a self-administered, nine-item depression scale of the patient health questionnaire. The nine items of the PHQ-9 are based directly on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV.
The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Total scores can range from 0 to 27.
A total score of 0-4 indicates minimal depression severity, 5-9 indicates mild depression severity, 10-14 indicates moderate depression severity, 15-19 indicates moderately severe, 20-27 indicates severe depression severity. Therefore, a high score indicates a worse outcome.
Outcome measures will be assessing a change in scores pre- and post- prescription of Amantadine.</description>
