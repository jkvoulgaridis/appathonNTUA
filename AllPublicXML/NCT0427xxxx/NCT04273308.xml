  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The whole-body vibration programme employed in this study partly improved the biomarkers and
      health beliefs of the prefrail community-dwelling older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental group participated in a 12-week whole-body vibration training that conducted
      3 times per week, with 5-min continuous vibration at 12-Hz frequency and 3-mm amplitude each
      time
