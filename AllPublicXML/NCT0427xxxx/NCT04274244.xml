  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness in periodontal regeneration of
      cross-linked hyaluronic acid at 1.8% (Hyadent BG®) with enamel matrix derivative (Emdogain®)
      in periodontal bone defects evaluating their clinical and radiographic variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high molecular weight polysaccharide, hyaluronic acid, also known as hyaluronan or
      hyaluronate, has recently been studied as a promising mediator for periodontal regeneration.
      It has a significant role in mineralized and non-mineralized periodontal tissues for the
      functioning of its extracellular matrices. It has a multifunctional role in periodontics
      including the stimulation of cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and the
      acceleration of wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis. It is used in surgical procedures
      due to its osteoinductive potential. HA is a key element in soft periodontal tissues, the
      gingiva and periodontal ligament, and in hard tissue, such as alveolar bone and cementum. It
      has many structural and physiological functions within these tissues.

      This research proposes two experimental groups to whom one of them will be applied
      cross-linked hyaluronic acid at 1.8% and another group with enamel matrix derivative, and a
      control group.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that the hyaluronic acid shows potential for periodontal
      regeneration when evaluating its clinical and radiographic variables and when compared with
      the use of Enamel matrix derivative.

    <time_frame>1. Baseline, 2. Reevaluation (60 days after Scale and root planing), 3. Second reevaluation (180 days after Periodontal regenerative surgery).</time_frame>
    <description>The probing depth will be measured in six areas (disto-buccal, mediate-vestibular, mesio-buccal, disto-palatal, mid-palatal, and mesio-palatal) of each tooth with a Williams PQ-OW 208 396 probe. It will be use with a pressure of 20 grams that is equivalent to the pressure of dropping the weight of the probe without exerting additional pressure.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Full mouth bleeding score&quot; (FMBS) will be calculated based on scores of 0 (no bleeding) or 1 (bleeding) after probing depths are checked. The usual thing is to measure 4 points for each tooth, but we have modified the index and we value 6 points per tooth (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, disto-palatal, mid-palatal and mesio-palatal).
We consider that the score is 1 when we see a red dot in the% bleeding diagram of the periodontogram and 0 when we see the blank box.</description>

    <description>The plaque will be quantified as follows:
Score 0 = no plaque
Score 1 = A film of plaque adhered to the free gingival margin and the adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque can be seen in situ only after the application of a plaque revealer or by using the probe on the surface of the tooth.
Score 2 = moderate accumulation of soft deposits in the pocket, tooth or gingival margin, which can be seen with our eyes.
Puntuación 3 = Abundance of soft material inside the bag and / or on the tooth and the gingival margin.
The evaluation will be carried out in 4 points per tooth (disto-buccal, mesio-buccal, disto-palatal, mesio-palatal).</description>

    <description>The study participants will first undergo SCALE AND ROOT PLANING. This procedure is the same as that used in the active comparator group and the control group.
Eight weeks following the initial therapy, reevaluation of the intrabony defects in the interproximal sites with a clinical probing depth &gt;5 mm will be performed by radiographs as well as by using William's graduated periodontal probe to confirm the indication for periodontal surgery. Pairs of premolar and molar teeth in the maxilla or the mandible will be randomized to receive the test treatment (REGENERATIVE PERIODONTAL SURGERY with adjunctive hyaluronic acid gel application) or to serve as active comparators (regenerative periodontal surgery with adjunctive enamel matrix derivative application).</description>
