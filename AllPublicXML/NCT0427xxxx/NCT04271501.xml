    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized within-subject controlled feasibility study to evaluate the clinical
      performance of RECELL for repigmentation of stable, depigmented lesions. The trial will
      evaluate 50 matched, stable depigmented areas from 10 subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible:

          1. Focal, segmental or generalized vitiligo documented as stable (no new lesions nor
             lesions expanding in size within the preceding 12 months).

          2. The patient has not undergone treatment (e.g., steroids, UVB) for the study lesion
             within the past 30 days.

          3. The patient is a candidate for surgical intervention for treatment of a depigmented
             area.

          4. Five discrete 3cm by 3cm areas are available for treatment within the depigmented
             lesion.

          5. The patient is &gt; 22 years of age.

          6. The patient is willing and able to complete all follow-up evaluations required by the
             study protocol.

          7. The patient agrees to abstain from any other treatment of the study areas for the
             duration of the his/her participation in the study (24 weeks).

          8. The patient agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other interventional clinical
             trial for the duration of his/her participation in the study (24 weeks).

          9. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient and/or guardian must be able to:

               1. Understand the full nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks and
                  adverse events,

               2. Understand instructions, and

               3. Provide voluntary written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible:

          1. The area requiring treatment is not associated with vitiligo.

          2. Study areas contain the distal phalanges.

          3. Patients with universalis vitiligo.

          4. The patient has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             may compromise patient safety or study objectives.

          5. Current use of medications (e.g., anticoagulants such as such as heparin or warfarin)
             that in the investigator's opinion may compromise patient safety or trial objectives.

          6. The patient is unable to follow the protocol requirements.

          7. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for
             irrigation (Hartmann's) solution.

          8. The patient has Koebner phenomenon and/or confetti-like lesions.

          9. Life expectancy is less than 1 year.
