  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study we have developed a novel biological age model. Assessing biological age
      is the assessment of the present health status and functional capacity/physiological reserve
      of one's body in comparison with people of the same age and sex.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the utility and validity of the novel biological age
      model designed for health promotion in real world conditions.

      Study design: This is a longitudinal study, where biological age assessment is conducted in
      the first and final week of 11-14 week lifestyle intervention courses.The courses takes place
      at a Danish folk high school (Ubberup), specialized in lifestyle interventions targeting a
      10% weight loss. We seek to include 80 adult men and women.

      Data collection: Will take place at the facilities at Ubberup folk highschool, participants
      being overnight fasted and without having exercised for the previous 24 hours. All analysis
      are done in investigators lab (Xlab) at the Department of Biomedical Sciences, Copenhagen
      University. When data are analysed Biological age are calculated for each particpant.
