  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a single-centre, prospective, single-arm, post-market,
      non-interventional, pilot clinical investigation designed to characterize microphone
      sensitivity and maximum stable gain of the Cochlear Carina System.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The totally implanted Carina System is an active middle ear implant where all components are
      implanted under the skin. Placing a microphone under the skin affects its acoustic
      sensitivity and vibration sensitivity. Software is now available to enable non-intrusive
      microphone measurements in existing patients with the Carina device, through a wireless link
      to the implant. Detailed knowledge of the acoustic sensitivity of the implanted microphone
      and objectively measured maximum stable gain, and its inter-individual variability, will
      allow more accurate calculation of overall system performance, and thereby more accurate
      prediction of clinical outcomes.

      Subjects will attend one scheduled study visit to be assessed; several objective acoustic
      measurements will be performed that do not require active participation from the subject. No
      data monitoring committee will be used for this clinical investigation.
