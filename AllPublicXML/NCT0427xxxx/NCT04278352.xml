  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will examine mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP)
      program outcomes for 240 individuals who have completed treatment for opioid use disorders.
      MBRP is a group aftercare program that integrates mindfulness skills training with
      cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention strategies. Primary outcomes will include frequency
      of opioid use, craving, withdrawal, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include time to
      first opioid use, adherence to medication-assisted treatment plans, perceived stress,
      posttraumatic stress symptoms, and chronic pain. We will also examine the following potential
      moderators of intervention outcomes: comorbid diagnoses, life events history, and MBRP
      intervention adherence. In addition, we will examine the following mediators of intervention
      outcome: mindfulness skills, emotion regulation skills, executive functioning skills,
      savoring, and positive and negative affect.

    <measure>Change in frequency of opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid frequency and time to first use will be assessed with both self-timeline follow-back method and collateral timeline follow-back for the past 60 days (Wray et al 2016; Donohue et al., 2004), as well as urine samples.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess opioid craving with a modified version of the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (Garland et al., 2014; Flannery, Volpicelli, &amp; Pettinati, 1999).

The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26 item self-report measure that assesses four domains: physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment. Transformed scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the four domains, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to other medication treatments; 12-item self-report scale, scores range from 12-34, where lower scores indicate better adherence (adherence to medications not given as part of this study) (Kripalani et al. 2009)</description>

    <measure>Change in mindfulness skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al, 2006) includes 39 self-report items assessing five dimensions of mindfulness. Items are rated on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 to 5, with total score ranging from 39 to 195. Higher scores indicate greater dispositional tendency to be mindful in daily life (e.g., observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner experience, nonreactivity to inner experiences).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotion regulation skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form (Kaufman et al., 2016) includes 18 items that assess four areas of emotion regulation: awareness/understanding, acceptance, ability to engage in goal-directed behavior, ability to control impulsive behavior. The items are rated on a 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always) scale based on frequency of feelings and use of emotion regulation skills, with a total score range of 18-90. Higher scores reflect greater impairments in emotion regulation skills.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in executive functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Savoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>The Savoring Beliefs Inventory (Bryant, 2003) is a 24-item self-report instrument with three subscales: anticipating, savoring the moment, and reminiscing. These items are rated on a 1 to 5 scale, half with a negative anchor and half with a positive anchor. Total scores can range from -72 to +72, with higher scores indicating higher levels of savoring.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in positive and negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (post-intervention for experimental group), 16 weeks (follow-up for experimental group, post-intervention for control group)</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect scales assess dispositional dimensions of affect (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1998). Two separate subscales will be used. There are 10 items to evaluate positive affect and 10 items to evaluate negative affect with a range of 10-50 for each scale. Each item is rated according to frequency of feeling a certain way, with higher scores on each scale indicating higher positive or negative affect.</description>

    <description>Current substance use disorders, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses will be assessed with the respective modules from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (First, 2014). Each module includes structured interview questions in &quot;yes/no&quot; response format, with a scoring protocol that indicates whether the participant met criteria for the DSM-5 psychological disorder diagnosis. A categorical outcome will be used (scored &quot;0&quot; for did not meet criteria for the diagnosis, &quot;1&quot; for met criteria for the diagnosis).</description>

(yes = 1, no = 0), 'How many days per week did you engage in mindfulness meditation?' (range = 0-7), 'How long in minutes did you meditate per session of mindfulness meditation?' (range = 0 to unspecified), 'Describe your practice of mindfulness meditation (what exercises/activities/techniques did you practice?). Each quantitative item will be analyzed separately as moderators of intervention outcome and reported descriptively.</description>
