  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first line of therapy for cervical dystonia patients is botulinum toxin injections,
      however injection parameter determination and optimization are challenging for physicians to
      do. In addition, some patients receiving this treatment long-term experience short duration
      of relief. Thus, Dysport (Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals), another BoNT-A formulation, may increase
      the duration of clinical benefit. The objective of this study is to compare the wearing off
      time of their original BoNT-A formulation (same injection parameters for at least 3 cycles)
      and the optimized treatment of Dysport (after 2 injection cycles). Ideally, the clinical
      benefits should last 2.5 - 3 months as injections are administered every 3 months. Conversion
      to Dysport will be conducted and optimization of Dysport dosing will be done using our
      sensor-technology assessment.

Sensors coupled with computer-assisted analysis can measure degrees of deviation from neutral head/neck position and angular root mean square tremor/dystonic jerks amplitude in each plane of motion (vertical, lateral, rotational).</description>
