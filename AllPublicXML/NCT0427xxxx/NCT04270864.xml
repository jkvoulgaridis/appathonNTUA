      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age

          2. Patient should understand, sign, and date the written informed consent form prior to
             any protocol-specific procedures performed.

          3. For part A &amp; B: patients must have a histologically confirmed and clinically or
             radiologically progressing unresectable advanced cancers relapsing or refractory after
             conventional therapies. Patients pre-treated with immunotherapy are eligible if they
             have not developed treatment-related CTCAE v.5 grade ≥ 4 irAE or any grade ≥ 3 irAE
             lasting for more than 21 days. However, patients who developed auto-immune
             endocrinopathies during previous immunotherapy and are well treated with hormone
             substitutive therapy do not fell into this category and should remain eligible.

          4. For part B (expansion cohorts):

               1. For part B1: histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically
                  progressing unresectable Stage III or Stage IV NSCLC, with a history of
                  pre-treatment by anti-PD-1. Patients should have a clinically or radiologically
                  documented disease progression after having either:

                    1. received an anti-PD-1 monotherapy first line followed by a chemotherapy
                       second line

                    2. or a combination of anti-PD-1 + chemotherapy first line

               2. For B2 cohort: histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically
                  progressing unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, as per AJCC staging
                  system, naïve of anti-PD-(L)1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 (ocular melanoma excluded).

               3. For part B3: histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically
                  progressing unresectable Stage III or Stage IV MSS CRC cancer naïve of
                  anti-PD(L)1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy . Patients must have received or must be
                  ineligible to standard treatments (chemotherapy with 5-FU, oxaliplatin,
                  irinotecan ; bevacizumab ; anti-EGFR therapies if applicable).

          5. Patient with at least one injectable tumor lesion (largest diameter ≥1cm; smallest
             diameter ≥1,5cm if lymph node) which is measurable as per RECIST 1.1 criteria and
             which will be used as the intratumoral immunotherapy priming site. Patients with
             additional tumor lesions should be monitored for both injected and non-injected
             lesions as per iRECIST criteria. Patients with additional peritoneal carcinomatosis or
             pleural tumoral effusions or other tumoral involvement could be included if they can
             be evaluable by an objective criteria such as PET-scan or tumor marker or ctDNA.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          7. Treatment naïve subjects or patients relapsing after prior local or systemic
             anticancer therapy. Note that systemic anticancer therapy is permitted if it was
             completed at least 28 days or 5 times its half-life (whichever is shorter) prior to
             the first study dose, and all clinically significant related adverse events have
             either returned to baseline or stabilized. Treatment naïve patients are allowed if
             they are unsuitable for conventional therapy.

          8. Measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          9. Patients willing to undergo intratumoral injections and tumor biopsies. Biopsies and
             intratumoral injections should be performed without any pain. Local anesthesia should
             be performed if necessary prior any intratumoral injection/biopsy. If a patient needs
             to undergo a systemic sedation or anesthesia for his intratumoral biopsies/injections,
             this should be validated during the screening phase by a consultation with an
             anesthesist from the team who would be in charge of such procedure.

         10. Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug
             administration. Irradiated lesion should not be chosen as injectable nor target
             lesion.

         11. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained
             within 14 days prior to randomization:

               -  Neutrophils to Lymphocytes Ratio (NLR) ≤ 6*

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x103/μL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (transfusion allowed)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 40mL/min (using the
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula)

               -  ALT ≤3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if liver metastases ALT ≤5.0 x ULN

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have
                  total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL).

               -  LDH ≤ Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

               -  Albumin ≥ Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)

         12. Subject Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a subject that has
             discontinued the study as a screening failure (ie, subject has not been treated) after
             obtaining agreement from the medical coordinator prior to re-enrolling a subject. If
             reenrolled, the subject must be re-consented.

         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine or serum β-HCG
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to initiation of treatment. Sexually active
             female patients must agree to use two methods of effective contraception, one of them
             being a barrier method, or to abstain from sexual activity during the study and for at
             least 5 months after last study drug administration. Sexually active males patients
             (and their female partners) must agree to use two methods of effective contraception,
             one of them being a barrier method, or to abstain from sexual activity during the
             study and for at least 7 months after last study drug administration.

         14. Patients must be willing and able to comply with the visits, treatments, procedures,
             and laboratory tests, and other requirements that are scheduled in the protocol.

         15. Patients must be affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases
             or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if these lesions have been treated or if they
             are asymptomatic without any steroids and there is no clinical evidence of progression

             monitored by contrast enhanced MRI at disease assessment timepoints.

          2. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.

          3. Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for Lynch syndrome patients
             and locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous
