    <textblock>
      Microbiome in patients affected by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma may present specific and
      identifiable patterns. These variations could affect the surgical outcome and increase the
      risk of life-threatening infections supported by multidrug-resistant bacteria. The
      identification of microbial signatures with tumor specificity may have a potential role in
      postoperative risk stratification. Variation of pancreatic, intestinal or bile microbiome and
      their relationship can be investigated and measured as promising tools in order to predict
      and overcome the clinical and infectious burden imposed by MDR infections. The prospect of a
      potential role for probiotics to promote competition against the pathogens and to improve the
      gastrointestinal barrier integrity has also been raised. Moreover, if the bacterial
      composition in human PDAC was confirmed to be distinct from that of the normal pancreas,
      microbiome variation could be used as a potential biomarker, to assess the potential for
      malignancy in precursor neoplastic lesions. However, we believe that a preliminary and
      explorative study is necessary. The study aims to outline the pancreatic microbiome of
      patients who undergo upfront PD for resectable PDAC and to characterize the possible
      association between bacterial composition and the occurrence of post-operative complications,
      particularly POPF and IC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in
      the western world by 2030. Patients still have a poor prognosis, and a complete surgical
      resection provides the only potential for long-term cure of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      (PDAC) with a 5-year survival of only around 20%.

      In addition, despite all the advances and technical modifications developed during this past
      decade, pancreatic surgery is still hampered by considerable postoperative morbidity.
      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), with a range of incidence between 3-45%, and the
      infectious complications (IC) that occur in nearly one-third of the patients are still the
      more frequent and dreadful complications after pancreatic resection. Moreover, in patients
      submitted to pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), the constantly growing presence of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria increases the morbidity and mortality rate. Those
      complications may also limit access to adjuvant chemotherapy and result in higher costs and
      longer hospitalization.

      The high clinical burden of pancreatic surgery, associated with the overall poor outcome of
      PDAC and worldwide diffusion of antibiotic resistance, suggest the urgent need to enhance our
      knowledge on new and modifiable risk factors able to affect the surgical, the infectious and
      the oncological outcomes.

      The alteration of the microbiome recently emerged as a contributor to oncogenesis, as a risk
      factor for postoperative morbidity in many intestinal tract malignancies and as one of the
      leading causes of colonization by resistant pathogenic bacteria. Recent evidence suggests
      that the pancreas also harbors its microbiome and in PDAC this is markedly more abundant and
      with different patterns compared to a normal pancreas in both mice and humans. However, the
      intestinal and PDAC microbiome have never been compared in humans. Alteration of the
      microbiome induces an adaptive immune suppression and promotes an inflammatory status.
      Growing literature evidence shows that the microbiome accounts for local and systemic
      microenvironment changes. These alterations, characterized by immune suppression and
      selection of potentially pathogenic bacteria, may lead both to adverse outcomes after
      surgical treatment and to the overgrowth of multidrug-resistant flora.

      Nevertheless, the etiologic relationship between intrapancreatic microbiota and postoperative
      complications in PDAC patients subjected to surgery has not yet been described.
