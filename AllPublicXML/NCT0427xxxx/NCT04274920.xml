  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of application of bioactive glass in
      different protocols on the formation of dentin bridge after indirect pulp capping using resin
      composite with its adhesive both are containing bioactive glass.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active carious lesion in deep dentin of molars.

          -  Absence of cavitated lesions at the buccal or lingual surfaces as determined by
             clinical and radiographic examination.

          -  Absence of clinical diagnosis of pulp exposure, fistula, swelling of periodontal
             tissues, and abnormal tooth mobility;

          -  Absence of clinical symptoms of irreversible pulpitis, such as spontaneous pain or
             sensitivity to pressure;

          -  The extension of the carious lesion should be such that complete caries removal would
             risk pulp exposure, as determined by clinical and radiographic assessment;

          -  Absence of radiolucencies at the interradicular or periapical regions, or thickening
             of the periodontal spaces, that would indicate the presence of irreversible pulp
             pathologies or necrosis;

          -  Absence of internal or external root resorption.

          -  Co-operative patients approving the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with systemic medical conditions

          -  pregnant females

          -  Teeth with spontaneous pain or sensitivity to percussion.

          -  Teeth with periodontal lesions, internal or external root resorption, mobility of
             tooth, sinus opening, or abscessed tooth.

          -  Radiographic examination revealed, interrupted or broken lamina dura, widened
             periodontal ligament space, periapical radiolucency.
