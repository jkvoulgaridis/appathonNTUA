  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation is a condition that reduces individuals' independence in daily life.
      Therefore, the main purpose of the rehabilitation process is to reintegrate the person as an
      independent and productive person as soon as possible. Although scales are frequently used in
      mobility evaluation in the clinic, they do not measure the advanced activities of patients.
      Therefore, the aim of the study is to obtain a comprehensive scale evaluating mobility in
      amputee. The mobility scale will be created using the two-round Delphi method. ICF
      (International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health) created by the World
      Health Organization, mobility subheading will be evaluated, and the questions that will be
      included in the scale will be compiled. In line with the data to be obtained from experts, a
      scale will be created.Scale and gold standard tests will be applied to patients so that
      validation of the scale will be investigated.
