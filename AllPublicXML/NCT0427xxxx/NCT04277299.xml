  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based mobile intervention (Icory
      -Solution) developed to pediatric patients and their parents in the pathway of outpatient
      surgery treatment in pre-intra- and postoperative setting: (1) Examine the effectiveness of
      the intervention on children's preoperative anxiety and fear, and postoperative pain (2)
      examine the effectiveness of the intervention on parental anxiety and satisfaction in
      children´s care path and (3) examine the experiences of the gamification in children in the
      intervention group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and their families are entitled to know what is going to happen to them before
      undergoing day surgery and information must be based on the child's age and understanding. It
      is important to help children to cope with any upcoming surgery because the more anxious and
      fear they are, the more pain they experience after the day surgery. Digital gaming solutions
      could help families and children to be better oriented to the coming treatment. Icory
      -solution is a digital pathway for children and family and it contains a virtual tour to
      hospital and distraction games for children. The information on the application is aligned
      with the patient's individual needs based on the type of surgery and requirements.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>mYPAS</measure>
    <time_frame>mYPAS will be assessed at the baseline:(1)at the hospital on the day before the operation when nurse meets the child, and will assess changes between baseline and (2) before the induction and (3) one hour after operation when the child is awakening</time_frame>
    <description>Children's preoperative anxiety: Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale - (mYPAS-) Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale ( Kain et al 1997) will be used to measure the preoperative anxiety levels of the children right before the operation. It is a 4-item scale (activity, vocalization, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal) and it is filled in via observation. The total score ranges from 23 to 100. Higher scores mean higher levels of anxiety. A score of 31 and above would indicate high-anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CPMAS</measure>
    <time_frame>CPMAS will be assessed (1) one day before the operation at home, and will be assessed changes between baseline and (2) at the hospital before the operation and (3) before the induction and (4) days 1 and (5) 7 after the operation</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Perioperative Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (CPMAS) developed by Chow et al. (2015) is a simple, age-appropriate self-report measure of pediatric perioperative anxiety and fear in busy hospital settings. The CPMAS is a visual analog scale composed of 5 items, each of which is scored from 0-100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children´s postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Children's postoperative pain will be measured at baseline (1) right after the operation and will be assessed changes between baseline (2) 24 hours,(3) days 3 and (4) 7 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>VAS - The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale to measure children´s postoperative pain. The scores range from 0-100 (Abu-Saad 1984) with a higher score means greater pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>STAI- Y</measure>
    <time_frame>Parents' preoperative anxiety will be assessed at baseline (1) at home on the day before the operation and will assess changes between baseline on the surgery day and (2) after the operation and (3) 24 hours after children´s day surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Parental anxiety Parental anxiety STAI- Y form will be used to measure parental anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) which is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 20 questions on a self-report basis (Copyright © 1983 by Charles D. Spielberger)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental satisfaction: VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Parents' satisfaction on children´s day care path will be assessed at baseline (1) at home on the day and (2) on the surgery day after the operation and (3) 24 hours after children´s day surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Parental satisfaction Satisfaction VAS (Reported satisfaction level by visual analog scales 1-10) 0 not at all satisfied 10 very satisfied</description>

    <time_frame>Gamefulquest will be assessed 1 week after the operation</time_frame>
    <description>Gamefulquest -instrument (Högberg et al. 2019) is a questionnaire for children in the intervention group to measure children´s experience playing the Triumf game. Gamefulquest is a 7-point Likert scale (1 totally disagree - 7 totally agree) concerning children's experience of playing the game in track record, immersion, challenge, playfulness and communal experience</description>

The ICory-Solution has two components: (1) the Buddy Healthcare mobile app (BuddyCare) that provides a comprehensive day-by-day perioperative guide for parents regarding their child's surgery with an interface for health care professionals to monitor parents' and their children's needs as well as communicate with them. (2) The Triumf Health mobile game app that provides emotional support and distraction to children.</description>
