      This single-site, non-randomized, open-label study to assess the initial safety and efficacy
      of the LUM Imaging System for detection of primary pancreatic cancer and peritoneal invasion
      from primary pancreatic cancer during surgery. In this feasibility study, the tumor detection
      algorithm will be developed for this indication.

      This study is being conducted to see if LUM015 can be safely given to human patients before
      surgery at a dose that allows the removed tumor tissue to be identified when imaged by the
      LUM imaging device.

      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be administered with LUM015
      at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Due to the expected duration of these surgeries (up to 14 hours), all
      subjects will require LUM015 administration intraoperatively.

      The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care
      used by the surgeon. Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will
      continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will
      continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is
      required. Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM
      Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histological or cytological confirmation of pancreatic cancer on a
             biopsy prior to the operation with planned surgical resection. Subjects at any cancer
             stage will be enrolled.

          -  Age of 18 years or older.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

          -  Subjects must have received and signed an informed consent form.

          -  Subjects must be otherwise healthy except for the diagnosis of cancer, as per the
             exclusion criteria listed below.

          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL

          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73
             m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          -  Subjects with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or nursing at the time of diagnosis

          -  Subjects who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable
             forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) upon
             entering the study and for 60 days after injection of LUM015.

          -  Subjects who have taken an investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment.

          -  Subjects who have not recovered from adverse events due to other pharmaceutical or
             diagnostic agents.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension defined as persistent systolic blood pressure
             &gt; 180 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg; those subjects with known HTN
             should be under these values while under pharmaceutical therapy.

          -  History of allergic reaction attributed to drugs containing polyethylene glycol (PEG).

          -  History of allergic reaction to any oral or intravenous contrast agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active

             arrhythmia, COPD or asthma requiring hospitalization within the past 12 months, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Subjects with QT interval &gt; 470 ms.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible.

          -  Any subject for whom the investigator feels participation is not in the best interest
