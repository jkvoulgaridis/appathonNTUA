    <textblock>
      This study is a two-part, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of the
      antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) DS-6157a given as a single agent to participants with
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

      This study will include 2 parts:

        1. Dose Escalation (Part 1)

        2. Dose Expansion (Part 2)

      Dose Escalation: Participants with histopathologically documented advanced GIST not amenable
      to curative therapy may be included in which the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of DS-6157a monotherapy will be determined.

      Dose Expansion: Once the RDE(s) is established for DS-6157a (Part 1), enrollment in Dose
      Expansion (Part 2) will commence in 2 cohorts. Participants with GIST who have progressed on
      or are intolerant to imatinib (IM) and at least one post-IM treatment will be enrolled in
      Cohort 1, and participants with GIST who progressed on IM and had not received a post-IM
      treatment (2nd line) will be enrolled in Cohort 2.
