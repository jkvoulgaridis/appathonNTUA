      This trial develops a health-related symptom index for participants with and either treated
      or monitored for anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The health-related quality
      of life index may help to capture the symptoms and related experiences of living with or
      being treated for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a Spanish-language version of the anal cancer/high-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesions outcomes research (ANCHOR) high-grade squamous intraepithelial
      lesions (HSIL) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) index (HQI) using state-of-the-art
      measure development methodology that captures the most important HRQoL symptoms and concerns
      of those persons diagnosed with anal HSIL and either treated or untreated for anal HSIL.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants take part in cognitive interviews in Spanish over 45-60 minutes.

    <description>As a research project involving survey measures and cognitive interviewing, no formal statistical analysis plan is required. Respondents' interviews will be abstracted and coded for analysis by an expert panel. The scale for the outcome measures for the aHRSI questionnaire responses includes: Not applicable, Not at all (0), A little bit (1), Somewhat (2), Quite a bit (3), Very much (4), to Difficult to understand. Respondents will then be queried with cognitive interviewing probes for general clarity, including whether the questions they answered were easy to answer, using a scale of responses ranging from all of the time, most of the time, some of the time, or none of the time. Areas where the survey was difficult to understand will be qualitatively discussed with the participant. The research plan includes cognitive interviewing discussion probes to then target questionnaire items for clarity of specific meaning to the participant.</description>
