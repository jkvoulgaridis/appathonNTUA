    <textblock>
      CAR-T cells and cellular therapies may lead to various adverse reactions. This study
      investigates reports of different toxicities for cellular therapies in the World Health
      Organization's (WHO) global database of individual safety case reports (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAR-T cells and cellular therapies are responsible of a wide range of side effects.The
      investigators use VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety
      case reports, to identify cases of adverse drug reactions following treatment with cellular
      therapies
