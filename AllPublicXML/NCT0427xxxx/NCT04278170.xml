      This study was designed to investigate the factors affecting sleep quality of Rheumatoid
      arthritis patients in Turkish population.

    <textblock>
      Demographic data, duration of disease, routine biochemical tests and currently used
      medications were recorded. Disease activity was assessed with Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS
      28). Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain levels. Health Assessment
      Questionnaire (HAQ) was used to assess activities of daily living. Beck depression inventory
      (BDI) was used to investigate the signs of depression in patients. Sleep quality was
      considered to be poor in patients with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score
      of 5 and greater.

    <description>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the sleep quality of the patients. PSQI is a questionnaire which assesses sleep quality by questioning the patient on 7 main sections; i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep activity, sleep disorders, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunctions. Questions are scored from 0 to 3, high scores reflecting poor sleep quality. Seven main components are first evaluated individually and then the scores are added. A total score of 5 and above indicates poor sleep quality</description>
