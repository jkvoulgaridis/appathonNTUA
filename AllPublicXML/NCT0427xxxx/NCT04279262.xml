  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community First Responders (CFRs) are trained members of the public, lay people or off-duty
      healthcare staff who volunteer to provide first aid. CFRs help ambulance services to provide
      care for people having health emergencies, from falls to road accidents to heart attacks, at
      home or in public places. CFRs are particularly important in rural areas where it is more
      difficult to provide or access emergency care, and where they are an important part of the
      care workforce. CFRs are broadly perceived to be positive, however evidence is needed about
      how they contribute to rural health services, which patients/conditions they attend, what
      care they provide, how effective they are and at what cost, how they are perceived by
      patients and other health workers, and how they could be developed to improve care for rural
      communities.

      The investigators aim to develop recommendations for rural CFRs, by exploring their
      contribution to rural care, evaluating their value for money, understanding experiences and
      views of patients, CFRs and other healthcare staff, and exploring the potential for CFRs to
      provide new services.

      The project will involve the following steps:

        1. Analyse records from six ambulance services to see: how many people CFRs attended; the
           proportion of ambulance calls attended; age, sex and conditions of people attended; how
           quickly CFRs attended and what happened to the patient(s) when the ambulance arrived.

        2. Evaluate benefits and costs of CFRs attending rural emergencies.

        3. Interview patients/relatives, ambulance staff, GPs, funders, CFRs and CFR leads to
           obtain views on rural CFR current and potential future roles. Interviews will also
           explore with CFRs and CFR leads, challenges and solutions to recruiting, training,
           retaining rural CFRs and ensuring safe, high quality care.

        4. Combine this knowledge (gained in steps1-3 above) to develop recommendations for change;
           who will be involved and how services should change to solve the most pressing problems
           for the rural communities served.

        5. Present recommendations to a workshop of experts and public to agree priorities for
           future development.
