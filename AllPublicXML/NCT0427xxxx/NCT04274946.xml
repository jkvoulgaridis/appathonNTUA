  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the gold standard method to stage axilla in breast
      cancer. The aim of the study is to compare the efficiency of various methods to identify SLN
      is breast cancer patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various markers has been used for SLN biopsy including isosulfan blue (patent blue),
      indocyanine green (ICG), radioisotope colloid (RAIC) and ultrasound (US) with several
      advantages and disadvantages. In this study investigators designed an algorithm using the
      combination of mapping with patent blue, ICG, RAIC and US to compare the accurate
      identification of SLN in breast cancer patients. The protocol is based on the hypothesis that
      identification rate of SLN is increased with multiple agents. Patent blue and ICG provides
      visual guidance. The combination of dyes with sonographic and RAIC method have the potential
      to prevent obstacles and ensure better outcomes as an identification strategy.

      Patent blue provides visual identification of the SLN. ICG fluorescence can be detected
      percutaneously and by means of fluorescence imaging system in real time. RAI has several
      advantages, but disadvantages as well, like cost and invisibility. RAI can only be detected
      and confirmed by means of sound and numerical value through gamma probe. All breast cancer
      patients underwent axillary ultrasound before SLNB with different mapping combinations. The
      determination of abnormal axillary lymph node was followed by ultrasound-guided FNA cytology
      of these nodes. The sonographic abnormality criteria of the nodes were defined as; completely
      hypoechoic node, asymmetric focal hypoechoic node, cortical lobulation more than 3, cortical
      thickness &gt;2mm, totally spheric appearance, absence of fatty hilum and compromise of normal
      vascularity (hypervascularization from various poles). Patients with negative results of FNA
      would undergo SLNB. Lymphatic mapping was performed with abovementioned dyes and radioactive
      colloid. Before the incising for SLNB real time intraoperative US was performed and
      suspicious axillary lymph nodes were seen by ultrasound guidance. In the SLNB operation,
      radioactive or dyed nodes and sonographically suspicious nodes were removed and labeled
      separately for pathological examination.

    <description>False negative rate for SLN surgery in women with normal or axillary US and at least 2 SLNs were excised, defined as the number of patients with no positive lymph nodes by SLN and with at least one positive lymph node by axillary lymph node dissection divided by the total number of patients with at least one positive lymph node by SLN or ALND multiplied by 100, or vise versa. For abnormal axillary US, false negative rate is calculated similarly.</description>

    <description>Lymphedema, shoulder movement pain, or functional deformity after SLNB with different mapping techniques will be assessed by clinicians during follow-up with 3 months periods. The result will be the percentage of patients which suffer from some complications after SLNB or AD. Common morbidity rate after AD is 20%, after SLNB 1-2%.</description>
