    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 40 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2).

          2. For Cohorts A and B: stable hepatic impairment conforming to Child-Pugh classification
             A and B.

          3. For Cohort C: healthy participants matched to participants with hepatic impairment
             with regard to age (+/-10 years), body weight (+/-20 percent [%]), race and gender,
             and as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal in medical
             history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory
             determinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Key Exclusion for all Participants:

          1. Following ocular disorders

               1. Current evidence of Grade 2 or higher corneal disorder

               2. Current evidence of active macular disorder (example, Age-related macular
                  degeneration, central serous chorioretinal disease)

          2. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive at Screening.

          3. A prolonged QT/QTc interval ([QT interval using Fridericia's formula] QTcF greater
             than (&gt;) 480 millisecond [ms]) demonstrated on ECG.

          4. Participants who need the use of drugs or foods that strongly inhibits or induces the
             metabolizing enzyme Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A).

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Hepatically Impaired Participants (Cohorts A and B)

        In addition to the Exclusion Criteria above for all participants, other standard exclusion
        criteria for participants with hepatic impairment will be used. These include:

          1. Any significant acute medical illness (such as new conditions or exacerbation of
             pre-existing conditions) within 8 weeks of dosing.

          2. Presence of severe ascites, edema, or uncontrolled hepatic encephalopathy

          3. The participant's standard therapy/concomitant medication for diseases related to
             hepatic disease has not remained stable/unchanged for at least two weeks before dosing
             of study drug.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Healthy participants (Cohort C)

        In addition to the Exclusion Criteria for all participants, other standard exclusion
        criteria for healthy participants in Phase 1 studies will be used. These include:

          1. Syphilis as demonstrated by positive serology at Screening.

          2. Any abnormal finding based on physical examination, assessment of vital signs, ECG, or
             laboratory test results that requires treatment or clinical follow up based on
             investigators opinion.
