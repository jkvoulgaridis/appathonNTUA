      Specific Aim #1: Pilot test a social network-informed CBPR-derived health promotion program
      for feasibility outcomes with overweight or obese adults from two immigrant communities.

      Specific Aim #2: Assess the preliminary impact of embedding a social network-informed
      CBPR-derived intervention within a regional health promotion resource hub on sustainability
      and uptake outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will consist of 12 community-based mentoring and education sessions, group
      activities and application of a community toolkit for healthy weight loss delivered by
      trained interventionists from Hispanic and Somali communities to their social networks. Using
      a pre-post study design, 4 social networks of adults with approximately 32 network
      participants will receive the intervention. Primary outcomes, measured 3 months after
      implementation, will include feasibility measures of acceptability, implementation, and
      practicality. Secondary outcomes will include BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure,
      fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, physical activity level, dietary change, and
      health-related quality of life.

      Eligibility criteria include (1) self-identification as Hispanic or Somali, (2) member of an
      HPs social network, (3) age≥18 and &lt;65 (4) willingness to participate in all aspects of the
      study; and (5) provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria include (1) pregnancy at the
      time of enrollment and (2) serious medical conditions or disabilities that would make
      physical activity difficult.

      We will test how best to integrate a social network intervention within an existing
      evidence-based regional health promotion infrastructure (WellConnect) that will enhance its
      potential dissemination and community-wide uptake

    <measure>Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a portable scale (Seca 880 Digital Floor Scale). BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m2).</description>

    <measure>Waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the narrowest part of the torso between the ribs and the iliac crest. Participants will remove all excess clothing prior to the measurement and smooth the remaining clothing against the skin. Two measurements will be taken; if the difference between the two measures is more than 2.0 cm, a third measurement will be taken. The average of the two closest measures will be used for analyses.</description>

    <description>Collected by a single finger prick. Participants will be asked to refrain from eating for at least 6 hours prior to testing. Samples used for testing are whole blood from a fingerstick collected in a lithium heparin coated capillary tube.</description>

    <measure>Cholesterol</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected by a single finger prick. Participants will be asked to refrain from eating for at least 6 hours prior to testing. The portable Whole Blood Lipid Screen Cholestech LDX Analyzer will be used to analyze specimens, which combines enzymatic methodology and solid-phase technology measured by reflectance photometry to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose in whole blood. LDL cholesterol is a calculated value. Samples used for testing are whole blood from a fingerstick collected in a lithium heparin coated capillary tube. Results will be recorded at the site of collection and samples will be destroyed upon recording of results.</description>
