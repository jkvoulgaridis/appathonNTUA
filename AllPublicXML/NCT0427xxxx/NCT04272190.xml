      To observe the effects of different treatments on the oncological outcome and complications
      of early cervical cancer (2018 FIGO stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion and IA2-IIA2
      cervical cancer). This study prospectively collecting enrolled cervical cancer patients
      clinical data and outcome from June 2020 to June 2025. (Classification factors: preoperative
      neoadjuvant treatment , surgical approach, type of hysterectomy, whether to receive
      radiochemotherapy) . This study is an observational study, and segmented analysis according
      to different treatment methods.

      Objectives: To observe the effects of different treatments on the oncological outcome and
      complications of early cervical cancer (2018 FIGO stage IA1 with lymphovascular space
      invasion and IA2-IIA2 cervical cancer).

      Study Design: We obtained the demographic, clinical, treatment hospital and complication data
      of patients with cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy from 2004 to 2015 at 37
      hospitals. The patients were assigned into groups. Classification factors: preoperative
      neoadjuvant treatment (not received, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, preoperative radiotherapy) ,
      surgical approach (abdomincal, laparoscopic, vaginal, robotic surgery), type of hysterectomy
      (type B, type C1, type C2), primary treatment (radiochemotherapy or surgery).

      laparoscopic and abdominal surgery groups. The differences in the survival, complication
      rates, quality of life, and cost were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic
      regression models.
