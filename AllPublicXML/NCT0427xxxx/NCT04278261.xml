    <textblock>
      Four hundred and thirty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer will include in this
      study. The clinical trial validation process will be as follows: (1) all patients are
      randomly divided into two arms: arm 1, irreversible electroporation; group 2, radical
      prostatectomy. The primary outcome is the 5-year free tumor progression rate.
