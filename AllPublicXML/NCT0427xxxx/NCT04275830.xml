  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) often continue to
      experience anxiety, depression, isolation, and other psychosocial distress due to the severe
      nature of the transplant experience. Storytelling interventions that provide an opportunity
      for emotional disclosure have shown preliminary efficacy to alleviate psychosocial distress
      and improve emotion regulation during health challenges. Not only are these changes observed
      in response to such interventions, but they can also be directly strengthened with HRV
      biofeedback (HRVB) training, a device-driven breath pacing practice that uses colored light
      signals to provide feedback to increase vagal tone and improve emotional responses and sleep
      quality by regulating negative affect and stress. This randomized controlled trial will
      explore the effects of HRV biofeedback (HRVB) training combined with a digital storytelling
      intervention and changes in psychosocial distress with a modified waitlist control in a
      population of Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients.

      This randomized controlled trial will explore the effects of an HRV biofeedback (HRVB)
      training session with a modified waitlist control in a population of Hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) patients. We will secondarily explore effects of a brief storytelling
      intervention, with or without the prior HRVB training. Two group of 10 HCT patients over the
      age of 18 will be recruited and enrolled into the study. The time of participating in this
      study will be 2-week proposed activities from the time of enrollment to completion. Specific
      participation will include baseline data collection (about 30 minutes), HRVB training session
      (30 minutes), watching and discussing stories (15 min for each week= 30 minutes) and one
      final data collection (about 30 minutes) at the end. For HRVB group, participants will be
      instructed to practice their HRV biofeedback skills at home for 10 minutes each day for a
      two-week period (about 140 minutes). Lab visit is required only twice for baseline data
      collection and final data collection. Other works will be via internet.

    <description>The Emwave Pro Plus device from HeartMath will be used to collect HRV data and heart rate using a 3-minutes &quot;neutral&quot; protocol (we call &quot;waiting at the bus stop&quot; implying that no particular intent for breath or mindful state is to be evoked) to understand the benefits of DS+ HRVB. In addition, HRV measures will be obtained for the 1-minute paced breathing period to understand the effects of paced breathing on HRV. The following precautions will be provided as instructions to participants prior to data collection: no coffee, tea, or caffeinated drinks such as energizing drinks in the 2 hours before the data collection, and no alcohol consumption during 24 hours prior to the data collection.</description>

    <measure>Changes from Baseline Profile of Mood States (POMS) short version (Psychological Distress) at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T1), 2 weeks after (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological distress will be measured using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) short version (15 items, 5-point Likert scale; 0=not at all, 4=extremely). The POMS is one of the most frequently used and validated scales in studies of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients. The POMS Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score has been shown to be most sensitive to interventions designed to facilitate emotional expression. The POMS consists of the TMD dimensions (tension-anxiety; depression-dejection; anger-hostility; and confusion-bewilderment) (Cronbach's a = .93) to be used in the current study as the primary outcome measure; and two others (fatigue-inertia; vigor-activity) will be documented. Total of Mood Disturbance= (anxious+depression+anger+fatigue)- vigor (Range from 12 to 48). The higher values represent a worse emotional well-being.</description>

The higher values represent a worse depression.</description>

    <description>In-person baseline surveys using the web-based data collection platform, Research Electronic Data Capture before the random assignment to HRVB+DS arm. This group will receive a standardized HeartMathÂ© Inner balance device and HRV biofeedback training session at the start of the two-week intervention period. They will be asked to attend either a group or one-on-one 30-minute HRVB training session and asked to practice their HRV biofeedback skills at home for 10 minutes each day for a two-week period. Participants will also be asked to watch four digital stories of other HCT patients (2 videos per week) with a weekly email notification and reminder phone call. Each story was made with voice, images, and sound (3-5 minutes each).</description>

    <description>In-person baseline surveys using the web-based data collection platform, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) before the random assignment to HRVB waitlist +DS control arm. After the baseline data collection, during two weeks, they will be provided four digital stories of other HCT patients sharing their experiences (challenges, feelings, strategies, coping, each 2-3 minutes long). At the end of the two-week period, participants will be scheduled for a final in-person session including T2 survey and HRV assessment. They will be also provided HRVB training session at T2.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive exactly the same four digital stories via REDCap, a standardized HRV sensor and accompanying smart phone app, and a 30-minute HRVB training to use the biofeedback signals to generate a resonant frequency pattern of HRV (coherence) after collecting data at baseline in person. Participants will be given a take-home manual and specifically asked to practice their HRVB skills at home for 5 minutes prior to viewing stories once each week and upload a log of their time practiced to the cloud. The main purpose of adding HRVB practice as a &quot;priming&quot; experience (i.e., to teach participants to practice HRV prior to viewing stories) is to optimize results by focusing patients' and caregivers' skills and experience on HRV as a mechanism of improved emotion regulation, and then combine this achieved coherent pattern with DS intervention.</description>

    <description>Four Digital Stories Intervention (4 patient stories about hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) over the course of 2 weeks (2 videos per week) with a weekly email notification and reminder phone call. Each story was made with voice, images, and sound (3-5 minutes each). The 4 digital stories patients produced contained the following content: (1) a leukemia patient expressed and controlled her depression and anxiety and described how she dealt with the intensive treatment and recovery through a positive attitude and active coping; (2) a mother of 3 children, who was experiencing severe pain due to MS, coped with HCT through family support and positive reframing; (3) a lymphoma patient coped with the HCT procedures by praying during the treatment; and (4) a father of young twins had a HCT twice, and his wife helped him cope with emotional distress through open communication and expressing emotions.Participants will receive a 30-minute HRVB training session at T2.</description>
