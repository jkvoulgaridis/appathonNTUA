  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accelerated atherosclerosis is an established complication of systemic autoimmune diseases,
      particularly SLE. Young female patients with SLE are more likely to develop myocardial
      infarction than matched healthy controls, and CVD is nowadays one of the most common causes
      of death (27%) in lupus patients. While traditional CV risk factors cannot explain such
      increased CV morbidity associated with SLE, common disease factors shared between SLE,
      atherosclerosis and treatment exposure may be of outmost importance in this process. Our
      group made 3 findings of particular interest that could link SLE pathogenesis and
      atherosclerosis-associated immune dysregulation: 1/ the investigators identified specific
      immunometabolites (circulating nucleotide-derived metabolites adenine and N4-acetylcytidine),
      which are increased in the circulation of SLE patients. These immunometabolites trigger a
      constitutive inflammasome activation resulting in aberrant IL1-β production. Given that IL1-β
      inhibition was reported to significantly reduce CV events without altering lipid levels, the
      investigators propose that these immunometabolites may represent novel candidate biomarkers
      of CV risk stratification in SLE. 2/ the investigators identified OX40L as an important
      costimulatory molecule implicated in follicular helper T cell (Tfh) activation in SLE.
      Interestingly, OX40L polymorphism has been associated to both SLE and atherosclerosis, and
      Tfh have been recently shown to accelerate atherosclerosis progression. 3/ Immune
      complexes-activated platelets sustain aberrant immune response in SLE and block
      immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a P-selectin/PSGL1 dependent
      manner. Selectins and Tregs cell dysfunction are well accepted players in atherosclerosis
      pathogenesis.

      Thus there are multiple pathways that are shared between SLE and atherosclerosis and that may
      results in an increased risk of CV-associated morbidity in SLE patients. Exploring these
      interconnected pathways in SLE patients together with traditional and other well-established
      disease-related factors, might lead to a better stratification of CV risk in SLE.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy, predictive value and utility of
      immunological disease-related biomarkers in stratifying CV risk in patients with SLE.
