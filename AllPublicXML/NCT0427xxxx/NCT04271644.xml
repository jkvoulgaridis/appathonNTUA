  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA-targeted CAR-T cells
      therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory Multiple Myeloma. BCMA is
      expressed on most Multiple Myeloma cells so it is an ideal target for CAR-T. In this study,
      investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting BCMA in patients with
      relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma. The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment,
      including adverse events and disease status after treatment.
