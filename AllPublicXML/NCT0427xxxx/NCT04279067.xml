  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US alone, with approximately 795,000 new
      cases annually. Despite the best available physiotherapy, 30-60% of stroke survivors remain
      affected by difficulty walking, with foot weakness often being the main cause. Given that
      post-stroke gait impairments remain poorly addressed, new methods that can provide lasting
      improvements are necessary. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology may be one such novel
      approach. BCI technology enables &quot;direct brain control&quot; of external devices such as assistive
      devices and prostheses by translating brain waves into control signals. When BCI systems are
      integrated with functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems, they can be used to deliver
      a novel physical therapy to improve movement after stroke. BCI-FES systems are hypothesized
      to stimulate recovery after stroke beyond that of conventional physical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research indicates that applying this technique to foot weakness after stroke is
      safe and may improve walking function. Hence, this warrants further investigation to: 1.
      determine if BCI-FES therapy can provide lasting gains in walking in chronic stroke patients;
      2. determine what factors influence BCI-FES therapy; and 3. explicitly elucidate the
      underlying neural repair mechanisms. First, a Phase II clinical trial in patients with foot
      drop due to chronic stroke will compare the effect of BCIFES dorsiflexion therapy to that of
      dose- and intensity-matched standard physical therapy (Aim 1). Comparing the improvement in
      walking speed and other secondary outcome measures between the two groups will test if
      BCI-FES therapy provides functional and neurological gains beyond those of standard physical
      therapy. The relationship between the patient baseline characteristics (walking speed, ankle
      function, stimulated muscle responses, brain wave features, sensation) and the outcomes will
      determine what features influence responsiveness to BCI-FES dorsiflexion therapy (Aim 2).
      Finally, the underlying mechanism driving the improvements of BCI-FES will be studied (Aim
      3). Determining that BCI-FES therapy can provide improvements beyond that of standard therapy
      may lead to a new treatment for stroke patients. The underlying mechanism can inform the
      design of future physical therapy techniques or improve current ones. Finally, BCI-FES
      therapy may ultimately become a novel form of physical therapy to reduce post-stroke
      disability, and in turn reduce the public health burden of stroke.

    <description>Subjects will undergo placement of an EEG cap using standard technique connected to our custom BCI system. Subjects will provide 5 min of training EEG data as they engage in alternating epochs of idling and attempted foot dorsiflexion (of the paretic side). In the online phase, the subjects will perform 20-25 BCI-FES runs. A total of 12 sessions will be performed at a rate of 3x/week (over 4 weeks). Each BCI-FES therapy session will be followed by 1 hour of conventional physiotherapy.
Conventional Physical Therapy: This will consist of a standardized regimen of activities typical of conventional post-stroke gait therapy, including passive/active range of motion exercises (to reduce/prevent excessive plantarflexor contractures), lower-extremity muscle strengthening, and a progression from treadmill to overground walking exercises.</description>

In each run, subjects will follow 10 alternating epochs of 10-s long idling/dorsiflexion textual cues, and respond by either idling or attempting dorsiflexion to elicit BCI-FES mediated contractions of the TA muscle.</description>
