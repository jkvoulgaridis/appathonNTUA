  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventive and rehabilitation programs include plyometric exercises to promote agility,
      power, and muscle activation pattern during jumping. These exercises also are known to cause
      a high mechanical load that increases the risk of a musculoskeletal injury. The knowledge
      regarding the musculoskeletal damage result from this configuration of exercise can help to
      elaborate safer and effective training and rehabilitation programs. In this study, the
      investigators will conduct a clinical trial to determine the acute effect of plyometric
      exercises on damage caused on different portions of quadriceps and biceps femoral's muscles
      and tendons of quadriceps, and biceps femoral, and its effects on mechanical properties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm clinical trial aiming to determine the acute effect of one session of
      plyometric exercises on quadriceps and biceps femoral musculotendinous properties in healthy
      individuals.

      The sample size was determined using G*Power software considering the application of ANOVA:
      Repeated measures, between factors, 90% power, alpha 0.05. Data from muscle echo intensity of
      the rectus femoral by Muddle et al. (2019) were considered for this calculation, with an
      effect size 0.44. A total of 30 individuals was required for this study.

      The outcomes will include the muscle and tendon quality, and mechanical properties of the
      tendon. The assessments will be performed at three different moments: before exercise,
      immediately after, and 48 hours after exercise.

      The data analysis will be performed per protocol. Generalized estimating equations will be
      used to identify the effects of time followed by Bonferroni posthoc. When effects are found,
      effect sizes will be estimated. Missing data will be estimated by statistical analysis.
