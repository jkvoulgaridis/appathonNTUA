    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the signal of melanin using Electron Paramagnetic
      resonance (EPR). Melanin is a paramagnetic pigment detectable by EPR. Recent advances in
      instrumentation allows the application of EPR in human beings. The characterization of
      melanin by EPR could be potentially interesting in the context of melanoma detection and
      characterization. While another clinical study is currently ongoing aiming at demonstrating
      the feasibility of the non-invasive detection of the EPR signal of melanin in melanoma
      patients, it is crucial to have a control group with healthy skin. The aim of the present
      study is to assess the influence of skin pigmentation of the EPR signal recorded. In the
      present clinical study, the EPR signal of melanin will be characterized in healthy skin with
      different phototypes (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) to assess the potential influence of skin pigmentation
      on the EPR signal.

    <textblock>
      Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), also known as electron spin resonance (ESR), is a
      spectrometric method enabling the observation of the absorption of energy by the free
      radicals contained by a sample immerged in a strong homogenous magnetic field. An EPR
      spectrum reveals only the presence of paramagnetic centers and can thus only be observed with
      samples containing lone unpaired electrons. In water-containing biological environments, most
      of free radicals are very reactive and have a very short life. To detect such species, a
      strategy is to use extrinsic molecules that will react with these species to form EPR
      measurable adducts. This technique is called &quot;spin trapping&quot;. In contrast, the study of
      stable free radicals does not require the use of spin-trap agents. Melanins are part of the
      rare stable biological radicals directly observable with EPR. In practice, melanin is the
      only endogenous stable radical that can be detected using 1 GHz EPR.

      The aim of the present study is to measure the EPR signal recorded from skin with different
      pigmentations. 45 healthy volunteers will be enrolled:

      15 subjects with phototype 1-2, 15 subjects with phototypes 3-4, 15 subjects with phototypes
      5-6. The parameters described hereafter will be investigated:

        -  g factor (resonance condition); expected g=2.005;

        -  shape of the signal, presence of a shoulder at g=2.01 due to pheomelanin;

        -  intensity of the signal (signal height, double integration, double integration relative
           to reference).

      This will provide a database for other ongoing studies carried out in patients with
      suspicious lesion (nevi vs melanoma)
