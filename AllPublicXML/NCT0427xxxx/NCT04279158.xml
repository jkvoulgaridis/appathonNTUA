  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human behavior is both flexible and adapted to the environmental context through inhibition
      capabilities; the investigator control the subject's behavior by repressing inappropriate
      responses and selecting, among several possibilities, those that are appropriate. These
      mechanisms are not independent of attentional control. Attention acts as a selection filter
      for the investigator's behavior. This leads us to hypothesize that attention modulates the
      mechanisms of inhibition. Nevertheless, the different brain structures involved, as well as
      mechanisms underlying the interaction between inhibition and attention remain largely
      unknown.

      Previous research has suggested that inhibition requires selective attention and, conversely,
      attentional mechanisms would result in the &quot;deselection&quot;, or inhibition, of objects in space
      or irrelevant actions. Reconciling the literature on attention with the one on inhibition
      appears fundamental for the understanding of the instance to which the mechanisms of
      inhibition and the cognitive processes interact. Therefore, the goal of this research project
      will be to investigate how inhibition mechanisms are implemented in the brain and, in more
      detail, what determines the type of resulting inhibitory control: spatially localized or
      global. The investigator will test 3 different patient groups (optic ataxia, hemispatial
      neglect and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) compared to control.

      In conclusion, this research project will aim to develop a theoretical model of the
      interaction between attentional control and inhibition mechanisms in order to improve
      diagnostic and rehabilitation tools in the future.
