  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia and OSA coexist in clinical populations, but the prevalence of comorbid insomnia
      among OSA patients in the community and risk factors remain poorly known. Little is known
      about the impact of sleep apnea and insomnia on the quality of life and quality of sleep
      compared to the presence of one of the sleep disorders alone. Our hypothesis is that the
      co-existence of OSA and insomnia is high in our community. We also hypothesized that the
      co-existence of OSA and insomnia promotes greater impairment of quality of life and quality
      of sleep when compared to the presence of OSA or insomnia alone.

      Patients referred to polysomnography will be submitted to 6 questionnaires to assess daytime
      sleepiness (EPWORTH), insomnia severity index (ISI), anxiety and depression assessment
      (Beck's anxiety and depression inventory), quality of life assessment(WHOQOL- BREF) and sleep
      quality assessment (Pittsburgh questionnaire) and they will also be submitted to a
      polysomnography type III.

      It will be calculated the frequency of insomnia, OSA and the comorbidity between insomnia and
      OSA in the sample. It will be analysed correlations between the insomnia severity index,
      apnea and hypopnea index, Epworth sleepiness scale, quality of life scale (WHOQOL-BREF),
      anxiety and depression scale (Beck's anxiety and depression inventory) and Pittsburgh sleep
      quality scale. Insomnia severity index scores, Epworth sleepiness scale, quality of life
      scale (WHOQOL-BREF), anxiety and depression scale (Beck anxiety and depression inventory) and
      Pittsburgh sleep quality scale will be compared according to the presence and absence of OSA
      and the presence and absence of insomnia and the presence of the comorbidity insomnia and
      OSA.
