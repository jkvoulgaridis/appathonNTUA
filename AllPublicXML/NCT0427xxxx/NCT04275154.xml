  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a promising new treatment that re-programs
      patient immune cells to target and destroy cancer cells. Importantly, CAR T-cell therapy has
      improved overall response rate and durability in patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      Toxicities following CAR T-cell therapy remain a major limitation to expanding access to this
      promising cancer treatment. Biological predictors of CAR-T-related toxicities are currently
      lacking, and it remains unknown whether CAR-T-related toxicities lead to subsequent
      impairments in instrumental activities of daily living. The overarching goal of this project
      aims to link biological predictors of CAR-T-related toxicities to instrumental activities of
      daily living, such as physical activity and driving performance. The current study proposes
      to test the hypothesis that CAR T-cell therapy causes changes in immunological and
      neurological markers that predict changes in physical activity levels and driving
      performance.

      Study specific aims are: (1A) Evaluate changes in serum inflammatory cytokine protein markers
      in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy; (1B) Evaluate changes in electroencephalographic
      and radiologic markers of CAR-T-related toxicities in comparison to neurocognitive function
      following CAR T-cell therapy; (2A) Assess changes in activity levels using
      actigraphy/accelerometry to continuously monitor physical activity; and (2B) Assess changes
      in driving performance using a standardized on-road instrumented vehicle drive.

      Patients (n=20) will be recruited into the study if they are diagnosed with relapsed or
      refractory DLBCL or ALL, and scheduled to undergo commercially-available CAR T-cell therapy.

      The following measures will be completed during primary study visits: prior to apheresis (T0)
      and 8-weeks post CAR-T cell infusion (T6). (1) blood inflammatory proteins; (2) brain wave
      recordings (or EEG), brain imaging, and neurocognitive assessment; (3) free-living activity
      levels; and (4) driving performance and safety. EEG will assess neural activity patterns of
      brain dysfunction; brain imaging will look for brain abnormalities; neurocognitive
      assessments will evaluate changes in thinking, concentration, and memory. A research-grade
      activity monitor will be used to assess activity levels. Driving performance and safety will
      be evaluated using a driving simulator and an on-road vehicle designed to monitor behavior
      while drivers complete a driving course. Analyses will assess changes between study visits,
      as well as relationships between immunological, neurological, activity, and driving measures.

      We expect that serum inflammatory cytokine protein concentrations will be elevated in
      patients showing symptoms of high-grade CRS relative to patients showing symptoms of
      low-grade or no CRS. We expect that CRS grade will be positively associated with changes in
      concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha.
