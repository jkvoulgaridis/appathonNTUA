  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are common in adolescence and recognized as an international public health
      concern given their links to a range of adverse outcomes. Adolescents with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience more sleep problems than their
      peers, including delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, more
      sleep variability, and greater daytime sleepiness. Further, research conducted by the
      investigator's team has shown that sleep problems are strongly associated with - and causal
      contributors to - functional impairment in adolescents with ADHD, including increased mood,
      behavior, and academic problems. However, sleep problems are not currently addressed in any
      evidence-based treatment for adolescents with ADHD, and no study has evaluated an
      intervention targeting sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD. This is a notable gap in the
      field since consensus statements on sleep suggest that treating sleep problems may improve
      ADHD and associated impairments. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral sleep interventions,
      including the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention for Youth (TranS-C)
      intervention, are effective for improving sleep and associated impairments (e.g., attention,
      mood) in adolescents with sleep problems. However, these interventions have never been tested
      in adolescents with ADHD specifically. This will be the first to evaluate a
      cognitive-behavioral sleep intervention (TranS-C) in adolescents with ADHD who experience
      co-occurring sleep problems. This study will recruit 15 adolescents with ADHD and sleep
      problems to enroll in and complete an open trial of the TranS-C intervention to evaluate its
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Findings will provide key pilot data
      regarding treatment of sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between 13 and 17 years of age at the first TranS-C session.

          2. Estimated IQ â‰¥ 80 as assessed by the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition
             (KBIT-2).

          3. Meet full DSM-5 criteria for ADHD (per protocol).

          4. Meet criteria for sleep problems (per protocol).

             intervention per parent and/or research staff judgment.

          6. If applicable: If the adolescent is taking a medication for ADHD or another
             psychiatric disorder (e.g., anxiety, depression), the adolescent must be on a stable
             medication dose/schedule for at least one month, and families will also be asked to
             not change/add medications the adolescent takes during the intervention period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children who have participated in a behavioral or cognitive-behavioral sleep treatment
             in the past year will be ineligible.

          2. Children with a parent-report diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder,
             obsessive-compulsive disorder, or psychosis will be excluded.

          3. Children taking a prescribed medication for sleep problems per parent report (not
             including melatonin).
