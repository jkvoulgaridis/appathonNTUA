  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of endovascular embolization of middle
      meningeal artery following evacuation of subdural hematomas (SDHs) to assess rate of
      recurrence. The historical standard for treatment of subdural hematomas has been surgical
      evacuation through burr holes or craniotomies. Many of these patients are elderly patients
      who are high risk surgical candidates. A major concern is SDH recurrence.

      Recurrences require frequent imaging, and will lead to increased length of hospital stay,
      increased morbidity,and re-operations. There are increasing number of reports that suggest
      that a less invasive approach such as endovascular embolization of the middle meningeal
      artery using standard endovascular materials and techniques may reduce the risk of
      recurrence. The reported outcomes in the current literature have been very positive when
      endovascular embolization has been used without surgery or as an adjuvant to surgery.
      However, there have been no studies directly comparing endovascular embolization following
      surgical evacuation to assess if this technique can actually reduce the complications of SDHs
      listed above. The investigators propose to study this treatment process by randomly assigning
      patients who have undergone surgical evacuation of SDHs into a control and treatment group.
      The control group will receive standard surgical evacuation of the hematoma. The study group
      will receive surgical evacuation followed by endovascular embolization.

      The historical standard for treatment of chronic subdural hematomas (SDH) has been through
      surgical evacuation through burr holes or craniotomies. Many of these patients are elderly
      patients who are high risk surgical candidates. Unfortunately given the pathophysiology of
      SDHs there is a high rate of recurrence ranging 5-30% in the literature necessitation
      frequent imaging, increased length of hospital stay, increased morbidity, and increased rate
      of reoperations. A more novel and less invasive approach has been used to treat SDHs in this
      patient population. There are increasing reports of endovascular embolization of the middle
      meningeal artery using a less invasive endovascular approach for SDHs. The reported outcomes
      in literature have been very positive when endovascular embolization has been used without
      surgery or as an adjuvant to surgery. These reports include case series and retrospective
      reviews. There have been no studies directly comparing endovascular embolization following
      surgical evacuation to assess if this technique can actually benefit patients with chronic
      SDHs. The investigators propose to study this treatment process by randomly assigning
      patients who have undergone surgical evacuation of SDHs through burr holes into a control and
      treatment group. The control group (surgery) would only receive surgical evacuation of the
      hematoma using current standard of care. The treatment group (surgery plus) would receive
      surgical evacuation followed by endovascular embolization of the middle meningeal vessels
      using current standard of care. We will directly compare these two treatment modalities to
      obtain class I evidence on the efficacy of embolization for treatment of chronic subdural
      hematomas.
