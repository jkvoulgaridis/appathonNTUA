      This study has two parts: A drug utilization study and a Health-related quality of life
      study.

      Drug utilisation study is an open label, cross sectional, descriptive drug utilization
      analysis of the primary cardiovascular drug classes prescribed to coronary artery disease
      patients attending cardiology OPD of a North India hospital.

      Quality of life study intended to evaluate impact of a mobile based patient education program
      on the health related quality of life, physical activity and body mass index of coronary
      artery disease patients. It is a two arm study.

    <measure>HRQOL measured by RAND-Short form (SF)- 36 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life to be measured using RAND-Short form (SF)- 36 questionnaire. This questionnaire comprises of 36 questions that measure HRQOL across 8 different domains that can be summarised into physical, mental and general health summary scores. Higher the SF 36 domain scores, better is the quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)- Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity of the participants to be measured using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)- Short Form. It measures physical vigorous and moderate physical activity along with time spent in walking and sedentary activities. Higher the IPAQ score, higher is the physical activity.</description>
