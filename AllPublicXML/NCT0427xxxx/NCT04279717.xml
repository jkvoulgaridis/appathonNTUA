      Establish a Latin-American network of centers and professionals with the aim of:

        -  To register VWD patients in retrospective/prospective study, using a database, available
           online, common to all

        -  To register the bleeding history, the treatment and the events of VWD patients in the
           region

        -  To investigate the influence of VWD on quality of life

    <textblock>
      von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common autosomal bleeding disorder, mostly inherited
      as dominant trait. VWD is due to deficiency/abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). The
      prevalence of VWD is unknown, but estimated as 0.1% to 1% of the general population. Although
      the autosomal inheritance pattern would suggest an equal distribution of male and female
      patients, the disease is diagnosed in more females because of female-specific hemostatic
      challenges: menses, ovulation, pregnancy and childbirth. Diagnosis of VWD is made by
      assessing personal and family history of bleeding, physical examination and completed with
      specific laboratory tests.

      There is limited information on the epidemiology of VWD in developing countries. Some
      countries in Latin America have registries of severe disease that, although it is the rarest
      form, carries the highest costs for regional health systems. So that the prevalence of
      clinical symptoms and laboratory features of the disease as well as the management of the
      disease in Latin America is unknown.

      The present project aims to establish a network of centers and professionals with the
      objective to register and investigate all patients with VWD in Latin America, using a
      database available online common to all, to gain understanding about phenotype, genotype and
      management of VWD in the region.

    <description>The aim of therapy is to correct the dual hemostatic defect, due to defective platelet adhesion-aggregation and abnormal coagulation due to Factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency. The choice of treatment depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the bleed, the procedure planned, the subtype and severity of the disease and the age and morbidity of the patient. The evaluation of the response to the treatment is going to be through the measure of FVIII, vWF Antigen (VWF:Ag) and vWF ristocetin cofactor (vWF:RCo).</description>

    <description>For many women with VWD, pregnancy is a time of few bleeding problems. Women with Type 3 von Willebrand disease seem to have more frequent miscarriages, especially during the first trimester. The evaluation of the response to the treatment is going to be through the measure of FVIII, vWF Antigen (VWF:Ag) and vWF ristocetin cofactor (vWF:RCo).</description>
