  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking related lung disease or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterised
      by periods of worsening symptoms termed exacerbations. In some patients these may be severe
      enough to require hospitalisation and support for their breathing. Patients who suffer a
      severe exacerbation requiring breathing support using mask ventilation (also termed
      non-invasive ventilation, NIV) have a high chance of being readmitted to hospital in the
      following 12 months. Recent evidence suggests that the provision of a breathing machine at
      home (home mechanical ventilation, HMV) may reduce the risk of readmission to hospital in
      selected patients.

      Morbidity and mortality in the 12 months following a life-threatening exacerbation of COPD
      remain high. Recent data from the Lane Fox Clinical Respiratory Physiology Research Centre
      supports the addition of home non-invasive ventilation to standard care to improve
      admission-free survival in patients with persistent hypercapnia following a decompensated
      exacerbation of COPD.

      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical implementation of the delivery of home
      non-invasive ventilation in COPD patients with persistent hypercapnia following an acute
      exacerbation of COPD to validate that the clinical benefit derived from the HOT-HMV trial is
      maintained when the home non-invasive ventilation is implemented into routine clinical
      practice.

      Following publication of the home oxygen therapy-home mechanical ventilation (HOT-HMV) trial,
      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical service delivery of home non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV) therapy in patients who have recently undergone, and recovered, from a
      life-threatening exacerbation of COPD.

      This prospective cohort observational study is designed to evaluate the clinical
      implementation of the delivery of home non-invasive ventilation in COPD patients with
      persistent hypercapnia following an acute exacerbation of COPD to validate that the clinical
      benefit demonstrated by the HOT-HMV trial is maintained when the home non-invasive
      ventilation is incorporated into routine clinical practice.

      Patients who have an admission to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring
      non-invasive ventilation will be referred for assessment. Eligible patients will be referred
      by the critical care or appropriate respiratory team to a monthly assessment clinic for
      assessment of chronic hypercapnia. The total UK sample size will be 200 participants. St
      Thomas' critical care unit managed between 80-100 patients per year with non-invasive
      ventilation for life threatening exacerbation of COPD. This study will run over 4 years;
      therefore it is anticipated that 200 patients will be enrolled into the trial over this
      period. Patients will also be referred from peripheral hospitals to the Lane Fox Unit as a
      regional centre for home ventilation.
