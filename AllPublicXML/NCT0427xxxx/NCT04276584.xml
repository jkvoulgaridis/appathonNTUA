  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia and reduced vital capacity is commonly occurring after abdominal surgery. Positive
      expiratory pressure (PEP) is one treatment suggested to improve lung function after surgery.
      We aim to test whether speaking and singing improve postoperative oxygen saturation and
      ventilation after abdominal surgery. In a cross-over design, 64 subjects will be randomized
      to start with either PEP maneuvers, i.e. deep inspiration followed by expiration in a
      positive expiratory pressure device of 10-15 cm H20 or to start with reading a text loudly.
      The experiment will end with singing a song. Patients will be monitored using Noxturnal T3,
      Res Med for respiration and pulse oximetry. SenTec Digital Monitoring systems for online
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure (PtcCO2) measurements. Main outcome
      measurements include oxygen saturation and PtcPCO2. Arterial blood gases will be taken at
      study start.

      Hypoxia and reduced vital capacity is commonly occurring after abdominal surgery. Positive
      expiratory pressure (PEP) is one treatment suggested to improve lung function after surgery,
      but there is a lack of evidence of effect. En passant, we observed that oxygen saturation was
      improved when patients talked postoperative day 1. We aim to test whether speaking and
      singing improve postoperative oxygen saturation and ventilation after abdominal surgery.

      In a cross-over design, 64 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to start with either PEP
      maneuvers, i.e. 3 x 10 deep inspiration followed by expiration in a positive expiratory
      pressure device of 10-15 cm H20 or to start with reading a text loudly during 3 minutes. The
      experiment will end with singing a song. Patients will be monitored using Noxturnal T3, Res
      Med for respiration and pulse oximetry. SenTec Digital Monitoring systems for online
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure (PtcCO2) measurements. Main outcome
      measurements include oxygen saturation and PtcPCO2.

      Arterial blood gases and Peak expiratory flow will be taken/measured at study start. Patients
      will be recommended to talk loudly every hour during the rest of the hospital study if the
      are assigned to talking in the first arm, and to use PEP every hour if they were assigned to
      PEP in the first arm. Peak expiratory flow will be measured and blood gases (PaO2, PCO2) will
      be taken the day after the experiment (secondary outcomes).

    <intervention_model_description>PEP (positive expiratory pressure) is routinely given to patients after abdominal surgery in order to improve postoperative oxygen saturation and lung function. We aim to test whether speaking loudly and singing from a given text improve postoperative oxygen saturation and ventilation. 64 patients will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial with cross-over design starting either with PEP (10 times 3 inspiration and expiration to positive expiratory pressure) or with speaking loudly from a given text. The study will end with singing a song.</intervention_model_description>
