  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the negative impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive processing and the partial
      reversal of this phenomenon by caffeine are well known, the types of cognitive processing
      previously studied have been limited to simple, straight-forward laboratory tasks. It is
      unclear how sleep deprivation and caffeine affect performance on operationally relevant
      complex cognitive tasks, like those encountered by working professionals such as doctors.
      This study aims to uncover how sleep deprivation and caffeine impact two types of clinical
      reasoning processes encountered by physicians on a daily basis. Previous work from members of
      our team investigated diagnostic reasoning in medical professionals and discovered that brain
      activation in executive processing areas was modulated by self-reported sleepiness and
      burnout and level of expertise (Durning, Costanzo, et al., 2013; Durning et al., 2014, 2015).
      The current study aims to expand upon those findings by also investigating a potentially more
      complex type of clinical reasoning, i.e. therapeutic reasoning, and directly manipulating
      sleep and caffeine use in a controlled sleep laboratory. Medical students, residents, and
      board-certified physicians will undergo thirty-seven hours of sleep deprivation and ten hours
      of sleep recovery in the sleep laboratory. During two FMRI scan sessions we will present
      high-quality validated multiple-choice questions on common patient situations in internal
      medicine to participants to explore brain activity during therapeutic reasoning compared with
      diagnostic reasoning. One FMRI scan will occur following a night of sleep deprivation, and
      another scan will occur following a night of recovery sleep. Additionally, half of the
      participants will receive caffeine gum during the sleep deprivation period, while the other
      half will receive placebo gum. This design will allow us to study the effect of sleep
      deprivation and caffeine on the neural correlates of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning and
      performance in general.

    <description>Caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) is a central nervous system stimulant that is found naturally in some foods and beverages such as coffee and tea. For this study, caffeine will be administered in the form of gum pellets (Military Energy chewing gum). Each pellet contains 100 mg of caffeine.</description>
