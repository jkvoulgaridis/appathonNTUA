  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that in patients with previous daratumumab exposure,
      combination therapy of daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd) will yield higher
      complete remission (CR) rates in relapsed/refractory amyloidosis than historical
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone treatment.
