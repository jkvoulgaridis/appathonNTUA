  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate two pharmacotherapeutic approaches to
      sleep induction, both of which have been shown to be effective hypnotics, but may have unique
      side effect profiles. These profiles may have markedly different impacts on performance in a
      military setting. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, the side
      effects of these drugs will be compared - suvorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist and
      zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist - in healthy controls
      comparable in age and gender to the target military population.

    <masking_description>Study sessions will be randomized prior to the study (e.g. Session 1 = placebo, Session 2 = zolpidem, etc.) and volunteers will be assigned a session (treatment group) when they are scheduled for their enrollment visit (Day 1). The randomization schedule will be generated using a random number generator by a person who is not involved in data collection prior to commencement of the study, with the following qualification (hence &quot;pseudo-random&quot;): that all volunteers participating in the same session be randomized or &quot;blocked&quot; together (i.e., assigned the same condition). This will help ensure double-blinding since it may be obvious to volunteers and staff within the same session if some volunteers receive placebo whereas others receive active drug. To help maintain confidentiality, each participant will also be given a unique numerical identifier (e.g., 01-120).</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        Healthy males and non-pregnant, non-lactating female volunteers must be between the ages of
        18 and 39

          -  learned English as a first language (inclusive)*.

          -  To be included in the study, volunteers will have to pass a &quot;Volunteer Comprehension
             Assessment&quot; with a score of 80% or greater. A maximum of two attempts is permitted.
             See section 5.7 for details.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must be on some form of birth control, if sexually
             active (e.g., oral contraceptive, condom, intrauterine device, etc.)

               -  Volunteers must have learned English as their first language. This is because
                  there are cognitive tests administered during the study that require a mastery of
                  the English language.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Self-reported habitual nightly sleep amounts outside the target range of approximately
             6-9 hours (i.e., less than 6 hours per night or more than 9 hours per night, on
             average) (Post-consent Checklist).

          -  Any use of prescription or over-the-counter sleep aids during the 3-month period prior
             to screening determined by the examining study medical investigator to be indicative
             of a potential sleep disorder (e.g., use of a sleep aid for several nights following
             travel across multiple time zones would not necessarily constitute evidence of a sleep
             disorder).

          -  Self-reported nighttime lights-out times earlier than 2000 or later than 0100 during
             weeknights (Sunday through Thursday) (Post-consent Checklist)

          -  Self-reported morning wake-up times earlier than 0500 or later than 0900 during
             weekdays (Monday through Friday) (Post-consent Checklist)

             habits (Post-consent Checklist).

          -  Self-reported symptoms suggestive of a sleep disorder (including but not limited to
             insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep disordered breathing/sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnia,
             restless leg syndrome, parasomnias, REM behavior disorder, etc.) (Post-Consent
             Checklist, Medical History/Exam form; Berlin Questionnaire); history of a sleep
             disorder (Medical History and Examination) or evidence of such from a prior
             polysomnographic assessment.

          -  MORNING-EVENINGNESS QUESTIONNAIRE -Scores lower than 31 or greater than 69.

          -  Self-reported caffeine use in excess of 400 mg (e.g., approximately 8 caffeinated
             sodas or approximately 20 ounces of brewed coffee) per day on average (Post-consent
             Checklist)

          -  History of neurologic disorder (including but not limited to epilepsy or another
             seizure disorder, amnesia, hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease, MS) (Medical History

             childhood seizure, rare sporadic migraine headaches, resolved meningeal infection with
             no sequelae) may be deemed non-exclusionary at the discretion of the examining study
             medical investigator.

          -  History of cardiovascular disease (including but not limited to arrhythmias, valvular
             heart disease, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction) (Medical
             History/Exam form)

          -  Self-reported or suspected heavy alcohol use (minimum limit to define heavy alcohol
             use is 14 drinks per week or as determined by the examining study medical
             investigator).

             limited to Raynaud's disease.

          -  As prisoners will not be recruited and are not eligible for participation in this
