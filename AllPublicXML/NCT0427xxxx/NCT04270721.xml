      EAGLE is an international service improvement study to investigate the value of an
      educational tool delivered to surgeons and their teams to reduce the risk of anastomotic leak
      (leak of a join in the bowel) after right hemicolectomy or ileocaecal resection. This
      complication causes significant risk to life and therefore risks of leak should be minimised.

      The educational team of the European Society of Coloproctology has developed an online
      training package to deliver to 350 hospitals in 30 countries.

      EAGLE is an international quality improvement programme to share best practice and harmonise
      ileo-colic anastomosis procedures through an education programme for surgeons and theatre
      teams.

      The programme has 3 main strategies: (i) enhanced pre-operative risk stratification (making
      sure it is safe to join the bowel together for each patient); (ii) harmonisation of surgical
      technique (making the join as good as it can be and checking it carefully after it is
      created), and (iii) implementation of an intra-operative anastomosis 'checklist' (focusing
      the attention of the whole theatre team at this critical stage of the operation). The
      investigators will use a novel scientific approach to assess the patient benefit that enables
      not only the quality improvement itself to be delivered to all participating hospitals but
      also enables collection and analysis of data to measure the effect of these measures. The
      best way of doing this is to embed the proposed quality improvement into a staggered
      implementation programme, allowing the effect to be assessed between the centres. The
      specific methodology proposed introduces the intervention in a step-wise fashion to all
      hospitals. By the end, all sites will have implemented the programme. Overall, the
      investigators hope to reduce the leak rate by 30% from 8.1% to 5.6% in about 4,500 patients.

    <intervention_model_description>EAGLE is an international, multicentre, cluster-sequence randomised controlled study. The intervention will be delivered at hospital-level so randomisation will be by hospital, with outcomes assessed at the individual patient level.
Cluster randomisation will follow a dog-leg phased study design with 3 randomisation sequences. In the first phase, approximately 48 hospitals (clusters) are randomised between the three sequences, all three are eventually exposed to the intervention. Sequence 1 immediately receives the training intervention and data are only collected after the intervention. In sequence 2, data are collected before and after the intervention. The final sequence collects data only before the intervention. The second dogleg phase commences after the first when more clusters are ready to participate (indicatively after one month, but can be delayed as practicable). Indicatively, 7 dogleg phases with 48 hospitals each, will achieve the sample size required (333 clusters).</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult patients (age 18 years and above) undergoing right colectomy with or without
             primary anastomosis. Right colectomy is defined as ileocaecal resection or right
             hemicolectomy (any colonic transection with the distal resection margin proximal to
             the splenic flexure).

          -  All patients undergoing right colectomy are eligible, including those who do not have
             an anastomosis and are defunctioned by a proximal stoma.

          -  Procedures for any pathology, via any operative approach (open, laparoscopic, robotic
             or converted) are eligible.

          -  Elective (surgery on a planned admission), expedited, and emergency (surgery on an
             unplanned admission) procedures are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing more than one gastrointestinal anastomosis during the same
             operation.

          -  In Crohn's disease, additional upstream stricturoplasty or resection/anastomosis to
             treat disease or strictures at the same operation.

          -  Simultaneous right colectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)
             and/or cytoreductive surgery.

          -  Each individual patient should only be included in EAGLE once. Following the index
             procedure that is included in EAGLE, patients undergoing additional procedures within
             the study window should not be included for a second time.
