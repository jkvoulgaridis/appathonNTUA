  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is a chronic degenerative retinal disease, which can lead to
      a progressive loss of visual acuity without affecting peripheral vision. It is a public
      health problem as it remains the leading cause of visual impairment in people over 50 years
      of age in industrialized countries.

      Age-related macular degeneration has two clinical forms:

        -  Atrophic or dry form: progressive disappearance of photoreceptors, alteration of the
           pigmentary epithelium leading to a thinning of the macula.

        -  Exudative or humid form: development of immature choroidal neo-vessels, leading to the
           formation of edema or intra or sub-retinal hemorrhage at the origin of the symptoms.

      There are still many questions about the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration,
      and there is currently no etiological treatment. The disorder is thought to have a
      multifactorial, genetic and environmental origin.

      Among the environmental risk factors, dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated acids and its
      effect on the retina are factors that influence both the incidence and progression of the
      disease. However, intervention studies have not been able to demonstrate the preventive value
      of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is likely that the precise identification of
      patients who could benefit from this supplementation is necessary. Currently, the estimation
      of dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is based on dietary surveys, which
      implies a number of limits. A blood biomarker of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content
      in the retina has been previously identified, which if lowered may be a risk factor for
      age-related macular degeneration. A low level could also help to identify patients who would
      best respond to supplementation. A publication has been submitted and a patent has been filed
      for this biomarker. The objective of this project is to confirm the relationship between this
      biomarker and the presence of age-related macular degeneration. The analysis will be refined
      by correlating the discriminating character of the biomarker with factors that may influence
      the intestinal metabolism of dietary lipids and their bioavailability in the blood. For this
      purpose, the status of the subjects with regard to their intestinal flora (microbiota) will
      be evaluated. The relationship between lipid metabolism, microbiota and age-related macular
      degeneration should also provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms
      that link diet, lipid metabolism and age-related macular degeneration.
