  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is the early stage of fibrosis. Serious patients are more likely to develop into
      pulmonary fibrosis, which affects the recurrence of lung function or even threatens life and
      health. This study is planned to observe the efficacy and safety of Fuzheng Huayu tablets in
      the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis after COVID-19.

    <textblock>
      Corona Virus Disease 2019, which began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, has spread
      rapidly and become an international public health emergency. Although the pathological
      mechanism of the pneumonia is unclear, some patients developed severe or critical condition
      due to the continuous development of inflammation.

      Inflammation is the early stage of fibrosis. After the control of acute symptoms and signs,
      severe patients often have more manifestations of pulmonary fibrosis, which affects the
      recurrence of lung function. Fuzheng Huayu tablets has been proved effective in inhibiting
      MMP activity to protect subepithelial basement membrane which plays a key role in lung injury
      and interstitial fibrosis.

      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter clinical study of pulmonary fibrosis due to
      2019-nCoV. The main objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fuzheng Huayu in
      pulmonary fibrosis after 2019-nCoV infection.

      In this study, 136 eligible patients with pulmonary fibrosis due to 2019-nCoV infection will
      be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio. Patients will receive one
      of two treatment regimens: A. Fuzheng Huayu tablets + basic treatment; B. Placebo tablets +
      basic treatment. The basic treatment includes N-acetylcysteine 1 capsule three times a day.
