  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goals are to characterize the effects of maternal obesity during pregnancy on infant
      brain development, reveal the neurodevelopmental consequences, and identify possible
      mechanisms causing these effects. Our overall hypothesis is that maternal obesity during
      pregnancy exposes the fetus to an inflammatory environment that affects infant brain
      structural and functional development and consequently neurodevelopmental outcomes. To test
      this hypothesis, the investigators will recruit normal-weight and obese pregnant women,
      examine inflammatory markers associated with obese pregnancy, and correlate them with
      offspring's brain development evaluated using quantitative MRI methods and outcomes evaluated
      using neurodevelopmental tests.

    <textblock>
      About one third of all women of reproductive age in the US are obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥
      30). Recent studies show that children born to mothers who were obese while pregnant may have
      lower cognitive performance and higher risk of developing neurodevelopmental conditions. The
      goal of this study is to see 1) if there are negative effects of maternal obesity during
      pregnancy on newborn's brain development; 2) if these effects on brain development persist to
      age 1 &amp; 2 years, and if there are changes in neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with
      maternal obesity; and 3) if inflammation in pregnant women associated with maternal obesity
      is one of the main reasons for the brain changes in offspring. The investigators will recruit
      pregnant women from early pregnancy who are either obese or normal weight and are otherwise
      healthy. The Investigators will measure their weight, body fat percentage, blood inflammation
      markers, family environment, what the participants normally eat, how much physical activity
      the participants usually have, and other characteristics during pregnancy. When their babies
      are born, the investigators will evaluate the brain development of their babies use magnetic
      resonance imaging (during natural sleep) at age two weeks and again at age 1&amp;2 years. The
      investigators will also measure the neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 2 years. Then compare
      the findings to see if there are group differences in these measures between babies born to
      normal-weight and obese mothers, if other parameters measured at pregnancy also play a role,
      and if inflammation markers during pregnancy strongly correlate with infant brain development
      and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

        We will recruit 160 pregnant women (N=75 for normal weight, BMI 18.5-25, and N=85 for
        obese, BMI 30-50) at &lt;12 weeks of pregnancy. The goal is to obtain neuroimaging data from
        120 infants (N=60/60 from normal-weight or obese mothers) at age ~2 weeks, and to follow up
        all children at age 1 and 2 years.
