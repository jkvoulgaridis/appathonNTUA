  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee injuries are common among active-duty military personnel. One of the most common knee
      injuries is a meniscus tear, which can have several consequences. Immediately, the soldier
      may be separated from the military for over one year or assigned a permanent activity
      limiting duty profile. Over time, meniscal tears may also increase the risk of other knee
      injuries, such as osteoarthritis, which is one of the most common medical reasons for
      discharge from active duty service. The current standard of care includes conservative
      treatments, such as physical therapy and rest. Once conservative treatments fail, surgery is
      generally the next option. However, there is limited evidence that surgery is effective and
      some studies suggest it can accelerate the development of osteoarthritis. The goal of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of a regenerative treatment for meniscal tears termed
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue in reducing pain and restoring activity levels. We will
      recruit active-duty military personnel and civilians with meniscal tears and provide them
      with either the adipose tissue treatment or a control treatment consisting of saline. We will
      then follow these individuals for up to one year and evaluate differences in pain and
      function between the two groups. The ultimate goal is to show that micro-fragmented adipose
      tissue is a viable alternative for the treatment of meniscal tears in active-duty military
      personnel.

      This is randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of autologous, micro-fragmented
      adipose tissue (MFAT) injection under ultrasound guidance for meniscal injuries in active
      duty military personnel. The control for this study, to which MFAT will be compared, is
      trephination with saline injection into the meniscal tear. Eighty (80) healthy,
      phyisically-fit men and women with confirmed, acute meniscal tears will be recruited and
      placed into one of two treatment groups.

      Percutaneous trephination with MFAT: Micro-fragmented adipose tissue will be obtained by
      using a minimal manipulation technique in a closed system (LipogemsÂ®), without the addition
      of enzymes or any additives. The final product will consist of micronized fat tissue yielding
      fat clusters with preserved vascular stroma of about 500 microns with intact stromal vascular
      niches and harboring regenerative cellular elements. Approximately 1-2 mL of micro-fragmented
      adipose will be injected into the meniscus with an 18-gauge x 3.5 inch needle under
      continuous ultrasound guidance. An additional 4-5 mL will be injected into the knee joint. No
      other biological or pharmacological agents will be used in combination with the
      micro-fragmented adipose.

      Percutaneous trephination with saline: In this group, the physician will identify the
      mensical lesion using ultrasound and will trephinate the torn meniscus with normal saline
      (0.9%) solution using an 18 guage x 3.5 inch needle. Approximately 1-2 mL will be injected
      into the meniscus and an additional 4-5 mL will be injected into the knee joint under
      ultrasound guidance.

      Both Groups: Participants will be followed for adverse events and changes in shoulder pain
      intensity on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10, with anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain
      as bad as you can imagine&quot;); the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS); the
      PROMIS Physical Functioning short form; knee physical and ultrasound examinations; and a
      5-point subject global impression of change (SGIC) scale. Subjects will be examined at 1
      month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the treatment.

    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knee pain intensity will be assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10, ranging from 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to a maximum of 10= &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Pain intensity is the most common pain domain assessed in research and clinical settings. Although different rating scales have proven to be valid for assessing pain intensity, the 11-point NRS has the most strengths and fewest weaknesses of available measures. An 11-point NRS measure of pain intensity allows for comparison across clinical trials of chronic pain treatment and has been recommended by the IMMPACT consensus group for use in pain clinical trials and by the 2006 NIDRR SCI Pain outcome measures consensus group. We will evaluate changes in scores between baseline and 3 months.</description>

    <description>The subject will be asked to rate on a 7-point scale his or her overall impression following treatment as compared to the previous measurement interval. The 7-point PGIC scale (also referred to as the original Guy/Farrar-PGIC scale; anchored by &quot;very much improved&quot; and &quot;very much worse&quot;) is used to measure global treatment effect and is recommended as a compliment to unidimensional pain intensity scales. Although other versions of the PGIC scale exist, the SCI Measures Pain Committee recommends using the original Guy/Farrar-PGIC scale in clinical trials since it has been used extensively and been shown to be sensitive to change. We will evaluate scores at 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a disease-specific measure of knee injury-related sequelae. It includes five subscales meant to capture the complex nature of knee pain: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life. The KOOS is the most widely used knee-related instrument, evidenced by its inclusion in large international patient datasets. It has strong psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity. Its wide use also allows for effect size comparisons to other treatments for knee conditions.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS-PF is one member of a number of patient reported outcomes, which measures self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. It utilizes a 5-point Likert scale (&quot;Without any difficulty&quot; to &quot;Unable to do&quot;) to assess difficulty with 20 different activities, such as getting in and out of a car or performing vigorous activities. It has shown construct validity among patients with arthritis and to be highly responsive to change in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</description>

    <description>The Lipogems system (Lipogems International SpA, Milan, Italy) is designed to isolate autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue without enzymes or other additives. It uses mild mechanical forces to break down adipose tissue that is extracted from the patient into a form that can be injected into the meniscal lesion and other degenerated tissues in a sterile and safe manner. The resulting product is rich in pericytes and mesenchymal stromal cells, retained within an intact stromal vascular niche, that is ready for use in clinical applications.</description>

    <description>Normal Saline solution is a mixture of sodium chloride in water (9 g NaCl per liter water, 0.9% saline). Trephination allows for vascular growth and healing, especially in the inner avascular regions of the meniscus, by puncturing the meniscus. Small &quot;tunnels&quot; are created, which allow for healing factors to reach the avascular inner region of the meniscus from the vascular peripheral regions.</description>
