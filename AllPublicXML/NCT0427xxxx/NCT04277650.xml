  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This quality improvement project will evaluate the implementation of a previously described
      intervention (twice per week on-treatment clinical evaluations) in a feasible fashion using a
      previously described machine learning algorithm identifying patients identified at high risk
      for an emergency visit or hospitalization during radiation therapy.
