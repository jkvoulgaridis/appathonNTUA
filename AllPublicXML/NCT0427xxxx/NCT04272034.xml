    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation design to identify the maximum tolerated dose and/or pharmacologically active dose for INCB099280. Part 2 is an expansion at 1 or more dose levels to further explore safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacoketics, and pharmacodynamic effects.</intervention_model_description>

          -  Prior receipt of an anti-PD-L1 therapy.

          -  Treatment with anticancer medications or investigational drugs within protocol-defined
             intervals before the first administration of study drug.

          -  A 28-day washout for systemic antibiotics is required.

          -  Probiotic usage while on study and during screening is prohibited.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.
