  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is aimed to determine the validity, validity and reliability of the Mouth
      Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis (MHISS) scale in Turkish patients with Systemic Sclerosis;
      information will be obtained on application considerations. In addition, when we look at the
      literature, there is no Turkish scale evaluating oral involvement in patients with systemic
      sclerosis. In this context, we believe that our work will have a mission that will benefit
      new studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Sclerosis is an autoimmune connective tissue disease with fibrosis. Although its
      etiology and pathogenesis have not been clearly defined, it has a chronic course. Systemic
      sclerosis is estimated to affect approximately 300,000 people in the United States. Most
      commonly, it affects adults and women.

      Narrowing of the mouth opening and mouth pain are the two most important causes reported by
      adults with systemic sclerosis. In patients with systemic sclerosis, orofacial findings such
      as microstomy or reduced mouth opening are frequently seen. Microstomy is defined as the
      distance between the incisors is less than 40 millimeters. In severe microstomy, this
      distance is less than 30 millimeters. It is approximately 33 millimeters in adults with
      systemic sclerosis. Microstomy in systemic sclerosis mainly results from submucosal collagen
      deposits that contribute to fibrosis in the perioral tissue. Microstomy is seen in 43% to 80%
      of adults with systemic sclerosis.

      When the current literature is examined, Bongi et al. evaluated the effectiveness of
      face-specific programs, which are applied together with general rehabilitation programs in
      patients with systemic sclerosis; they demonstrated that these techniques improve disability,
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and facial functionality.

      A Turkish validity and reliability study based on patient reporting evaluating oral health
      has not been performed. When the literature was examined, outh Mouth Handicap in Systemic
      Sclerosis (MHISS) Scale &quot;was found to be an objective method for assessing oral involvement
      in the MSS.

      In 2007, the Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis (MHISS) Scale, which was published in
      English, was translated into Italian in 2012 and Dutch in 2013 and cultural adaptation was
      performed. No Turkish version was found in the literature.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the validity, validity and reliability of the
      Turkish version of the Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis (MHISS) Scale in the evaluation
      of oral health of patients with Systemic Sclerosis. At the end of the study, the validity,
      reliability study will be conducted and the Turkish population will be translated into
      Turkish by using the Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis (MHISS) Scale, which allows
      assessment based on patient notification.

    <time_frame>at first day and second week change</time_frame>
    <description>Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Questionnaire (MHISS): This is a self-reported scale specific to the disease that questions oral involvement in systemic sclerosis. It consists of 12 items that evaluate features such as mouth opening, chewing, tooth structure, lip structure, dry mouth, fluent speech, and facial appearance. It is answered according to the five-point Likert system: 0: Never, 1: Rarely, 2: Sometimes, 3: Frequently, 4: Always. The higher the total score, the higher the severity of the problem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at first day</time_frame>
    <description>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ): The SHAQ includes 5 visual analog scale questions that question Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcer, gastrointestinal and pulmonary respiratory symptoms, as well as the patient's overall disease severity. In addition, there are 20 questions (HAQ) evaluating the functional competence level of the patient. Each question is between 0-3 points (0: no difficulty and 3: can not). In the scoring of the sections, the highest score among the items constituting that section is accepted as the section score. The score of each category is summed and divided by the total number of categories, 8 to obtain the SHAQ disability score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>at first day</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-report scale that questions the proportion of individuals experiencing oral health problems. Likert response system; 0: None, 1: Rarely, 2: Sometimes, 3: Often, 4: Very often. The evaluation shows the total score of the participants' responses to each item, while OHIP-14 A (additive) shows the number of responses that a participant gave as 2 (sometimes) and 3 (often) in 14 items. The increase in the total score indicates that the severity of the problem increases and quality of life decreases.</description>

    <measure>Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)</measure>

    <description>It is a single factor scale used to evaluate the severity and change of dysphagia symptoms. It consists of ten items. Each item is scored from 0 to 4. The total score ranges from 0 to 40. The scale is considered to be abnormal 3 points or more.</description>

    <description>Cases will be evaluated for oral health and data will be recorded. In addition to evaluations by a single physiotherapist in the first evaluation, a second physiotherapist will independently implement the OMouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Questionnaire (MHISS). The second assessment will be performed within 1-2 weeks to ensure that the patient's condition is stable and that he does not remember any previous answers to the questions, and that only the Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Questionnaire (MHISS) will be applied.</description>
