  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prisoners experience huge health inequalities, and their exceptionally high smoking
      prevalence (five times the national average) contributes significantly to their high
      mortality. Since the introduction of smoke-free polices across Her Majesty's Prison and
      Probation Service (HMPPS) in England and Wales, prisoners are now obliged to abstain from
      smoking while held in prison. This represents a unique opportunity to promote lifelong
      cessation in this highly disadvantaged and marginalised group. However, evidence suggests
      most prisoners intend to resume smoking as soon as possible after release. A systematic
      review of prison smoke-free polices worldwide concluded that there was a need for new
      research to identify effective strategies to reduce relapse in these individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to develop and pilot test the feasibility and
      acceptability of an intervention to help prevent prisoners relapse to smoking after release.
      The study will work in accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for
      developing and evaluating complex interventions. The Preventing Relapse tO Smoking among
      PrisonErs after Release (PROSPER) study consists of three key Phases:

        1. Document the support provided to manage nicotine addiction during imprisonment and in
           the periods immediately before and after release; establish the extent to which
           prisoners intentionally resume or unintentionally relapse to smoking after release; and
           obtain views on how relapse might be prevented.

        2. Drawing on current literature and findings from Phase 1, develop and design an prototype
           intervention to prevent smoking relapse after release.

        3. To pilot the designed prototype intervention and conduct a process evaluation to inform
           the development of further work in this area.

      The research will be carried out in three prisons in the East Midlands. The main duties will
      include recruitment of participants (HMPPS staff members and prisoners), data collection,
      data analysis, assist with intervention development and refining related intervention
      materials/resources, co-facilitate Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups, contribute to
      the ethical application for the pilot intervention, and preparation of manuscripts for
      peer-review publication.
