  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) called &quot;Reducing Risk of Dementia through
      Deprescribing&quot; (R2D2) to evaluate the impact of a deprescribing intervention on important
      cognitive and safety outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The R2D2 study will test whether the adverse cognitive effects of anticholinergic medications
      are reversible by implementing a pharmacist-based deprescribing intervention for older adults
      within primary care practices. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: the
      deprescribing intervention group or usual care; the intervention group will receive a
      pharmacist-based deprescribing intervention, while the usual care group will receive care as
      usually provided by their primary and/or specialty care providers. The target population will
      be primary care older adults with subjective cognitive decline or make at least one error on
      a cognitive screening test, but do not have dementia, and are currently using a strong
      anticholinergic medication. The intervention and follow-up data collection will occur over 24
      months in order to test the long-term impact of the intervention on the planned clinical
      outcomes. Study outcomes include cognition (primary) and safety (secondary) through validated
      self-reported scales.

Physicians agreeing to participate in the trial will be randomized to intervention or usual care in blocks of two or four. Physician randomization status will determine participants' study group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive composite scores will be collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and changes in the composite scores over time will be compared between the intervention and usual care groups. An overall cognitive composite score including Central Processing Time, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and the Trail Making Test will evaluate domains of memory and new learning, processing speed, and executive function. Assessments will be conducted at each time point from the average of each measure's z-score, constructed by subtracting the mean baseline scores and dividing by the baseline standard deviation. The z-score transformation of the cognitive composite score will have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 at baseline, with higher scores representing improvement in cognition.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported, 4-item scales evaluating depression, anxiety, pain, and insomnia will be collected for each participant at each time point. Each PROMIS measure raw score can be converted to a T-score where 50 represents the general population norm for that symptom and each 10-point deviation represents one standard deviation (SD) from the population norm. Changes in the T-scores over time will be compared between the intervention and usual care groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Utilities Index (HUI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported measure of health-related quality of life, evaluating domains including vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognitive function and pain. These attributes produce a single score on a standardized utility measure with individual health domain scores ranging from 0.00 (maximum impairment) to 1.00 (no impairment) and the multi-attribute (HUI) scores ranging from 0.36 to 1.00 with anchors 0.00 = dead and 1.00 = perfect health. HUI scores will be collected at each outcome assessment and change in HUI scores over time will be compared between the intervention and usual care groups.</description>

    <description>The active intervention group (ACT) will receive a pharmacist-based deprescribing intervention focused only on targeted anticholinergic medications. The intervention pharmacist will serve as the central source of communication between participants, providers, and (as needed) dispensing pharmacy to coordinate the deprescribing process. The study pharmacists will navigate a shared-decision model between the physicians and participant in order to personalize the selection of appropriate alternatives and switch/titration schedules. Importantly, the pharmacist will supervise the titration and deprescribing plan and communicate with both participants and physicians throughout the study.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data collected through this trial will be made available to either advance scientific research in a way that is allowed by the federal regulations that protect research subjects, or for the purpose of auditing or program evaluation by the government or funding agency. Data sharing for scientific purposes is essential for further translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. To protect participants' rights and confidentiality, protected health information will be limited to the minimum necessary for authorized oversight before the data are shared.The final dataset will include demographic, clinical, and limited genetic data. The final subject-level, de-identified dataset will be made available to qualified individuals within the scientific community.</ipd_description>

As a GAAIN Data Partner, data from this study will be shared in aggregate through the GAAIN portal (gaain.org). GAAIN provides a global infrastructure for cooperative research by linking data repositories that have collected information from participants who are at risk for or have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The GAAIN network allows the investigator to retain ownership of the data collected in each study, and can detach the data at any time. Only de-identified data is shared with GAAIN or any other research entity.</ipd_access_criteria>
