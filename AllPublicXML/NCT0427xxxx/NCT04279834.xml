  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how mild sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and not
      getting enough sleep each night, contribute to daytime sleepiness. The investigators also
      want to determine the treatment that works best for improving daytime sleepiness.

      In this study, the investigators are comparing 3 programs that may improve symptoms of
      daytime sleepiness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with significant adverse health consequences
      including cardiovascular disease, motor vehicle accidents, daytime functional impairments and
      mortality risk. A significant proportion of the populace has mild SDB.

      This study is a randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a program combining
      patient monitoring with behavioral techniques across Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) and sleep
      education. Screening for sleep apnea will be performed based on a phone screening
      questionnaire and an initial polysomnography (collected from another clinic or collected by
      research staff). Both objective (actigraphy, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, 24 hour blood
      pressure monitoring, office blood pressure, and EndoPATTM) and self-report
      (questionnaire/diary) sleep measure will be collected, as well as other health-related
      measures. Participants with an Apnea Hypopnea Index between 5 and 15, and who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three educational programs.

      All groups will receive education about SDB and sleep, but only one group will receive PAP
      devices. This information will be provided to participants as part of the 4-session
      intervention. Follow-up assessments will be conducted immediately following the intervention
      and after 3-months.

      Main study outcomes (lapses, daytime sleepiness, endothelial function and ambulatory blood
      pressure) will be assessed at baseline, post treatment and 3 month. Data will be analyzed
      using &quot;intention to treat&quot; principles, using appropriate statistical methods for clinical
      trials.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>PVT is a performance measure of alertness and vigilance. Reaction time to a visual cue, delivered at random intervals varying from 2 to 10 seconds, is measured. The total number of lapses (reaction time &gt;500ms) during the 10 minute test will be used as a measure of objective alertness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>ESS is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses general level of daytime sleepiness. Total score ranges from 0 - 24, with higher scores indicating greater sleepiness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multi-dimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The MFSI-SF is a 30-item questionnaire that measures general, physical, emotional, and mental manifestations of fatigue. Scores range from 0-120, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reactive hyperemia index</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function will be measured by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) collected by fingertip sensor. Proprietary software is used to calculate a reactive hyperemia index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24-hours Ambulatory Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be monitored over a 24-hour period. Mean 24-hour blood pressure, mean daytime (6am - 10pm), and mean nocturnal (10pm - 6am) blood pressure will be calculated.</description>
