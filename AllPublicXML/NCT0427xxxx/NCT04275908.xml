  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open enrollment study to collect data for the optimization of smartphone-based
      algorithms for the early detection of mental health and suicidal risk in a student
      population. Approximately 2000 students, ages 8-23, will be recruited by therapists across 30
      schools and mental health centers.

    <description>Participants will be asked about their mental health using standardized questionnaires and a specific set of additional questions developed to encourage an open conversation with the therapist. The app will record the therapy session and a proprietary algorithm will be tested to determine if it can accurately detect the presence of a mental state (for example, suicidal intention) as compared with the standardized questionnaires (e.g. Columbia scale) and the therapists' clinical impression.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Convenient and accessible use of the app in a variety of settings where adolescents and young adults may require intervention for mental health and suicide-related concerns. Upon completion of the therapy sessions, the therapists will be asked to complete a questionnaire to provide feedback on the usability of the device in a real-world setting. This information will drive modifications to the app and to the device that it is used with (e.g. smartphone, tablet) to create second generation models that are user-friendly and provide valuable information in clinical settings.</description>

        Thirty sites across Southwest Ohio will be recruited, including schools (using the
        school-based therapists), community mental health centers, and colleges/universities
        (counseling centers). Approximately 150 therapists across 30 sites will be recruited to
        enroll students from their current caseloads.
