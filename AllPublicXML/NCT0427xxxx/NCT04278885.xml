    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, exploratory, proof-of-concept, single-center, open-label pilot study to
      assess the effects and safety of Lanadelumab in patients with FXII-associated cold
      autoinflammatory syndrome (FACAS).

      Factor XII is a serine protease with diverse functions that participates in coagulation,
      fibrinolysis, complement and contact system activation. So far, mutations in the factor XII
      gene were linked to the rare coagulation disorder Hagemann factor deficiency and hereditary
      angioedema (FXII-HAE).

      The investigators recently identified a novel FXII mutation in a 4-generation family with
      profound contact system activation and an autoinflammatory clinical phenotype.

      Lanadelumab is a specific kallikrein Inhibitor that is known to prevent clinical symptoms and
      contact system activation in hereditary angioedema.

      This study aims at assessing the clinical effects and safety of Lanadelumab in patients with
      FXII-associated cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FACAS).

                  interpretation of the results (e.g., history of substance abuse or dependence, a
                  significant pre-existing illness or other major comorbidity that the Investigator
                  considers may confound the interpretation of study results).
