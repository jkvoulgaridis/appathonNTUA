      The purpose of this study is to provide clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of
      Ortho Development® Corporation's Entrada™ Hip System (Figure 1). The Entrada™ Hip System was
      fully introduced to the US market in July, 2018. The Entrada™ Hip System includes the
      Entrada™ Hip Stem, an FDA approved (510(K) # K171249) femoral stem coupled with either a
      cobalt chrome or Biolox® Delta Ceramic femoral head. Additionally, the stem and head are
      coupled with either the Escalade® or Legend® acetabular shell, both of which utilize highly
      cross-linked polyethylene liners.

    <measure>Implant Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 - 10-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Implant survival based on removal or intended removal of any component of Entrada Hip Sys @five years follow-up. Will be measured using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Reconstruction, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Assessment, the UCLA Activity Rating Scale. Effectiveness will be assessed by achieving minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in HOOS JR and UCLA Activity scores. Hung et al. recently reported MCID of HOOS JR to be 19.68 units in an adult recon pop. The MCID for UCLA activity score has been reported to be 0.92 units.minimal detectable change for the PROMIS Global physical and mental health measures will be assessed using one-half of the standard dev between the pre and last post change score. MCID for numeric pain scale will be assessed as a 2 unit change in pain. HOOS, JR score ranges from 1-100 where 0 = total hip disability 100 = perfect hip health.</description>

    <time_frame>2 - 10-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Satisfaction with their hip replacement will be assessed at one, two, five and ten years. Satisfaction will be measured on a 5 point likert scale from very unsatisfied to very satisfied.</description>

    <description>Radiographic adverse events: Adverse events will be captured on the adverse event case report form. Radiographic adverse events will be evaluated using the zones for radiolucencies as described on the radiographic evaluation case report form. These include the femoral zones described by Gruen et al. Radiolucent lines &lt;2mm will be considered fibrous integration as per the review of Vanrusselt et al. Without evidence of progression these lines will not be considered evidence of aseptic loosening.</description>
