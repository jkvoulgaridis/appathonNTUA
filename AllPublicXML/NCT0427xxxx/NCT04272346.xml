  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short, online interventions designed to enhance well-being may be particularly amenable for
      use with adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (age 15-39 at diagnosis), an
      understudied group in the cancer community. The benefits of psychological well-being on both
      physical and mental health outcomes are well-known and, in recent years, researchers and
      policymakers have begun to view the period of adolescence and young adulthood as a window of
      opportunity to instantiate lasting habits and behaviors. Growing evidence suggests that
      prosocial behavior—a behavior that can be reliably manipulated through a short online
      intervention—may have beneficial effects on well-being and physical health. This has yet to
      be tested in AYA cancer survivors.

      Drawing from the literature on positive psychology and prosocial interventions, the proposed
      study will test the feasibility and efficacy of an 8-week online peer helping intervention
      designed to increase well-being among AYA cancer survivors. AYA cancer survivors (n = 176)
      will be recruited and randomized to one of three conditions: a peer helping condition, a
      cancer-specific writing plus peer helping condition, or a cancer-specific writing condition
      (control condition). The second group was added in response to a previous study, which found
      that writing about one's experience prior to helping other survivors may be more beneficial.
      Participants will complete a weekly writing activity once per week for 4 weeks, with
      instructions administered via a weekly email. Participants will also complete online
      assessments before, during, and after the 4-week intervention period.

    <measure>Change in psychological well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline survey (the day the intervention begins), at the post-intervention survey (1 week after the final writing assignment), and at the 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Well-being within the past month will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and the 1-month follow-up via the 14-item Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). The MHC-SF is comprised of three empirically derived subscales: the 3-item Emotional Well-Being Subscale, the 6-item Psychological Well-Being Subscale, and the 5-item Social Well-Being Subscale. Higher scores on each subscale, and the total score overall (range: 0-56), indicate greater well-being.</description>

    <description>Depressive symptoms over the past week will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and the 1-month follow-up via the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a measure of symptom severity, with higher scores (range: 0-60) indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Perceived impact of cancer will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and the 1-month follow-up via the Impact of Cancer Scale, Version 2. The following subscales will be administered: positive self-evaluation (4 items; range: 4-20), worry (7 items; range: 7-35), body change concerns (3 items; range: 3-15), physical appearance concerns (3 items; range: 3-15), and altruism/empathy (4 items; range: 4-20.

    <description>Pain intensity over the past week will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and the 1-month follow-up using the 1-item PROMIS pain intensity questionnaire (range: 1-5). Pain interference over the past week will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and the 1-month follow-up using the 4-item PROMIS pain interference questionnaire (range: 4-20). Higher scores indicate greater pain intensity and interference.</description>

    <time_frame>At the baseline survey (the day the intervention begins), at the post-intervention survey (1 week after the final writing assignment), and at the 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and the 1-month follow-up using the 21-item 2-way Social Support Scale. This scale measures 4 dimensions of social support: instrumental support received, instrumental support given, emotional support received, and emotional support given.

Two additional adjectives were also included, happy and calm. Greater scores indicate higher feelings of positive (range: 10-50) and negative affect (range: 10-50).</description>
