  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AV-1 is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) being investigated as a potential therapy for
      dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease with extensive global public health impact. Globally,
      over 2 billion people are thought to be at risk of infection from the dengue virus and there
      are an estimated 390 million infections each year. Current treatment options for dengue are
      limited to supportive care, so a safe and effective treatment would provide substantial
      public health benefits. AV-1 has not previously been tested in humans. This study aims to
      determine the safety of AV-1 in healthy adult volunteers, when administered as a single IV
      infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be in good health at Screening (reaffirmed at Check-in):

               1. Good health is defined by the absence of a medical condition described in the
                  exclusion criteria of the study protocol, and based on screening medical history,
                  physical examination, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

               2. If the subject has another current, ongoing chronic medical condition, the
                  condition cannot: (i) Be first diagnosed within 3 months of enrollment; or (ii)
                  Have worsened in terms of clinical outcome in the first 3 months; or (iii)
                  Involve the need for medication that may pose a risk to the subject's safety or
                  impede assessment of adverse events (AEs) or anti-AV-1 antibody response if they
                  participate in the study.

          -  Women who are not pregnant and/or not lactating.

          -  Female subjects, including postmenopausal women and surgically sterile women, must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening, Check-in and on admission to the
             study facility.

          -  Female subjects must fulfill one of the following criteria:

               1. Postmenopausal women must have had ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with
                  follicle-stimulating hormone concentration consistently ≥40 mIU/mL and must have
                  a negative pregnancy test result at Screening and Check-in.

               2. Surgically sterile women - those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral
                  ovariectomy (oophorectomy), or bilateral tubal ligation, must provide
                  documentation of the procedure and must have a negative pregnancy test at
                  Screening and Check-in.

               3. Must be willing to not engage in sexual intercourse from Check-in until the final
                  follow-up visit on Day 85 (± 5 days).

               4. Must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth control until the final

             donation from Check-in until the final follow-up visit on Day 85 (± 5 days). A male
             subject is considered capable of fathering children even if his sexual partner is
             sterile or using contraceptives.

          -  Body Mass Index between 13.5 and 29.9 kg/m^2 inclusive.

             would interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study or increase the
             risk of participating for that subject, based on the Investigator's Brochure and the
             safety profile of AV-1.

          -  Subject has one or more symptoms of a urinary tract infection (e.g. dysuria, frequent,
             urgency, or suprapubic pain) at Screening or Check-in.

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody types 1 and 2 within 28 days of enrollment.
