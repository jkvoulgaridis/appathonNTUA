    <textblock>
      Introduction: A baseline assessment of surgical capacity is recommended as a first-step to
      inform national policy on surgical system strengthening. In Ethiopia, the World Health
      Organization's Situational Analysis Tool (WHO SAT) was adapted to assess surgical capacity as
      part of a national initiative: Saving Lives Through Safe Surgery (SaLTS). This study
      describes the process of adapting this tool and initial results.

      Methods: The new tool was used to evaluate fourteen hospitals in the Southern Nations,
      Nationalities, and People's Region of Ethiopia between February and March 2017. Two analytic
      methods were employed. To compare this data to international metrics, the WHO Service
      Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) framework was used. To assess congruence with
      national policy, data was evaluated against Ethiopian SaLTS targets.

        The Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' (SNNP) Region is one of Ethiopia's eleven
        regions, occupying the southwest portion of the country. Public hospitals serve the
        region's population in this area within three tiers - primary, general, and specialized
        hospitals. An average of four providers were interviewed per facility and participants
        included hospital leadership (CEOs, medical directors, and matrons), surgeons, integrated
        emergency surgical officers, obstetrician-gynecologists, mid-level anesthesia providers,
        and operating room nurses.
