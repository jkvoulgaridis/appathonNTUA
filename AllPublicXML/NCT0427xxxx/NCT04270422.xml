  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effect of multidimensional physiotherapy to usual evidence-based
      physiotherapy in the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain in adults. Half of the
      participants will receive multidimensional physiotherapy based on biopsychosocial approach
      while the other half will receive usual evidence based physiotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      multidimensional physiotherapy treatment include: psychoeducation based on cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT), education, graded exposure, postural correction exercise, lifestyle
      change, and electrotherapy.

      usual evidence-based physiotherapy include: electrotherapy, education, and trunk general
      exercises.
