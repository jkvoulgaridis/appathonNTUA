  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase 4 study, women who have been prescribed commercial ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone) by a
      physician as standard of care for postpartum depression (PPD) and who are planning to receive
      the infusion per United States Prescribing Information (USPI) at a Risk Evaluation and
      Mitigation Strategy (REMS)-certified healthcare center are being asked to participate to
      collect data on multimodal neuroimaging parameters in order to evaluate the relationship
      between changes in depressive symptoms and changes in neuroimaging parameters.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Infusion on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D total score comprises a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 include: insomnia (early night, middle night, early morning), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. Items scored in a range of 0 to 4 include: agitation, depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score can range from 0 to 52.</description>

    <description>rsfMRI is used in brain mapping to evaluate regional interactions that occur in a resting or task-negative state, when an explicit task is not being performed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Participant has been prescribed brexanolone for PPD and plans to receive commercially
             available brexanolone per the USPI at a REMS-certified healthcare setting.

          -  Participant is ambulatory.

          -  Participant agrees to adhere to the study requirements.

          -  Participant has had a major depressive episode that began no earlier than the third
             trimester and no later than the first 4 weeks following delivery, as diagnosed by the
             Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders (SCID-5).

          -  Participant agrees not to be the primary caregiver of any dependents during the
             infusion.

          -  Participant has a HAM-D total score of ≥22 at screening and baseline.

          -  Participant is ≤12 months postpartum at screening.

          -  Participant is willing at screening to delay the start of any new pharmacotherapy
             regimens, including antidepressant or antianxiety medication until the brexanolone
             infusion and post-Infusion assessments have been completed. If medically justified,
             any new medication should be delayed until after the Day 30 follow-up visit.

          -  If the participant is taking medications administered to treat the symptoms of
             depression or anxiety (such as anxiolytics or antidepressants), these must be at a
             stable dose from 30 days prior to dosing until the brexanolone infusion and
             post-infusion assessments have been completed. If medically justified, any change of
             preexisting medication should be delayed until after the Day 30 follow-up visit.

          -  Participant agrees to use a highly effective method of contraception during
             participation in the study and for 30 days following the end of the brexanolone
             infusion, unless she is surgically sterile (bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, and/or hysterectomy) or does not engage in sexual relations which carry
             a risk of pregnancy.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participant has a positive pregnancy test at screening or baseline.

          -  Participant's most recent pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage, still birth, or

             placed for adoption).

          -  Participant has evidence of any gross brain abnormality observed during the baseline
             MRI, as determined by a radiologist.

          -  Participant has clinically significant findings considered to interfere with the
             participant's ability to safely participate in the study, as determined by the
             investigator upon evaluation of medical history, electrocardiogram, hematology, and
             clinical chemistry.

          -  Participant has end stage renal disease.

          -  Participant is in hepatic failure.

          -  Participant has known allergy to progesterone or allopregnanolone.

          -  Participant has attempted suicide during the current episode of PPD.

             schizoaffective disorder.

          -  Participant has current/active alcohol or drug abuse (including benzodiazepines)
             within the 30 days prior to screening as assessed by the investigator. A positive
             urine drug screen is exclusionary unless deemed by the investigator to reflect a
             prescribed medication.

          -  Participant has been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days
             prior to screening.

          -  During the current episode of PPD, participant has participated in this study or any
             other study employing brexanolone, SAGE-217, ganaxolone, or a similar compound, or has
             received prior treatment with ZULRESSO™.

          -  Participant is investigative site personnel, sponsor personnel, or an immediate member
             of their family (spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether biological or legally
             adopted).

          -  Participant has received electroconvulsive therapy within 30 days prior to screening
             and/or plans to receive electroconvulsive therapy before the Day 30 visit.

          -  MRI is contraindicated for the participant for any reason, including but not limited
             to: cardiac pacemaker, surgical implants, previous accident resulting in metal or
             shrapnel lodged internally, tattoos inked with metallic dyes, a history of metal work
             without using protective eyewear, history of claustrophobia.
