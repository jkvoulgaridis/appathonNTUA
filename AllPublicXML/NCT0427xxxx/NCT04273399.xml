  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease increases the risk of poor musculoskeletal health, as the inflammatory
      disease process directly inhibits regulatory pathways involved in bone and muscle formation
      and maintenance. The negative effects of disease on muscle-bone health are compounded by poor
      nutritional status, vitamin d deficiency, prolonged exposure to glucocorticoid therapy, and
      reduced physical activity. Modern, steroid sparing therapies are successful at inducing
      clinical remission in terms of inflammation, however they have limited effect in remedying
      observed muscle-bone deficits. Subsequently, patients with Crohn's disease are at increased
      lifelong risk of pathological fractures and osteoporosis. Novel adjunctive therapies are
      therefore required to complement pharmacological treatments and target muscle-bone deficits,
      which are responsible for significant disease burden in Crohn's.

      High-impact exercise may be a useful additional therapy for patients with Crohn's disease, as
      the mechanical strains produced during this type of exercise, through large magnitude
      muscular contractions and ground reaction forces, can promote bone formation and gains in
      muscle mass. There have been no previous studies assessing the effects of high impact
      exercise in Crohn's disease, so it is unknown if this type of exercise is safe and feasible
      in this population. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of high-impact
      exercise for improving markers of bone and muscle health in adults with Crohn's disease, and
      compare the effects of exercise with a group of healthy age and sex matched controls.
