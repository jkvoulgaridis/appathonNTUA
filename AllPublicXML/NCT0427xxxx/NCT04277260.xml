  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the study, the composition and content of human milk oligosaccharides in premature
      delivery mothers in China will be examined to investigate the differences in oligosaccharide
      concentrations in preterm breast milk from different gestational weeks. This study will fill
      a gap in human milk research in China, provide theoretical basis for the superiority of
      breastfeeding, and provide more powerful nutritional support for the catch-up growth of
      preterm infants

      Objective:

        1. Analyze and compare the differences in HMOs components among mothers who give birth at
           different gestational weeks;

        2. Longitudinal observation of weekly changes in HMOs concentrations of premature mothers
           within 1 month of delivery;

        3. Validate the association between HMOs components in preterm mothers and fecal intestinal
           flora in infants at 6 months of age.

      Research content

        1. The LC-MS method will be used to detect the content of HMOs in preterm mothers and
           compared with the corresponding components in term breast milk during the postpartum
           period to analyze the effects of different gestational weeks on HMOs;

        2. The intestinal flora 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing method will be used to
           determine the bacterial gene profile in the fecal DNA samples of infants, and the
           differences between the gestational age groups (term and preterm infants) were compared,
           and the preterm infants in this group were plotted Evolution of intestinal flora within
           6 months of birth;

        3. Use statistical methods to verify the association between HMOs components in preterm
           mothers and the establishment of intestinal flora in infants.

    <description>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer(LC-MS) will be used to quantitatively detect a total of 15 types of neutral oligosaccharides and acid oligosaccharides in different breast milk samples.
Human milk samples will be collected four times for each mother after delivery (day7-12, day14-19, day21-26, day28-33). Only one series of samples will be collected for each mother, and 30 samples are needed for each group, totaling 480 human milk samples</description>

    <description>The results of bacterial gene profiles in fecal DNA samples of premature infants at different gestational ages will be analyzed as follows.First, bacterial genomic DNA in feces will be obtained using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit(51604), and PCR amplification will be performed. After the Miseq library are successfully constructed, cluster preparation and sequencing will be performed with qualified libraries. The data obtained by the machine will be used for biological information analysis. By comparing OTU with database, species annotation will be performed on OTU.Based on OTU and species annotation results, species complexity analysis and inter-group species difference analysis will be carried out.
Neonatal fecal samples will be collected four times for each infant after delivery at day7-12, day28-33, 3 months and 6 months of age. Only one series of samples will be collected from each infant, and 30 samples are needed for each group, totaling 480 fecal samples.</description>
