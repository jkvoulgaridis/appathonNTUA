    <textblock>
      This study is intended to test the comparative biomechanical benefits of different lower-limb
      prostheses and orthoses using data collected over extended periods of everyday life using
      wearable sensors. Investigator seek to improve physical health, functional activity level,
      independence, workforce participation, and mental health in participants with lower limb
      amputation and other lower-limb impairments. Investigator seek to study the similarities and
      differences in participants' movement using prostheses and orthoses with different
      technological features or designs. Study team also seek to develop technologies that enhance
      the methods for using wearable sensor technology to perform this type of study.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will perform testing inside the laboratory (&quot;lab testing&quot;), outside the laboratory (&quot;field testing&quot;) on the campus of University of Wisconsin, Madison, and/or extended testing in a home and community environment (&quot;take-home testing&quot;) to evaluate different aspects of device function.
Outcomes will generally be compared using a repeated-measures design, in which each participant acts as his/her own control. This design is chosen to minimize the statistical problems caused by heterogeneity in the subject population.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility (PLUS-M) is a 12 item questionnaire. It is a self-report instrument for measuring mobility of adults with lower limb amputation.
PLUS-M instruments measure prosthetic users' mobility (i.e., the ability to move intentionally and independently from one place to another). PLUS-M questions assess respondents' perceived ability to carry out actions that require use of both lower limbs, ranging from household ambulation to outdoor recreational activities. The described activities relate to two primary forms of movement, locomotion (i.e., movement in a continuous, repeatable pattern) and/or postural transitions (i.e., movement from one position to another or one type of activity to another).
PLUS-M instruments provide a T-score that ranges from 17.5 to 76.6. A higher PLUS-M T-score corresponds to greater mobility.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ground reaction force is force applied by the body to the ground. Peak forces and shape of the force vs. time trajectory are commonly used to assess gait quality. Forces closer to &quot;normal&quot; are usually considered better, but this goal does not apply in participants with amputation.</description>

    <description>Socket torque (also termed &quot;socket moment&quot;) is the amount of twisting or bending torque applied to the prosthetic socket. Peak socket torque and cumulative socket torque are measures commonly used to assess gait quality in persons with lower limb amputation.</description>
