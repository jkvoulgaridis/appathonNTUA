      The CoNoR study aims to assess whether the use of the LiMAx test and the HepaT1ca
      pre-operative planning magnetic resonance scan impact upon technical resectability
      decision-making in colorectal liver metastases (CLM).

      The CoNoR Study will occur via 4 workstreams:

        1. Systematic review of all published criteria for colorectal liver metastases (CLM)
           technical resectability (systematic review protocol published on PROSPERO database:
           https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=136748

        2. Expert interviews: Interviews with liver surgeons and radiologists to assess current
           standard practice in CLM technical resectability decision-making and role for novel
           assessment tools

        3. Online questionnaire: Online international questionnaire of liver surgeons to assess
           current standard practice in CLM technical resectability decision-making and role for
           novel assessment tools, in additional to identifying clinical scenarios in which these
           tools may be of greatest benefit

        4. Online case-based survey: Recruitment of 10-20 participants with 'difficult decisions'
           regarding technical resectability, and consent to use results from pre-operative
           assessments to create anonymised online case-based survey. Participants will consent to
           have two additional pre-operative assessments: the LiMAx tests and the HepaT1ca magnetic
           resonance scan. These results from these additional tests will also be used in the
           online survey, We will recruit international liver surgeons to complete this online
           survey, where they will be asked to provide an opinion on technical resectability for
           each individual case scenario, and to specify their operative plan, both before and
           after seeing the results of these novel assessment tools. We will assess for change in
           decision-making on resectability, and change in operative plan after seeing these test
           results. We will also assess for level of agreement between liver surgeons on each
           scenario, and identify where they difficult decisions persist.

    <description>Liver surgeons will view the standard pre-operative assessment results and decide if each case scenario is 'technically resectable.' They will then view the results from these two additional pre-operative tests (LiMAx and HepaT1ca), and decide again. We will measure for any change in decision making after viewing the novel test results.</description>

    <description>Patients with colorectal liver metastases where the decision-making on technical resectability is difficult, i.e. 'borderline resectable,' where a group of liver surgeons might reasonably be expected to find the decision whether to operate to be challenging. A group of up to 20 such patients will undergo pre-operative LiMAx test and HepaT1ca pre-operative scanning. Recruited participants' data will be used to create anonymised online case scenarios to be used in a survey, assessing whether liver surgeons find these pre-operative assessments helpful in their decision-making on technical resectability.</description>
