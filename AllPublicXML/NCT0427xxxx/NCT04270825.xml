    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a novel group treatment
      for hoarding disorder. Participants will be randomized to receive either treatment as usual
      (cognitive behavioral therapy: CBT) or treatment as usual augmented by interpersonal
      psychotherapy (IPT). It is hypothesized that group CBT with IPT will result in greater
      decreases in hoarding symptoms, as compared to standard group CBT. It is further hypothesized
      that CBT with IPT will result in greater reductions in object attachment and maladaptive
      beliefs about relationships with others, as well as greater increases in interpersonal
      attachment.

    <measure>Changes in Hoarding Rating Scale (HRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hoarding Rating Scale is a commonly used measure of hoarding symptoms in which participants rate the severity of their symptoms. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 40. Higher scores indicate more severe/worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Reciprocal Attachment Questionnaire Adapted (RAQ-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Reciprocal Attachment Questionnaire Adapted assesses attachment to one's belongings, with higher scores indicating greater attachment to possessions (i.e., worse outcome). Minimum score is 75 and maximum score is 375.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Adult Attachment Scale (AAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AAS is a measure of two dimensions proposed to underlie interpersonal attachment security: anxiety and avoidance. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 72.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The INQ is a measure of two interpersonal risk factors, namely perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, with higher scores indicating higher levels of each construct (i.e., worse outcome). Minimum score is 15 and maximum score is 105.</description>

Treatment includes strategies from CBT, including cognitive restructuring, behavioral exposures, and organizational strategies, as well as strategies from IPT, including role-play, interpersonal skills building, communication analysis, and decision analysis.</description>
