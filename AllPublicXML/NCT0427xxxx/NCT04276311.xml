  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major health problem leading to
      significant morbidity and even mortality. Patients with superficial femoral artery stenosis
      make up an important proportion of patients with PAD, and since this type of involvement was
      reported to be most commonly associated with intermittent claudication, this patient
      population has been subject to intensive research on methods to prevent disease progression
      and further complications.

      Endovascular treatment has become the first-line treatment for low-complexity femoropopliteal
      (FP) lesions classified as TASC (Trans Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus) A and B.
      Conversely, in case of more extensive lesions (TASC C), this treatment is still under debate
      because of a primary permeability that is difficult to maintain over time. Recently, studies
      have shown the interest of drug eluting technologies in the treatment of TASC A &amp; B
      femoral-popliteal lesions, by significantly improving patency rates compared to uncoated
      balloons or stents.

      In this context, the endovascular treatment of FP complex lesions (TASC C) continues to
      develop widely.

      During endovascular treatment, the quality of the artery preparation has recently been
      identified as a factor improving outcomes. The dilatation of the artery with an uncoated
      balloon or POBA (Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty) is the reference method performed before
      stent placement or drug-coated balloons. However, some new alternatives to prepare the artery
      have emerged, using no more dilatation but atherectomy (Jetstream™ system).

      Atherectomy appears to reduce the risk of dissections and bailout stenting and improve the
      acute procedural results. Its long term outcome, when associated with drug coated balloons
      (DCB), has recently been demonstrated in the USA to be superior to angioplasty in a single
      center study JET-SCE.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of atherectomy,
      using the Jetstream™ artery preparation associated to DCB treatment (Ranger™
      Paclitaxel-Coated balloon), in symptomatic patients with claudication (Rutherford 2 and 3)
      and with complex de novo FP arterial lesions (TASC C).
