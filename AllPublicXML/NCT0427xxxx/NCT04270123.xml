  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female breast cancer is still the most frequent type of cancer in Europe with 21 per 100,000
      women .The EORTC QLQ-BR23 was one of the first modules developed to be used in conjunction
      with the core questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 and was published in 1996. Since the beginning of
      the work on the EORTC QLQ-BR23 some 20 years ago, much knowledge has been gathered about the
      epidemiology of breast cancer, and major advances have been made with regard to diagnostic
      and therapeutic options. Therefore, the EORTC Quality of life group decided to update the
      BC23. A phase 1 to 3 module development project has been completed. This resulted in a 45
      item module, retaining 23 of the original items and adding 22 new items, particularly tapping
      into the side effects of new systemic and local therapies.

      The aim of the Phase 4 study is to test the scale structure, reliability, responsiveness to
      change, and validity of the EORTC QLQ-BC45 in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in patients
      diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants will be enrolled in four groups according to their
      disease stage (1. local/locally advanced disease, 2. metastatic disease, 3. follow up.
      Various combinations of therapies are permissible.

      According to sample size calculations, we will include a total of N =490 patients from 12
      countries.

      Participants will be invited to complete the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BC45, followed by the
      Debriefing Questionnaire. Data of all patients will be used to evaluate the scale structure,
      internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity. A subgroup of follow up patients
      with no evidence of disease (no change in health status) will be invited to complete the
      QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BC45 for a second time one to two weeks later for the test-retest
      analysis. A subgroup of patients from the local/ locally advanced breast cancer group (who
      have had change in disease or treatment status after the first assessment) will be invited to
      complete a second set of questionnaires for the response to change analysis. Sociodemographic
      and clinical data will be recorded using standardized case report forms (CRF).

    <description>Group 1 consists of breast cancer patients with local or locally advanced disease. All participants will complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR-45 questionnaires. A subgroup of participants within this group (those who have changed disease or treatment status) will be asked to complete the above questionnaires again, three months later (+-1 week). They will also complete an anchor question. Completing twice is for the responsiveness to change analysis.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaire has been updated with a further twenty-two items to create the EORTC QLQ-BR45. This updated questionnaire contains items to encapsulate advancements in knowledge about the epidemiology of breast cancer and side effects experienced with new treatments. This study will test the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ-BR45 as a measure of quality of life in patients with breast cancer.</description>
