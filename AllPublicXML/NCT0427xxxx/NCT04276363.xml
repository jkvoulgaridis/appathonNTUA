  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study examines the impact of ParentCorps in high-poverty district schools in New
      York City (NYC). The study is conducted within the context of the NYC Department of Education
      (DOE) Pre-K Thrive initiative. As part of this initiative, the Center for Early Childhood
      Health and Development (CEHD) at NYU Langone Health is implementing services to strengthen
      family engagement and support parents and teachers in creating safe, nurturing and
      predictable environments for young children. All parents of Pre-K students in the 81 district
      schools will be invited for them and their Pre-K children to participate in the study, which
      includes 2 school-based assessments in Pre-K over a 10-month period and 1 school-based
      assessment at the end of Kindergarten, and teacher ratings of children in Pre-K and
      Kindergarten. Additionally, parents will be invited to consent to the use of their children's
      NYC DOE administrative records from Pre-K through grade 5 for the purposes of this study.
      Parents will also be invited to participate by completing surveys with NYU study staff.
      Parents will be consented to complete two surveys when their child is in Pre-K. Parents may
      be randomly selected to complete a third survey when their child is in Kindergarten or to
      participate in a focus group with other parents.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test (ROWPVT)</measure>
    <time_frame>84 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A higher score indicates higher academic skills. The assessment will take 10-20 minutes - the assessor will state a word in English or Spanish, while the child is shown four images. The child must choose the image that represents the word the assessor said.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>84 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Children are presented with a series of cards depicting images that vary along two dimensions: color and shape. Children are first asked to sort the cards by one dimension (color). After they do this for several trials, they are then asked to sort the cards by the other dimension (shape). Scores are reported as a binary &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; - yes - child can shift to sorting by the second dimension accurately.</description>

    <measure>Score on Pencil Tap Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>84 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Children are asked to tap on a table twice with a pencil with the experimenter taps once, and once when the experimenter taps twice. Scores are reported as proportion of trials children answer correctly out of 16 (i.e. 1/16, 2/16, 3/16, etc.)</description>

    <description>Children are presented with a series of photographs of children making happy, sad, mad, scared, or ambiguous facial expressions. For each photograph, children are asked to name the emotion expressed in the face. The higher the score indicates higher ability to match emotions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Emotion Recognition Questionnaire (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>84 months</time_frame>
    <description>16 scenarios that elicit happy, sad, mad, or scared emotions are presented to children, along with black and white line drawings to aid with comprehension (e.g. Johnny's little brother broke his toy on purpose). Children are asked to name the emotion the main character would be feeling in that situation. Scores are reported as the proportion of correct matches out of 16 (i.e. 1/16, 2/16, etc.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Child body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>84 months</time_frame>
    <description>Children's height and weight will be measured in order to calculate BMI. The height will be measured using a stadiometer, and the weight will be measured using an electronic scale.</description>
