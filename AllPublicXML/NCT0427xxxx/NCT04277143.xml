  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daptomycin ，is the ﬁrst approved member of a new class of antimicrobials, the cyclic
      lipopeptides, and presents selective action against gram-positive bacteria, including
      methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains，disrupting the transfer of amino acids in the
      cell membrane, thus hindering the biosynthesis of bacterial cell cell wall peptide
      polysaccharide, changing the properties of cytoplasm membrane, can destroy bacterial cell
      membrane function in many ways, and quickly kill gram-positive bacteria. Because of its
      unique chemical structure and sterilization mechanism, bacteria rarely develop resistance to
      daptomycin. Daptomycin can be reversibility combined with human plasma protein (mainly serum
      albumin) and metabolized mainly through the kidneys.

      There is still a lot of controversy about the application of daptomycin in patients with
      severe illness. Although studies suggest that daptomycin has less damage to kidney function
      than vancomycin, the effect of daptomycin on kidney function in severely ill patients is not
      yet clear, and more clinical studies are needed to explore their relationship. In addition,
      it is not clear whether the physiological pathology of specific populations such as
      sepsis/infectious shock (acute kidney injury, AKI), chronic renal failure (chronic kidney
      disease, CKD), hypoproteinemia, and blood purification therapy affects the
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of Daptomycin.

      By exploring the application of daptomycin in patients with severe illness, this study
      explores the effects of special pathological physiological states such as sepsis/infectious
      shock and hypoproteinemia on daptomycin PK/PD, as well as the effects of different hemoglobin
      concentrations of daptomycin on the outcome of kidney function.
