    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BKR-017 on insulin resistance in type
      2 diabetes (T2D) subjects during 28 days of active test product administration.

      The study consists of a screening period followed by a 28-day treatment period. All subjects
      will receive test product.

      There are a total of 4 study visits including screening. Visit 1 is the screening visit.
      Eligible subject must have an HbA1c between 6.5 -10.5% and with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.7 (calculated
      from fasting insulin and fasting glucose). Visits 2 and 4 are overnight visits during which
      time a Mixed Meal Tolerance (MMTT) will be performed after an overnight fast. The MMTT
      requires an indwelling IV catheter so that 11 blood draws can be more comfortably be obtained
      over a period of 4 hours. At Visit 3,subjects will be evaluated and test product will be
      replenished. Routine chemistry and hematology testing are done and two time periods during
      the study and a physical exam is performed at screening
