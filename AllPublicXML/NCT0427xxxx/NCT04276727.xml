  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited who have peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy. They will be
      given a blinded treatment of gel containing either menthol (3%) or placebo to be applied for
      6 weeks, twice a day. Assessments of pain, neuropathic symptoms and impact on quality of life
      will be done at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      scans will be done at baseline and 6 weeks. Physical activity data will also be collected to
      be analysed in conjunction with pain assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern cancer treatments, while more effective at prolonging life, are associated with some
      long lasting effects, especially nerve pain. This occurs in up to 90% of patients and 50% of
      patients still experience nerve pain a year after treatment. Not only is this distressing in
      itself but the investigators now understand that this treatment-related pain is exacerbating
      other pains, making cancer pain more difficult to control. The problem with managing nerve
      pain caused by treatment is that there is no predictable and effective treatment.

      Our team has discovered that menthol cream or gel applied to the skin in the area of nerve
      pain can be effective. This trial seeks to provide better evidence of using this simple,
      cheap, non-toxic treatment. Participants will be given either menthol gel to the affected
      area or a placebo gel which smells, looks like and has the same texture as menthol but has no
      active drug. The gel will be applied twice a day for 6 weeks.

      Participants will initially be assessed for pain and its impact on function, mood and quality
      of life and will also have an fMRI scan immediately before starting menthol treatment and
      after 6 weeks of treatment. They will also have some assessments a further 6 weeks after
      treatment finishes. As part of impact on function assessment, participants will be asked to
      wear a physical activity monitor for a few days prior to each of the three main assessment
      points.

      Our group has used special scans of the brain called fMRI to help identify if a treatment has
      real potential for patients. Sometimes, in early studies of a new treatment, patients can
      believe that the treatment has a real effect, but in fact it is a placebo effect. FMRI scans
      in this study will help to identify if menthol gel is having a true pain relieving effect, by
      comparing the patient's reports of pain with their scan findings. This will be very helpful
      in aiding the decision of how the research team conduct any future larger clinical trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients have received any neurotoxic chemotherapy.

          2. Patients have experienced post treatment Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
             (CIPN) pain for a minimum of 3 months after completing chemotherapy.

          3. Patients reporting a distressing or uncomfortable neuropathic symptom (such as pain or
             tingling) with an average score in the last 24 hours of ≥5 on a scale of 0-10 with 0
             being none, according to the Numeric Rating Scale for pain.

          4. Aged 18 years or over at study entry.

          5. Patient's Oncology team agrees to their taking part in the study.

          6. Patients are able to provide written informed consent to participation in the study
             after explanation of the study protocol.

          7. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient is able to complete the various
             assessments.

          8. Neuropathy must be confined to the distal extremities (distal to elbows and/or knees).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing or history of peripheral neuropathy due to any cause other than
             chemotherapy (diabetes, alcohol, toxin, hereditary, etc.).

          2. Patients with any contraindication to the use of topical therapy or menthol.

          3. Neurological conditions which may influence findings (such as Multiple Sclerosis or
             residual signs/symptoms from a previous stroke).

          4. Skin conditions which prevent assessment of the relevant areas affected by peripheral
             neuropathy.

          5. Suffering from significant psychiatric illness, which would hinder their completion of
             the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          6. General medical condition is unstable or rapidly deteriorating, such that they are
             unlikely to be able to contribute to the study.

          7. In the opinion of the Research Team or their usual medical team, would be unable to
             complete the study protocol for any other reason.

          8. Current treatment of ≤ 30 days duration with anticonvulsants, tricyclic
             antidepressants, MAO inhibitor, or other neuropathic pain medication agents such as
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, gabapentin/pregabalin, lamotrigine or
             amifostine. (If on the same dose of any of these medications for &gt;31 days, patients
             will be asked to continue these for the duration of the study. Analgesic agents such
             as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or opioids, are allowed if on
             the same doses for &gt;31 days).

          9. Application of topical lidocaine patch/gel or capsaicin cream or patch (to the limb
             extremities) currently or within the last 30 days (as this would interfere with
             application of the menthol gel and potentially study outcome).

         10. Patients with significant pain other than CIPN (ie pain worse than the CIPN).

         11. Patients with a pain that is likely to emerge during the scan because of position.

         12. Other medical conditions, which in the opinion of the treating physician/allied health
             professional would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

         13. Contraindication to MRI: e.g. aneurysm clips, pacemaker, other metal work in body,
             claustrophobia.

         14. Participants previously randomised into this study.

         15. Participants not prepared to stop using any other physical activity meter.

         16. Co-enrolment in any other pain treatment studies.
