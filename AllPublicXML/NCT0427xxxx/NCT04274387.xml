      Background Emotional distress is known to render vicious effects both mentally and
      physiologically to human beings. Emotional regulation is therefore an important capability to
      dilute the poisonous effect of emotional distress. The cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness
      thinking are two major strategies that have been empirically tested and supported to be
      effective emotional regulation approaches. Oftentimes, entry-level practitioners of
      mindfulness get confused easily between the cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness approach to
      emotional regulation in that they look similar in some of their practice forms. However, they
      are quite different from each other in terms of their fundamental concept. Although there are
      already many studies contribute to the mechanisms underlying these two approaches
      independently, very few studies have been proposed to directly investigate the fundamental
      differences of the underlying neural mechanisms between the two approaches. The current
      proposal therefore aims to compare the underlying neural mechanisms between the cognitive
      reappraisal and the mindfulness approaches within the context of emotional processing.

      Objectives We propose herein a 2-year research project to address the following two
      hypotheses: (1) we hypothesize that the differences in terms of neural activation patterns
      between the mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal responses toward positive or negative
      stimuli in the emotion regulation task (ERT) will appear only after certain amount of MBSR
      training and (2) we hypothesize that the 10-week Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
      training will be accompanied by the increased resting-state functional connectivity between
      the salience network (involved in the process of meta-awareness) and both the dorsal
      attention network (i.e., attention to the outside world) and the default mode network (i.e.,
      attention to the internal state).

      Methods For the current proposal, we will use a pre-post-test plus longitudinal follow-up
      design research design. Based on the power analysis, we expect to recruit 45 adults
      (convenient sampling). We will collect neuropsychological, EEG and fMRI data from each
      participants at three time points with one time point before the MBSR training course
      (pre-test), one time point immediately after completing the MBSR training course (post-test)
      and one time point 8 months after completing the MBSR training course (8-month follow-up).
      For the neuropsychological measures, we will use the MAAS for evaluating trait mindfulness,
      DERS for evaluating emotional regulation and dysregulationand IRI for evaluating cognitive
      and emotional empathy level. For the fMRI measures, we will analyze the functional activation
      patterns between the cognitive reappraisal and the mindfulness process of emotion regulation.
      Furthermore, we will analyze the functional connectivity based on the resting-state fMRI data
      to investigate the change of pre- and post-MBSR training. For EEG measures, we will further
      analyze the different time-frequency patterns between these two types of emotional
      regulation.

      Anticipated results We expect that the results will help unravel the functional changes of
      neuronal circuits associated with the transition from habitual cognitive reappraisal strategy
      to a mindfulness strategy, after an intensive mindfulness-based training. We hope that the
      overall outcomes from the current proposal will help enrich our knowledge that will enhances
      the translation of applying cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness based approaches in
      clinical psychiatry.
