    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled and non-inferiority trial in comparison of the novel
      three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion targeted biopsy between the
      software-based fusion targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer
      in men without a prior biopsy.

      This trial is a prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled, and non-inferiority study
      in which all men suspicious to have clinically significant prostate cancer. This study aims
      to determine whether a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion targeted
      biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion targeted biopsy in the detection rate of
      clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy.
