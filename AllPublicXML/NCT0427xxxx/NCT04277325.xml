  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      70 couples (married or cohabiting) will be recruited across 5 countries (12-18 in each
      country: Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala, México, and Spain). After their entry into the
      study is confirmed, couples will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: intervention
      or control (no intervention). In each country, both groups will have equal number of couples.

      Couples in the intervention group will receive 20 sessions of Emotionally Focused couple
      Therapy (EFT). Couples in the control group will receive no intervention during the study
      period (they will receive a shorter intervention after the trial is over). Participants of
      both groups will fill questionnaires before allocation, during the intervention period and
      after the intervention period.

      The main outcomes will be couple attachment, couple satisfaction and dyadic adjustment.

      The study will start in February 2020 for Argentina and Guatemala, and in September 2020 for
      Costa Rica, México, and Spain. The study period for each couple will be around 6 months.

      A detailed description about the procedure of this clinical trial will be available on an
      open access study protocol document or paper upon request.

      Some more details about therapists, supervision during treatment phase, implementation
      checking and research team, is offered below.

      Participating therapists were chosen based on a rigorous criterion focused on excellence in
      the adherence to the EFT model. There therapists also had to meet the following
      prerequisites: (1) Meet all legal requirements necessary to practice therapy in the country
      and region in which the therapist is located (licensure, insurance, etc.); (2) Have a video
      recording device; (3) Have completed the Externship, Core Skills and at least 10 hours of EFT
      supervision by the 1st of June, 2019; (4) Have experience applying the EFT model in couples
      therapy; and (5) be a licensed therapist or actively participating in case supervision.
      Additionally, candidates for participating therapists must send a video of at least 20
      minutes of a session of actual couples therapy recorded in the last three months, to the
      principal investigator (MR-G) with their application. The couple in the recording was asked
      for their consent to have this video be reviewed by two supervisors who are participating in
      the study. Each video was shared through a secure channel with Martiño Rodríguez, who then
      sent said video to two EFT certified therapists and/or supervisors from a list of six
      therapists provided by Samuel Jinich, PhD and Certified EFT Trainer. Each evaluator submitted
      their evaluation independently to the principle investigator. In the event that a discrepancy
      arose, a third evaluation was sought from a separate evaluator. In some cases, a second video
      was requested to resolve doubts regarding a candidate's suitability. A total of 26 therapists
      sent in an application to participate, of those 11 applications were considered insufficient,
      and 15 met the requirements of the evaluation. This application and evaluation process took
      place between January and September, 2019.

      All sessions will be videotaped and/or audio-taped for supervision and research purposes.

      Supervision of the therapy process will be offered biweekly, in an individual meeting (one
      therapist, one supervisor) of one hour. Participating supervisors are required to speak
      Spanish and to certified as a supervisor by the International Center for Excellence in
      Emotionally Focused Therapy; Ottawa, Canada (ICEEFT), or to be certified by ICEEFT as a
      therapist and actively be in the process of becoming an ICEEFT certified supervisor.

      In order to ensure the therapists in this study are implementing EFT faithfully, two
      different procedures will be carried out. First, during the supervision meetings with
      participating therapists, the supervisor will review video recording segments of therapy to
      determine if EFT is being conducted with adherence to the model. Second, once the study ends,
      two independent raters will be asked to rate at least 5 sessions of each therapist's taped
      sessions to ensure that at least 80% of the therapists' interventions can be coded as
      adherent to the model.

    <measure>Change in Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS-32 and DAS-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS; Spanier, 1976) is a 32- item measure which measures romantic relationship adjustment. Partners are asked to rate the occurrence of both relationship disagreements and positive relationship exchanges on a Likert scale from 1-5 or 1-6. Higher scores on this measure are indicative of better relationship adjustment or higher relationship satisfaction. A short version of the DAS called the DAS-4 (Sabourin, Valois, &amp; Lussier, 2005), composed of 4 items, will also be used. The DAS-4 measure was chosen to decrease the time spent by couples completing questionnaires coinciding with their therapy sessions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Couple Satisfaction Inventory (CSI-16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CSI-16 (Funk &amp; Rogge, 2007) is a 16-item measure of relationship satisfaction. One global item uses a 7-point scale, whereas the other 15 items use a variety of response anchors, all with 6-point scales. The CSI represents the only measure of relationship satisfaction described here which was developed using item response theory. Higher scores indicate higher levels of relationship satisfaction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure contains 36 items and yields continuous scores on two attachment domains: attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. The data collected through the ECR would contribute to this study as it would allow researchers to analyze the effect of EFT therapy on the attachment styles of clients living in Spanish speaking countries.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Health Questions (Health-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In this measure, respondents are asked to rate their health. Higher scores on this measure represent better health. Participants respond to these questions about general health based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). As there are many established connections between mental health and physical health, these variables are of interest in this study so as to control for the effects of physical health or physical ailments on participant outcomes as well as an analysis of the positive effects of relationship quality increases on physical health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ - 15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-15 is a somatic symptom subscale which stems from the original full PHQ. The PHQ has 13 somatic and 2 psychological (fatigue, sleep problems) symptoms questions. Each item is scored from 0 (not bothered at all) to 2 (bothered a lot). Items consist of symptoms such as &quot;stomach pain&quot; and &quot;headaches&quot; (Kroenke, Spitzer &amp; Williams, 2002).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS 21 consists of 21 negative emotional symptoms statements/questions. Respondents rate to what extent over the past week they have experienced each symptom on a 4-point scale of severity or frequency. The DASS 21 has a depression, anxiety and stress subscale. Items on the depression subscale consist of statements like &quot;I felt that life was meaningless.&quot; and &quot;I felt down-hearted and blue.&quot; Items on the stress subscale consist of statements like &quot;I felt I was rather touchy.&quot; and &quot;I found it difficult to relax.&quot; Items on the anxiety subscale consist of statements like &quot;I felt I was close to panic.&quot; and &quot;I felt scared without any good reason.&quot; (Antony, Bieling, Cox, Enns, &amp; Swinson, 1998).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sexual dissatisfaction subscale of Marital Satisfaction Inventory (SD-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Marital Satisfaction inventory has 150 items which measure the type and severity of relationship distress in multiple areas of marital interaction including aggression, finances, role orientation, leisure time spent together etc. Respondents choose between a true and false response to each item. The Sexual dissatisfaction (SD-13) subscale assesses the level of dissatisfaction through statements regarding the frequency and quality of the couple's sexual activity. Items consist of statements such as &quot;My spouse sometimes shows too little enthusiasm for sex.&quot; and &quot;My spouse has too little regard sometimes for my sexual satisfaction.&quot; (Snyder, 1979).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in UCLA Loneliness Scale Revised - Short version (UCLA LS-R-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The revised UCLA loneliness scale (UCLA LS-R) is a 8-item questionnaire designed to measure and detect variations in loneliness. Each item is ranked on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Often&quot;. Items consists of statements like &quot;I feel isolated from others&quot; and &quot;I lack companionship&quot; (Hays &amp; DiMatteo, 1987). As loneliness can be an indicator of relationship satisfaction and/or relationship quality, data collected through this questionnaire would allow researchers to assess for an additional element of relationship satisfaction and the impact EFT has on relationship satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Reflective functioning questionnaire (RFQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RFQ seeks to measure the capacity one has to understand one's own and other's feelings, goals and attitudes. It has an uncertainty subscale and a certainty subscale. This short version of the RFQ contains 8 items which are scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Items consist of statements such as &quot;People's thoughts are a mystery to me&quot; and &quot;I always know what I feel.&quot; This scale would provide data allowing researchers to control for individual's capacity for understanding their partner and how EFT might affect said capacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Authoritative Parenting subscale (RELATE)-(AP-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Authoritative Parenting subscale comes from the Parenting Style and Dimensions Questionnaire Short form (PSDQ). The PSDQ is used to measure parenting styles. The authoritative parenting subscale from the short version of the PSDQ is composed of 15 items. (Olivari, Tagliabue, &amp; Confalonieri, 2013; Oliveira et al., 2018). Items include phrases such as &quot;I am responsive to our child's feelings or needs.&quot; and &quot;I allow our child to give input into family rules.&quot; Responses are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Always&quot; (Oliveira et al., 2018).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep quality (Sleep-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS sleep disturbance short form (Sleep-8) questionnaire has 8 items. Respondents are asked to assess their sleep quality over the past 7 days by responding to statements like &quot;I had trouble sleeping.&quot; and &quot;My sleep was refreshing.&quot; Responses are scored on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Very Much.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Brief Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Engagement Scale (BARE-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BARE is an instrument which measures an individual's perception of their own and their partners attachment behaviors. It measures attachment behaviors (and has 3 subscales) through assessing accessibility, responsiveness and engagement, all of which are related to secure attachment. The scale has 12 items, measuring 6 subscales (accessibility, responsiveness and engagement for both self and partner). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Never True&quot; to &quot;Always True.&quot; Items consist of statements such as &quot;I am rarely available to my partner.&quot; and &quot;I am confident my partner reaches out to me.&quot; (Sandberg, Busby, Johnson, &amp; Yoshida, 2012).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CORE Outcome Measure short form (CORE-OM-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a client self-report questionnaire designed to be administered before and after therapy. The questionnaire is repeated after the last session of treatment; comparison of the pre-and post-therapy scores offers a measure of 'outcome' (i.e. whether or not the client's level of distress has changed, and by how much). The CORE-10 is a brief outcome measure comprising 10 items drawn from the CORE-OM which is a 34-item assessment and outcome measure. The CORE-OM has been widely adopted in the evaluation of counseling and the psychological therapies in the UK. The CORE-10 taps global distress and is, therefore, suitable for use as an initial quick screening tool and also as an outcome measure.</description>
