  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main causes of acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) or chronic pancreatitis (CP) in
      children are defects in genes that have been associated to pancreatitis. Among these gene
      defects CFTR gene mutations are commonly found, 34% ARP and 23% CP . Since not every CFTR
      gene mutations clinically manifest, just identifying these CFTR gene mutations may not help
      to establish a clear role of this defect in the etiology of the individual ARP/CP. The novel
      beta-adrenergic sweat secretion test is a very sensitive test to detect small abnormalities
      in CFTR function in form of a linear gene-function relation. By identifying even mild CFTR
      defects, in future will help in finding the role of CFTR modulators and providing treatment
      to these patients.

    <description>All patients consented to study will undergo study intervention which is Beta-adrenergic sweat test (Beta sweat test) using evaporimeter. It takes about 60 minutes to complete this test. Once this test is completed, patient will be considered to have completed the study.</description>

    <description>In Beta Sweat Test - sweat secretion will be stimulated by injecting a series of drugs within the skin surface. Small needles will be used to inject minute amounts of each drug. Before and after each skin injection, the skin will be cleaned using an alcohol swab.
Two sensor probes will be strapped to the forearm with rubber bands in position just above the injection site.
Under the first probe, injection atropine will be given in one small area of the skin.
Under the second probe, first injection carbachol will be given in one small area of the skin.
Next, at the second probe area, the normal sweating will be stopped for awhile by injecting a drug called atropine.
Lastly, beta-adrenergic sweating will be stimulated by injecting a combination of the following drugs: atropine, isoproterenol, and aminophylline (Î²-cocktail). Using probes, all sweat rate readings will be recorded.</description>
