  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab have been recently
      approved for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer (HNSCC). However,
      only a minority of patients respond to therapy. From the clinical point of view the optimal
      management of patients progressing on or after CPI therapy is still a challenge.
      Retrospective analysis showed that HNSCC patients, who progressed on/after CPI, demonstrated
      an overall response rate (ORR) of up to 30% subsequent to chemotherapy +/- cetuximab
      treatment. It is the aim of this study to evaluate if paclitaxel plus cetuximab after first
      line pembrolizumab failure is an effective salvage therapy in 50 R/M HNSCC patients. The
      primary endpoint is ORR according to RECIST V 1.1.
