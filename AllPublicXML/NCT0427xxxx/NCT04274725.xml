      Men aged over 18 having a first or second diagnostic prostate biopsy at the Royal Marsden NHS
      Foundation Trust or Epsom General Hospital will be approached by their Urology team or study
      Researcher with an information sheet about the study pre or post biopsy. The participant
      information sheet outlines that the study will involve being interviewed by the researcher,
      Kathryn Myhill as part of her doctoral research and being asked about their perceptions of
      their biopsy experience and what it was like to go through it. Men who return an expression
      of interest reply slip by post will be contacted by the researcher or they can contact her
      directly via the email or phone details given in the PIS. The researcher will answer any
      queries about the study and explore whether they would like to take part in an interview. A
      one to one interview will then be offered in a non-clinical, private room at the hospital
      where their biopsy took place (Royal Marsden Hospital, Epsom General Hospital) or at their
      workplace or home.
