    <textblock>
      The central goal of this application is to demonstrate the causal contribution of reward
      learning signals (expected values and reward prediction errors [RPE]) to antidepressant
      responses (Aim1) by experimentally manipulating expected values using transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) targeting the vmPFC (Aim 2) and μ-opioid striatal RPE signal using
      pharmacological approaches (Aim 3).

      The central goal of this study is to demonstrate the causal contribution of reward learning
      signals (expected values and RPEs) to antidepressant responses (Aim1) by experimentally
      manipulating expected values using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the
      vmPFC (Aim 2) and μ-opioid striatal RPE signal using pharmacological approaches (Aim 3). In a
      3x3 factorial double-blind trial, the investigators will randomize 120 unmedicated major
      depressive disorder (MDD) adults (18-55 years) to one of three between-subject opioid
      conditions: the μ-opioid agonist buprenorphine (n=40), the μ-opioid antagonist naltrexone
      (n=40), or the inert pill (n=40). Within each arm, individuals will be assigned to receive
      three within-subject counterbalanced sessions of TMS targeting the vmPFC—intermittent TBS
      (iTBS) expected to potentiate the vmPFC, continuous TBS (cTBS) expected to de-potentiate the
      vmPFC, and sham TBS (sTBS). These experimental manipulations will be used to modulate
      trial-by-trial reward learning signals and related brain activity during the Antidepressant
      fMRI Task. Understanding the mechanisms underlying antidepressant responses is essential to
      identify novel therapeutic targets for depression.

Each block of iTBS will consist of 20 trains, each lasting 2s with intertrain intervals of 8s, for a total of 192s. Each block of cTBS will consist of one continuous train of 40s. The sTBS will make use of two surface electrodes placed on the scalp.</description>

The investigators will use the Validation and Upload Tool for CSV files from behavior during the fMRI experiment, and NIfTI-formatted images for imaging. The investigators will upload study data cumulatively every 6 months per NDA guidelines, with the exception of imaging data, which are will be uploaded in installments.
The final research data will not contain any identifiable information and will be deposited in the Research Domain Criteria Database (RDoCdb) repository in the NDA prior to the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset.
