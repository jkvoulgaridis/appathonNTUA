  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative pain after endodontic instrumentation
      using rotation, reciprocation and adaptive motion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post operative pain assessment is done at the end of the session Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      questionnaires were handed out to the patients and they were asked to assign a number
      correlating to their post-treatment pain, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the
      most severe pain imaginable.These scores were marked in intervals of 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h
      following endodontic treatment.
