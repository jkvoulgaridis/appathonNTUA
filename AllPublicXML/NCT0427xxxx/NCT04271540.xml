  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if the drug called Tildrakizumab
      (also known as ILUMYA) can help improve the blood flow to the heart in people with psoriasis.
      The investigators think this is because ILUMYA reduces the inflammation in the heart
      arteries.

      ILUMYA is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of psoriasis.

      This research study will compare the blood flow to the heart before starting ILUMYA and after
      24 weeks of taking the drug. ILUMYA is given as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous
      injection) in areas of the body such as your thighs, stomach area (abdomen), or upper arm.

      The gold standard for measuring blood flow to the heart with imaging is known as Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET). A PET scan is a test that uses a radioactive tracer (dye) called
      N13 Ammonia. PET scans allow doctors to see the blood flow to the muscle of the heart. It
      also lets the investigators calculate the blood flow using a measure called Coronary Flow
      Reserve (CFR). CFR adds information to help doctors diagnose heart disease. The use of N13
      for PET scans is FDA-approved and these scans are routinely performed at Brigham and Women's
      Hospital.
