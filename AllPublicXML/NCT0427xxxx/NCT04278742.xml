  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional directive style of requesting or demanding compliance to set behavior is found to
      have little effect on patient's self-care behavior. It is reported that patients prefer to
      restate or rephrase their understanding in a care setting, instead of a directive/didactic
      approach where the clinician provides 'one-way' information. In fact, directive persuasion is
      thought to lead to resistance to change and is counter-effective.

      New approaches such as open ended communication, interview style and collaborative approach
      is found to engage patients better in their own care and elicit patient's own intrinsic
      motivations for making changes. One way to do this is to

        1. invite patient to share their thoughts or concerns then

        2. clarify patient's understanding

      From their responses:

      (3a) affirm patient's correct understanding or (3b) address misconceptions with permission.

      In this study, the investigators will randomize 240 subjects into two groups: Group A will
      undergo the above describe collaborative approach to patient education and counselling; Group
      B will undergo current (traditional, didactic approach) patient education. It is hypothesized
      that the collaborative approach group (Group A) should experience better understand of their
      health condition and foot ulcer, be better able to adhere to treatment plan through
      collaborative participation and overall be more satisfied with the treatment. Outcomes will
      be tracked at (i) post intervention and (ii) 4 months post intervention.
