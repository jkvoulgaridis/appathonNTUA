        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand the requirements of the trial and provide written informed
             consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of research related health
             information), willing and able to comply with the trial protocol procedures (including
             attending the required trial visits).

          -  Male/female aged ≥18 years at the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of ITP made at least 3 months before randomization and based on
             the American Society of Hematology Criteria, and without a known etiology for
             thrombocytopenia.

          -  Diagnosis supported by a response to a prior ITP therapy (other than TPO RAs), in the
             opinion of the investigator.

          -  Mean platelet count of &lt;30×10^9/L from 2 counts during the screening period including
             the predose count at visit 1. Additionally, a documented history of a platelet count
             of &lt;30×109/L prior to screening.

          -  At the start of the trial, the patient either takes concurrent ITP treatment(s) and
             has received at least 1 prior therapy for ITP in the past, or the patient does not
             take treatment for ITP but has received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. Patients
             receiving permitted concurrent ITP treatment(s) at baseline, must have been stable in
             dose and frequency for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Permitted concurrent
             ITP medications include oral corticosteroids, oral immunosuppressants,
             dapsone/danazol, fostamatinib, and/or oral TPO-RAs. Patients not receiving concurrent
             ITP therapy are also eligible for the trial if they have not received prior ITP
             therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline, and 6 months in case of prior ITP
             therapy with an anti-CD20 therapy (eg, rituximab).

          -  Women of childbearing potential: Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline
             before trial medication can be administered. Women must be on a stable regimen for at
             least 1 month of at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (ie, failure rate
             of less than 1% per year) during the trial and for 90 days after the last
             administration of the IMP.

          -  Non-sterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use effective contraception from signing the ICF through
             90 days after the last administration of the IMP. Male patients practicing true sexual
             abstinence (as consistent with preferred and usual lifestyle) can be included.
             Sterilized male patients who have had a vasectomy and with documented absence of sperm
             postprocedure can be included. Male patients are not allowed to donate sperm from
             signing the ICF through 90 days after the last dose of the IMP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ITP/thrombocytopenia associated with another condition, eg, lymphoma, chronic
             lymphocytic leukemia, viral infection, hepatitis, induced or alloimmune
             thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia associated with myeloid dysplasia.

          -  Use of anticoagulants (eg, vitamin K antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants) within 4
             weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Use of any transfusions within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Use of Ig (IV, subcutaneous, or intramuscular route) or plasmapheresis (PLEX), 4 weeks
             prior to randomization.

          -  Use of romiplostim within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Undergone splenectomy less than 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Use of an investigational product within 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) before the first dose of the IMP.

          -  Use of any monoclonal antibody within the 6 months before the first dose of the IMP.

          -  At the screening visit, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as below:
             Hemoglobin ≤9 g/dL - OR - International normalized ratio &gt;1.5 or activated partial

             infection at screening.

          -  Any other known autoimmune disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with an accurate assessment of clinical symptoms of ITP or put the patient
             at undue risk.

          -  Current or history of (ie, within 12 months of screening) alcohol, drugs, or
