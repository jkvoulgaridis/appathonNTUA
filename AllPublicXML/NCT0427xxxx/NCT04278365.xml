  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot study examining the feasibility and potential utility of
      administering a psychosocial intervention termed Affective Modulation of Positivity (AMP) for
      individuals suffering from co-morbid depression or anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder
      (AMP-A). The aims of this study are to (1) determine the feasibility and potential utility of
      administering AMP-A with individuals suffering from alcohol use disorders, (2) explore the
      potential impact of training on positive and negative affect, symptom severity, and
      functional disability, and (3) explore the potential impact of training on neural reactivity
      to reward and alcohol cues during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      This study is a non-randomized, single-arm, single-site clinical trial conducted at Laureate
      Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) in Tulsa, OK. The primary objective for this study is to
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting positive affect training with
      individuals suffering from substance use disorder. Primary outcome will include treatment
      completion rate; secondary outcome will include the score on a participant feedback
      questionnaire. The investigators hypothesize that the majority of participants (&gt;60%) will
      complete all 11 sessions of the intervention and that participant feedback concerning the
      intervention will be at least moderately favorable on average.The secondary objective(s) is
      to explore the potential impact of training on positive and negative affect, symptom
      severity, and functional disability. The investigators hypothesize that positive affect will
      significantly increase from baseline to post-intervention, while negative affect,
      alcohol-related craving, and functional disability will significantly decrease. A tertiary
      objective is to explore the potential impact of training on behavioral and neural responses
      involving the processing of positively valenced or alcohol-related cues. The investigators
      hypothesize that activation with striatal and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regions to
      alcohol-UNrelated reward cues will increase from baseline to post-intervention, while
      striatal and OFC response to alcohol-related cues will decrease from baseline to
      post-intervention.

      Participants will be asked to complete interview and pencil-and-paper questionnaires related
      to clinical symptoms, traits and personality characteristics, daily life function, and
      medical and mental health history at both pre- and post-intervention. Participants will also
      be asked to complete brief follow-up survey sessions 3 months after completing treatment. If
      there are participants who are only able to complete part of the intervention (i.e., only
      able to attend a few of the sessions) either due to their own wish to terminate or due to
      exclusion criteria or clinical concerns, they will only be asked to complete survey sessions
      for weeks that they attend. Neuroimaging procedures will be conducted at both pre- and
      post-intervention. Each neuroimaging session will last approximately 1.5-2.5 hours and will
      involve completion of self-report measures regarding current affective state and sleepiness
      and a functional MRI session during which participants will complete tasks related to reward
      processing and alcohol cue reactivity.

      Following completion of baseline assessments, participants will be asked to complete 11
      sessions of the positive affect intervention, conducted once or twice weekly and with each
      session lasting 1 - 1.5 hours. If the content of sessions is too much to cover for any one
      client, the intervention may be extended to 13 sessions as needed. Participants will be
      expected to complete all intervention sessions within 16 weeks of starting the first session.
      Each session will be completed as individual therapy sessions (i.e., one-on-one with a
      therapist). The positive affect intervention will involving positive emotion enhancement
      exercises established in prior studies, including noticing and amplifying positive emotions,
      practicing gratitude, engaging in acts of kindness, and pleasurable or meaningful activities,
      identifying strengths and values, being optimistic, engaging in activities meant to make
      others happy, and living life to its fullest. The investigators will use the protocol
      developed by Taylor et al. with modifications to specifically address alcohol use, based on
      previous work. The general structure of each session will follow standard cognitive
      behavioral treatment regimens as follows: (1) meet with clinician to review completion of the
      prior week's exercises, including self-monitoring forms of emotions and exercise completion;
      (2) identify and troubleshoot any issues that arose during exercise completion; (3) introduce
      material about a new positive emotion enhancement activity; (4) identify concrete exercises
      to implement for the upcoming week.

             the written materials included in the Positive Affect Training.

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          1. Unwillingness or inability to complete any of the major aspects of the study protocol,
             including self-report or behavioral assessment. However, failing to complete some
             individual aspects of these assessment sessions will be acceptable (i.e., being
             unwilling to answer individual items on some questionnaires or being unwilling to
             complete a behavioral task).

          2. Non-correctable vision or hearing problems.

          3. No telephone or easy access to telephone.

          4. Diagnosis of Schizophrenia spectrum, other psychotic disorders, or bipolar I disorder.

          5. Active suicidal ideation with plan and intent to attempt suicide within the next
             month.

          6. Has a history of unstable liver or renal insufficiency; glaucoma; significant and
             unstable cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic,
             hematologic, rheumatologic, or metabolic disturbance; or any other condition that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would make participation not be in the best interest
             (e.g., compromise the well-being) of the subject or that could prevent, limit, or
             confound the protocol-specified assessments.

          7. A positive test for drugs of abuse, including alcohol (breath test), cocaine,
             marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, methamphetamines, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines,
             barbiturates, methadone, and oxycodone at the time of baseline assessments.
             Participants will be asked to refrain from using alcohol within 24 hours prior to
             assessment sessions and to refrain from using marijuana within 48 hours of assessment
             sessions.

          8. Current use of a medication or change in the dose or prescription of a medication
             within the 6 weeks prior to enrolling in the study that could potentially affect brain
             functioning (e.g., stimulants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers,
             anti-hypertensives). The current use of antidepressants (i.e., SSRIs) will not be
             excluded as long as the dose has remained consistent for 6 weeks prior to baseline
             assessment sessions. While individuals reporting use of benzodiazepines will be
             excluded; individuals with sporadic use (i.e., less than once per week) may be
             included, but will be asked to refrain from using within 72 hours prior to assessment
             sessions. Inclusion of individuals reporting other types of medications or supplements
             not listed or considered this far will be at the discretion of the PI according to
             evidence in the literature of it affecting brain function or brain blood flow.

          9. Taking drugs that affect the fMRI hemodynamic response (e.g., methylphenidate,
             acetazolamide, and excessive caffeine intake &gt; 1000 mg/day).

         10. Concurrent engagement in psychosocial treatments that specifically target alcohol use
             disorder or mood/anxiety symptoms and began within 12 weeks of baseline assessments.
             Individuals concurrently receiving psychosocial treatments for other symptoms, or that
             are not specifically targeting symptoms (e.g., ongoing support groups) will not be
             excluded as long as the dose of treatment (i.e., frequency of sessions) has not
             changed significantly within 6 weeks prior to enrolling in the study.

             (shrapnel), aortic/aneurysm clips, prosthesis, by-pass surgery/coronary artery clips,
             hearing aid, heart valve replacement, shunt (ventricular or spinal), electrodes, metal
             plates/pins/screws/wires, or neuro/bio-stimulators (TENS unit), persons who have ever
             been a professional metal worker/welder, history of eye surgery/eyes washed out
             because of metal, vision problems uncorrectable with lenses, inability to lie still on
             one's back for 60-120 minutes; prior neurosurgery; tattoos or cosmetic makeup with
             metal dyes, unwillingness to remove body piercings, and pregnancy.

         12. Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (&gt;30 min. loss of consciousness or &gt;24 hours
             posttraumatic amnesia) or other neurocognitive disorder with evidence of neurological
             deficits, neurological disorders, or severe or unstable medical conditions that might
             be compromised by participation in the study (to be determined by primary care
             provider).

         13. Severity of alcohol use disorder requiring more intensive treatment (i.e., intensive
             outpatient or residential), as determined by baseline assessments conducted by
             licensed clinicians.
