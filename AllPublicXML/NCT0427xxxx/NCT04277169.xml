      This is a single-centre, prospective, non-randomised volunteer study to be undertaken in the
      MediCentre, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, prospective study involving at least 120
      participants. The data collected in this study will augment the data collected in
      IU2019_AG_03 Volunteers will be enrolled sequentially until at least 120 scans have been
      recorded. Ideally, between 120 and 150 scans will be recorded.

      Phase I Data collected from up to the first 80 participants in each of the six peripheral
      nerve block areas will be used as a training/verification set. This set will be used to
      develop and verify models for the identification and highlighting of target anatomical
      structures on ultrasound images.

      Phase II The remaining 40 videos in each area (total minimum 120 participants) will be used
      for validation of these models.

      The validation videos will be fed into the models created during Phase I of the study and the
      output anatomy highlighting will be recorded as a separate video, overlaid on the original
      ultrasound image. The overlay video will then be further split into 30-second segments.

      A panel of three independent expert anaesthetists will be convened to review and score the
      segments for accuracy and performance to the endpoints agreed in Phase I of the study.
