  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two study periods for the TCU JCOIN project. The primary aims of Study 1 (approved
      by the TCU IRB) are (1) to gather information from staff on the current treatment referral
      process within participating communities and (2) to learn about the existing
      interrelationships between medical and community behavioral health (CBH) providers. TCU IRB
      granted approval for Phase 1 on 11/07/19, approval number: 1920-60-AM1. Study 2 (under
      current review by the TCU IRB) includes recruitment across 18 community collaboration sites
      across 3 states; these communities will participate in the TCU Opioid-Treatment Linkage Model
      (O-TLM) protocol. The O-TLM is focused on best practices for improving screening, identifying
      and linking to MOUD providers, reducing stigma, and addressing other important factors that
      impact justice-involved individuals returning to their communities. Along with their agency
      records, information collected from justice-involved individuals within the target
      communities will be examined to assess O-TLM impact on improving public health and public
      safety outcomes. Furthermore, stakeholder staff across community organizations, including
      criminal justice and treatment agencies, will be asked to complete surveys on the O-TLM
      regarding its acceptability and adoption, as well as on best training strategies.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Horizontal implementation approach of the O-TLM intervention is accompanied by facilitated collaboration between Criminal Justice and Community Behavioral Health systems. Direct involvement of stakeholders with differing perspectives and buy-in from agency leadership and policymakers are key elements. The Horizontal approach involves first developing a prototype (including how to modify existing practices, overcome implementation barriers, and manage roles and responsibilities) that are tested and refined before being rolled out systematically to other units within an agency.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Vertical implementation approach</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Vertical implementation approach of the O-TLM intervention relies on the traditional criminal justice system's typical use of a hierarchical structure and the use of a top-down implementation approach (i.e., administrative orders) for directing change. Top-down regulatory and policy changes are viewed as vital levers for driving system change.</description>
