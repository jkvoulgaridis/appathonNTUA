  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the patient's baseline QoL prior to HFCWO use against the
      patient's QoL at various study timepoints over a one-year period of HFCWO use.

      This study will use a prospective interventional comparative study design using the patient's
      quality of life (QoL) as the primary study endpoint to determine HFCWO affect. The study will
      compare the patient's QoL baseline (established at enrollment prior to HFCWO treatment) to
      the QoL measured at various timepoints (enrollment, 2 months, 6 months and 12 months) over a
      one-year period whilst receiving HFCWO treatment. In addition, a baseline for the secondary
      endpoints will established at enrollment for comparison to measurements taken at various
      timepoints over a one-year period whilst receiving HFCWO treatment. The patient's medical
      records will be used to establish prior histories of exacerbation rates for comparison to
      exacerbation rates experienced after one year of HFCWO treatment. Patients will serve as
      their own control.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the subject's quality of life (QoL) using the Quality of Life-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) questionnaire as the measurement tool. QoL measured at enrollment (baseline) will be compared to QoL measured at 2 months, 6 months and 1 year.
The previously validated questionnaire is titled &quot;Quality of Life Questionnaire - Bronchiectasis&quot;. The Likert style questionnaire asks the subject to subjectively rank their symptoms using a 4 scale base ranging from &quot;a lot of difficulty&quot; to &quot;no difficulty&quot; and &quot;always&quot; to &quot;never&quot;.</description>

Exacerbation frequency
The time to the subject's next exacerbation will be recorded for comparison pre to post HFCWO
Lung function (FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75) measured by standard spirometry
Sputum production measured by using the Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS) questionnaire
