  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at six
      clinical sites in North America. Patients with a hearing loss and that are already planned
      for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin) bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will
      be included in the study. The total number of participants included in the study will be 64.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after
      implantation of the Ponto Implant system using the surgical technique Minimally Invasive
      Ponto Surgery (MIPS).

      This prospective, multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at six
      clinical sites in North America. Patients with a hearing loss and that are already planned
      for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin) bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will
      be included in the study. The total number of participants included in the study will be 64.
      Patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion will not be replaced.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after
      implantation of the Ponto Implant system using the surgical technique Minimally Invasive
      Ponto Surgery (MIPS). The implant, coupled to a skin-penetrating abutment, is implanted in
      the bone behind the ear and is later loaded with a sound processor which transforms sound
      waves to sound vibrations that can be sent directly to the inner ear via the skull bone. The
      primary objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of implant/abutment
      complexes providing a reliable anchorage for a sound processor, 3 months after
      implantation/surgery.
