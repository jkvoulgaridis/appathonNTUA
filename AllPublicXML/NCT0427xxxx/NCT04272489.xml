  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many different factors can degrade the performance of an upper limb prosthesis users control
      with electromyographic (EMG)-based pattern recognition control. Conventional control systems
      require frequent recalibration in order to achieve consistent performance which can lead to
      prosthetic users choosing to wear their device less. This study investigates a new adaptive
      pattern recognition control algorithm that retrains, rather than overwrite, the existing
      control system each instance users recalibrate. The study hypothesis is that such adaptive
      control system will lead to more satisfactory prosthesis control thus reducing the need for
      recalibration and increasing how often users wear their device. Participants will wear their
      prosthesis as they would normally at-home using each control system (adaptive and
      non-adaptive) for an 8-week period with an intermittent 1-week washout period (17 weeks
      total). Prosthetic usage will be monitored during each period in order to compare user wear
      time and recalibration frequency when using adaptive or non-adaptive control. Participants
      will also play a set of virtual games on a computer at the start (0-months), mid-point
      (1-months) and end (2-months) of each period that will test their ability to control
      prosthesis movement using each control system. Changes in user performance will be evaluated
      during each period and compared between the two control systems. This study will not only
      evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive pattern recognition control, but it will be done
      at-home under typical and realistic prosthetic use conditions.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized crossover home trial consisting of two 8-week periods with an intermittent 1-week washout period (17 weeks total).

    <measure>Differences in prosthetic wear time</measure>
    <time_frame>We will record total prosthetic wear time during the course of each in-home 8-week period.</time_frame>
    <description>We will record each instance participants turn on or off their pattern recognition device throughout the home trial. Prosthetic wear time is defined as the cumulative amount of time participants keep their pattern recognition device turned on during the course of each in-home 8-week period. We will perform a statistical analysis to compare wear time when using each type of pattern recognition control system (adaptive and non-adaptive). We will complete repeated measures analysis of variance with subject as a random factor, order of control system used as a fixed variable, and wear time as a fixed variable.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete two virtual games called Simon Says and In-the-Zone using the Coapt Complete ControlRoom desktop application. Both games will test how well participants control motion of virtual objects using their pattern recognition device. We will measure their overall control performance by computing completion rate, movement time, path efficiency. We will perform a statistical analysis to compare virtual game performance when using each control system. We will complete a repeated measures analysis of variance with subject as a random factor, order of pattern recognition control system used as a fixed variable, and each performance metric as a fixed variable.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the Upper Extremity Functional Status module from RIC's Orthotics Prosthetics User Survey (OPUS). The OPUS asks prosthetic users to rate the level of difficulty (from very easy to very difficult) in performing upper arm/hand functions using their pattern recognition device.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to use their pattern recognition device to make a set of independent prosthesis motions and hold each motion for 3 seconds. For each motion, we will record the output motion class determined by their pattern recognition classifier every 50 ms. We will measure the performance of their classier when using each control system (adaptive and non-adaptive) by computing the classification accuracy which is defined as the number of correct classifications over the total number of classifications for each motion. We will perform a statistical analysis to compare classification accuracy when using each control system. We will complete a repeated measures analysis of variance with subject as a random factor, order of pattern recognition control system used as a fixed variable, and classification accuracy as a fixed variable.</description>
