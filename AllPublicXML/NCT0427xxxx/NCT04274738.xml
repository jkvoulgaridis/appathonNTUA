  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to establish a pharmacologically active dose of
      mavorixafor in combination with ibrutinib based on pooled safety, clinical response,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to select the recommended dose for a
      randomized registrations trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intrapatient dose-escalation study. Three dose levels of mavorixafor will be
      explored: 200 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) (dose level 1), 400 mg QD (dose level 2), and
      600 mg QD (dose level 3). Ibrutinib will be administered at its labeled dose for participants
      with WM, 420 mg orally QD. Each treatment cycle will be 28 days.

    <description>Each participant will receive mavorixafor at 200 mg (2 capsules of 100 mg each) QD in combination with ibrutinib 420 mg (3 capsules of 140 mg each) QD. If the dose is well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed during 28-day DLT observation period (Cycle 1), the participant will receive 400 mg (4 capsules of 100 mg each) QD in combination with ibrutinib during Cycle 2. If participant does not experience a DLT at this dose level at the end of Cycle 2, participant will receive mavorixafor at 600 mg (6 capsules of 100 mg each) QD in combination with ibrutinib during Cycle 3. If participant tolerates 600 mg dose for 28 days and no DLTs are observed, the participant will continue to receive mavorixafor at 600-mg dose in combination with ibrutinib. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for participant has been identified, the participant may continue to receive treatment for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or study withdrawal.</description>
