  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is defined as the presence of gastroduodenal symptoms in the
      absence of organic disease that is likely to explain the symptoms. Joint hypermobility (JH)
      refers to the increased passive or active movement of a joint beyond its normal range. Recent
      reports have highlighted the co-existence of FD with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III or
      hypermobility type (EDSIII). The association between FD and EDS III, and the underlying
      pathophysiological alterations, are poorly understood. We hypothesised that EDS III might
      influence gastroduodenal sensorimotor function, resulting in dyspeptic symptoms. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to explore the impact of EDS III on gastric motility, nutrient
      tolerance and dyspeptic symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia.Our aim is to study
      the prevalence of EDSIII in FD compared to healthy subjects (HS) and to study the impact of
      co-existing EDSIII on gastric motility, nutrient tolerance and dyspeptic symptoms in FD.

    <measure>Gastric motility in JHS and non-JHS</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a physiological parameter. Intragastric pressure measurement (mmHg) in JHS and non-JHS are compared to the Intragastric pressure measurement (mmHg) of healthy subjects. During the intragastric pressure measurement, the pressure drop (mmHg) from baseline during the intragastric infussion of a liquid meal will be assessed and compared in both groups (patients vs. controls).</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of JHS in functional dyspepsia</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients with JHS and without JHS will be assessed. Based on the number of patients in each group, propotions (in %) can be calculated of the presence of JHS in a functional dyspepsia cohort.</description>

    <measure>Level of nutrient tolerance during the intragastric pressure measurement in JHS</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>During the intragastric pressure assessment, a liquid nutrient drink is intragastrically infussed until the subjects experience and repport maximal satiation. Maximal satiation is assessed every minute during the intragastric infussion of the nutrient drink by means of questionnaires (VAS score: 0, no sensation; 5, maximal satiation). For this outcome, the quantity of nutrient drink tolerated during the test will be measured (ml) in patients with and without JHS and compared.</description>
