    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled study will compare Mindfulness Awareness Practices for Insomnia
      (MAP-I) to sleep health education (SHE) in subjects receiving autologous hematopoietic cell
      transplant for multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a mindfulness
      intervention targeting inpatient autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      recipients (first HCT) with multiple myeloma (MM) and the preliminary efficacy of Mindfulness
      Awareness Practices for Insomnia (MAP-I) vs. sleep health education (SHE) to improve insomnia
      outcomes, cellular and transcriptomic markers of inflammation, and insomnia associated
      behavioral symptoms (depression, fatigue).

      Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to either receive MAP-I or SHE starting
      2-4 weeks prior to HCT. Patients will receive two sessions prior to inpatient admission for
      HCT, and four sessions in the two weeks of hospitalization following HCT, for a total of six
      intervention (or control) sessions.

      Primary Objective: Determine the feasibility of implementing MAP-I among HCT recipients under
      first autologous HCT for MM.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to practice mindfulness techniques on a daily basis, beginning with 5 minutes and increasing to 20 minutes over the course of the 6-week intervention - as is standard with the Mindfulness Awareness Practices (MAPs) course - with practice prior to bedtime. An intervention training manual is the cornerstone of standardized delivery of MAP-I. Participants are also provided with a book on mindfulness (Fully Present: The Science, Art, and Practice of Mindfulness, authored by the Mindfulness Awareness Research Center (MARC) leader and MAP-I instructor Diana Winston) as well as access to the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Mindful App courtesy of the MARC at UCLA (via personal iPhone or study-administered tablets per patient preference), which contains pre-recorded guided meditations for use in daily practice.</description>

    <description>Six individual 1-hour videos will be shown to participants at the same time points as, and with equal duration to, the MAP-I intervention. These videos will be recorded presentations that have been modified for HCT recipients based upon similar SHE interventions delivered in prior studies. Similar to the intervention group, patients in the SHE group will also participate in group Zoom chat sessions with equal frequency and duration lead by a study research coordinator. These sessions will allow for general patient interaction to discuss sleep and any questions or comments they may have, as lead by the group facilitator.</description>
