  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and overweight are among the problems that produce infertility. The combination of
      diet and exercise to achieve weight loss are currently considered an effective intervention
      for the improvement of reproductive parameters in overweight or obese infertile women.

      Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of an online program to promote a healthy lifestyle among
      women who are overweight or obese who also have a diagnosis of infertility and are on the
      waiting list for in vitro fertilisation treatment

      Weight management problems (being obese or overweight) are among the problems that produce
      infertility. The combination of diet and exercise to achieve weight loss are currently
      considered an effective intervention for the improvement of reproductive parameters in
      overweight or obese infertile women.

      Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of a 3-month internet-based program focusing on the
      promotion of healthy lifestyles (especially weight loss and healthy eating and physical
      exercise habits) in women who also have a diagnosis of infertility and are on the waiting
      list for IVF treatment.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 7 items which collects information about the physical activity the surveyee has completed in 7 days prior to completing the test. The IPAQ-SF will be used to calculate the total number of minutes and days the person has engaged in physical activity by adding all physical activity category scores from the prior 7 days together. This data will be converted into metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week (MET-min/week), using the formula published by Ainsworth et al., to classify their physical activity levels as 'high' (&gt; 1,500 MET-min/week), 'moderate' (600-1,500 MET-min/week), or 'low' (&lt; 600 MET-min/week).</description>
