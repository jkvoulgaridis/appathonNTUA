  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial neglect represents a common and severe cognitive disorder following unilateral
      (mostly right hemisphere) stroke. Patients are unaware of objects, persons and even own body
      parts in the (usually left) hemispace opposite to their brain lesion. While there is
      spontaneous remission in some patients, neglect symptoms persist in many stroke survivors
      which is associated with a poor functional outcome. Although different therapeutic approaches
      (including cognitive interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation and drugs) have been
      investigated in the last decades, an established therapy is still missing. Hence, there is a
      clear need for an effective and feasible intervention that can be applied in rehabilitation
      centers.

      This study is dedicated to assess the effect of a cognitive treatment consisting of combined
      optokinetic stimulation (OKS) and cueing-based reading therapy (READ) on hemispatial neglect
      and the neglect-related functional disability in right-hemisphere stroke patients. It will be
      a mono-centric, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Using a crossover design with two
      arms, patients will either receive the intervention therapy (OKS-READ) first and subsequently
      the control treatment (neuropsychological training not targeting visuospatial attention) or
      they will start in the control arm and then switch to the intervention. Each treatment phase
      consists of 15 therapy sessions lasting 30 to 45 minutes. The outcome will be assessed at
      different time points, including established neuropsychological tests for spatial neglect and
      a clinical score of neglect-related functional disability.

    <masking>Double (Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the implicit constraints of cognitive interventions (no placebo possible as opposed to drug studies), neither the patient himself nor the therapist of the study can be blinded to the patient's allocation arm. However, the assessment of the functional impairment will be performed by rehabilitation staff who are blind to the patient's allocation. Furthermore, the assessment of neglect severity by use of a computerized neuropsychological test battery is robust and objective and largely independent of the investigator who is administering the test.</masking_description>

    <intervention_name>Optokinetic stimulation and cueing-based reading therapy (OKS-READ)</intervention_name>
    <description>Each intervention session starts with an optokinetic stimulation (OKS) of at least 15 minutes duration. A pattern of squares, dots, triangles and stars will coherently and continuously move to the left on a computer screen in front of the patients. Patients are instructed to choose one stimulus and follow it with the eyes until it has reached the left side of the screen, then jump to the right edge of the screen and start again.
The second part of each intervention session is the cueing-based reading therapy (READ), which will also last at least 15 minutes. The task of the patient is to read out loud words or a text presented on a paper in front of them. We will use exogenous (e.g., the therapist highlights words when they were omitted) and endogenous cues (verbal instructions which require intrinsic action by the patient) to facilitate attentional shifts to the left. The intensity of cueing will be matched to the actual severity of neglect (adaptive therapy).</description>
