  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LYS-GM101 is a gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis intended to deliver a functional copy of
      the GLB1 gene to the central nervous system. This study will assess, in a 2-stage
      adaptive-design, the safety and efficacy of treatment in subjects with infantile and juvenile
      GM1 gangliosidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GM1 gangliosidosis is a fatal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the GLB1
      gene leading to accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in neurons and progressive
      neurodegeneration. There are three pediatric subtypes: early infantile, late infantile and
      juvenile. This is an interventional, multicenter, single-arm, dose escalation study of
      LYS-GM101. In the first stage of the study, two doses of LYS-GM101 will be studied in 6
      subjects who have infantile GM1 gangliosidosis. The second stage of the study will include
      both infantile and juvenile patients.
