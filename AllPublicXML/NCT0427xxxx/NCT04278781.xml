      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be &gt;/= 18 years of age

          -  Have a histological diagnosis (fresh or archived tumor biopsy sample) of locally
             advanced/metastatic or recurrent operable chondrosarcoma (conventional grade 2 or 3
             only) confirmed by central pathology review

               -  Patients with low grade (grade 1) and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma are
                  ineligible

               -  Patients with biopsy proven low grade (grade 1) pelvic chondrosarcoma are
                  ineligible unless they have radiological imaging consistent with higher grade
                  disease in which case they will be deemed potentially eligible. In such cases the
                  pre-treatment biopsy should be taken where feasible from the area of presumed
                  higher-grade disease to confirm grade 2 or 3 disease to confirm eligibility

               -  Patients without confirmation of grade 2 or 3 disease will not be eligible for
                  the study unless in the case where radiology features are consistent with high
                  grade disease but a biopsy confirmation of this is not technically feasible. Such
                  cases should be discussed with the principal investigator before enrollment onto
                  the study

          -  Have a documented IDH1 gene mutation (from a fresh tumor biopsy or the most recent
             archived tumor tissue available) confirmed by a CLIA approved laboratory.

          -  Have expected survival of &gt;/= 4 months.

          -  Have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1, subjected who have
             received prior local therapy are eligible provided the measurable disease falls
             outside of the treatment field or within the field and has shown &gt;/=20% growth in size
             since post-treatment assessment.

          -  Have documented radiographic disease progression within the preceding 4 months before
             study entry (date ICF signed).

        Have recovered from toxicities associated with prior anti-cancer therapy to baseline unless
        stabilized under medical management (see washout time from different therapies in Exclusion
        Criteria section).

          -  Have adequate bone marrow functions as evidenced by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/=1,500/mm^3 or 100 x 10^9/L.

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;/=8/dL.

               -  Platelets &gt;/=100,000/mm^3 or 100 x 10^9/L.

          -  Have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

               -  Serum total bilirubin &lt;/=2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x ULN OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;/= 50ml/min based on the cockcroft-gault glomerular
                  filtration rate (GFR) estimation:

               -  (140 Age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female)/72 x serum creatinine

          -  Be able to understand and willing to sign the informed consent form and to comply with
             scheduled visits, treatment plans, procedures and laboratory tests, including serial
             peripheral blood sampling and urine sampling, during the study. A legally authorized
             representative may consent on behalf of a subject who is otherwise unable to provide

             Board (IRB)

          -  Be able to swallow oral medication.

          -  Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to the start of therapy, or a confirmation from an obstetrician in case of
             equivocal serum pregnancy results. Females of reproductive potential are defined as
             sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
             or tubal occlusion or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not
             menstruated) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., have not had menses at any time
             in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Women of reproductive potential, as well as
             fertile men and their partners who are female with reproductive potential, must agree
             to use 2 effective forms of contraception (including at least 1 barrier form) from the
             time of giving informed consent throughout the study and for 90 days (both females and
             males) following the last dose of study drug. Effective forms of contraception are
             defined as hormonal oral contraceptive, injectables, patches, intrauterine devices,
             intrauterine hormone-releasing systems bilateral tubal ligation, condoms with
             spermicide, or male partner sterilization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received a prior IDH1 inhibitor.

          -  Received systemic anticancer therapy or an investigational agent &lt; 3 week prior to the

             weeks prior to Day 1.

          -  Underwent major surgery within 4 weeks of Day 1 or have not recovered from clinically
             significant post-surgery toxicities.

             diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they completed their treatment and have
             recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study entry,
             have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 4 weeks
             and have a radiographically stable disease for a least 3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Are taking known strong CYP3A4 inducers or sensitive CYP3A4 substrate medications with
             a narrow therapeutic window unless they can be transferred to other medication within

             unexplained fever &gt; 38.5 degrees C within 7 days of Day 1 (at the discretion of the

          -  Have significant active cardiac disease within 6 months prior to the start of study
             treatment, including New York Heart Association Class II or IV congestive heart

             investigator.

          -  Are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, unless they can have
             transferred to other medications within &gt;/= half-lives prior to dosing, or unless the
             medications can be properly monitored during the study (If equivalent medication is
             not available, QTcF should be closely monitored).

          -  Have known active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infections, known positive
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody results, or acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome (AIDS) related illness. Subjects with a sustained viral response to HCV or
             immunity to prior HBV infection will be permitted. Subjects with chronic HBV that is

             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

             or lap band dysphagia, short bowel syndrome, gastroparesis or other conditions that
