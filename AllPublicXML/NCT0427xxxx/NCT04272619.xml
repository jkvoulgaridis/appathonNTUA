  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to bridge the gap between evidence and action and combat rising liver
      cancer rates attributed to Hepatitis B and C infection in Philadelphia by identifying
      neighborhoods with higher than expected rates of liver cancer and related risk factors and
      administering an educational intervention about liver cancer and neighborhood health in those
      communities, working with existing community partners at Fox Chase Cancer Center.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean liver cancer knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Liver cancer knowledge will be measured through four true/false items. Responses will be summed for a total liver cancer knowledge score. A positive change in mean knowledge score indicates liver cancer knowledge increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in general interest in learning about neighborhood health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>General interest in learning about neighborhood health will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, whether the participant would like to learn about liver cancer in their own neighborhood. A positive change in mean score indicates that interest increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in interest in learning about neighborhood health from a healthcare provider</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Interest in learning about neighborhood health from a healthcare provider will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, whether the participant would like to learn about liver cancer in their own neighborhood from their doctor. A positive change in mean score indicates that interest increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in interest in learning about neighborhood health from other sources</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Interest in learning about neighborhood health from other sources will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, whether the participant would like to learn about liver cancer in their own neighborhood from non-medical sources (e.g., website or brochure). A positive change in mean score indicates that interest increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in interest in discussing high liver cancer risk with a healthcare provider</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Interest in discussing high liver cancer risk with a healthcare provider will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, whether the participant would be likely to discuss their liver cancer risk with a doctor if they learned they lived in a high-risk area. A positive change in mean score indicates that interest increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in outcome expectancies for learning about neighborhood health - patient behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patient outcome expectancies for learning about neighborhood health will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much), whether learning about neighborhood health will help the participant make health decisions. A positive change in mean score indicates that outcome expectancies increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in outcome expectancies for learning about neighborhood health - provider behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Provider outcome expectancies for learning about neighborhood health will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much), whether learning about neighborhood health will help the participant's healthcare provider make health decisions for them. A positive change in mean score indicates that outcome expectancies increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intentions about communicating with healthcare provider - neighborhood prevalence of liver cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>intentions about communicating with healthcare provider about neighborhood liver cancer will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from very likely to not at all likely, how likely the participant is to discuss liver cancer in their neighborhood with their healthcare provider over the next 12 months. A positive change in mean score indicates that intentions increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intentions about communicating with healthcare provider - liver cancer screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>intentions about communicating with healthcare provider about liver cancer screening will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from very likely to not at all likely, how likely the participant is to discuss liver cancer screening with their healthcare provider over the next 12 months. A positive change in mean score indicates that intentions increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intentions about communicating with healthcare provider - liver cancer risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>intentions about communicating with healthcare provider about liver cancer risk will be measured through a single item asking, on a scale from very likely to not at all likely, how likely the participant is to discuss their personal risk factors for liver cancer with their healthcare provider over the next 12 months. A positive change in mean score indicates that intentions increased from baseline to post-intervention.</description>
