  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) is performing this research to study different
      conditions and diseases by using cells from the body (such as skin or blood cells). NYSCF
      uses these samples to make stem cells and other types of cells, conduct research on the
      samples, perform genetic testing, and/or store these samples for future use.

      Through this research, scientists hope to identify future treatments or even cures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at NYSCF study diverse diseases, conditions, and traits by creating &quot;pluripotent&quot;
      stem cells. These stem cells can become any cell in the human body, including cells that may
      be difficult, invasive, or even impossible to obtain directly. For example, researchers may
      create pancreatic insulin-producing cells to learn more about type 1 diabetes, or brain cells
      to learn more about Parkinson's disease.

      Additionally, researchers perform genetic testing to learn more about DNA, a material in most
      cells that contains instructions for the body's development and functions (such as traits
      like eye color and risk of certain diseases). A piece of DNA that determines the specific
      role of a cell is called a &quot;gene.&quot; If the instructions in a gene are abnormal, this can lead
      to disease.

      Participation in the study involves: (1) completion of a health questionnaire, (2) donation
      of a skin and/or blood sample from which stem cells may be created, (3) possible collection
      of a saliva sample for genetic analysis, and (4) possible future follow-up to provide
      additional information or learn about other research studies. This study is not a clinical
      trial.

        Biological Sample Collection

          -  Able and willing to provide:

               -  new samples of blood, skin, and/or saliva specifically for use in this study
                  and/or

               -  excess/leftover samples, cell lines, and/or derivatives that were (or will be)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-English speaking

          -  Wards of the state

          -  For skin samples collected specifically for this study: history of keloid formation,
             bleeding disorder, allergy to the anesthetic, or anticoagulation use that precludes
             sample collection.

          -  For blood samples collected specifically for this study: bleeding disorder, or other
             medical condition, if the subject's condition increases the risks associated with
             blood collection.

          -  For saliva samples: inability to produce sufficient saliva or has a condition that
             precludes sample collection (such as severe trismus).
