  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study (LANDMARK) is to compare the safety and effectiveness of
      the Myval THV Series with Contemporary Valves (Sapien THV Series and Evolut THV Series) in
      patients with severe symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis.

      This study will be done in approximately 768 subjects (384:384, Myval THV Series vs.
      Contemporary Valves)

      The randomization will be carried out with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between Myval THV
      Series vs. Contemporary Valves (Sapien THV Series and Evolut THV Series)

      LANDMARK Trial is a prospective, randomized, multinational, multicentric, open-label
      non-inferiority trial of approximately 768 subjects (384:384, Myval THV Series vs.
      Contemporary Valves) with severe symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis via transfemoral
      approach.

        -  Device sizes applicable for the Myval THV Series: 20 mm, 21.5 mm, 23 mm, 24.5 mm, 26 mm,
           27.5 mm, and 29 mm diameter.

        -  Device sizes applicable for the Sapien 3 THV Series: 20 mm, 23 mm, 26 mm, and 29 mm
           diameter.

        -  Device sizes applicable for the Evolut THV Series: 23 mm, 26 mm, 29 mm, and 34 mm
           diameter.

      The randomization will be carried out with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between Myval THV
      Series vs. Contemporary Valves (Sapien THV Series and Evolut THV Series) (Stratification and
      equal allocation will be done for each valve within contemporary valves, i.e., 50% Sapien THV
      Series and 50% Evolut THV Series)

             upper and lower extremity arteries, renal arteries, and abdominal or thoracic aortic
             systems which as per Heart Team assessment is significant and unsuitable to perform
             TAVR procedure) including aneurysm defined as maximal luminal diameter ≥5 cm; marked
             tortuosity (hyperacute bend), thrombus, prior aortic graft, aortic arch atheroma
             [particularly if thick (&gt;5 mm), protruding or ulcerated] or narrowing (especially with

             investigator's opinion would be improper for safe vascular access or implantation of
             the device.

         27. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study.

         28. Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 months of procedure.
