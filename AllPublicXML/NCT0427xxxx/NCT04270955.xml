  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH) are one form of bleeding in the head. They are one of the
      most common diseases encountered by neurosurgeons across the country. The cSDH can push on
      the brain and produce symptoms that include seizures, weakness, loss of sensation, and
      confusion. Many of these cSDH produce repetitive bleeding.

      Treatment has largely consisted of surgical drainage of hematoma (also known as a blood clot)
      through either a small hole in the skull or open surgery. However, it is common for the cSDH
      to reappear despite these procedures. A recent study has shown a treatment failure rate of
      27% and a need for additional surgery at 19%.

      A new approach to treatment of cSDH blocks the blood supply to the tissue that produces the
      repeated bleeding. Catheters are used to gain access to the middle meningeal artery (MMA), an
      artery that supplies the coverings of the brain. The artery is blocked using small particles
      or glue in a process called embolization. A recent pilot study of 72 patients who underwent
      MMA embolization showed a much lower rate of repeated bleeding. Based on these results, it is
      thought that this procedure holds promise in reducing the number of cSDH that require one or
      more operations. The goal of this study is to systematically examine if blocking the blood
      supply to the tissue responsible for repeated bleeding helps the cSDH resolve and improves
      patient outcomes.
