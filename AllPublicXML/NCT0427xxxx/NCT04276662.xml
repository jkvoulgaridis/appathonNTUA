        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female participants 18 years to 75 years of age (inclusive), with a body mass
             index (BMI) of 18 kg/m^2 to 40 kg/m^2 (inclusive) and body weight between 50 kg and
             120 kg (inclusive) at Screening.

          -  Female participants who are of non-childbearing potential must be:

          -  Surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation or removal of both ovaries and/or
             uterus at least 6 months prior to dosing, or Essure® with hysterosalpingogram
             [documentation to confirm tubal occlusion 12 weeks [wk] after procedure]).

          -  Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24 consecutive
             months prior to dosing, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or estradiol
             testing.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential with proper means of hormonal and
             nonhormonal or barrier contraceptive methods; all female participants must have
             negative pregnancy tests at Screening and Check-in. Female participants must be using
             proper contraceptive means for at least 1 month prior to Screening. Acceptable means
             of contraceptive methods include sexual abstinence, vasectomy of male partner,
             intrauterine device, barrier methods like female condom, diaphragm or cervical cap,
             spermicide, hormonal contraceptives, or any combination of above. Female participants
             who normally abstain from sexual activity may be recruited provided that they agree to
             use a condom and spermicide should they become sexually active at any time during the
             study and for 90 days post dose. Male partners should also be informed to use a condom
             during this study period. Participants with hepatic impairment should consult with
             their primary care physician about using any oral contraceptive options (eg, would a
             combination of hormonal contraception and barrier contraceptive methods be allowed by
             the physician).

          -  Male participants must agree to use a condom and spermicide during sexual intercourse
             until 90 days post dose or must have had a vasectomy and must be willing not to donate
             sperm until 90 days post dose. Female partners of male participants should be informed
             of additional barrier contraceptive during this time and may use barrier and/or
             hormonal contraceptive methods under the conditions described below. Participants with
             hepatic impairment should consult with their primary care physician about hormonal
             contraceptive options for their partner. Participants should use both hormonal and
             barrier methods of contraception for themselves and their partner.

          -  Participants must agree to refrain from donation of blood from 56 days prior to
             Screening, plasma from 2 wk prior to Screening, and platelets from 6 wk prior to
             Screening. Participants must also agree to refrain from donation of blood until 56
             days after the end of study.

          -  All participants must be willing to refrain from consuming grapefruit/grapefruit
             juice, Seville oranges, and pomegranates/pomegranate juice 10 days before the study
             drug is given on Day 1 until End-of-Study.
