  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that weekly digital interactions and routine measurement of TEWL
      rates and SC hydration levels will promote patient adherence to maintenance ivermectin
      therapy and prevent disease relapse. The project will consist of a trial in which thirty
      subjects with rosacea receive ivermectin therapy and are randomized to receive either no
      intervention, a weekly digital survey to assess patient's attitudes towards ivermectin
      therapy, or a portal hydration measurement device that measures TEWL rates and SC hydration
      levels. The study team will measure adherence objectively in all groups with electronic
      monitors attached to the containers of the ivermectin, which all subjects will be told to use
      daily for maintenance therapy. Additionally, the hydration measurement device can transmit
      data to an Internet server via a smartphone using Bluetooth technology, thereby allowing
      providers to monitor a patient's TEWL rate and SC levels.

      Subjects will be offered an opportunity to participate in the study. Subjects will either
      have a diagnosis of rosacea. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled. After consent and basic
      demographics, a study team member will use the GPSkin Barrier® to measure the baseline
      moisture level of the face of all subjects. Subjects will also fill out questionnaires
      pertaining to quality of life, accountability, and severity of rosacea.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of three arms: the control group (n= 10), the digital
      interaction group (n=10), or the GPSkin group (n=10). All subjects will receive ivermectin
      equipped with an electronic monitor to measure adherence for daily treatment of rosacea. The
      digital interaction group will receive a survey by email each week asking about their use
      ivermectin generated by Causa Research. The subjects in the GPSkin group will receive the
      GPSkin Barrier® to measure their moisture level of their face daily. Subjects will be
      instructed to use the ivermectin once daily. Subjects will return at 3 Months. At this visit,
      the data from the electronic adherence monitoring will be downloaded, the ivermectin will be
      weighed, and the subject will fill out the same questionnaires (quality of life,
      accountability, and severity of rosacea). The intervention subjects will be evaluated on
      their use of the GPSkin Barrier® to measure their stratum corneum hydration. Subjects not
      randomized to the email intervention group will receive an accountability questionnaire at
      the beginning and end of the study.
