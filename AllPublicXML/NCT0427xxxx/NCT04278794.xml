  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of death and adult disability in Canada. Sixty percent of these
      older adults (&gt; 65 years) will return to their homes after a stroke and will require ongoing
      rehabilitation. About 92% of older adults have two or more chronic conditions. These patients
      often require services from a number of providers in a number of settings and are therefore,
      susceptible to fragmented health care when transitioning from hospital to home. New
      interventions are needed to improve the quality of care as patients move from hospital to
      home after a stroke. The proposed research project will examine the impact of a new
      intervention on patient/caregiver health, patient/caregiver and provider experience and
      costs, compared to usual health care services. The new intervention will be coordinated by a
      system navigator and consists of four core components: 1) development of a comprehensive
      discharge plan, 2) up to 6 home visits (supported by phone calls) by an interprofessional
      outpatient team, 3) monthly case conferences including the interprofessional care team who
      will discuss and focus on the patient's goals and care needs, and 4) linkages to other
      healthcare and community services. This multidisciplinary project will build on our previous
      study, which provided the groundwork for further study of this new intervention.

    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to adapt,
      implement and evaluate a novel person- and family-centred Transitional Care Stroke
      Intervention (TCSI) for older adults (&gt; 55 years) with stroke and multimorbidity (&gt;2 chronic
      conditions) and their caregivers. The TCSI is a theory- and evidence-based 6-month
      intervention designed to improve the health, experience, and quality of transitioning from
      hospital-to-home for this vulnerable population. An effectiveness-implementation hybrid type
      I design will be used, which will focus primarily on examining the effectiveness of the TCSI
      on quadruple aim outcomes: (i) patient and caregiver health outcomes, (ii) patient and
      caregiver experience, (iii) provider/manager experience, and (iv) patient healthcare service
      use costs, and will also evaluate implementation outcomes (e.g., barriers, facilitators,
      fidelity). Our earlier pre-post study provided evidence to support the feasibility,
      acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the TCSI on reducing hospital readmissions and
      emergency department visits (for any cause). These improvements were achieved at no
      additional cost. The key components of the TCSI in this earlier study included home visits
      supported by telephone calls by an interprofessional team (IP), patient-centered care
      planning, and care coordination/recruitment. The following enhancements to the TCSI will be
      included in the trial: 1) integrating the navigator role across the care continuum, 2)
      testing the TCSI with a larger sample and more rigorous (RCT) design, 3) enhancing patient
      self-management, and 4) evaluating the impact of the intervention on caregiver health
      outcomes and experience. These improvements alongside the inclusion of additional evaluation
      measures will enable rigorous evaluation of the TCSI and position it for future scale-up and
      spread

    <masking_description>Study patients will be blinded to their group allocation. Those aware that they are receiving or not receiving the intervention are more likely to provide biased assessments of the effectiveness of the intervention than blinded participants. Participants who are aware that they are not receiving the intervention may be less likely to comply with the trial protocol, and more likely to drop out of the trial. To minimize assessment bias, Research Assistants will be blinded to group allocation.

    <time_frame>Baseline; 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short-Form 12 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2) tool will be used to assess change in mental health. The tool consists of 12 questions that measure functional health and well-being from the participant's perspective. It provides scores for eight health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health) by which a psychometrically-based physical component summary and mental component summary score can be calculated. Response options include the frequency of feeling a certain way or behaviour across 3 or 5 categories (e.g., 'all of the time'). Total scale range 0-100. Higher scores represent a better mental health - health-related quality of life. This will be assessed in patients and caregivers.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies on Depression 10-Item Scale (CES-D-10) will be used to assess change in depressive symptoms and symptom severity. This tool has been used in prior studies of older adults with mood disorders, has a high degree of reliability and validity, distinguishes between depressed and non-depressed people, and is a sensitive tool for measuring changes in depressive symptoms over time in psychiatric populations. Participants will be asked about the way they have felt or behaved in response to 10 statements such as 'I was happy'. Response options ask participants to select the frequency they have felt or behaved during the last week, ranging from 'rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)', 'some or a little of the time (1-2 days)', 'occasionally or moderate (3-4 days)', to 'most or all of the time (5-7 days)'. Scale range: 0 - 30. Higher scores represent more depressive symptoms. This will be measured in patients.</description>

    <description>Core components:
Comprehensive Hospital Discharge Plan. The Care Coordinator will meet with staff in the in-patient unit along with patients and their caregivers to develop and implement a comprehensive discharge plan.
Structured home visits and telephone support. As part of the structured home visits and telephone support, a member of the IP team will provide up to 6 home visits over 6 months. The team will provide: screening and assessment; medication review and reconciliation; self-management support; education; and caregiver assessment.
Monthly IP case conferences. 6 monthly IP team case conferences will be held to discuss goals identified by the patient, collectively develop a plan of care, and identify needs.
Linkages to services. Facilitate timely follow-up with the primary care provider and build relationships with local health and social service providers. These referrals and links will provide the foundation for continued use post-intervention.</description>
