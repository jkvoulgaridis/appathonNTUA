      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment on the tumour
      choline metabolism as determined by [18F]D4-FCH PET/ computed tomography(CT) in breast cancer
      and to determine the suitability of [18F]D4-FCH-PET/CT as a non-invasive, early imaging
      biomarker for therapy response following CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment.

      A target of 16 evaluable participants will be recruited to this study. Participants will
      have[18F]D4-FCH PET/CT imaging on each of 2 visits Scan 1: Baseline scan to be conducted
      prior to initiating standard of care CDK4/6 inhibitor-based therapy drug therapy.

      Scan2: Early post-treatment scan to be conducted at 4-6 weeks after initiating therapy.

      Each participant will provide written consent to take part in the study before they undergo
      screening assessments to confirm eligibility. On the day of imaging the participants will
      have a blood sample taken for circulating tumour DNA prior to the scan.

      A single dose of [18F]D4-FCH IV will be administered to the participant followed by dynamic/
      whole body imaging.

      Optional tumour biopsies at baseline and after 4-6 weeks of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment will
      be obtained, or if there is a suitable archival pre-treatment biopsy that has been taken
      within 18 months, this can be retrieved for baseline analysis.

      Clinical data for progression/ survival followed up for up to 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients with a histological diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic
             estrogen-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer

          2. Written informed consent prior to admission in the study.

          3. Target lesion diameter of ≥15mm that has not been previously irradiated and is located
             outside the liver

          4. Female patients aged ≥ 18 years of age

          5. For all patients: histologically confirmed locally advanced/ metastatic breast cancer
             with a previous biopsy confirming hormone receptor and HER2 status

          6. ECOG performance status 0‐2

          7. Negative urine pregnancy test (within 2 hours prior to injection of imaging agent) in

             non‐hormonal) for 3 weeks after injection of [18F]D4-FCH

          8. Life expectancy &gt; 3months

          9. Adequate organ function as judged by investigator to include:
