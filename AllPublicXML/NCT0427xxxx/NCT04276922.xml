  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn if creative arts programs that include visual, musical, written, or
      physical expression can reduce symptoms of burnout syndrome, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD), depression, and anxiety in critical care healthcare professionals. This study also
      explores if creative arts can enhance the connection to the purpose of work, the development
      of adequate coping skills, while providing time to connect with peers.

    <time_frame>At the end of 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of intervention will be assessed using eight item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (SCQ-8) to generate an estimate of general satisfaction. Scores range from 8-32 (higher scores = greater satisfaction).</description>
