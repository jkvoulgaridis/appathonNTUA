  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a dialogue-based online intervention
      (ceprica) that provides information regarding cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in patients
      with A) tension-type headache and B) migraine.

      The study aims to test the hypothesis that ceprica has a higher positive impact on
      psychometric parameters than the active control. 520 patients with tension-type headache or
      migraine (260 participants with each indication) will be included and randomized to two
      groups: (1) a control group, that will be provided with an online intervention, that will
      teach about evidence-based content regarding headache or (2) an intervention group that
      immediately receives access to the online program ceprica. The primary endpoints are
      self-reported days with headache and self-reported mean pain intensity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tension-type headache and migraine are common in the German population and lead to a
      decreased quality of life as well as high economic consequences. Cognitive behavioural
      therapy has shown to be effective in the treatment of all types of headache, especially the
      chronic ones. Web-based psychological interventions are easily accessible and preliminary
      evidence suggests that such interventions can be effective.

      In this study, the treatment effects of a novel dialogue-based online intervention compared
      to an active control group will be investigated. The interventional online program ceprica
      contains elements of cognitive behavioural therapy that address specific approaches in the
      management of pain, integrated in an individually tailored dialogue that is based on the
      responses given in the program. The intervention is delivered via the internet and protected
      by individually assigned passwords. The active control will receive an online intervention
      that contains evidence-based information regarding headache.

      This randomised controlled trial will include 520 patients with tension-type headache or
      migraine (260 participants for each indication). Participants will be recruited via a website
      containing relevant information about the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either (1) a control group, in which they receive online evidence-based information regarding
      headache and continue their usual care or (2) an intervention group that may also use care as
      usual and in addition receives the online intervention ceprica. Measurements are collected at
      baseline (T0), and three months later (T1).
