    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, four-cohort, phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of CART19 in
      pediatric and young adult patientswith hypodiploid (Cohort A) or t(17;19) B-ALL (Cohort B),
      infants with very high risk KMT2A B-ALL (Cohort C), and in patients with central nervous
      system (CNS) relapse who did not receive cranial radiation (XRT) or bone marrow
      transplantation (BMT) (Cohort D).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent form must be obtained prior to any study procedure.

          2. Male and female patients with documented CD19+ B-ALL

             a.Cohort A &amp; B: Patients, regardless their response to initial or relapsed B ALL
             therapy, with the following characteristics: i.Cohort A: Subjects with confirmation of
             a hypodiploid karyotype (chromosome number fewer than 45) ii.Cohort B: Subjects with
             cytogenetic confirmation of the chromosomal translocation t(17;19) (Cohort B) b.Cohort
             C: Infants w/ newly diagnosed KMT2A rearranged B-ALL classified as very high risk by
             the following criteria: i.Age &lt; 3 months at diagnosis ii.Age &lt; 6 months and WBC &gt;
             300,000x109/L at diagnosis or a poor prednisone response in induction iii.MRD positive
             &gt; 0.01 (or PCR &gt; 104) after 2 courses of standard infant ALL therapy.

             c.Cohort D: Subjects in a first or greater CNS relapse, prior to therapy with cranial
             XRT or HSCT for the current relapse

          3. Expression of CD19 on leukemic blasts demonstrated by flow cytometry of bone marrow,
             cerebrospinal fluid, or peripheral blood

          4. Age 0 to 29 years

          5. Adequate organ function defined as:

               1. A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:

                  Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Age Male Female 0 to &lt; 2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to &lt; 6

             exceed this range are acceptable if, in the opinion of the physician-investigator (or
             as confirmed by liver biopsy), the abnormalities are directly related to ALL
             infiltration of the liver.

             c.Must have a minimum level of pulmonary reserve defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea and &lt;
             Grade 3 hypoxia; DLCO ≥ 40% (corrected for anemia) if PFTs are clinically appropriate

             d.Left Ventricular Shortening Fraction (LVSF) ≥ 28%, or Left Ventricular Ejection
             Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% by echocardiogram. In cases where quanitative assessment of
             LVSF/LVEF is not possible, a statement by the cardiologist that the ECHO shows
             qualititatively normal ventricular function wll suffice.

          6. Adequate performance status defined as Lansky or Karnofsky score ≥ 50

          7. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control methods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For subjects with a CNS relapse, prior cranial XRT or BMT for the current relapse is
             an exclusion.

          2. Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C.

          3. HIV Infection.

          4. Active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring systemic therapy.

          5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids at the time of cell infusion or cell collection,
             or a condition, in the treating physician's opinion, that is likely to require steroid
             therapy during collection or after infusion. Steroids for disease treatment at times
             other than cell collection or at the time of infusion are permitted. Use of
             physiologic replacement hydrocortisone or inhaled steroids is permitted as well.

          6. CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that
             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.

          7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          8. Uncontrolled active infection.
