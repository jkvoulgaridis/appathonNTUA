      To determine if different serum Progesterone levels on FET day are associated with different
      clinical pregnancy rates (CPR), and if increasing dosage of vaginal Progesterone in cases of
      lower serum Progesterone level on FET day can be either beneficial or detrimental regarding
      the CPR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, the use of frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) has risen around the
      globe. There is no consensus which mode of FET is superior, either natural cycle (NC) or
      artificial cycle (AC) with hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). The latter has become more and
      more popular because it allows more flexibility in timing of FET and it requires fewer visits
      for monitoring before the transfer. AC also has the advantage of a more precise control of
      progesterone (P) exposure, which is of utmost importance for controlling the window of
      implantation between the embryo and the endometrium. Although FET in AC give excellent
      results, there is still a need for improvement, as the ideal dose is not individualized to a
      patient's characteristics and serum P required for optimal cycle outcome haven't been
      established.

      Retrospective studies about P levels on the day of FET in AC cycles showed contradictory
      results regarding cycle outcomes. Several studies showed that a lower P levels on FET day, or
      one day prior, are associated with lower clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) or live birth rate
      (LBR), whereas one study showed that women with higher P on FET day were having lower LBRs.
      Recently, a prospective study showed that serum P level &lt; 9.2 ng/ml on the day of FET in
      oocyte reception cycles was associated with a significant lower ongoing pregnancy rate.
      Considering these previous studies, we wanted to determine if different serum P levels on FET
      day are associated with different CPR, and if increasing dosage of vaginal P in cases of
      lower serum P level on FET day can be either beneficial or detrimental.
