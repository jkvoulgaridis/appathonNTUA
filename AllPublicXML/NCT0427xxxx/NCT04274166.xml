  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) secukinumab has
      on the subject and their pyoderma gangrenosum.

      Secukinumab is a type of medicine called human monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies
      are proteins that recognize and attach to other specific proteins (in this case, immune
      system hormones called &quot;cytokines&quot;) that your body produces. The cytokine (a &quot;messenger&quot;
      protein in the body) that secukinumab binds to and reduces the activity of is a naturally
      occurring cytokine called interleukin-17A (IL-17A). IL-17A is believed to be partly
      responsible for inflammation (pain, swelling, redness), and researchers believe that IL-17A
      may cause symptoms PG.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, Phase IIa study of secukinumab in the treatment of
      subjects diagnosed with PG. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline (week 0), Week
      1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, and then every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The total duration of
      treatment is up to 20 weeks. Subjects may be treated for shorter durations if the lesions
      clear prior to week 20. Subjects will have a follow-up visit at 24 weeks, or 4 weeks after
      the last dose of study drug. Subjects will also have standard of care wound dressings done at
      each visit. Subjects will be given 300 mg of secukinumab SQ at week 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4,
      followed by injections every 4 weeks, for up to 20 weeks. Subjects may receive a dose
      increase at week 16 (if there is not at least a 25% reduction in target lesion size) to 300
      mg every 2 weeks.

        -  Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic panel (CMP), C- reactive protein
           (CRP), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Hepatitis panel, HIV test, Pregnancy test,
           and QuantiFERON gold TB test will be performed at screening. (Appendix 6)

        -  CBC, CMP, CRP, ESR will be performed at week 8 and week 20.

        -  Pain rating by Likert scale (A 10-point scale to rate the level of pain - Appendix 2),
           an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) (Appendix 3), Subject Global Assessment (SGA)
           (Appendix 3), and Ulcer Lesion Assessment (Appendix 5) will be done at Screening,
           Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.

        -  Lesion photography will be done at Screening and all visits.

        -  Infection and adverse event assessments and concomitant medication assessments will be
           performed at each visit.

        -  Quality of life will be measured with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at
           Baseline and Week 20 (Appendix 4).

             administration (requirement of a 2-week washout).

          6. Known HIV+, known viral hepatitis infection, known tuberculosis infection.

          7. Any subject with a current or history of a malignancy in the last five years
