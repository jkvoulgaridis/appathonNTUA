  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study enrolling 5 patients with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury
      (TBI) without polytrauma and 5 patients with TBI with polytrauma admitted to the University
      of Kentucky (UK) Chandler Medical Center to evaluate differences in platelet bioenergetics in
      the populations. Additionally, five healthy subjects will be recruited to the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is used to describe a myriad of primary and secondary
      brain-related injuries related to trauma. Clinically, moderate-to-severe brain injury results
      in early coagulopathy, with a tendency toward unanticipated bleeding, followed by delayed
      hypercoagulation, with a tendency toward unanticipated clot formation. Optimal platelet
      count, activation and function are necessary for normal coagulation. Investigators have
      recently developed a novel approach to measure platelet activity. This approach specifically
      measures platelet energy output or bioenergetics from blood samples. Preclinical (animal)
      studies show that platelet bioenergetic profiles are different after TBI and that they change
      over time. This temporal profile may be used as a biomarker that can inform diagnosis and
      prognosis of TBI.

          -  Patients must be consented and undergo first blood sampling within the first 12 hours
             (+/- 2 hours) after their traumatic brain injury to be enrolled in the TBI or TBI with
             trauma groups.

          -  Patients must be expected to survive to discharge, as assessed by their admitting
             neurosurgery team
