  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of a single dose of fezolinetant
      test formulation compared to a single dose of fezolinetant reference formulation under
      fasting conditions. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      dose of fezolinetant test formulation and a single dose of fezolinetant reference
      formulation.

      Each participant will participate in 2 study periods separated by a washout of at least 5
      days between investigational product (IP) administrations. Participants will be randomized to
      1 of 2 sequences: either fezolinetant test formulation followed by fezolinetant reference
      formulation or fezolinetant reference formulation followed by fezolinetant test formulation.
      Participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and will be residential for 2
      study periods for a total of 10 days/9 nights. Participants will receive a single dose of
      test formulation or reference formulation under fasting conditions on day 1 of each period.
      Participants are to remain semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for
      4 hours postdose. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected predose on day 1 of each period
      and at multiple time points postdose. Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be
      conducted. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 4 of period 2 on the
      condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical
      reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 5 to 9
      days after discharge from period 2 or at early discontinuation from the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigatonal product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP.</description>
