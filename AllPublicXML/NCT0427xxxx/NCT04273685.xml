      This intervention trial explores the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of a novel
      psycho-social intervention for early psychosis based on a combined cognitive remediation
      training and cognitive behavioural therapy approach focused on social recovery. The impact of
      the CReSt-R intervention on social cognition as a primary outcome will be explored in
      addition to secondary outcome measures such as social and occupational functioning ( Detailed
      further in this registration). Feasibility of the trial design and the acceptability of the
      CReSt-R intervention to the target group, 16-35 year olds who are within the first 5 years of
      a diagnosed psychotic illness, are also explored in this trial.

      This study is being carried out as part of a collaborative doctoral award program entitled
      Youth Mental Health Research Leadership (YOULEAD, www.nuigalway.ie/youlead) and is funded by
      the Health Research Board, Ireland.

      It is a single centre, randomised pilot study based at the National University of
      Ireland,Galway with ethical approval from the Galway University Hospital ethical committee.
      The principal investigator is Prof. Gary Donohoe and study lead Ms. Emma Frawley, both based
      at the School of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway.

      Across psychosis spectrum disorders, social cognition is strongly linked to functional
      outcomes and therefore considered an important target for intervention.Social Cognition is
      reported to mediate the effects of neurocognition on functional outcomes.This suggests better
      functional outcomes may be achieved if both neurocognition and social cognition are targeted
      in intervention and that neurocognitive training alone does not result in significant social
      cognitive improvements.

      People living with experience of psychotic illness often experience barriers to socialising.
      For example, experience of positive symptoms in schizophrenia can result in psychological
      challenges and reduced opportunities to meet and engage with other individuals in a social
      context. In a 2012 review of social cognitive interventions it was concluded that in order to
      impact higher-order social cognitive processes, there needs to be ample opportunity for
      practice of skills both in a clinical setting as well as in the community. A recent meta-
      analysis and meta-regression study also concluded early intervention in psychosis, where
      there is a multi-component treatment approach, is associated with better outcomes across a
      number of variables including global functioning and involvement in school or work.
      Exploration of the feasibility of the CReSt-R intervention and its ability to integrate into
      a multi-component treatment approach, is integral to this research study.

      The CReSt-R study is novel in its approach, combining the CIRCuiTS cognitive training
      programme, informed by a metacognitive model, with Social Recovery Therapy, informed by
      cognitive behavioural theory and assertive outreach.

      Effectiveness of the intervention will be explored with social cognition as a primary outcome
      in addition to secondary outcomes of general cognition and social and occupational
      functioning (Detailed further in this registration). Feasibility of the intervention will be
      assessed using key indicators of rate of enrollment, blinding effectiveness, rate of
      retention of participants and completion rate of the primary outcome measures. Acceptability
      of the intervention will be assessed using the Intrinsic Motivation inventory (IMI)
      administered on completion of the study.

      When a participant is recruited and consented to the study (via the services they attend)
      they will be randomised to either an intervention or control group.

      In the intervention group the participant will receive 1 hour a week of the CReSt-R
      intervention for 10 weeks. This will include:

        1. Cognitive remediation training (CR). Cognitive remediation training &quot;Is a behavioural
           training-based intervention that aims to improve cognitive processes [attention, memory,
           executive function, social cognition, or metacognition] with the goal of durability and
           generalisability&quot;. The programme used in this study is the Computerised Interactive
           Remediation of Cognition- Training for Schizophrenia (CIRCuiTS). CIRCuiTS is a web based
           CR programme which targets metacognition, specifically strategy use, in addition to
           massed practice of cognitive functions (Attention, memory and executive functioning).
           Collaborative goal setting related to real-world tasks are integral to the programme
           with the programme tasks and exercises increasing in difficulty in response to the
           participant's performance and progress. This will be the primary focus of 1:1 therapy
           for the first 4 weeks with remote practice sessions occurring between therapy visits.
           After 4 weeks' remote practice will continue and the focus of in-person therapy sessions
           will bridge to Social Recovery Therapy (SRT) as detailed below.

        2. Social Recovery Therapy (SRT) focuses on addressing barriers to individuals interacting
           in their social environment e.g. social anxiety. It is informed by cognitive behavioural
           theory and addresses individual goals. It occurs in three stages as defined by the SRT
           protocol - Stage one focuses on engagement with the participant and collaborative
           formulation with the purpose of identifying a problem list and establishing a
           therapeutic relationship. Stage two prepares the participant for new activities with
           identification of pathways to activity and collaboration with community stakeholders.
           Stage three promotes engagement in new activities using behavioural experiments to
           promote social activity. This is the primary focus of in-person therapy sessions from
           week 5 to 10 alongside remote practice of the CR programme.

      In the control group of the study participants will receive Treatment as Usual (TAU) plus 10
      weeks of 1:1 non-directive counselling matching the intervention group for time.

    <measure>Social and Occupational Functional Assessment Scale (SOFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post study at 12 weeks,follow up 3-5 months post study</time_frame>
    <description>The Social and Occupational Functional Assessment Scale is a global rating of current functioning ranging from 0 to 100.Lower scores represent lower functioning and higher scores represent higher functioning.For example a score of 100 represents superior functioning in a wide range of activities,a score of 50 represents serious impairment in social, occupational or school functioning, a score of 30 represents an inability to function in almost all areas of activity. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Use Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post study at 12 weeks,follow up 3-5 months post study</time_frame>
    <description>The Time Use Survey is a semi-structured interview that enquires about time spent over the past month on work, education, voluntary work, leisure, sports, housework or chores, and child care. Time spent on each of the activities is calculated in terms of the average number of hours per week. The activities are summed to create two scores: constructive economic activity (work, education, voluntary work, housework or chores, and child care) and structured activity (constructive economic activity plus leisure and sports activities).A higher score indicates superior social functioning, a lower score represents impaired social functioning. Less than 45 hours of structured activity per week is considered a threshold for being at risk of social disability, less than 30 hours per week is threshold for social disability and indicative of poor social functioning, and less than 15 hours per week is considered to reflect serious social disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>STROOP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post study at 12 weeks,follow up 3-5 months post study</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop test measures a person's sustained attention for word reading and color naming with/without interference. A computerized Stroop task measures mean reaction times (RTs) for congruent and incongruent trials. Four colour words (green, red, yellow, and blue) written in congruent or incongruent colour are randomly presented on screen. The Stroop test detects attentional interference via the measurement of response latency (calculated as mean RT for incongruent trials minus mean RT for congruent trials) when participants are asked to inhibit word meaning and indicate the ink colour of the word. Longer latencies are interpreted as greater interference by word content and lower executive function.</description>

    <measure>The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>post study at 12 weeks,follow up 3-5 months post study</time_frame>
    <description>The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory is a multidimensional self-report measure of intrinsic motivation intended to assess participant's subjective experience related to a target activity. The instrument can be modified to fit different activities (i.e. therapy). The instrument assesses participant's interest/enjoyment, effort, pressure/ tension, perceived choice and value/usefulness, thus yielding five subscale scores. In the subscales each item is a statement and the participant must indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with the statement. Item scores range from 1-7 with 1 indicating disagreement and 7 indicating agreement. Subscale scores are calculated by averaging the items scores for the number of items on each subscale. Higher scores indicate more of the concept described in the subscale name.</description>

    <measure>The Need for Cognition Scale (NCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post study at 12 weeks,follow up 3-5 months post study</time_frame>
    <description>The Need for Cognition Scale is an 18-item scale that assesses the degree to which participants seek out cognitively challenging activities of daily living and will provide supplementary information to the social and occupational functioning outcome measures. Each item of the scale contains statements relating to cognitive activities and participants must indicate whether or not the statement is characteristic of them or what they do. Item scores range from 1-5 with 1 indicating a statement is extremely uncharacteristic and 5 indicating a statement is extremely characteristic. Item scores are summed with a lowest possible score of -72 and highest score of 72. Higher scores indicate greater tendency to seek out cognitively challenging activities.</description>
