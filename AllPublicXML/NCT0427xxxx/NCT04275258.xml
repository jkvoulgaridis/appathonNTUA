  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 100 participants using a randomized control trial design to
      implement and evaluate an individualized opioid taper program supporting rural Primary Care
      Physicians (PCPs) caring for patients with moderate to severe trauma discharged on opioids.
      This study will link a trauma center Physician Assistant (PA) with rural PCPs to facilitate
      pain care and the individualized opioid taper. The investigators seek to improve patient's
      pain and opioid outcomes and support the PCPs who assume care for these complex patients
      after hospital discharge.

      Our long term goal is to provide a service that will help trauma patients as they go back
      into primary care and into pain- and opioid-free living.

      This study explores the feasibility, efficacy, and potential sustainability of a
      collaborative pain care/opioid taper strategy for patients discharged to a rural PCP practice
      on opioids after hospitalization for moderate to severe traumatic injury.

      The randomized control study design will provide important pilot data on the efficacy of
      opioid taper in the context of engaged pain management care at the PCP level when the PCP is
      supported by expert consultation and has broad implications for patient and clinician
      education.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will use a randomized controlled trial design. Patients taking opioids prior to trauma are at an increased risk for adverse opioid outcomes, therefore we will stratify randomization so that the intervention and control groups are half opioid exposed and half opioid naïve at the time of trauma, Patients with any prescription opioid use in the 30 days prior to trauma will be considered opioid-exposed, while those with no prescription opioid use in the prior 30 days will be considered opioid naïve.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Subjects will receive standard trauma discharge plan and no more than a 2-week supply of opioids. Subjects will complete surveys at baseline, 12-week, and 24-week post hospital discharge. In addition, subjects will receive:
A face-to-face meeting prior to discharge where the PA will discuss with the subject their individualized pain management plan and individualized opioid taper plan.
PA will contact subject on the phone within the first week after hospital discharge to ensure subject plans to follow up with PCP and to troubleshoot any subject concerns related to pain management.</description>

    <description>PA checks in with PCP at 1,2,4,8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks post hospital discharge by secure e-mail, fax or phone to provide opioid taper and pain management guidance until patient has tapered off opioids or returned to pre-trauma doses. PCP may contact PA whenever needed.
If PCP requests assistance or reports deviation from the planned opioid taper, PA will provide individualized consultations, which may include a revised taper plan and/or adjunctive therapy recommendations.
If there is continued deviation from the planned taper, the PA will facilitate a UW TelePain multidisciplinary telemedicine consultation.
The collaborative pain care and opioid taper intervention ends at 20 weeks.</description>
