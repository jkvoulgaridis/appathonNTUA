  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label pilot study of a 30% solution of ascorbic acid in 95% dimethylsulfoxide applied
      topically twice a day for 8 weeks as a treatment for 6 biopsy proven basal cell carcinomas in
      4 otherwise healthy adult patients. Outcome measure was biopsy proven resolution of the
      carcinoma.

      Importance

      Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, with more people diagnosed each
      year than all other cancers combined (1). Basal cell cancer is the most common form with an
      estimated 4.3 million cases diagnosed annually (2,3). Costs of treating this cancer in the
      U.S. are estimated at $4.8 billion annually (4). Task force consensus guidelines suggest Mohs
      surgery as the treatment of choice, and as the single most precise and effective treatment
      method (5). However, cost and issues of cosmesis are principal disadvantages.

      Objective

      To evaluate efficacy of a therapeutic regimen in treating basal cell cancer, consisting of
      30% ascorbic acid in 95% dimethylsulfoxide topically applied at home by patients twice a day
      for 8 weeks.

      Design, Setting, and Participants

      This case series of 4 patients with 6 lesions was conducted after biopsy proven diagnosis of
      basal cell cancer. All 4 patients sought initial non-surgical treatment. All 4 had an
      appointment set for Mohs surgery 10 wks after study enrollment, so in the event of treatment
      failure no further delay in definitive treatment would occur. Three patients were female, 1
      male, and all were over the age of 50.

      Interventions

      An 8 wk therapeutic regimen of topical 30% (w/v) ascorbic acid, 95% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide,
      and 5% (v/v) distilled water applied twice daily at home.

      Main Outcomes and Measures

      Number of lesions out of a total of six that were cancer free after 8 wks of treatment.
