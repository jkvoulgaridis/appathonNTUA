  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global disease burden of elevated blood pressure (BP) is staggering, accounting for 14%
      of deaths worldwide (7.6 million), and an estimated 10% of global healthcare expenditure.
      Despite the wide availability of clinically effective antihypertensive drugs, global
      hypertension control rates are poor, ranging from 50% in the US to as low as 20% in European
      and Asian countries.

      The exact pathophysiology of hypertension remains unclear and in the majority of cases no
      single cause is identifiable. However, emerging research investigating the impact of common
      genetic variants on BP has enabled a more detailed understanding of the biological processes
      underlying BP control. One such variant is the 677C→T polymorphism in the gene encoding the
      folate-metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The frequency of this
      variant enzyme is reported to be 10% worldwide, but ranges between 2-32%.

      MTHFR acts as a methyl donor in the reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to
      5-methyltetrahydrofolate, an essential step in homocysteine metabolism. The 677C→T
      polymorphism produces a variant enzyme with decreased activity resulting in impaired folate
      metabolism and higher homocysteine in vivo an effect found to be particularly marked in
      individuals with low folate status. Meta-analyses have linked homozygosity for the
      polymorphism (TT genotype) with a significantly higher risk of both hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD).

      The B-vitamin riboflavin, in its co-enzymatic form FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) is
      required as a cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme. The decreased enzyme activity evident in
      individuals with the TT genotype results from the increased propensity of the enzyme to
      dissociate from its FAD cofactor. However, supplementation with riboflavin appears to
      stabilize the variant enzyme in vivo; with the greatest effects seen in those with the lowest
      baseline riboflavin status. Further to this, Horigan et al. (2010) reported the elevated BP
      observed in high-risk CVD patients with the TT genotype (compared to those without the
      polymorphism) was highly responsive to low-dose riboflavin (1.6mg/d for 16 weeks). A
      cross-over, 4-year follow-up study, confirmed how stabilizing the flawed MTHFR enzyme by
      riboflavin supplementation resulted in significant BP lowering in high-risk CVD patients with
      the TT genotype.

      Observational studies have shown a significant association between homocysteine
      concentrations and BP; however numerous secondary prevention trails aimed at lowering the
      risk of re-occurring CVD events demonstrated little or no BP lowering response to B-vitamin
      intervention, despite the marked lowering of homocysteine concentrations. None of these or
      indeed any other studies have however examined BP response to folic acid specifically in
      individuals with the TT genotype. It is possible that supplementation with folic acid could
      show significant benefits to blood pressure and furthermore the combination of folic acid and
      riboflavin could indeed contribute to additional BP lowering effects in this genetically
      pre-disposed group of hypertensive individuals. To date, studies at this Centre have forced
      mainly on office blood pressure; however, in recent years central blood pressure and other
      markers of vascular health have emerged as important prognostic indicators of future CVD
      risk. The effect of this gene-nutrient interaction with respect to these novel measures is
      unknown. If shown, such findings could have major public health benefits in the primary and
      secondary prevention of CVD in genetically at-risk hypertensive individuals both in Northern
      Ireland and worldwide.
