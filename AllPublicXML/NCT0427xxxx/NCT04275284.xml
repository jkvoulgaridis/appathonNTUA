  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence of immunogenicity following a reduced dosing
      schedule of 10- or 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV10, PCV13). This is the
      follow-up of a randomized controlled trial in which children received a single priming dose
      of PCV10 or PCV13 (at 6 or 14 weeks of age) followed by booster dose at 9 months of age (1+1
      schedule), compared to a 2+1 PCV schedule (6, 14 weeks of age and 9 months of age).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2017 and 2019, we conducted an open-labelled, randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      for non-inferiority in the post-booster serotype-specific geometric mean concentrations
      (GMC's) in children randomized to receive either PCV10 or PCV13 as a 1+1 schedule (with the
      first dose occurring either at 6 or 14 weeks of age) compared to infants who received a two
      dose primary series (6 and 14 weeks of age). All six study groups received a booster dose at
      40 weeks of age, and serotype-specific IgG and opsonophagocytic activity was measured
      one-month post booster. Subjects were planned to be followed-up until 18 months of age as
      part of the initial study. In the present study, we propose to extent the follow-up of the
      cohort to include annual visit at 3, 4 and 5 years of age, to evaluate the sustainability of
      the humoral immune response of the different PCV dosing schedules.
