  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to investigate the efficacy of treatment for Kinesio tape application
      in chronic neck pain individuals.

      A total of 44 individuals were randomly divided into two groups (study group: 22, control
      group: 22). Conventional physiotherapy methods including active (exercise) and passive
      (hotpack, ultrasound and conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS))
      treatment were applied to all subjects for 15 sessions (5 days a week). In addition to the
      individuals in the study group, Kinesio tape application was performed at the end of each
      session. Pain (Visual Analogue Scale), pressure pain threshold (digital algometer), range of
      motion (CROM device), muscle strength (Hand-Held Dynamometer), muscle endurance, pectoralis
      minor muscle length, quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile) and depressive symptoms
      (Beck Depression Scale) assessments were performed before treatment, on the second day of
      treatment and after treatment (after three weeks). Treatment satisfaction with individuals
      (Visual Analogue Scale) was assessed on the 2nd day of treatment and post-treatment (after
      three weeks).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, it is seen that Kinesio tape is used in problems such as knee pain,
      chronic low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain and common musculoskeletal pain. Some studies
      with individuals with low back and neck pain show positive effects of Kinesio tape on pain
      reduction and recovery in disability. However, studies are reporting the opposite of these
      results. The number of studies in the literature is insufficient to create clinical evidence
      regarding the use of Kinesio tape in patients with neck pain. By considering this deficiency,
      the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of Kinesio tape applied together with
      conventional physiotherapy methods in individuals with chronic neck pain.
