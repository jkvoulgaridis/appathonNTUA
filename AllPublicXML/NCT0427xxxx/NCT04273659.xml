    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal
      fermentation rates of the study products as measured by breath hydrogen and methane in adult
      population with self-reported mild abdominal sensitivity to pulses. The study products are a
      pulse products with two different cereals.

      The study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, cross-over intervention trial. The aim
      is to recruit 25 subjects to the trial. The study will be conducted with a cross-over
      setting, where the subjects will go through exposure meals and breath gas measurement two
      times (two different test products) in a randomized order. The study meals are identical in
      appearance but differ in fiber content. After study breakfast the breath gases are analyzed
      every 15 minutes during 8 hours.
