      Univariate comparisons of the baseline/pre-intervention outcomes to the post-intervention
      outcomes will be performed on outcomes in order to determine how the intervention affects
      each. For continuous outcomes data the univariate comparisons of the pre-treatment and
      post-intervention outcomes will be performed using related samples t-test comparisons. For
      categorical outcomes data, comparisons of pre-intervention to post-intervention time frames
      will be performed using McNemar tests.
