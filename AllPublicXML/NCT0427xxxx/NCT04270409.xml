      Primary Objectives:

        -  Safety run-in: To confirm the recommended dose of isatuximab when combined with
           lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with high-risk smoldering multiple
           myeloma (SMM)

        -  Randomized Phase 3: To demonstrate the clinical benefit of isatuximab in combination
           with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in the prolongation of progression-free survival
           when compared to lenalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with high-risk SMM

      Secondary Objectives:

      Safety run-in

        -  To assess overall response rate (ORR)

        -  To assess duration of response (DOR)

        -  To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in participants achieving very good
           partial response (VGPR) or complete response (CR)

        -  To assess time to diagnostic (SLiM CRAB) progression or death

        -  To assess time to first-line treatment for multiple myeloma (MM)

        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of isatuximab

      Randomized Phase 3 - Key Secondary Objectives:

      To compare between the arms

        -  MRD negativity

        -  Sustained MRD negativity

        -  Second progression-free survival (PFS2)

        -  Overall survival

      Other Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate in both arms

        -  CR rate

        -  ORR

        -  DOR

        -  Time to diagnostic (SLiM CRAB) progression

        -  Time to first-line treatment for MM

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Pharmacokinetics (PK)

        -  Potential of isatuximab immunogenicity
