  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies showed dexmedetomidine (DEX) could improve surgical field, but the effect for
      functional nasal endoscopic surgery (FESS) was unclear. The investigators explored IV
      administration of a single loading dose DEX (0.5μg/kg) for FESS, and IV administration of
      midazolam (0.05mg/kg) as a control with comparision of surgical field, haemodynamics,
      ventilation parameters and recovery.

      The participants received an induction of anesthesia with propofol 2-3 mg/kg, sufentanyl 0.2
      μg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, and then insertion of a flexible laryngeal mask airway was
      conducted using the index finger insertion technique by anesthesia providers with a minimum
      of four years endotracheal intubation experience. Mechanical ventilation parameters were as
      follows: pressure-controlled ventilation mode, ventilation pressure: 12, respiratory rate:
      12, oxygen concentration: 50%. The maintenance of general anesthesia was performed with
      sevoflurane at minimum alveolar concentration of 1.3. After induction, a single loading dose
      DEX (0.5μg/kg) was IV infusion within 10 minutes, or IV administration of midazolam
      (0.05mg/kg). Heart rate, blood pressure, tidal volume, ventilation pressure and ETCO2 after
      insertion of a LMA, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes after drug infusion and transferred to
      PACU, besides heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before and after induction.
      Surgical field was evaluated at the time of 10 minutes and 20 minutes after drug infusion.
      Blood gas analysis was performed just transferred to PACU and before transferred to ward.

    <measure>Evaluation of surgical field according to the scale reported by Boezaart A.P. in the two groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of the scale reported by Boezaart A.P. as follows:
0. No bleeding.
Slight bleeding - no suctioning of blood required.
Slight bleeding - occasional suctioning required. Surgical field not threatened.
Slight bleeding - frequent suctioning required. Bleeding threatens surgical field a few seconds after suction is removed.
Moderate bleeding - frequent suctioning required. Bleeding threatens surgical field directly after suction is removed.
Severe bleeding - constant suctioning required. Bleeding appears faster than can be removed by suction. Surgical field severely threatened and surgery not possible.
Evaluation of surgical field was carried out by Kruskal-Wallis H test.</description>
