      Our research team has developed a peer coaching intervention that has been deployed to
      promote activated self-management for AYAs with several conditions, and this has been
      modified adolescents and young adults (AYA) with with congenital heart disease (CHD). This
      study will be conducted over two years and pair AYA with CHD with a peer coach who also has
      CHD has successfully navigated the transition to adult medical care and over six months will
      work to promote the motivation for self-care as well as the development of self-management
      skills. This pilot study will test feasibility and acceptability, as well as preliminary
      efficacy and long-term effects on successful transfer to adult cardiology.
