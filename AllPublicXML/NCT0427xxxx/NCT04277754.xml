    <description>Researchers will use objective tests to measure the equivalent age of development in this area with respect to their chronological age and the percentage of skills acquired in the different dimensions of the motor area.
The evidence that will be used will be for this purpose will be:
- Peabody Developmental Motor Scales- II.
It will take about 15 minutes of evaluation where the child will be asked to reproduce a series of general body movements, as well as some hand and object skills</description>
