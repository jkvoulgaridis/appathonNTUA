  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators apply a radiopathomics artificial intelligence (AI) supportive
      model to predict neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) response before the nCRT is delivered
      for the patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The radiopathomics AI system
      predicts individual tumor regression grading (TRG) category based on each patient's
      radiopathomics features extracted from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and biopsy
      images. The predictive power to classify each patient into particular TRG category will be
      validated in this multicenter, prospective clinical study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational clinical study for validation of a
      radiopathomics integrated artificial intelligence (AI) system. Patients who have been
      pathologically diagnosed as rectal adenocarcinoma and defined as clinical II-III staging
      without distant metastasis will be enrolled from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
      University, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College and Sir Run Run Shaw
      Hospital Affiliated by Zhejiang University School of Medicine. All participants should follow
      a standard treatment protocol, including neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (nCRT),
      total mesorectum excision (TME) surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Images of Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and biopsy hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides of each patient
      should be available before nCRT treatment. The tumor region within these images would be
      delineated manually by experienced radiologists and pathologists. Further, the outlined
      images will be presented to the radiopathomics AI system to classify each participant into
      particular tumor regression grading (TRG) category. Here, the American Joint Committee on
      Cancer and College of American Pathologist (AJCC/CAP) 4-category TRG system is served as the
      standard. The actual TRG category of each participant will be confirmed based on pathologic
      assessment after TME surgery. Through comparisons of the predicted TRG and actual TRG
      category, investigators calculate the prediction accuracy, specificity and sensitivity as
      well as the F1 score. This study is aimed to develop a reliable and robust AI system to
      predict pathologic TRG prior to nCRT administration, facilitating response-guided precision
      therapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
