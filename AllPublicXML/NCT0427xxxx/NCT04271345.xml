  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims to evaluate the relationship between the heterogeneity of pulmonary microbiota
      and clinical and outcome variables among critically ill patients admitted to the intensive
      care unit (ICU). In patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, an aliquot of
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid will be used in the microbiology laboratory for the
      analysis of respiratory microbiota through next-generation sequencing technologies and
      validate computational techniques.

      Traditionally, microbiological investigations and clinical trials have contributed to the
      definition of lower airways as a physiologically sterile district, whose microbiological
      balance is altered when a respiratory infectious process occur. Actually, the introduction of
      molecular study methods aiming at the identification of pathogens through genomic sequencing
      questioned the pardigm of &quot;one bug-one disease&quot;, according to which we usually tend to
      consider a bronchial or pulmonary infectious event as due to the pathogenic role of a single
      exogenous microorganism. In such a contest, there are truly few data dealing with the
      characterization of respiratory microbiota in human BAL as well as with the major
      determinants of this phenomenon and the possible impact on clinical and microbiological
      outcomes. Our study, although it's a pilot one, aims to evaluate these aspects in a larger
      cohort of critically ill patients, observing the relationship between the heterogeneity of
      pulmonary microbiota and clinical and outcome variables. In patients undergoing invasive
      mechanical ventilation, an aliquot of BAL fluid will be used in the microbiology laboratory
      for the analysis of respiratory microbiota through next-generation sequencing technologies
      and validate computational techniques. For each enrolled patient, we will register
      demographic, clinical and laboratory variables. The benefits deriving from this study lay in
      the possibility of improving the understanding of characteristics of critical patient's
      pulmonary microbioma and its clinical impact. Such an information meets the increasingly
      topical need to customize medical interventions, especially in the context of critically ill
      patients.
