  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to evaluate the influence of a 635nm diode laser on the stability of
      orthodontic mini-implants in vitro, as well as mini-implants failure rate (mini-implant loss)
      and patients pain level after the treatment. A randomized clinical split-mouth trial was
      concluded with 22 subjects (14 women, 8 men), 44 orthodontic mini-implants with a diameter
      1.4mm and length of 10mm. Mini-implants were placed between teeth 3 and 4; and 13 and 14
      (Universal Numbering System), in the area of the attached gingiva, 2 mm below mucogingival
      junction.

    <description>The mini-implants stability was estimated employing a Periotest device (Medzintechnik Gulden e K, Modautal, Germany). The Periotest measurement system includes the sound formed from contact between an object and a metallic tapping bar in a handpiece, which is electromagnetically driven and electronically verified. The Periotest response detection is analyzed through a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Simply put, the Periotest answer to tapping is estimated by an accelerometer and then analyzed. The signal generated by tapping is then transformed to a value called the Periotest value (PTV), which depends on the damping characteristics of the peri-implant tissue. The Periotest Test values (PTVs) are based on a numerical scale ranging from −8 to +50, defined by mathematical computation. The lower Periotest values indicate higher implant stability and thereupon the higher absorption effect of the target objects.</description>

    <measure>Pain level (NRS scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient received a questionnaire for individual pain assessment (the numeric rating scale, NRS-11, grade level 0-10) immediately following placement of mini-implants. The maximum pain level was measured at both sides of the maxilla during the first day after the treatment. The NRS-11 scale consists of a conscious, subjective assessment of the pain experienced; therefore, it is used in the case of patients over ten years old.
0 = no pain, 1-3 = mild pain, 4-6 = moderate pain, 7-10 = severe pain.</description>
