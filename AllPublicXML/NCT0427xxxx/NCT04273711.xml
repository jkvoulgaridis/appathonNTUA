  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a growing public health concern in most western countries. More and more patients
      with high body mass index (BMI) are undergoing surgical procedures of all kinds and, in this
      context, obese patients are undergoing thyroid surgery more than ever before. This study
      showed that obesity, in the field of thyroid surgery, is not associated with any increase of
      postoperative complications. Thus, it is possible to conclude that thyroidectomy can be
      performed safely in obese patients.

      Background: Obesity is a growing public health concern in most western countries. More and
      more patients with high body mass index (BMI) are undergoing surgical procedures of all kinds
      and, in this context, obese patients are undergoing thyroid surgery more than ever before.
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether thyroidectomy can be considered safe in
      obese patients.

      Methods: Patients undergoing thyroidectomy in our Unit between January 2014 and December 2018
      were retrospectively analysed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2
      were included in Group A, while those with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 in Group B.
