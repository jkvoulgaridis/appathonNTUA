      Consenting women with evidence of poor ovarian reserve will be randomly assigned to treatment
      with either Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) or Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP).

      As women age oocytes are gradually depleted with a consequent progressive loss of ovarian
      function and fertility. When a woman's follicle cohort falls below a critical level, she
      enters a transitional time of diminished ovarian reserve known as ovarian aging. Recently the
      use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (A-PRP) has been proposed as an additional strategy
      for improving ovarian function. A-PRP is prepared from autologous blood using an FDA approved
      device. The rationale for the use of PRP is that it contains growth factors which stimulate
      cellular anabolism, inflammatory modulators that create an anti-inflammatory effect and
      fibrinogen which acts as a scaffold for regenerating tissue. We hypothesize that the growth
      factors present in PRP may have a beneficial effect promoting growth and recruitment of
      antral follicles. We will recruit a prospective cohort of 90 patients with evidence of
      Premature Ovarian Aging/DOR. Women invited to participate in this RCT will have FSH above 12
      and AMH below 1.0 ng/mL respectively and will have had fewer than 6 oocytes retrieved in a
      previous ovulation attempt. Consenting participants in this trial will be randomized in a
      doubly blind fashion to two groups. One will receive Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and the other
      will receive Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP). Women assigned to PPP will be offerred PRP in a
      future cycle if they so desire.

Using a 20-gauge 6-inch spinal needle 2 ml of Platelet POOR Plasma will be drawn off the supernatant from each tube to leave 2.5 ml of Platelet Rich Plasma in the tube. The tube is inverted several times to suspend the platelet pellet.
