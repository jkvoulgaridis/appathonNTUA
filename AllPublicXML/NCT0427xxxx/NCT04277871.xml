    <textblock>
      This study was an experimental study with repeated measures. Study aims were to examine the
      effects of pelvic floor muscles training (PFMT) combined with yoga on improving
      genitourinary/climacteric symptoms, the pelvic floor muscles strength, and health-related
      quality of life (HRQL). Study participants were assigned to the intervention group or
      comparison group. Data analyses were based on the information obtained from 91 midlife women
      with a mean age of 56.6 years. Information related o the pelvic floor muscles strength was
      only obtained from 45 women. Descriptive statistics were used to represent study
      participants' individual characteristics, genitourinary/climacteric symptoms, the pelvic
      floor muscles strength, and HRQL. Paired t tests, independent t tests, and Generalized
      Estimating Equation (GEE) procedures were used to examine the intervention effects.

      This study was an experimental study with repeated measures. Study aims were to examine the
      effects of PFMT combined with yoga on improving genitourinary/climacteric symptoms, the
      pelvic floor muscles strength, and HRQL. Study participants were randomly assigned to the
      intervention group or comparison group. All study participants received an educational
      section (a discussion section and an abbreviated practice section) and related educational
      materials. The intervention group attended on-site group practice sessions and performed
      individual home-based practice. The comparison group performed individual home-based practice
      only. Data analyses were based on the information obtained from a sample of midlife women
      with a mean age of 56.6 years. Relevant information was mainly collected by a structured
      questionnaire. Information related to the pelvic floor muscles strength was only obtained
      from 45 women in the intervention group by using the FemiScan pelvic floor therapy system.
      Descriptive statistics were used to represent study participants' individual characteristics,
      genitourinary/climacteric symptoms, the pelvic floor muscles strength, and HRQL. Paired t
      tests, independent t tests, and GEE procedures were used to examine the intervention effects.
