  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEG is a fusogen, a type of chemical that aids in mediating cell fusion. PEG helps nerve
      cells recover neuronal continuity by removing plasmalemmal-bound water which opens the axonal
      ends on both sides of the injury. Opening axonal ends permits the nerve ends to reconnect and
      begin regeneration. PEG has been tested on animal models extensively and in earthworm models
      has been shown to induce fusion rates in 80-100% of neuronal cells. In crushed or severed
      mammalian sciatic nerves PEG has enhanced neuronal continuity to baseline functioning levels.

      Human applications for PEG have been tested by Bamba and colleagues in a case series with
      encouraging results. No studies, to our knowledge, have prospectively examined the use of PEG
      in peripheral nerve injuries. We propose a placebo controlled, double-blinded randomized
      controlled trial to test the hypothesis that local PEG administration can enhance sensory
      nerve regeneration following digital nerve transection compared to surgery alone.

    <measure>Change in Sensory Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Testing to be done at one month, three months, and six months post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory recovery will be assessed by a blinded and trained OT through standardized testing with static two point discrimination (s2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing (SWMT). The end point will be composite in nature as both s2PD and SWMT are important to gauge and are the gold standards in determining sensory recovery.</description>

    <description>In order to prepare PEG 3350 50% weight/volume, 25 grams of the sterilized PEG 3350 will be measured out and placed into a sterilized glass bottle then 25 mL of sterile water will be added. The solution will be allowed to rest for 10 minutes so that dissolution may occur. More sterile water will then be added so the total volume is 50mL. This solution will then be sterilized by the Halifax Health Infirmary pharmacy department using a liquid autoclave cycle of 120 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes in a glass vial. The 50 mL solution will be portioned into 2mL sterilized glass vials using a standard aseptic technique. The solutions will be kept at a solid frozen state between negative 25 degrees Celsius and negative 10 degrees Celsius for a maximum of 45 days. The solutions will be removed from storage on the day of surgical utilization in order to ensure storage guidelines are kept to the highest standards.</description>
