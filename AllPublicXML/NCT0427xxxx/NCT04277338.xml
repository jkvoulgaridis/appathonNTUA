      The study should evaluate distribution of 99mTc- HE3-G3 in patients with primary
      HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.

      The primary objective are:

        1. To assess distribution of 99mTc- HE3-G3 in normal tissues and in tumours over time;

        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc- HE3-G3;

        3. To obtain initial information concerning safety and tolerability of 99mTc- HE3-G3 after
           single intravenous injection:

      The secondary objective are:

      1.To compare the tumour imaging data with the concerning HER2 expression obtained by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of biopsy
      samples.

      should evaluate distribution of 99mTc- ADAPT6 in patients with primary HER2-positive and
      HER2-negative breast cancer.
