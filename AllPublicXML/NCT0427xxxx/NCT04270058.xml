        There will be 2 cohorts:

        Cohort 1 will be pregnant patients who have been exposed to at least 1 dose of TEGSEDI
        within 25 weeks prior to conception or during pregnancy.

        Cohort 2 will be pregnant patients who have hATTR-PN, who were not exposed to TEGSEDI or
        have not received TEGSEDI within the previous 25 weeks prior to conception.

        The exposed cohort will include pregnant patients from any country where TEGSEDI is
        marketed and/or clinical trials, post-market studies and registries are being conducted or
        expanded access programs are available.
