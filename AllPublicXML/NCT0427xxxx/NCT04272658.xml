      The value of 4D body-to-whole dynamic acquisition in FDG PET / CT to differentiate
      progression / pseudo-progression during the first therapeutic assessment (PET1) of metastatic
      melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)to predict the progression of the
      disease..
