  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclamptic women with and without chronic periodontitis were recruited for the study.
      Subgingival plaque samples and placental tissue samples(postpartum) were obtained from the
      participants for the microbial analysis(bacteria, viruses) and MIR155 levels and comparison
      was done among groups. this study was designed in order to evaluate the role of periodontal
      microorganisms in preeclampsia and to find compare the MIR155 levels among participants, so
      as to check its importance as a biomarker for inflammatory disease like preeclampsia.

      Four hundred forty five pregnant women, aged 18-35 yrs were selected and were divided into
      four groups. Controls- 145 systemically and periodontally healthy, Group A-100 Systemically
      healthy women with chronic periodontitis, Group B- 100 Preeclamptic women with chronic
      periodontitis, Group C-100 Preeclamptic women without chronic periodontitis. Age, BMI,
      Socioeconomic status and periodontal parameters such as plaque index(PI), bleeding on
      probing(BOP), probing pocket dept(PPD), clinical attachment level(CAL) were recorded.
      Subgingival plaque and placental tissues (postpartum) were collected and assessed for
      periodontal pathogens such as Tannerella forsythia(Tf), Treponema denticola(Td),
      Porphyromonas gingivalis(Pg), Prevotella intermedia(Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum(Fn). Herpes
      Simplex Virus(HSV), Ebstein Barr Virus(EBV), Human Cytomegalovirus(HCMV). microRNA155 levels
      were also assessed and compared between the groups.
