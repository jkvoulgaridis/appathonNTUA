  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DreaMed Advisor Pro, is a software which automatically analyses treatment information,
      learns patient's needs and accordingly suggests adjustments in insulin dosing (FDA approved
      decision support system). The Advisor Pro uses information gathered from glucose monitoring
      (sensor readings or capillary blood glucose measurements), insulin dosing and meal data
      during daily routine home care. Following a 5 minute data collection and analysis, the
      algorithm learns and suggests pump-setting changes for optimization of glucose control. The
      algorithm is designed as an advisory tool for health care professionals and has three main
      components: First, data analysis report - a statistical analysis of the insulin pump and
      sensor data: insulin delivery, bolus-calculator rate of use, sensor glucose variables,
      hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic patterns. Second, recommendations, alert messages based on
      aforementioned data for example &quot;pay attention- you skipped boluses&quot;, basal/bolus ratio is
      too high, bolus delivery compliance, glucose target recommendations and more. Third, a
      recommendation for new insulin pump settings: including basal intervals and rate, different
      carbohydrate ratio according to time of day, correction factor and insulin sensitivity time.
      The Advisor Pro can be used to optimize insulin pump setting during clinical visits,
      in-between visits or as part of virtual (telemedicine) visit. The objective of the proposed
      study is to evaluate the use of Advisor Pro by Health Care Providers for regular clinical
      visits and in between visits titration for adjustment of insulin pump settings. The study
      design is an open label, prospective, observational study that will include up to 100
      participants with Type 1 Diabetes using insulin pumps and monitoring glucose levels by
      continuous glucose monitoring including flash glucose monitoring.
