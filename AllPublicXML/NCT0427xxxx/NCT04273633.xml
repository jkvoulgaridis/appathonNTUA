  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      448kilohertz capacitive resistive monopolar radiofrequency is a novel technique in
      physiotherapy and its usefulness and clinical relevance is still to be investigated at both
      clinical practice and also in performance. Current studies show promising results in
      different musculoskeletal disorders, however there no studies in the assessment of quality
      soft tissue in sporty population after the used of this technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders, presenting a high
      prevalence in primary care centers and sport populations. Many factors have been proposed as
      the cause of pain, however there are no studies analysing possibilities of preventing
      shoulder injuries by using a radiofrequency stimulus.

      The use of 448kilohertz capacitive resistive monopolar radiofrequency as the focus of the
      treatment looking for improve the quality of the tissue is still to be explored.

      The hypothesis of the present project is that focus treatments on 448kilohertz capacitive
      resistive monopolar radiofrequency on the shoulder will produce better outcomes in terms of
      ultrasound assessment measured by quantified elastography, and this will decreased the
      possibilities of get injured.

      The stimulus will be carried out on the shoulder region (suprascapular, axillar, subscapular,
      long thoracic or pectoralis nerves) and the thoracic region. All interventions will be
      developed by the same examiner, who is a physiotherapist with 6 years of clinical experience.
