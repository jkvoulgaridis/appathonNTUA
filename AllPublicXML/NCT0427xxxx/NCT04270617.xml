  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is notoriously difficult to treat and is a primary contributor to lost
      work days and excessive health expenditures, and whose treatment has, in part, contributed to
      the opioid crisis. Surgery is only an option in a minority of these patients, usually
      confined to those with structural instability. Yoga is an ancient modality whose benefits are
      currently being studied.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a 6 week standardized yoga
      practice is superior to usual conservative therapies in the treatment of chronic back pain at
      6 months. There is enough data that the most recent ACP guidelines have included yoga as a
      treatment for chronic back pain, but more data needs to be generated regarding the efficacy
      of this modality in treating the chronic back pain population.

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. Improvement will be measured by the lower score out of a 100, which reflects less disability.</description>

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. Improvement with those with Yoga will be seen by higher scores in SF-36 which indicate lower disability.</description>

    <intervention_name>Yoga program</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention will be a 6-week ashtanga yoga program designed by world-renowned yogi Eddie Stern. Eddie Stern is an internationally known Ashtanga yoga teacher, in independent practice not affiliated with NYULH, who has done significant work exploring the physiology and science of yoga. He is not currently engaged in his own research. The yoga protocol for chronic back pain was designed with poses specific to addressing core strength but are gentle enough for patients in pain. The protocol is designed to be directed by a teacher initially but can be done at home and is only 18 minutes in duration.</description>
