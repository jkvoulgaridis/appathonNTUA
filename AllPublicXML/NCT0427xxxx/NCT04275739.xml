  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and initial utility of a brief
      academic goal-relevant episodic future thinking (A-EFT) task among heavy college drinkers.

      First, the study attempts to extend the temporal reach of EFT interventions which have
      demonstrated immediate reductions in discounting, and alcohol demand. The current study
      utilized a longitudinal design to evaluate whether EFT can change drinking behavior outside
      the lab in heavy drinking college students. The two-group experimental design included an
      active control group, weekly booster contact, and 1-month follow-up. Second, this study seeks
      to investigate whether the process of engaging in EFT is sufficient to produce effects when
      cues are not presented during the decision-making task. Lastly, this study adds an academic
      goal-related focus to the EFT task based on previous research indicating that forming
      meaningful academic goals is protective against drinking and associated problems.
