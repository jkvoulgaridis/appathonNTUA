      A randomized control trial, pre and post study involving 105 subjects randomized into 3 arms:

        -  Control : received conventional education group

        -  Intervention 1 : received conventional education group + mobile application-based
           diabetes education

        -  Intervention 2 : received mobile application-based diabetes education + health coaching

      Conventional education group divided into 6 session, which for each session consist of 2
      different topics and lasts for 60 minutes.

      Mobile application-based diabetes education is using DM Educorner (Diabetes Mellitus
