  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition which affects 1 in 2500 newborn infants and is
      the commonest genetic condition in the UK. 1 in 25 of the white population carry the
      mutation. The genetic defect prevents the movement of fluids from cells, leading to thickened
      secretions and injury. With improvements in treatments from the commonest organ affected, the
      lungs, patients born with CF now can expect to live into their 40s with more than 60% living
      past 16.

      Though better, more can be done. As treatments from lung complications have improved, the
      management of liver disease (second commonest organ involved) remains unchanged for a
      considerable time. Treatment options are limited with liver transplant the only curative
      option. Though potentially life-saving, it has risks and an organ shortage means alternative
      treatment options are desperately needed.

      Identifying those with or at risk of Cystic Fibrosis related liver disease is difficult due
      to inadequate diagnostic tools. Routine blood tests are unreliable; therefore specific blood
      tests to identify scarring of the liver (biomarkers) are urgently needed. Ultrasound scan,
      the recommended diagnostic investigation, is only accurate in identifying the late stages of
      liver disease. For new therapies to be most effective we need to be able to identify patients
      at a much earlier stage.

      This study will use multi-modality testing, including imaging techniques such as FibroScan,
      MRI scan and blood tests (biomarkers), to diagnose those with liver scarring and use this to
      better categorise disease.

        The study population will be selected from the Manchester Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre.

        For the initial stage of the study 200 patients will be selected who are attending for
        their annual reviews. At this stage they will be consented, have bloods taken and FibroScan
        performed.

        From this initial cohort, they will be classified into presence and absence of liver
        disease based on current guidelines. From this 20 patients from each group along with 20
        healthy volunteers will then undergo MRI scan.
