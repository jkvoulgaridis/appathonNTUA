  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-centre, prospective, single-arm, open-label pilot trial assessing
      the feasibility and safety of unilateral MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy
      for refractory hand tremor in up to 12 patients with multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting,
      primary progressive or secondary progressive MS). This study will be conducted at the Focused
      Ultrasound Centre of Excellence and MS Clinic located at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre/
      University of Toronto. Patients with stable MS and refractory hand tremor providing informed
      consent will receive MRgFUS thermal ablation of the Vim thalamus contralateral to the most
      affected side of the body (frequently this will be the dominant hand).
