    <textblock>
      Protocol YY-20394-007 is a phase1 open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of YY-20394 in participants with relapse and/or refractory B cell
      malignant hematological tumor. eligible participants will initiate oral therapy with YY-20394
      at a starting dose of 80mg taken once per day. treatment with YY-20394 can continue in
      compliant participants as long as the study is still ongoing and the participants appear to
      benefiting from treatment with acceptable safety.
