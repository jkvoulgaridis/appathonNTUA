  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the the effect of Thera Togs soft orthotic
      undergarment on modulation of the spinal geometry and mobility in sagittal plan in children
      with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty children with spastic diplegic CP will be assigned and randomly distributed into two
      equall groups (A&amp; B). Control group (A) will receive conventional rehabilitation program for
      postural correction 2 hours/3 sessions' weekly/3 successive months. Study group (B) will
      receive conventional rehabilitation protocol as in group (A) plus wearing TheraTogs soft
      orthotic undergarment. Children evaluation will be carried out before and after the
      intervention programs to assess postural deviations using the Formetric system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a definite diagnosis of spastic diplegia obtained from medical files or personal
             physicians and supported by magnetic resonance images (MRIs).

          -  Their weight should be less than 40 kg.

          -  The degree of spasticity in the affected lower extremity will ranged between grades
             (1, 1+&amp;2) according to Modified Ashworth Scale.

          -  The levels of gross motor function will be selected at level II according to Gross
             Motor Function Classification System.

          -  The children will be included have the ability to stand alone for five minutes.

          -  Children should be able to understand and follow instructions.

          -  The degree of the spinal kyphosis ,for all participated children , in sagittal plane
             should be not more than 55° as Kyphosis above 55° is considered as fixed
             hyper-kyphosis while

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with GMFCS levels III, IV, and V or use any assistive mobility devices

          -  Children suffering from allergic problems in their skin.

          -  Children with visual, auditory or cognitive deficits.

          -  Fixed and significant deformities of the lower limb and spine.

          -  Children with surgical interference for the lower limb and spine within the previous 2
             years.

          -  Children with seizures.

          -  Children with fixed hyper-kyphosis (kyphotic angle is more than 55°).

          -  Children who used any medications (e.g., steroids) that affect growth or body
             composition.
