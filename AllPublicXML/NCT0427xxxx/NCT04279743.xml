  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, ~17 millions of adults between 30-64 y old could benefit from a prevention
      strategy to lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a lot of epidemiological
      studies reported positive cognitive outcomes in populations eating fish, there is skepticism
      about the link between docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 (OM3) fatty acid in fish and
      prevention of cognitive decline. This is largely because there is a disconnect between
      epidemiological, molecular and animal studies which generally favor a link between higher DHA
      intake and cognition whereas clinical DHA and fish oil trial seem not to support such as
      link. There are several knowledge gaps in this field that might explain why clinical trials
      were not successful. This project will focus on two major gaps : OM3 fatty acid metabolism
      and the blood-to-brain DHA link. OM3 supplements in cardiovascular disease have faced the
      same issues for decades but the more recent trials have now generated the clinical evidence
      supporting primary and secondary cardiovascular events reduction and a better risk to benefit
      balance of OM3 drugs compared to statins, for instance. What if, for cognitive decline, the
      target was missed because the supplement/drug formulations were not appropriately designed to
      target the brain? The investigators hypothesize that (i) E4 carriers display a faulty
      packaging of circulating OM3, leading to reduced bioavailability for brain cells, (ii) The
      use of new OM3 formulation can direct plasma DHA into brain compartments more readily
      available for the brain, thereby increasing brain DHA concentrations and improving cognition.
      Studies in mice and humans will be performed to test OM3 metabolism and the blood-to-brain
      DHA link. Ultimately the information generated in this research project will help to better
      design clinical trials in term of fatty acid formulation, expected level to reach in the
      plasma and the brain.

All plasma samples collected during the research project will be anonymized i.e. it will not be possible to identify the participant by his name since a number will be assigned to him. The code key linking the participant's name to his number will be stored, with access restricted to those designated by the principal investigator.

    <description>The intervention is a randomized double blind parallel design testing the metabolism of a krill oil omega-3 phospholipid supplement compared to fish oil omega-3 triglycerides in carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE4 allele. Half of the carriers and non-carriers will receive phospholipids and the other half will receive triglycerides. The intervention choice will be randomized and double blind.
Participants will be instructed to take 4 supplements every day (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening) (4 g/ day of phospholipids), providing 1.8 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids. They will come back fasted to the research center on weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 of the study for blood draws. The omega-3 fatty acids metabolism will be compared between the carriers and non carriers of the ApoE4 allele.</description>
