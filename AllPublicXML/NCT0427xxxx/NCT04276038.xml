  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease affecting joint cartilage and its surrounding
      tissue. It is the leading cause of disability in the elderly. The treatment of this disease
      remains limited to symptomatic relief and, ultimately, joint replacement. Despite the
      progress made in understanding the pathophysiology of OA, effective disease-modifying drugs
      are still lacking.

      Low-level laser therapy (LLLT), also known as Photobiomodulation therapy, is a non-ionizing
      optical radiation in the visible or near infrared range of the spectrum. LLLI has been used
      widely for alleviation of pain, reduction of inflammation, and acceleration of wound healing.
      Specifically, it has been shown to reduce pain in chronic inflammatory related knee
      pathologies in pre-clinical and clinical studies. However, the recommended treatment protocol
      requires frequent treatments that translates to frequent visits at the clinic. Such a
      treatment regimen is difficult for Knee OA (KOA) patients and demanding of the clinical
      staff. Since the treatment itself can be self-applied easily, a home-use device would enable
      frequent treatments thereby improving patient adherence to the treatment.

      In a pilot study, Kruglova et al [4] reported that 2 weeks of daily treatments with the home
      use B-Cure laser significantly reduced pain and increased flexibility in 20 elite athletes
      with KOA.

      The purpose of the current study is to determine if B-Cure laser treatments, applied at home,
      by the patient or personal caregiver in a real-life situation, can reduce pain and improve
      functionality in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

    <description>Patients will self-treat at home (active or sham), twice a day (excluding Weekends) for 1 month. The duration of each session will be 15-20 minutes and will include treatment over painful point on the knee and over regional lymph nodes (popliteal, inguinal). The treatment dose should be initiated gradually for the first week until reaching the maximum dose of 6-8 minutes per treatment point. This is the recommended dose for near infrared lasers for the indication of knee pain by the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT). In the first days an increase in pain may be felt before the reduction in pain. If the increase in pain continues for more than a week under graded dosimetry, the treatment must be stopped.
Laser therapy will be administered to the patients in addition to standard of care therapy as customary in our institution.</description>

    <description>Half of the LLT devices will be not activated at random before the application to the patients. Sham activated devices will give outward signs of normal function but will not generate a signal. The investigators will be unaware of the device's functionality. The patients will not be able to determine whether the device is working or not. At study completion, device serial numbers will be used to determine which patients received a working device.</description>

    <description>The B-Cure laser pro is a portal, non-invasive, low level laser therapy device, that emits light in the near infrared (808nm) over an area of 1X4.5 cm2 with power output of 250mW, and energy dose of 1J/cm2. The device is used at home and is self-applied by the patient. The device is AMAR approved (approval # 14810408) for pain reduction and for ulcer treatment. The device is also approved for marketing in Canada and as a medical device in Europe (CE medical mark).</description>
