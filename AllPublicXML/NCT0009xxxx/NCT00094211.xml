    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether seniors living in neighborhoods that are
      conducive to walking are more physically active than those living in neighborhoods that are
      less conducive to walking.

      BACKGROUND:

      Despite the recognized benefits of regular physical activity for older adults, people over
      the age of 65 remain among the most inactive groups of the U.S. population. Efforts to
      understand the factors influencing physical activity in this important group have been
      limited primarily to demographic and psychosocial domains. The importance of the neighborhood
      environment in influencing a host of health, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes has been
      recognized. However, to date, no systematic investigation of the relationship between
      objective and subjective environmental factors and objectively measured physical activity
      levels among older adults has been undertaken.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This observational study will investigate whether seniors living in neighborhoods conducive
      to walking are more physically active, after adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES), than
      those living in neighborhoods less conducive to walking or other forms of physical activity
      for transportation or recreational purposes. Additional questions of interest concern the
      moderating effects of physical function and the proportion of seniors living nearby on the
      relationship between environment and physical activity. The study will take advantage of the
      sampling, recruitment, and data collection methods of an ongoing NIH-funded research project
      aimed at integrating public health and urban planning frameworks in studying the impacts of
      environmental factors on physical activity levels in younger adults. Population-based
      sampling methods will be used to recruit adults over 65 years of age who are living in more
      walkable versus less walkable neighborhoods of varying SES levels. Participants will be
      recruited from Seattle, Washington (n = 600) and Baltimore, Maryland (n = 600). In addition
      to objectively measured physical environment (using geographic information systems {GIS}) and
      physical activity levels (using accelerometry), self-reported neighborhood environment,
      physical activity, and quality of life variables of particular relevance to older adults will
      be assessed twice during a 12-month period.

    <measure>Physical Environment Factors Using Geographic Information Systems [GIS]</measure>
    <time_frame>at two time points, 6 months apart, which were averaged</time_frame>
    <description>Physical environment factors measured using GIS-derived measures of street connectivity, residential density, and mixed land use in participant block groups and a network buffer around each participant's home. A walkability index was created for a 500 meter street network buffer around participant homes. The walkability index was calculated for each census block group in the regions by summing the z-scores of four macro built environment measures: 1) net residential density, 2) intersection density, 3) retail floor to land area ratio (FAR), and 4) mixed use. A higher scores indicates higher walkability. The minimum value is -4.08 and the maximum value is 12.5.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessment at baseline and 6 months, with the data across these two time points averaged to increase outcome stability.</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report physical activity questionnaire that assesses weekly frequency and duration of various activities typically undertaken by midlife and older adults over the prior 4-week period. Self-reported walking for errands is one physical activity item assessed. The measure has been shown to have good test-retest reliability (stability) and construct and concurrent validity, and has been shown to be sensitive to change in a variety of adult populations. It has seven frequency categories (from less than 1 hour a week to 9 or more hours per week). The minimum value is 0 and the maximal value is variable. (See Stewart AL, Mills KM, King AC, et al. CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Adults: Outcomes for Interventions. Med Sci Sports Exerc, 33:7, 1126-1141, 2001.)</description>

    <description>Ambulatory assessment of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity using a validated Actigraph accelerometer. Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer during waking hours for seven days at each of the two measurement points. The accelerometer was placed over the right hip. Data were cleaned and scored using MeterPlus version 4.0 software.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessment at baseline and 6 months, with the data across these two time points averaged to increase outcome stability.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is walking/cycling facilities which is a mean of 5 items. The minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Higher scores indicate an environment that is supportive of walking and cycling which is a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Physical Environment Factors Using Geographic Information Systems [GIS]</title>
        <description>Physical environment factors measured using GIS-derived measures of street connectivity, residential density, and mixed land use in participant block groups and a network buffer around each participant's home. A walkability index was created for a 500 meter street network buffer around participant homes. The walkability index was calculated for each census block group in the regions by summing the z-scores of four macro built environment measures: 1) net residential density, 2) intersection density, 3) retail floor to land area ratio (FAR), and 4) mixed use. A higher scores indicates higher walkability. The minimum value is -4.08 and the maximum value is 12.5.</description>

        <title>Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) Self-reported Walking for Errands</title>
        <description>A self-report physical activity questionnaire that assesses weekly frequency and duration of various activities typically undertaken by midlife and older adults over the prior 4-week period. Self-reported walking for errands is one physical activity item assessed. The measure has been shown to have good test-retest reliability (stability) and construct and concurrent validity, and has been shown to be sensitive to change in a variety of adult populations. It has seven frequency categories (from less than 1 hour a week to 9 or more hours per week). The minimum value is 0 and the maximal value is variable. (See Stewart AL, Mills KM, King AC, et al.

        <title>Neighborhood Environment for Walkability Survey (NEWS) - Land Use Mix Access</title>
        <description>The scale is land use mix access which is a mean of 7 items. The minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Higher scores indicate easier access to services which is indicative of a high walkability environment (i.e., a better outcome).</description>
        <time_frame>Assessment at baseline and 6 months, with the data across these two time points averaged to increase outcome stability.</time_frame>

            <description>Households were enumerated in King County, WA and in the Baltimore, MD-Washington, DC area based on geographical information systems-derived walkability index and neighborhood-level income. Four quadrants were derived based on these two factors: higher walkability-higher income; higher walkability-lower income; lower walkability-higher income; and lower walkability-lower income neighborhoods. This arm represents the High Walkability/High Income quadrant.</description>
