  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased numbers of white blood cells called eosinophils can cause disease. To investigate
      this disease, researchers need blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, skin and/or
      bone marrow samples to compare to samples from patients with this problem. Some of the
      samples will be used for genetic testing or future research.

      This study will last for about 10 years and will include a maximum of 50 paid volunteers ages
      18 to 65.

      This protocol is designed to provide blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, skin
      biopsy and bone marrow aspirate samples from paid, volunteer donors for use in in vitro
      studies of eosinophilia and parasitic diseases. Donors meeting standard normal donor
      eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal
      fluid, skin biopsy and/or bone marrow using conventional techniques. The investigational
      nature of the studies in which their samples will be used, as well as the risks and benefits
      of the donation process will be explained to all donors, and a signed informed consent
      document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule
      based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. Samples provided through this protocol
      will be used solely for in vitro research. Blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid,
      skin biopsy and bone marrow samples will be assigned a unique product number, and the study
      investigators listed on this protocol will serve as the custodians of the code that links the
      product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the specimens
      collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol and will be
      described in general terms only, since it involves several IRB-approved LPD protocols.
      Because some of these protocols require normal controls without a history of asthma or
      allergic disease, all subjects will undergo a standardized allergy/asthma history at
      enrollment. Serum immunoglobulin levels and a basic RAST panel may be performed on sera from
      some normal donors, and some normal donors may be asked to undergo pulmonary function
      testing. This protocol is designed to assure adequate and complete informed consent,
      counseling, and protection of the study subjects according to IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other
      applicable Federal regulatory standards.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation are based on the Standards of
             the AABB(2) and the Code of Federal Regualtions 21 CFR 640(3). Specific criteria
             follow:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (blood, urine, stool and/or sputum donation):

          -  ability to sign informed consent

          -  healthy, male or female

          -  18-85 years of age

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (blood, urine, stool and/or sputum donation):

          -  pregnancy

          -  weight &lt;110 pounds

          -  history of heart, lung, kidney disease, chronic anemia or bleeding disorders

        Eligibility criteria for volunteer bone marrow, skin and cerebrospinal fluid donation are
        more stringent than those for other specimen donations to minimize risk of procedure
        complications and maximize utility of specimens for study:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and/or skin donation):

          -  ability to sign informed consent

          -  healthy, male or female

          -  18-85 years of age

          -  willingness to provide concurrent blood sample

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and/or skin donation):

          -  a known bleeding disorder, low platelets (&lt;100k) or taking medications that interfere
             with blood clotting, such as aspirin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents or
             warfarin

          -  anemia (hemoglobin less than 12.3 mg/dL)

          -  evidence of an immune deficiency, such as HIV infection or cancer

          -  pregnancy

          -  taking a medication that affects the immune response within the past month, including
             oral, intravenous, or injectable steroids

          -  allergic to xylocaine

          -  have taken an investigational drug in the last 6 months

          -  any other medical condition that the investigator feels puts the participant at too
             high a risk for participation

               -  warfarin and/or heparin treatment will not be stopped so that a subject can
                  participate in this protocol. If warfarin or heparin was recently discontinued, a
                  subject can be enrolled, but no bone marrow procedures will be performed until
                  the PT is &lt; 15.5 seconds and the PTT is within normal range. For other agents
                  that interfere with blood clotting without prolonging the PT, a 7- day washout
                  period will be required before bone marrow sampling, skin biopsy or lumbar
                  puncture.

        Additonal exclusion criteria (cerebrospinal fluid):

        -Previous diagnosis of central nervous system pathology (including tumors,

        inflammatory conditions, infection, seizure disorder, spina bifida)

          -  History of spinal surgery with hardware placement

          -  History of any spinal surgery or injections of the lumbosacral spine

          -  Headache on the day of donation

        Additonal exclusion criteria (skin biopsy):

        -History of keloid or abnormal scar formation
