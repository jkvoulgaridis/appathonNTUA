    <textblock>
      PRIDE will evaluate the impact of weight loss on urinary incontinence in a randomized,
      controlled trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three hundred and thirty overweight and obese women with urinary incontinence, 165 from each
      of two Clinical Centers, will be randomized to either a 6-month intensive behavioral weight
      control program or to usual care (no weight reduction intervention) and followed for 18
      months. Efficacy of weight reduction as a treatment for urinary incontinence will be examined
      at 6 months following the intensive weight control program, and the sustained impact of the
      intervention will be examined at 18 months. To increase the maintenance of weight reduction
      and facilitate evaluation of the enduring impact of weight loss on urinary incontinence, we
      propose to study a motivation-based weight maintenance program. At the end of the intensive
      weight control program, women randomized to the weight loss program will be randomized to
      either a 12-month skill-based maintenance intervention or to a motivation-based maintenance
      intervention. The maintenance interventions maximize the potential for sustained weight loss
      and will allow us to determine if long-term weight reduction will produce continued
      improvement in urinary incontinence.

    <description>Participants in the weight loss arm will receive an intensive group-based behavioral weight loss program. In the first six months of the intervention, all participants in the weight loss arm will be given skill-based diet and exercise prescriptions for weight loss and will be taught specific cognitive and behavioral skills to assist in the modification of their eating and exercise habits. Participants will meet weekly for 6 months in group sessions led by a nutritionist, exercise physiologist, or behaviorist and will follow a structured protocol. This intervention strategy is modeled on interventions that have been successful in other overweight populations and is similar to the programs implemented in our ongoing studies, such as Look AHEAD. With this intervention, women are expected to lose on average of 7-9% of their initial body weight.</description>

    <description>Women randomized to the Structured Education Program will be invited to participate in hour long group educational sessions at months 1, 2, 3, and 4. At months 6, 9 and 15, the groups will meet again for group support sessions. The content of these education and support sessions will include information about weight loss, physical activity, healthy eating habits and general health promotion. The educational sessions will be delivered primarily in a group format, with individual make up sessions provided for participants who miss group sessions.</description>
