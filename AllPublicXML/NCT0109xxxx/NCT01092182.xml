  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (BL) is highly treatable, but most of the standard therapies
           require multiple doses of intensive chemotherapy that may require long hospital stays
           and frequently have severe side effects. In addition, BL is a fairly common type of
           cancer in patients who also have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but treatment
           outcomes are poor because standard treatments do not work very well in HIV-positive
           patients and the more intense treatment regimens are highly toxic. New approaches are
           needed that expand the ways to treat BL with the same efficiency but with reduced side
           effects.

        -  DA-EPOCH-R is a standard chemotherapy treatment that consists of the drugs etoposide,
           prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab. It may be able to
           treat BL with similar effectiveness but with fewer side effects. Researchers are
           interested in confirming the results of previous studies that investigated the
           effectiveness of DA-EPOCH-R in treating BL.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of DA-EPOCH-R in treating Burkitt lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma and have
      not had any prior chemotherapy treatments.

      Design:

        -  Individuals will have a series of blood and other tests to determine their suitability
           for participating in the study. Eligible participants will be divided into high-risk and
           low-risk groups based on their disease prognosis and the possibility that the BL may or
           already has spread into the central nervous system.

        -  Participants will receive intravenous infusion of the six chemotherapy drugs in
           DA-EPOCH-R in 21-day treatment cycles. The exact doses will be adjusted depending on
           participants white blood cell counts and other tests.

        -  High-risk participants will receive six cycles of DA-EPOCH-R. To treat BL that may have
           entered the central nervous system, high-risk participants will also receive infusions
           of other chemotherapy drugs into their spinal fluid.

        -  Low-risk participants will receive up to six cycles of DA-EPOCH-R, with an additional
           dose of rituximab during each cycle.

        -  Frequent blood and urine tests will be performed during treatment, as well as body
           imaging scans and other tests of cancer progression as directed by the study doctors.
           Participants will receive additional medicines to help prevent possible adverse side
           effects of DA-EPOCH-R.

        -  Participants who respond successfully to the treatment will be asked to return for
           follow-up exams every 3 months for the first 18 months, then every year for the next 3
           years. Participants who do not respond successfully to the treatment will be given the
           opportunity to participate in additional research and treatment protocols, if any are
           available.

      Background:

        -  Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (BL) is highly curable. Standard treatment employs doseintense
           multi-agent chemotherapy and though effective is associated with high morbidity.
           Therefore, novel approaches are needed that improve the therapeutic index of BL while
           maintaining or improving efficacy. In HIV+ BL, outcome has been poor, mainly due to the
           use of CHOP based regimens in this disease.

        -  Two NCI phase II trials have used EPOCH chemotherapy with 1 or 2 doses of rituximab (R)
           per cycle in untreated BL. (Dose-adjusted) DA-EPOCH-Rituximab has been used in16 HIV
           negative BL, and 8 HIV positive patients have received 3 to 4 cycles of EPOCHRR to
           minimize toxicity and risk of opportunistic infections. All patients remain in
           continuous remission. Treatment was very well tolerated and represents a novel
           therapeutic strategy in BL.

        -  This trial seeks to assess the effectiveness of a risk adaptive approach with DA-EPOCHR

      in untreated BL (HIV+/-). Because this treatment represents a major conceptual

      departure from standard treatment, it is important to obtain additional Phase II results in

      limited/advanced stage BL

      -c-MYC positive DLBCL is a rare variant of DLBCL. There is very little data on the biology of
      this disease and what the optimal therapeutic approach should be has not been

      defined. Therefore, based on our impression that this behaves aggressively and is likely
      characterized by a high tumor proliferation rate, we plan to accrue patients with this
      disease in addition to BL patients.

      -Plasmablastic lymphoma, another variant of DLBCL is frequently characterized by the
      activation of MYC and has had a poor outcome historically with standard treatment. We plan to
      include these patients in the study also. As they are CD20 negative, they will

      receive DA-EPOCH without Rituximab.

      Objectives:

        -  Determine PFS, EFS and OS of risk adaptive DA-EPOCH-R in untreated BL and c-MYC + DLBCL
           and DA-EPOCH in c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma.

        -  Assess predictive value of early FDG-PET/CT scans on PFS.

        -  Obtain pilot comparative molecular profiling in HIV negative and positive BL and c- MYC
           + DLBCL, including c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Burkitt lymphoma, c-MYC + DLBCL and c-MYC + plasmablastic lymphoma age greater than or
           equal to 18 years.

        -  No prior treatment except limited-field radiotherapy, short course of glucocorticoids

      and/or cyclophosphamide for an urgent problem at diagnosis.

      -Adequate major organ function unless impairment due to lymphoma.

      Study Design:

      -Phase II Study of risk adapted DA-EPOCH-R in BL, c-MYC + DLBCL and DA-EPOCH

      in c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma

        -  Low risk: DA-EPOCH-RR x 3 cycles.

        -  High risk , c-MYC + DLBCL and c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma : DA-EPOCH (+/-) R x 6
           cycles or 8 cycles in select patients.

        -  CSF cytology and flow cytometry for analysis of BL.

        -  High Risk CSF negative - Prophylactic intrathecal treatment

        -  CSF positive - Active intrathecal treatment

        -  FDG-PET/CT pre- and post-cycle 2 in all patients.

        -  A total of 194 patients will be enrolled in the protocol.
