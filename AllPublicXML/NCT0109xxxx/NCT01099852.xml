  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arbovirus refers to a group of viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. There are
      hundred which have been shown to cause disease in humans. The incubation period is usually
      limited between 1 and 15 days. The most common clinical features of infection are 4:
      algo-eruptive, hemorrhagic fever, neurological or arthritic afflictions.

      Dengue is a mosquito-born viral disease caused by 4 different serotypes of virus. Dengue
      fever (DF) is defined by the sudden onset of fever with non-specific constitutional symptoms,
      recovery occurring spontaneously after 3 to 7 days.

      The infection can sometimes progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) characterized by a
      transient increase in vascular permeability provoking a plasma leakage syndrome. DHF can be
      complicated by shock and internal hemorrhage. Other rarer but potentially life-threatening
      complications include encephalitis, hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis and myocarditis.

      There is currently no way of predicting the outcome of DF or DHF and the WHO classification
      lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity to recognize and guide the management of severe
      forms of dengue. The pathophysiology of these severe forms is also poorly known.

      Since the early 2000s, the French West Indies and French Guiana have become hyperendemic for
      dengue with simultaneous circulation of the 4 serotypes, regular large outbreak and severe
      dengue including fatalities.

      Chikungunya is a re-emerging alphavirus causing massive epidemics in Africa, in the Indian
      Ocean and Southeast Asia. The first autochthonous cases were described in French Antilles in
      Nov. 2013. The disease consists of an acute illness like dengue fever, characterized by
      abrupt onset of a high-grade fever, followed by constitutionals symptoms, poly-arthritis and
      skin involvement. Usually, the illness resolves within 4 to 6 weeks. However, severe clinical
      forms in early stage may appear and chronic forms such as incapacitating arthralgia which
      affect 40 to 60% of patients with confirmed chikungunya. In France, others arboviruses may
      cause severe emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like Zika or West Nile. In
      non-immunized population they may cause outbreaks with specific severe clinical
      complications. French interministerial mission on emerging infectious diseases, coordinated
      by Professor A. Flahault, recommended such studies.

      Principal objective To identify demographic, clinical, biological, virologic, immunologic and
      genetic factors associated with or predictive of severe complications of arbovirus infections
      (shock, internal bleeding, organ failure, death) in a cohort of children and adults with
      confirmed arbovirus infections, in France.

      Secondary objective

      To identify demographic, clinical, biological, virologic, immunologic and genetic factors
      predictive of altered quality of life after confirmed an acute arbovirus infection. Onset of
      specific complications:

        -  Hemorrhagic fever (dengue :WHO criteria..)

        -  Neurological disorders (West Nile virus infection, Zika virus infection, Japanese
           encephalitis…)

        -  Chronic chikungunya (persistent musculoskeletal symptoms for more than three months
           after symptoms onset)

    <description>The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint defined as the occurrence, within 12 weeks of the onset of arbovirosis, of at least 1 of the following events: death or shock or internal bleeding, or failure to one or more organs or systems (brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, hemostasis).
