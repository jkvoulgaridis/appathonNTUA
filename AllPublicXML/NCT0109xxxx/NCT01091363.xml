  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence is very common among Asian Americans; yet, research on understanding and
      treating nicotine dependence in this group is almost nonexistent. The proposed study is a
      first attempt to develop a smoking cessation program that is tailored to Korean-culture
      specific aspects. It is proposed that Korean Americans who receive a culturally tailored
      smoking cessation program will be more likely to have prolonged abstinence at 12-month
      follow-up than their counterparts who receive brief cessation counseling. Subjects in both
      arms receive nicotine patches for 8 weeks. Self-reported abstinence is validated with exhaled
      carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Korean men have been known for very high smoking rates and the highest cancer death
      smoking-attributable fraction. In contrast, Korean women reportedly smoke at low rates
      compared to the general U.S. population. However, recent population-based survey data
      indicate steady increases in smoking prevalence of Korean American women. Particularly, it
      has been found that they tend to initiate smoking as they acculturate into social norms of
      American women. Preliminary data of the applicant and others suggests interventions must be
      culturally adapted and a motivation-based and family-involved approach is most promising. The
      training plan will help the applicant develop an independent program of drug abuse research
      that focuses on better understanding and treating tobacco dependence among Asian Americans,
      including evaluating culturally competent and gender-specific interventions. The research
      plan will examine the impact of culture and gender on nicotine dependence and utilize
      National Institute on Drug Abuse behavioral therapy development methods. The proposed
      research plan has two-phases and evaluates tobacco dependence treatment with Korean Americans
      (N = 164, 50% women). Phase 1 is a no-control group study (Stage Ia) that is aimed at
      developing an intervention manual of Group-based Motivational Interviewing (GMI)
      intervention, therapists' adherence and competence scales, training program, and small
      feasibility intervention study with 20 Korean-American (offered separately for men and
      women). Phase 2 is a randomized controlled trial (Stage Ib) with 144 Korean Americans that is
      conducted to assess feasibility and relative effectiveness of the GMI behavioral intervention
      in conjunction with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in comparison with a brief group
      medication management of NRT. Gender-interaction effects of psychosocial variables on
      treatment outcomes will be assessed, including acculturation and depression. This award will
      help prepare the applicant for an independent research career focusing on Asian Americans and
      Nicotine Dependence, including adapting and testing new interventions for different
      populations.

    <description>Perceived family norm toward quitting smoking was assessed using the Perceived Family Norm Index consisting of two items assessing normative beliefs (i.e., &quot;I believe that my family [my friends] wants me to quit smoking&quot;) and motivation to comply with the belief (i.e., &quot;I am willing to comply with the belief&quot;). Score for each item can range from −3 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to +3 &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The total score is the sum of the scores of the two items and can range from -6 to +6.</description>

Self-reported abstinence was biochemically verified with expired-air CO (&lt; 6 parts ppm) and saliva cotinine (≤ 30ng/ml) tests. We used a Micro+ Smokerlyzer CO Monitor (Bedfont Scientific, NJ) and NicAlert® test strips.</description>

Score for each item can range from −3 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to +3 &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The total score is the sum of the scores of the two items and can range from -6 to +6.</description>
