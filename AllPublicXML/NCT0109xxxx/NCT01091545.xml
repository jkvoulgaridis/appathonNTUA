      To compare digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with full field digital mammography (FFDM)
      regarding effectiveness as screening modalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mammography is the only approved method for breast cancer screening, but not all tumors can
      be detected with mammography. The main reason is overlapping structures that can either mimic
      or hide a tumor on a 2-dimensional image like mammography. Digital breast tomosynthesis,
      (DBT) is a 3-dimensional x-ray technique that has been developed during the last years. A
      tomographic technique like DBT, which reduces or eliminates the detrimental effect of over-
      and underlying tissue, can probably help to find more tumors. This study aims to investigate
      whether more breast cancers can be detected with DBT compared to full field digital
      mammography (FFDM) in population invited to screening. An interim analysis will be performed
      during 2013 including the first 7,500 women of the study cohort.

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer detection will be assessed for DBT and DM respectively. The following screening performance measures will also also investigated: the number of detected cancers per 1000 women screened, the number of recalled women/100 screens (recall rate) after consensus, and the positive predictive value (PPV) for screen-recall and the negative predictive value (NPV), in both reading arms. Analyses of the contribution from different reading steps will be investigated. A follow-up period of 24 months after the intervention period will provide information on the actual numbers of breast cancers in the study population through record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry.</description>

    <description>Women in the study will once undergo both standard FFDM screening (2-views) and DBT (1 view, MLO). This will result in a doubled radiation dose compared to only 2-view FFDM, which is the standard procedure for women in the screening program.</description>
