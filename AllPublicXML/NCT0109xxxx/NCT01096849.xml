  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, randomized, comparator-controlled
      study of plazomicin administered intravenously compared with levofloxacin, a standard
      approved intravenous therapy for complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) and acute
      pyelonephritis (AP).

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Attained Microbiological Eradication (MBE) at the Test of Cure (TOC) Visit in the Microbiological Intent to Treat (MITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to TOC (Day 12)</time_frame>
    <description>MBE was defined as documented eradication of all isolated pathogens. This was based on a urine culture, taken at the TOC visit that showed that all pathogens isolated at baseline at ≥10^5 colony forming unit(s) per milliliter (CFU/mL) were reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to the end of study (Day 40)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered to be drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and it does not imply any judgment about causality. Adverse events also include the exacerbation or worsening of a condition present at screening other than the index infection for which the patient was enrolled in the study. A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered to be drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and it does not imply any judgment about causality. Adverse events also include the exacerbation or worsening of a condition present at screening other than the index infection for which the patient was enrolled in the study. A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study drug.</description>

        <description>MBE was defined as documented eradication of all isolated pathogens. This was based on a urine culture, taken at the TOC visit that showed that all pathogens isolated at baseline at ≥10^5 CFU/mL were reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL.</description>
