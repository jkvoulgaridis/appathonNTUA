  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled study to be conducted in two parallel study arms for
      a six month period (three doses). Approximately 10 eligible patients per center will be
      enrolled and will receive afamelanotide (16 mg implants) or placebo according to the
      following dosing regimen:

        -  Group A will be administered afamelanotide implants on Days 0, 60 and 120

        -  Group B will be administered placebo implants on Days 0, 60 and 120

      To determine eligibility for study inclusion, patients will undergo a screening evaluation 7
      to 14 days prior to the administration of the first dose. The number and severity of
      phototoxic reactions will be determined Days 60, 120, and 180. Quality of life will be
      measured using the EPP specific questionnaire (EPP-QoL) every 60 days and the DLQI
      questionnaire every 7 days, beginning at Day 0 until Day 180. Participants will visit the
      clinic on Days 60, 120 and 180 for assessments of adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Afamelanotide is a man-made drug being studied for use as a preventative medication for EPP
      sufferers. It is a synthetically produced analogue of human alpha melanocyte stimulating
      hormone (alpha-MSH) and is not yet available on the market.

      The purpose of this study is to look at whether afamelanotide can reduce the number and
      severity of EPP symptoms when patients are exposed to light between 10:00 and 20:00 hours.
      This study will also look at how the drug is tolerated when taken by people with EPP.

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a
      placebo (inactive medication).

      Over 450 subjects have been treated with afamelanotide to date with no serious safety
      concerns identified. For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled
      release depot injection (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly
      into the body over a few days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after
      afamelanotide has been released and will slowly dissolve.

      This study will help to provide more information about afamelanotide. This information will
      be used to determine the safety and efficacy (the ability of the drug to produce an effect)
      of this drug in EPP sufferers.

    <measure>Time in Direct Sunlight Between 10:00-15:00 on Pain-free Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of direct sunlight exposure between 10:00 and 15:00 hours on days when no pain was experienced (e.g. 11-point Likert pain score of 0). Time was recorded in a patient dairy using 15 minute time blocks.
The pain score is measured by the 11-point Likert Pain scale with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10.
Likert Pain scale of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Severity of Phototoxic Reaction Experienced by Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The maximum severity of a phototoxic reaction was determined by the highest daily 11-point Likert scale score that occurred during that phototoxic reaction.</description>

    <measure>Change of Total Protoporphyrin IX Level in Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 60, Day 120, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>This was an exploratory assessment only to analyze whether afamelanotide-induced change in sun exposure would result in a reduction of protoporphyrin IX.
The changes of the Total Protoporphyrin IX Level (μg/dL) from Screening Visit (ITT Population) were measured between the two groups.
The Protoporphyrin IX level is a laboratory parameter that is measured in specialist labs.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Phototoxic Reactions With Likert Severity Scores ≥ 4 and ≥ 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who experienced phototoxic reactions with Likert severity scores ≥ 4 and severity scores ≥7 were recorded.
A derived endpoint was used. The number of participants who reported at least one phototoxic reaction with a Likert severity score of ≥ 4 was recorded. For severity scores ≥ 7, the number of patients who reported at least one phototoxic reaction with a Likert severity score of ≥ 7 was recorded.
The 11-point Likert pain scale ranges from minimum of 0 to maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <measure>Number of Phototoxic Reactions Experienced by Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The number of phototoxic reactions was determined by counting the number of episodes on which participants report a 11-point Likert scale score of 4 or more for one or more consecutive days.</description>

    <measure>Total Severity of Phototoxic Reactions Experienced by Participants Over the Entire Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary.
On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert Pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The total severity of phototoxic reactions was determined by the sum of daily 11-point Likert scale scores that occurred during phototoxic reactions. The overall sum of the severity per participant over the entire study was analyzed. The theoretical minimum score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 1800.</description>

        <title>Maximum Severity of Phototoxic Reaction Experienced by Participants</title>
        <description>The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The maximum severity of a phototoxic reaction was determined by the highest daily 11-point Likert scale score that occurred during that phototoxic reaction.</description>

The changes of the Total Protoporphyrin IX Level (μg/dL) from Screening Visit (ITT Population) were measured between the two groups.
The Protoporphyrin IX level is a laboratory parameter that is measured in specialist labs.</description>
          <population>One active participant and one placebo participant withdrew after Baseline assessment and no data was provided for the analysis of this endpoint.
The overall number of participants analyzed differs from the total number of study participants because the data was either incomplete and/or missing.</population>

        <title>Number of Phototoxic Reactions Experienced by Participants</title>
        <description>The days on which the participant experienced pain as a result of phototoxic reactions (caused by exposure to natural light) was recorded in a study diary. On each day such a reaction occurred, the participant scored the level of pain using an 11-point Likert pain scale, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 10. The 11-point Likert pain scale with a value of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.
The number of phototoxic reactions was determined by counting the number of episodes on which participants report a 11-point Likert scale score of 4 or more for one or more consecutive days.</description>
