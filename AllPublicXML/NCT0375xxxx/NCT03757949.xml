    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well nutrition therapy works in improving immune
      system in patients with bladder cancer that can be removed by surgery. Improving nutrition
      before and after surgery may reduce the infections and other problems that sometimes occur
      after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the impact of consuming perioperative specialized immunemodulating drinks (SIM,
      Impact Advanced Recovery, Nestle) to oral nutrition supplement control drinks (ONS, Oral
      Nutrition Control, Nestle) on post-operative complications (any versus [vs.] none) within 30
      days after scheduled radical cystectomy (RC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether SIM use compared to ONS reduces late-phase post-operative complications
      within 90 days after scheduled RC.

      II. To assess whether SIM use compared to ONS reduces infections. III. To assess whether SIM
      use compared to ONS reduces skeletal muscle wasting. IV. To assess whether SIM use compared
      to ONS reduces high grade post-operative complications.

      V. To assess whether SIM use compared to ONS reduces readmission rates. VI. To assess whether
      SIM use compared to ONS improves quality of life. VII. To assess whether SIM use compared to
      ONS improves disease-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of SIM use on the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

      II. To assess the impact of SIM use on pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil: lymphocyte
      ratios.

      III. To assess the impact of SIM use on post-operative arginine deficiency and amino acid
      metabolism.

      IV. To explore the association of dietary intake variables (nutrition status, calories,
      protein, and immune-enhancing factors) and study outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive SIM orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days -5 to -1 and 1-5. Patients
      undergo standard of care surgery on day 0.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO TID on days -5 to -1 and 1-5. Patients undergo standard
      of care surgery on day 0.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2, 30, and 90 days, and at 6, 9, 12,
      18, 24, and 36 months after surgery.

    <description>A post-operative complication is defined as a binary indicator variable indicating whether the patient experienced any complication (any/none; Clavien-Dindo grades I-V). The primary analysis will be based on a multivariable logistic regression under intent-totreat among all randomized patients, irrespective of their eligibility status, adjusting for the specified stratification factors: a. Diversion type (neobladder versus [vs.] ileal conduit); b. Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy (any vs. none); and c. Nutrition status (well nourished vs. moderate malnutrition). A Fisher?s exact test will also be conducted to establish whether the results are sensitive to model assumptions. A single interim analysis for efficacy will be conducted when 50% of patients achieve their endpoint at the alpha=0.005 level. Accordingly, the final analysis will be conducted at the alpha=0.045 level. A separate analysis among all eligible randomized patients will also be conducted.</description>

    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Complications will be defined using surgery-specific categories (ileus, deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, wound infection, urinary tract infection, return to operation room, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, dehiscence, sepsis, respiratory failure, bowel leak, urine leak, small bowel obstruction, death, or other). Post-operative ileus will be defined as a delay in feeding of greater than or equal to five days post operatively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in fat mass and non-bone lean tissue (muscle mass) will be assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The fat-free mass index and the appendicular skeletal muscle will be examined over time. Body weight (in a hospital gown without shoes) will be measured using a digital scale accurate to +/- 0.1 kg. Two measurements will be taken and averaged; if the two measurements differ by greater than 0.2 kg, a third measure will be taken. Height will be determined using a wall-mounted stadiometer (+/- 0.1 cm). Two measurements will be taken and averaged; if the two measurements differ by greater than 0.2 cm, a third measure will be taken.</description>
