  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no external noise is present. The Center for Disease
      Control (CDC) estimates over 50 million - nearly 15% of the general public -experience some
      form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, with 2
      million experiencing extreme and debilitating symptoms.

      The 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline on tinnitus from the American Academy of Otolaryngology
      - Head and Neck Surgery summarized the existing state of tinnitus management by stating &quot;A
      cure for primary tinnitus does not yet exist, and despite claims to the contrary, no method
      has been proven to provide long-term suppression of tinnitus.&quot;

      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and efficacy of cochlear promontory
      stimulation in the short term relief of tinnitus. The secondary goal of the study is to
      determine the optimum region(s) of the cochlear promontory in planning for an implantable
      electrical device for long term tinnitus suppression.

      Candidate subjects will undergo a temporal bone Computed Tomography (CT) scan, contrast
      enhanced head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), audiogram with immittance testing, pitch and
      level matching of tinnitus, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) and Auditory
      Brainstem Response (ABR) testing prior to promontory stimulation. Head MRI, DPOAE, audiogram
      and immittance testing are considered clinically routine for assessment of asymmetric
      tinnitus. Temporal bone CT, ABR, tinnitus pitch, level matching, masking levels and residual
      inhibition testing are not standard clinical assessments for asymmetric tinnitus. In
      addition, subjects will complete the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Functional
      Index (TFI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaires three separate times within the week
      prior to promontory stimulation testing. Additional testing for comorbid anxiety and
      depressive conditions will be a screening Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ8), and short Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI-S). The NEO Personality
      Inventory (NEO PI) will be administered to provide baseline information. The initial session
      of promontory stimulation will define optimal stimulation parameters (i.e., location, current
      level, pulse-width, phase polarity), where maximal tinnitus suppression occurs with minimal
      or no auditory percept. After these parameters are established, the patient will complete the
      THI, TFI, and VAS immediately prior to stimulation, during stimulation, and following
      completion of stimulation at 10-minutes, 1-hour, 24-hours, 48-hours, and 1-week following
      completion of stimulation. In addition, pitch and level matching of tinnitus will be
      completed immediately upon completion of each promontory stimulation session. Each patient
      will undergo three successive treatments separated by 1-week. Prior to each treatment, the
      patient will receive an audiogram and DPOAE testing to document interval safety. At the
      conclusion of the study, subjects will be asked about their willingness to undergo surgical
      implantation of a device capable of long-term scheduled or on-demand electrical stimulation
      for tinnitus suppression

Scores categories are (1-16: Slight or no handicap - Grade 1), (18-36: Mild handicap - Grade 2), (38-56: Moderate handicap - Grade 3), (58-76: Severe handicap - Grade 4), (78-100: Catastrophic handicap - Grade 5).</description>

    <description>There will only be one arm. The patient and investigator will initially be blinded to the &quot;on-off&quot; status of the electrode. The patient will thus serve as an internal control for testing. Once device integrity and possible benefit is confirmed, the patients will undergo non-tactile electrical stimulation to the bone of the inner ear (cochlear promontory) for short term relief of tinnitus via Cochlear promontory stimulation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cochlear promontory stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Promontory stimulation is an established otologic procedure that was initially developed as a diagnostic tool to assess patient candidacy for cochlear implantation. Promontory stimulation is most commonly performed in the outpatient setting on an awake patient by placing a single insulated probe through a topically anesthetized tympanic membrane and applying monopolar current for several seconds to minutes. The initial session of promontory stimulation will define optimal stimulation parameters (i.e., location, current level, pulse-width, phase polarity), where maximal tinnitus suppression occurs with minimal or no auditory percept. Additional stimulation testing visits will confirm these findings.</description>
