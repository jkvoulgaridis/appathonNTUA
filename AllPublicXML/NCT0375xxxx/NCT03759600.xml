      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib in participants
      with advanced, relapsed, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer who have received 3 or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens.

      The drug being tested in this study is called niraparib. Niraparib is being tested to treat
      people who have the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive, advanced, relapsed,
      high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. This
      study will look at the efficacy and safety of niraparib in Japanese participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be enrolled to one
      group and after that will be asked to take niraparib capsules at the same time each day
      throughout the study:

      - Niraparib 300 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 23 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the
      treatment period, and the post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the
      last dose of the study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Japanese female participants aged 20 years or older on the day of signing informed
             consent.

          2. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          3. Participants must agree to undergo tumor HRD testing, and this test result must show
             that participants have an HRD-positive tumor (defined by the presence of a deleterious
             or suspected deleterious breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation or be positive for genomic
             instability) by the central laboratory selected by the sponsor.

             Note 1: The study HRD test result must be received prior to enrollment. The tumor
             sample may be submitted for HRD testing prior to the screening period (ie, within 40
             days before Cycle 1 Day 1) if the consent has been obtained and it appears the
             participant is likely to meet other eligibility requirements.

             Note 2: If historic blood germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) is detected by a prior
             gBRCAmut testing, then tumor HRD sample test results are not required prior to
             enrollment; however, HRD testing still needs to be performed.

          4. Participants must have histologically diagnosed, relapsed, high-grade (Grade 2 or 3)
             serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with recurrent
             disease and must have been previously treated with chemotherapy and have not
             experienced disease progression at least 6 months to the last chemotherapy containing
             platinum-based anticancer agents.

          5. Participants must have completed 3 or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens. Participants
             must have completed their last chemotherapy regimen &gt;4 weeks prior to treatment
             initiation.

          6. Participants must have at least one measurable disease according to RECIST (v.1.1).

          7. Participants must have performance status of ≤1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scale.

          8. Participants must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following
             laboratory values:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/μL.

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL.

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5× institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) OR calculated
                  creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/minute, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤1×ULN.

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5×ULN
                  unless liver metastases were present, in which case they had to be ≤5×ULN.

          9. Participants must have formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples available from
             the primary or recurrent cancer or agree to undergo fresh biopsy prior to study
             treatment initiation.

         10. Participants must be able to take oral medications.

         11. Female participants of childbearing potential must be negative for pregnancy test
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]) within 7 days prior to receiving the first

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], condoms only, withdrawal,
                  spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.)

             abnormality (including active or uncontrolled myelosuppression [ie, anemia,
             leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the
             study, interfere with the participant's participation throughout the study period, or
             study participation is not in the best interest of the participant.

         15. Participants who are regular user (including &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs
             at the time of signing informed consent or have a recent history (within the past

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
