  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent animal research indicates that excitatory brain stimulation opens a time window of
      increased neural plasticity that permits remodeling of neural representations. Repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may thus facilitate learning of new associations by
      reducing proactive interference but human research is missing. Therefore, it is the aim of
      this study to investigate the effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a
      potent form of excitatory brain stimulation, on associative memory. Twenty right handed
      healthy participants will receive 3 minutes of iTBS or sham stimulation of the left lateral
      parietal cortex after memorizing a set of 20 face-word associations. Recall capacity will be
      tested directly before and after stimulation. Participants will then learn a new combination
      of associations using the same set of stimuli, followed by an evaluation of their recall
      capacity. It is hypothesized that iTBS compared to sham stimulation will reduce recall
      capacity directly after the stimulation but increase recall capacity of the newly learned
      associations due to reduced proactive interference. This study may not only pave the way
      towards a new understanding of the mechanism of action of brain stimulation, but can also
      help in developing new treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.

    <description>iTBS comprises 3-pulse 50-Hz bursts, applied every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) as described previously (Huang, Edwards et al. 2005) and consists of 2-second trains with an inter-train-interval of 8 seconds. We will repeat trains (30 pulses; 10 bursts) for 20 times to reach a total number of 600 pulses per session (3x10x20)</description>
