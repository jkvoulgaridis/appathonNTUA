  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Related to urological and gynecological systems, patients with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome
      (CPPS) often present pain, pressure and chronic discomfort in suprapubic and perineal area
      associated with low urinary tract symptoms. This condition can generates a negative impact in
      cognitive, social, behavioral and sexual quality of life.

      As Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome originates from different causes and includes the
      genitourinary, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and neuropsychological systems, a
      multidisciplinary approach is needed with doctors,physiotherapists, psychologists and others.
      Physiotherapeutic interventions are recommended as first line of conservative treatment for
      patients with CPPS. The physiotherapeutic interventions include the use of Biofeedback to
      relax the pelvic floor muscles, myofascial trigger points release, transcutaneous
      electrostimulation to decrease the pain and postural exercises to improve the pelvic
      mobility. Despite of these recommendations, the evidence of the studies in the literature is
      weak/moderate. There is no consensus related to physiotherapeutic techniques, i.e., the
      biofeedback devices,the myofascial trigger points techniques, the electrostimulation
      parameters,the use of postural exercises and short, medium and long term follow up of these
      patients. The goal of this study is to verify the effects of physiotherapeutic interventions
      in the treatment of patients with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and to compare with
      control group.

      All patients will be assessed by specialized physiotherapists through a medical history data;
      application of validated questionnaires of pain, urinary symptoms, sexual function and
      quality of life; postural evaluation; pelvic floor muscles physical and surface
      electromyographic assessment at baseline. Patients will be randomized to two different
      treatment groups and control group. One treatment will be consisted by 10 sessions, once a
      week, usingBiofeedback , myofascial trigger points release and transcutaneous
      electrostimulation. The other group will be treated by 10 sessions, once a week, using
      Biofeedback , myofascial trigger points release and postural exercises.The control group
      willstart treatment 3 months after the assessment. All patients will be re - evaluated after
      treatment, at 3, 6 and 12 months' post treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Multicenter randomized control trial. All patients will be randomized by the computer (www.random.org) in 4 groups, 2 groups of treatment and 2 control groups. Then, they will be assessed by specialized physiotherapists through a medical history data; application of validated questionnaires of pain, urinary symptoms, sexual function and quality of life; postural evaluation; pelvic floor muscles physical and surface electromyographic assessment at baseline. Patients will be randomized to two different treatment groups and control group. One treatment will be consisted by 10 sessions, once a week, using Biofeedback , myofascial trigger points release and transcutaneous electrostimulation. The other group will be treated by 10 sessions, once a week, using Biofeedback , myofascial trigger points release and postural exercises.The control groups will start treatment 3 months after the assessment.

    <description>The E-stim Group will start treatment after the assessment. Interventions:10 sessions of physiotherapeutic treatment, once a week, using SEMG Biofeedback , myofascial trigger points release and transcutaneous electrostimulation. SEMG Biofeedback device will be applied with vaginal sensors, to assess pelvic floor tenderness and to treat pelvic floor muscles disorders. The myofascial trigger points release will be applied using manual myofascial stretching and relaxation techniques to release the trigger points.The e-stim will be applied during 20 minutes on the sites of pelvic pain to decrease the pain and discomfort (analgesia). Parameters:F=100Hz; Pulse width = 70-100 us and the intensity varies according to the sensitivity of the patient.</description>
