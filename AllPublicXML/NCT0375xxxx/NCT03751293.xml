        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Volunteered to participate in this study and signed informed consent.

          2. Age 18-70 years old, male or female.

          3. Meet the internationally accepted Criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma (IMWG
             diagnostic criteria 2014).

          4. Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who meet at least one of the
             following conditions:

               -  Subjects must have received at least two therapy regimens (including proteasome
                  inhibitor or immune-modulator therapy, disease progress or relapse after the last
                  therapy).

               -  Subjects have received only one therapy regimen, but the investigators judge that
                  patients have unmet treatment needs or can't get benefit from current treatment
                  options.

          5. Subjects have one or more measurable multiple myeloma lesion, must include one of the
             following conditions:

             compression.

          7. Patients with CNS metastasis or symptoms of CNS involvement.

          8. The investigators judge that any increase in the risk of the subject or interference
             with the results of the trial.
