  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemia and reperfusion injury is unavoidable during a liver transplantation. Remote
      ischemic preconditioning, a safe and feasible method, has previously been shown to reduce
      ischemia and reperfusion injury. In the transplantation setting, focus of remote ischemic
      preconditioning has been on the donor. However, preconditioning of the recipient may be a
      better approach due to the mechanisms by which ischemic preconditioning protects against
      ischemia and reperfusion injury.

      The aim of this randomised, double-blinded clinical trial is to biochemically assess the
      liver function after application of remote ischemic preconditioning on the recipient.

      Background The use of solid organ transplantation, including liver transplantation, is the
      golden standard for many end-stage solid organ diseases. Ischemia and reperfusion injury is
      unavoidable during a liver transplantation. Remote ischemic preconditioning, a safe and
      feasible method, has previously been shown to reduce ischemia and reperfusion injury. This
      may have a similar effect in a liver transplantation setting. In the transplantation setting,
      focus of remote ischemic preconditioning has been on the donor. However, preconditioning of
      the recipient may be a better approach due to the mechanisms by which ischemic
      preconditioning protects against ischemia and reperfusion injury.

      The aim of this randomised, double-blinded clinical trial is to biochemically assess the
      liver function after application of remote ischemic preconditioning on the recipient.

      Methods 52 patients undergoing a liver transplantation, included in accordance to the
      inclusion criteria, will be allocated to an intervention group (rIC-group) and compared to a
      retrospective non-intervention control group (non-rIC group) consisting of 52 patients.
      Patients in the non-intervention group will also be included in accordance to the inclusion
      criteria. Within two hours before surgery, patients in the intervention group will be
      subjected to four rounds of five-minute inflations and five-minute deflations of a pneumatic
      tourniquet applied on the right leg.

      Follow-up time will be 30 days.

      Measurements The aim of this trial is to assess the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning
      on the extent of liver injury and inflammation as a result of ischemia and reperfusion
      injury. Assessment will be done by measurement of biomarkers relevant to liver function and
      liver injury.

    <description>The rIC procedure will be applied on seated patients, who have been resting for at least five minutes. The active rIC procedure consists of four five-minute inflations of a pneumatic tourniquet to 100 mmHg above the patient's systolic blood pressure separated by five-minute periods of complete deflation. Placement of the pneumatic tourniquet will be unilaterally on a lower limb (right thigh)</description>
