  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematological malignancy that affects older patients.
      Currently, despite recent progress, the disease relapses more or less quickly after initial
      treatment and requires the resumption of treatment with new drugs associated with cortisone,
      whose side effects are important. The investigators propose to conduct a phase 2 testing the
      combination ixazomib - daratumumab without dexamethasone.

             the following methods of birth control: subcutaneous hormonal implant, levonorgestrel
             releasing intra-uterine system, medroxyprogesterone acetate depot, tubal
             sterilization, ovulation inhibitory progesterone only pills, or sexual intercourse
             with a vasectomized male partner (vasectomy must be confirmed by 2 negative semen
             analyses). Or women will commit to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed to her
             physician on a monthly basis. Childbearing potential*. Contraception will start during
             therapy including dose interruptions, for 4 months after discontinuation of Ixazomib
             and Daratumumab.

        Criteria for women of childbearing potential:

        This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who:

          1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or

          2. has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not
             rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)

               -  A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy
                  tests at Screening, first within 28 days prior to dosing and the second within 48
                  hours prior to dosing, and remain on a highly effective method of birth control.
                  The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective
                  method and one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a
                  qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples
                  of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:

                    -  Highly effective methods: Intrauterine device (IUD) ; Hormonal (birth
                       control pills, injections, implants) ; Tubal ligation ; Partner's vasectomy

                    -  Additional effective methods: Male condom ; Diaphragm CervicalCap

               -  Serum (urine in the case where serum is not possible in a timely manner)
                  pregnancy test to be performed for all women of childbearing potential regularly
                  during the study, In addition, a pregnancy test may be done at any time during
                  the study at the discretion of the investigator if a subject misses a period or
                  has unusual menstrual bleeding.

               -  A woman of childbearing potential must remain on a highly effective method of
                  birth control. Contraception must begin 4 weeks before initiating treatment with
                  Ixazomib and Daratumumab, during therapy, during dose interruptions and
                  continuing for 4 months following discontinuation of Ixazomib and Daratumumab.
                  Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of
                  infertility, unless due to hysterectomy.

               -  A man who has not had a vasectomy and who is sexually active with a woman of
                  childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of birth control eg,
                  condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men must also
                  not donate sperm during the study, for 4 months following discontinuation of
                  Ixazomib and Daratumumab. The exception to this restriction is that if the
                  subject's female partner is surgically sterile, a second method of birth control
                  is not required.
