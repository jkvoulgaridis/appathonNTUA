  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purposes of determining the prevalence of ocular complications in inflammatory
      rheumatic diseases, the following search terms were used: conjunctivitis,
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerophthalmia, uveitis, eye hemorrhage, optic neuritis,
      papilledema, orbital disease, retinal artery/vein occlusion, macular edema, retinitis,
      chorioretinitis, scleritis, iridocyclitis, choroid hemorrhage, blindness and amaurosis fugax.

      These terms were searched in the context of a corresponding inflammatory disease on Medline,
      Cochrane and Web of Science from their inception (1966, 1991 and 1990 respectively) until the
      point of study completion.

      Studies were included if they provided numerical data of the prevalence or incidence of
      ocular manifestations in an inflammatory rheumatic disease. Studies were excluded if they
      were review articles, case reports where all patients experienced the same ocular
      comorbidity, if different comorbidities were not grouped independently, and if the study
      reported on fewer than 20 patients. When the same study cohort was used in more than one
      analysis, the most recent or largest sample-size study was included. The Strengthening the
      Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist was used to assess the
      quality of cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.
