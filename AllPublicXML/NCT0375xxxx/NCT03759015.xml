  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and the potential positive health impacts of a novel
      &quot;health education theater,&quot; which will task participants of a health education program to
      create an original 10-minute theater that is required to use the health guidelines about
      physical activity and diet/nutrition. The outcomes include the changes in (a) knowledge about
      these guidelines, (b) compliance to these guidelines, (c) health related quality of life, and
      (d) self-perception well-being measures such as self-esteem and self-efficacy.
