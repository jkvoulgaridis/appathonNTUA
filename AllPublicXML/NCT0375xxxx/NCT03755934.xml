  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study investigating the effect of MEDI7352 on chronic pain in patients with painful
      diabetic neuropathy.

      The study incudes a screening period of up to 45 days and a 12-week treatment period during
      which MEDI7352 or placebo will be administered intravenously (IV) on 6 occasions, with each
      dose separated by 14 days. There will be a 6-week follow-up period.

      Subjects will randomly be assigned to double-blind treatment with one of 4 dose levels of
      MEDI7352 or placebo

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male, or postmenopausal or surgically sterile female, 18 to 80 years of age

          -  Body mass index of ≤42 kg/m2.

          -  Chronic PDN persistent for 6 months or longer, not adequately controlled by standard
             of care treatments.

          -  mean pain intensity score of ≥4, as measured on an 11-point (0-10) NRS

          -  willing and able to discontinue all NSAID or COX-2 analgesic therapy

          -  currently be taking medication for the treatment of PDN. Subjects should be taking at
             least one of the first-line medications (consistent with regional or local standard of
             care guidelines for PDN)

        Key Exclusion criteria:

          -  Presence of other clinically significant neuropathy (eg, hereditary neuropathy,
             inflammatory neuropathy) or other clinically significant disorder (eg, nerve
             compression injury) involving abnormal peripheral sensation, with an aetiology that is
             considered to be distinct from that of PDN, and that is likely to interfere with
             assessment of peripheral nerve function, as judged by the investigator.

          -  History of osteonecrosis, rapidly progressing OA, subchondral insufficiency fractures,
             neurogenic arthropathy, or analgesia-induced arthropathy.

          -  Diagnosis of clinically significant OA currently affecting a major joint in the upper
             extremity (shoulder, elbow, or wrist) or lower extremity (hip, knee, or ankle) or
             axial spine; or other degenerative disease affecting any joint in subjects for whom,
             in the opinion of the investigator, there is an identified risk of osteonecrosis,
             rapidly progressing OA, subchondral insufficiency fractures, neurogenic arthropathy,
             or analgesia-induced arthropathy.

          -  Chronic pain condition, other than PDN, that is likely to interfere with the
             evaluation of the subject's PDN pain, as judged by the investigator

          -  Haemoglobin A1C greater than 8.5% (&gt;8.5%).
