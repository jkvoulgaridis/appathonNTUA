      The study design is a case-control, sample based study. 275 cases (Group 1), infants &lt;12
      months old with RSV infection and 40 controls (Group 2), otherwise healthy infants &lt;12 months
      old without RSV infection will be recruited. Samples will be taken on enrolment and for
      infants in Group 1; repeated at 7 weeks convalescence. There will be annual follow up by
      questionnaire for up to 3 years and a minimum of 1 year, depending at what stage in the study
      the infant is enrolled (study end is December 2021).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe disease in the very young, elderly and
      in high risk groups. Worldwide in 2005 there were an estimated 34 million cases of acute
      lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI), 3.4 million ALRI hospitalisations and 55,000 to
      199,000 deaths associated with RSV in children &lt;5 years old. RSV infection in childhood is
      associated with subsequent wheezing and asthma. These long-term sequelae pose a substantial
      additional burden on healthcare systems. There is a parallel need to assemble clinical
      resources to identify the correlates of severe RSV disease for clinical management,
      classification of disease severity in clinical trials and identification of biomarkers for
      severe disease, which are currently lacking.

      Group 1: Infants under 12 months with an RSV infection will have nasopharyngeal swabs, blood,
      urine and stool samples taken at the onset of infection and again 6 - 8 weeks later, in
      convalescence. An online diary will be completed for 2 weeks during illness to record the
      participant and parent health. The participant and their family will be followed up annually
      by questionnaire, for a maximum of 3 years. When the study data are analysed, the infants
      will be subdivided into 4 further groupsÍ¾ healthy infants requiring hospitalisation, healthy
      infants not requiring hospitalisation, infants with co-morbidity, requiring hospitalisation
      and infants with a co-morbidity not requiring hospitalisation. Group 2: Well, healthy
      infants, under 12 months with no acute respiratory infection will have nasopharyngeal
      swab,blood, urine and stool samples taken on enrolment. They will receive a follow up contact
      7 days after enrolment to assess if they have developed any illness. The participant and
      their family will be followed up annually by questionnaire, for a maximum of 3 years.

Respiratory frequency (score 0-3)
Presence of apnoea (either 0, or 3)

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline parental questionnaire followed by 14 day symptom diary at onset of illness. Subsequent annual questionnaire for total of 3 years to determine subsequent disease sequelae.
These questionnaires record symptom severity, duration of symptoms, whether the symptoms affect activities of daily living and a record of persisting symptoms. The follow up questionnaires will extract information about subsequent respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze), whether the participant has required subsequent review by a healthcare practitioner or been admitted to hospital and during of admission. It also records the need for ongoing medications.
The information extracted is qualitative in nature. There is no scale used for recording this information.</description>

    <description>RSV point of care testing will be performed (if result not already available) to confirm RSV positive status. Individuals with confirmed acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) secondary to RSV (Group 1- active) will have nasopharyngeal swabs, blood samples, urine samples and stool samples taken at the time of recruitment and again at 7 weeks (convalescence).
Group 1 participants are categorised into 4 groups as follows:
Group 1a and 1b participants are healthy infants with an RSV infection either requiring hospitalisation for at least 12 hours or not requiring hospitalisation respectively.
Group 1c &amp; 1d are infants with an RSV infection with any co-morbidity that would exclude them from Group 1a and 1b either requiring hospitalisation for at least 12 hours or not respectively.</description>
