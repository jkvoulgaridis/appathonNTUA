  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of fasting, participants are recruited in a
      5-days fasting ( without any food, except unlimited mineral water),and do some fitness
      regimen (such as meditation and mild physical exercise ) during fasting.The samples will be
      collected from participates and subjected to comprehensive analysis ,including routine
      medical examination in blood, metabonomics and proteomics anlysis in serum and urine samples,
      gut microbiome analysis in stood samples, and so on.

      1. Recruiting: 45 healthy people will be included in the clinical trial according to the
           Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

        2. Fasting : Participants fast for five days, without any food, except unlimited mineral
           water. Participants will do some fitness regimen (such as meditation and mild physical
           exercise ) during fasting.

        3. Re-feeding: Gradually distribute participants with rice flour, porridge and juice in the
           next 3 days.

        4. Follow-up :The health checklist is similar with that during fasting on the first month.

        5. Data processing, statistics and analysis. Diet monitoring: The intake of glucose
           decreases, while the burning of fat increases, which can down-regulate glucose level in
           blood, up-regulate ketone level in urine. Thus, the fasting situation of participants
           can be monitored by the variation of blood glucose and urine ketone.

    <measure>Self-rating depression scale；</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, day 3, day 5, day 8; 1 month and 3 months post fasting</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale ,includes half of items ues positive words and half is negatively,which could assess symptoms of depression. Item responses are ranked from 1 to 4, and higher scores correspond to more frequent symptoms. For each item,patients give a score according to whether the item has occurred: 1 = never/very rarely; 2 = once in a while/some of the time/occasionally; 3 = relatively often/very often/often; 4 = most of the time/always. Each items points accumulated as raw scores,the lowest raw score is 20 points, the highest raw score is 80 points. The raw scores multiply by 1.25, taking the integer part as the standard scores.The scale standard scores were used to define four categories of depression severity: within normal range or no significant psychopathology (below 51points); presence of minimal to mild depression (51-60points); presence of moderate to marked depression (61-70points).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0, day 3, day 5, day 8; 1 month and 3 months post fasting</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale contains 20 questions. Each question is scored on a scale of 1-4 (never, some of the time, relatively often, most of the time). There are fifteen questions involved in the assessment could indicate the increase of anxiety levels, and rest of the questions assessment would decrease of the anxiety levels.Each items points accumulated as raw scores,the lowest raw score is 20 points, the highest raw score is 80 points. The raw scores multiply by 1.25, taking the integer part as the standard scores.The scale standard scores were used to define four categories of anxiety severity: within normal ranger no significant psychopathology (25-49points); presence of mild to moderate anxiety levels (50-59points); severe anxiety levels (60-69points); and presence of extreme depression (70-100points).</description>

    <description>Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) at 1 day、4 day、6 day、9 day、40 day. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe) with a total score range of 0-56. Changes in HAM-A scores are calculated as the difference between the baseline HAM-A scores and scores at 1 day、4 day、6 day、9 day、40 day.</description>

    <description>Remission according to HAM-D: HAM-D17 score less than or equal to (=&lt;) 7 or a HAM-D7 score =&lt; 3. HAM-D17: standardized, clinician-administered rating scale; assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Individual items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe. Total score: 0 to 66; higher score indicates more depression. HAM-D7: subset of HAM-D17; assesses 7 items associated with major depression. Total score: 0 to 26; higher score indicates more depression.</description>
