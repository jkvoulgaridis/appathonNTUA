  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent in the sickle cell
      population, studies focusing on the associations of the two diseases and their common
      pathophysiological mechanisms are scarce. OSA is one of the most common conditions
      responsible for hemoglobin desaturation. The nocturnal hemoglobin desaturation occurring in
      some sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with OSA could trigger hemoglobin S polymerization
      and red blood cell (RBC) sickling, leading to further blood rheological alterations, hence
      increasing the risks for VOC. Moreover, OSA has been demonstrated to increase oxidative
      stress and inflammation in non Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients, which, in SCD patients,
      could increase the risk for complications. Finally, OSA is accompanied by impaired vascular
      function and autonomic nervous system dysfunction in the general population. Indeed, the
      presence of OSA in SCD could increase the clinical severity of patients and the frequency of
      VOC.
