  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive, degenerative neurological disease associated with
      profound changes in the quality of life of its survivors. Recent evidence has demonstrated
      the potential use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate cerebral
      excitability and movement control in neurological chronic conditions. However, few studies
      have investigated the effects of tDCS on postural control in patients with Parkinson's
      disease. This study aims to investigate the effect of bihemispheric tDCS on postural control
      in people with Parkinson's disease. Participants will be randomized to receive a single
      session of anodal and sham bihemispheric tDCS (7 days between each type of stimulation).

      Primary clinical outcome (balance) will be collected before and immediately after tDCS. The
      data will be collected by a blind examiner to the treatment allocation.
