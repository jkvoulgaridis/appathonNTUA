        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure (BP),
             Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Willingness to comply with contraception requirements. Subjects who are sexually
             active must use adequate contraception with their female partner throughout the study
             and until one month after the last administration of trial medication. Adequate
             methods are:

               -  Sexual abstinence or

               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening (with medical assessment
                  of the surgical success) or

               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subject's female partner or

               -  The use of condoms, if the female partner uses an adequate contraception method
                  in addition, e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal contraception (e.g.
                  implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that started at
                  least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method (e.g.
                  diaphragm with spermicide) Unprotected sexual intercourse with a female partner
                  is not allowed throughout the study and until one month after the last
                  administration of trial medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)

             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking during in-house confinement

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding
             at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
