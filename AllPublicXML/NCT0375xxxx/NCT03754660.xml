  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the effects of the inhaled drug BAY1237592 will be studied in patients with
      high blood pressure affecting the blood vessels in the lungs due to Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension (PAH) and due to Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH).
      Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by the elevation of pressure in the pulmonary
      arteries (PAP) and of the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) leading to increased workload
      of the right chamber of the heart to eject blood against this elevated resistance. The goal
      of this study is to measure the safety and tolerability of the drug as well as the reduction
      of the PVR at different doses

      In Part A patients without specific treatment for PH (untreated patients) will be tested. In
      Part B patients stably pretreated with specific PH drugs will be studied in combination with
      the new inhaled drug
