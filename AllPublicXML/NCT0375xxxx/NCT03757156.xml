  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the efficacy of aspirin for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is
      evident, the effect of aspirin for primary prevention is unclear. The use of aspirin reduces
      cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction but increases side effects such as
      bleeding. Therefore, the use of aspirin for primary prevention in people without
      cardiovascular disease should be determined by individual risk and clinical benefit. The
      European guidelines have been changed to not recommend aspirin use in people without
      cardiovascular disease, but there are still people taking aspirin for primary prevention. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of aspirin withdrawal on cardiovascular
      events in patients without cardiovascular disease.

      This is a single center, prospective, randomized clinical study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of withdrawal of aspirin among patients with moderate or high cardiovascular risk.

      Patients taking aspirin will be randomly assigned to a group that maintains taking aspirin
      and a group that discontinues to take aspirin by 1:1 manner. The follow-up duration is five
      years and clinical outcomes will be investigated.

    <description>Major bleeding is defined with International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria: 1) fatal bleeding; 2)Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome; 3) bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or more, or leading to transfuction of two or more units of whole blood or red cells. Bleeding that is not classified as major bleeding is minor.</description>
