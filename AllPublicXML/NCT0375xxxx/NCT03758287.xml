  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, multi-center, open label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative NSCLC
      who have progressed after EGFR TKI treatment.

      This study is being carried out in two parts, part 1 and part 2.

      Part 1: This is the dose-escalation part. The primary purpose of the part 1 portion is to
      determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommend
      the appropriate doses of CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib for further studies.

      Part 2: This is the expansion part. The part 2 portion of this study will continue to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of CT053PTSA and gefitinib , at the
      appropriate doses recommended in Part 1, in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative
      NSCLC.
