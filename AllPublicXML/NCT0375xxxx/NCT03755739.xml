  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to investigate the safety, response rates and survival outcomes of
      patients with advanced solid tumors by trans-artery/intra-tumor infusion of PD1/PDL1 antibody
      and/or CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab and to compare their differences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant solid tumors including lung and liver cancers are the most common malignancy
      worldwide, and their mortality rates are very high. China has a huge population base, with
      about 4,000,000 new cases each year. More than 60% of the solid tumors in China are diagnosed
      at mid-to-late stage and have lost the chance of surgery. Recently a lot of therapeutic
      strategies have been developed and applied to clinic including targeted therapy and
      immunotherapy, but the overall efficiency is still low. It is difficult to be widely used in
      patients with advanced solid cancers, and more alternative therapies are urgently needed.

      Antibodies against PD1, PDL1 and CTLA4 are representative drugs for the check-points
      inhibitory agents, and their clinical indications have been approved in various types of
      tumors, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and
      classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and late recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      patients, et al. Those drugs are regularly systemically administrated by vein infusion,
      however, local delivery of those drugs via interventional radiology technique including
      trans-artery or intra-tumor injection may increase the local drug concentration of the tumor,
      improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions, through so called &quot;first pass
      effect&quot; of drug on target organs. To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been
      developed on the efficacy and survival benefit of localized delivery of checkpoint inhibitors
      for treatment of cancer patients. This phase II-III clinical trial was designed to compare
      the effects of Pembrolizumab, Tecentriq, et al and/or ipilimumab on the survival benefit of
      patients with advanced solid cancers, including ORR, DCR, median survival time, and safety.
