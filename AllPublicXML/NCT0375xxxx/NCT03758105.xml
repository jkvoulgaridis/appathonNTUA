    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      cost-utility in the depression therapy.

      This is a 3 years medico-economics study with 1 year follow-up period involving patients with
      1 or 2 depression treatment(s) failed.

      Eligible subject will be randomized in 2 groups, usual care with tDCS cure (arm A) or only
      usual care (arm B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation is a non-invasive brain neuromodulation technique.
      tDCS can be a new therapy in depression.

      This study focuses on tDCS cost-utility-analysis. Each patient is following during 12 months.
      Patients are randomized in 2 arms. Arm A usual care with tDCS cure or arm B usual care
      without tDCS.

      Patient in arm A get a initial tDCS cure one week after randomization. If these patients are
      answering to the treatment, they can have a new cure in case of relapse. This new cure can
      start from the second month following initial treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-utility ratio, according to collective perspective of tDCS use in depression compared to usual care without active tDCS.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The utility will be measured by :
Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALYs) as estimated from responses to the Euroqol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) health-related quality of life questionnaire. The questionnaire focuses on 5 dimensions: mobility, personal autonomy, current activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. For each of these dimensions, 5 answers are possible.
The costs will be measured by the addition of the following costs:
Drugs dispensing via Health insurance database &quot;National system of information of the French health insurance&quot; (SNIIRAM), hospitalizations, work stoppages and care consumption collected in a declarative patient questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, at the end of each tDCS cure (for Arm A patients) through study completion (12 months) and at 12 months for all patients</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as follows: decrease of the MADRS score by at least 50% compared to baseline score. MADRS stands for Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. It is used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.
