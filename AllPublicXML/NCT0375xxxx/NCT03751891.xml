  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a validation
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based
      in Stäfa (Switzerland).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study a comparison with a CE-labeled Phonak Receiver-in-the-canal (RIC) device
      (active comparator) and two CE-labeled competitor devices (RIC) is done. All study devices
      contain direct connectivity functionality which will be compared in terms of streamed Audio
      quality, streaming stability and Usability preferences of all available functions and
      features. This will be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova
      AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the speech intelligibiltity of phone calls via direct streaming</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome meaurement of this study is the comparison of Phonak's direct connectivity solution against two competitors in terms of subjective speech intelligibility of streamed audio signals via smartphone. The subjective speech intelligibilty will be measured via interview (sound quality rating, satisfaction rating of speech intelligibility) from far-end talker and near-end talker.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Bluetooth Connection losses between Hearing Aid and smart phone during a phone call (number of reported interruptions during a phone call which will be streamed via bluetooth from Smartphone to Hearing Aid)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measurement of this study is to investigate the number of (Bluetooth-) Connection losses between Hearing Aid and Smartphone during a phone call stream. The bluetooth connection losses will be investigated by counting the reported interruptions of a streamed phone call between smartphone and Hearing Aid in relation to the amount of conducted phone calls during two weeks of home trial for the investigational device and the comparative devices.</description>
