      A study run at multiple study sites in Spain to test whether the SAMANTA questionnaire that
      is used to diagnose heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), can also be used to assess changes of
      severity of HMB in women with HMB who are treated during 12 months with a chronic hormonal
      treatment. Patients that are treated with chronic hormonal treatment as Levonorgestrel (trade
      name Mirena) or with a combination of estradiol valerate and dienogest (trade name Qlaira) or
      with Medroxyprogesterone acetate (trade name Progevera) and any new hormonal treatment
      marketed in Spain that has the indication for HMB in routine gynaecological practice are
      observed for 12 months in this study or for a shorter period in time in case of withdrawal.
      The study aims also to describe the overall satisfaction of women with their chronic hormonal
      treatment for HMB and how the women think their menstrual bleeding has changed. In addition
      the study aims to describe the changes of the score that is derived from the SAMANTA
      questionnaire in relation to Quality of Life. Quality of Life is measured with the SF36v2
      questionnaire. The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of
      patient health.
