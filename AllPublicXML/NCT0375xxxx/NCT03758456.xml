  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this first-in-human phase I study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      HAL-MRE1 subcutaneous immunotherapy in subjects suffering from ragweed pollen-induced
      allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma.

      The study has 4 treatment groups: 1 placebo group and 3 groups treated with different doses
      of HAL-MRE1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A chemically modified, aluminum hydroxide adsorbed ragweed extract (HAL-MRE1) for
      subcutaneous administration was developed for the treatment of ragweed pollen-induced
      allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) with or without asthma. The aim of this
      first-in-human phase I study is to assess the safety and tolerability of HAL-MRE1
      subcutaneous immunotherapy in subjects suffering from ragweed pollen-induced ARC with or
      without asthma.

      The study will consist of 3 staggered cohorts of 15 subjects each who are randomly assigned
      to the active or placebo group in a 2:1 manner using block randomization.

      A one month gap must be maintained between the end of the ragweed pollen peak season (2018)
      and subject randomization into the study. The study has seasonal constraints; subjects with
      concomitant tree and/or grass pollen allergies must complete study treatment before any
      allergy symptoms due to tree and/or grass pollen exposure develop or start study treatment
      after the symptoms caused by the tree and/or grass pollen exposure have disappeared.

             severe or unstable lung diseases; endocrine diseases; clinically significant renal or
             hepatic diseases, or hematological disorders; or severe ongoing symptomatic allergic
             diseases.
