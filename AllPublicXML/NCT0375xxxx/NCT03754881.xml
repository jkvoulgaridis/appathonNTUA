  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In korea, it is not easy to practice standard pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). in this study,
      we'll educate PR to patients and make reservation for re-visiting outpatients clinics with PR
      diary. we want to confirm whether patients, who perform home based PR during more than 30
      minutes in 3 days per week, present improved dyspnea score or quality of life compared with
      non-compliance group.

    <measure>Change from basline Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment Test (CAT) at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported Patient-completed questionnaire assessing globally the impact of COPD (cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest tightness) on health status. Each item is scored 0-5, yielding a total between 0 and 40</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from 6 minutes walk test at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the Short Form 36 Health survey (SF-36), version 2.0 at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>
