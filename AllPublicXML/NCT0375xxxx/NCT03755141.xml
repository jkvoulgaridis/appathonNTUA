  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy has been approved as the first line therapy in HER2+
      metastatic breast cancer. When patients experienced progression beyond trastuzumab containing
      therapy, T-DM1 is considered as the second line therapy followed by trastuzumab plus any
      other chemotherapeutic agents or lapatinib plus capecitabine.

      A biosimilar drug is a biological product that is highly similar to a licensed biological
      product, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, or potency.
      Several trastuzumab biosimilar products have been approved after efficacy and safety studies
      which were usually as the first line setting with taxane combined.

      Even though trastuzumab biosimilar drugs demonstrated similarity of equivalence with
      trastuzumab in these studies, the efficacy of their second use beyond progression with other
      chemotherapeutic agents has not been tested yet. In addition, the investigators don't have
      any data regarding possible cross reactivity between trastuzumab and trastuzumab biosimilar
      drugs.

      In this study, the investigators plan multicenter phase II clinical trial to test the
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of trastuzumab biosimilar, Herzuma® in combination with
      TPC in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who progressed after 2 or more HER-2
      directed chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is an adult, ≥ 19 years old at the time of informed consent.

          2. Patient has histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HER2-positive
             breast cancer (HER-2/neu 3+ as defined by immunohistochemistry and/or HER-2/neu gene
             amplification as defined by fluorescence in situ hybridization).

          3. Metastatic or unresectable disease documented on diagnostic imaging studies.

          4. Prior 2 or more HER-2 directed therapy for metastatic disease is mandatory.

          5. Patient must have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1)

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1

          7. Adequate bone marrow and organ function including: a) WBC ≥ 3500/ml; b) Platelets ≥
             100,000/ul; c) Hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dl; d) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN; e) AST and ALT &lt;
             2.5 x ULN; f) Alkaline phosphatase &lt;2.5x ULN; g) Creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN or CCr &gt;60
             ml/min for patients with abnormal serum Cr level function.

          8. Life expectance longer than 3 months

          9. Patient has an adequate left ventricular ejection function of at least 55 % at
             baseline, as measured by echocardiography.

         10. Written informed consent

             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test.
