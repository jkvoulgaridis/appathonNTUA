      This study will be conducted in the Department of physical therapy, College of Applied
      Medical Sciences,Jazan University, to investigate text neck syndrome and hand grip force in
      smart phone addiction among students of jazan university

    <textblock>
      Four hundreds students with age 19 to 26 years old, and right dominant hand, will be
      recruited from the College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jazan University. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to into a heavy user group (n=200; 100 female and 100 male students) and a
      control or regular use group (n=200; 100 female and 100 male students) according to their
      smartphone addiction proneness scale.

      Baseline hydraulic hand dynamometer: (Fabrication Enterprises Incorporated, White Plains,New
      York, USA) is used to measure the hand grip strength and pinch strength.

      Algometer Commander (JTech Medical Company) is used on the location of the trigger point to
      assess the amount of pressure the patient could sustain before the patient registered the
      pressure as being painful for upper fiber of trapezius muscle and sternocleidomastoid muscle

    <description>Using Algometer to measure pain pressure for upper trapezius trigger point which lies in the more horizontal fibers of the upper trapezius on the back of the shoulder, about halfway between spine and the acromion on right and left side for 3 repetition for each</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain pressure threshold for sternocleidomastoid muscle</measure>
    <time_frame>9 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Using Algometer to measure pain pressure for sternocleidomastoid muscle on right and left side for 3 repetition for each. Measurement will includes three sites on each side:
1. upper part of the sternal division of the muscle near to its insertion into the mastoid process. 2. he mid-part of the sternal division of the muscle. 3. lower end of this division near to its attachment to the sternum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand Grip Force</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For measuring the grip strength, the subjects will be asked to sit on a chair with their hip joint flexed at 90 degree, and shoulder joint in a neutral position.
The elbow is fixed at 90 degree flexion, forearm in a neutral position, and wrist at 0 to 15 degree radial deviation.The test will be performed twice, and the higher value between the two measurements will be selected.
The subjects are allowed a rest time of more than 5 minutes after the first measurement to avoid examiner bias and to decrease physical stress</description>
