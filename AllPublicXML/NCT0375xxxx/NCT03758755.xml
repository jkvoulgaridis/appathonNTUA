  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to determine the impact of Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) therapy, in
      comparison to a standard rehabilitation protocol, on the functional outcomes of patients
      recovering from ACL reconstruction. The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing
      BFR therapy after ACL reconstruction surgery will have better functional outcomes than those
      undergoing normal rehabilitation without BFR therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction involves early physical therapy
      to promote muscular development. Traditional training regimens are based on the concept that
      muscle growth is induced with high resistance exercises of at least 65-70% of 1-repetition
      maximum. Achieving a high resistance level can be challenging in the early post-surgical
      patient who may be limited by pain, muscle atrophy, diminished proprioception, and
      psychological factors. Increasing evidence has suggested that Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) in
      resistance training, while transmitting a decreased load (25-50% of 1-repetition maximum)
      across the surgical site, may provide an additional benefit of inducing muscular development
      similar to that of high intensity exercises .

      Augmenting exercises with BFR involves an external pressure cuff applied to the proximal
      portion of the extremity, which is inflated to a pressure that restricts venous outflow while
      allowing arterial inflow to continue. This creates a physiologic environment for the patient
      to gain the hypertrophic effect of high resistance training, though at a lower and safer
      intensity. Studies suggest that BFR stimulates muscular development through an increase in
      metabolic stress, muscle fiber recruitment, cell swelling, and protein synthesis.

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 3 months post op</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument, developed to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problem. The KOOS collects data on five patient-centered outcomes. The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: KOOS Pain (9 items); KOOS Symptoms (7 items); KOOS ADL (17 items); KOOS Sport/Rec (5 items); KOOS QOL (4 items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as is common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured at 3 months post op</time_frame>
    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Questionnaire) is a knee-specific patient-reported outcome measure. The IKDC Questionnaire is a subjective scale that provides patients with an overall function score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function.</description>

    <description>The Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) is a guide to objectively determine discrepancies in lower limb strength, function, and mobility. The LSI is calculated by taking the average of any test scores for the affected limb, divided by the unaffected limb, multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage difference between limbs. A result of 100 indicated identical performance between each leg, while a result sof 50 indicates the affected leg performed half as well as the uninjured leg. Tests include single leg hop for distance, triple hop for distance, crossover hop distance, 6 meter hop for time, and isometric quadriceps strength.</description>
