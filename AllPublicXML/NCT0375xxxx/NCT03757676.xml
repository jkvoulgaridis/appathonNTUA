  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of playing
      Pokémon Go to increase daily steps among young adults. The study also aimed to assess
      people's experience playing the game, identify specific features of the game that users
      like/dislike, and explore game features that may promote overall well-being.

    <textblock>
      Study participants were 30 undergraduate students from a State university in California who
      were 18 years or older, enrolled full-time, non-Pokémon Go players, and were able to walk
      leisurely. Daily steps were measured for 6 consecutive weeks via the Fitbit Flex 2. Habitual
      activity was first measured during the first two-weeks. After the 2-week baseline assessment
      of physical activity and GPS travel patterns, participants were randomized to one of three
      study conditions for the remaining 4 weeks: (1) &quot;No Play,&quot; (2) &quot;Play At Will,&quot; or (3) &quot;Goal
      Oriented Play&quot;. The 4-week intervention period was followed by a post-study interview
      completed within one week from the end of the intervention period.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants were randomly assigned into one of three experimental groups: a control group and two play groups. The two play groups consisted of a group that was asked to play Pokémon Go ad libitum (at will play) and the other group was asked to achieve a specific level within the game during the study period (goal oriented play). Participants were measured for baseline physical activity levels (2 weeks) followed by randomization to one of the three groups. The intervention period lasted 4 weeks. All participants completed a brief questionnaire and were measured for height and weight, and daily physical activity levels using a FitBit accelerometer. Locations of where individual engaged in physical activity were recorded using a GPS tracking application. During the 5th week of the study period, participants completed five (5) short surveys per day using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) software to assess level of play and engagement of play.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants in this group were asked not to download or play Pokémon Go during the study period and were asked to simply continue with their normal daily activities. Participants were asked to wear the Fitbit device and use the GPS app on their mobile phones during the 6-week study period. Starting the fifth week, participants were prompted to complete five (5) brief daily surveys on their phones via the EMA app.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group were asked to download Pokémon Go and play for at least 30 minutes initially, then play as much or as little as desired during the 4 week intervention period, with no specific instruction or goals for play. Participants were asked to wear the Fitbit device and use the GPS app on their mobile phones during the 6-week study period. Starting the fifth week, participants were prompted to complete five (5) brief daily surveys on their phones via the EMA app.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group were asked to download and play Pokémon Go and achieve a minimum player level of 20 within the game during the study period. They were given materials that described game features and functions to show them how to play the game. There were no restrictions on which features to pursue within the game to achieve this goal nor on how long or how frequent their play sessions should be. Upon reaching their goal (Level 20), participants were encouraged to continue to play as much or as little as they desired. Participants were asked to wear the Fitbit device and use the GPS app on their mobile phones during the 6-week study period. Starting the fifth week, participants were prompted to complete five (5) brief daily surveys on their phones via the EMA app.</description>
