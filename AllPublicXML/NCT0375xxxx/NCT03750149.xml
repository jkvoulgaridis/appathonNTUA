    <textblock>
      Investigation of the reading parameters and fixation behavior in patients with different
      ocular diseases (age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic maculopathy, epiretinal
      membrane) and healthy subjects. In addition, fixation analysis and retinal sensitivity
      measurements will be done with a microperimeter in each subject.

      Reading is a complex function. It requires a proper retinal image that is received by the
      brain. There it is analyzed for letter and word recognition and then the semantics is
      detected. Reading speed slows down when letters are blurred, or do not have enough contrast
      or luminance or when binocular fusion is hampered. Hence, it is obvious that reading ability
      is reduced in patients with various ocular diseases. Especially, pathologies effecting the
      posterior pole (central and paracentral vision) might impair reading parameters
      significantly.

      Recently, the Eyetracker Eyelink 1000 (SR Research Ltd, Canada) became available. ItÂ´s
      application was described previously. Briefly, a high-speed infrared camera detects the
      position of eye (pupil and corneal reflex) and in turn the direction of gaze 500 times per
      second. During the calibration process the position can be linked to the position on a screen
      where, for instance, a text or a fixation target can be projected. Direction of gaze is
      recorded during the reading process and the gathered data are analyzed.

      Fixation ability was assessed using Eyelink 1000 in patients with age-related macular
      degeneration. It was shown that fixation is related to visual function. The worse eye showed
      reduced fixation ability which is improved during binocular fixation. This study investigates
      reading parameters in patients with various ocular diseases.
