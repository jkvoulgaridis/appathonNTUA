  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture on quality of life in gastric
      cancer patients undergoing postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Enrolled participates will
      randomly receive high-dose acupuncture, low-dose acupuncture or none-acupuncture during the
      first 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy after resection.

    <description>FACT-Gastric Scoring is designed for measurement of quality of life (QoL) for gastric cancer patients. FACT-Gastric TOI is composed of PHYSICAL WELL BEING （PWB） SUBSCALE, FUNCTIONAL WELL BEING （PWB）SUBSCALE and GASTRIC CANCER SUBSCALE（GaCS）of the FACT-Gastric Scoring. The range of FACT-Gastric TOI is 0-132. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <description>Chinese version of Edmonton symptom assessment scale (C-ESAS) is a questionnaire used for symptom assessment in cancer patients. C-ESAS is composed of 11 items with score range of 0-10 for each item. The higher the score, the worse the symptom is. We don't include inching item in our study because the inching is common in gastrointestinal department patients rather than cancer patients.</description>
