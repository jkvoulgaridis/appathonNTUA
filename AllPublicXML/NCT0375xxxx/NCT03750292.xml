    <textblock>
      This study looks at whether air cleaning devices put in the bedroom and living room of your
      home could reduce the irritation of your lungs and body that is caused by indoor air
      pollution. While participating in this study there will be two, 2 month long study segments
      (Study Period 1 and Study Period 2) where the air filter units, placed in your living room
      and bedroom windows, will be turned on at your home.

    <measure>Mean change in St. George Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is an established, clinically relevant measure of respiratory symptoms, activity level, and impacts on daily life, and is a measure of functional status regularly used and validated in COPD patient populations. The questionnaire is a fixed format 50 item survey completed by the study subject asking questions in three parts: 1) levels of symptomatology including frequency of wheezing, cough, sputum production, and breathlessness, including the duration of episodes of wheeze and breathlessness, 2) physical activities that may be caused or are limited by breathlessness, and 3) impacts of these symptoms. It is a self-assessment of respiratory symptoms and functional status, and provides a quantification of the impacts of airflow limitation on health and well-being. The scores range from 0 to 100 with higher number indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>It is a trademarked, patented (U.S. Patent # 7,802,443), U.S. FDA approved Class II medical re-circulating air cleaner, built by Air Innovations, Inc. (North Syracuse, NY) to provide improved indoor air quality in the bedrooms of asthmatic children. Units to be used in the proposed study have a 99.97% efficient filter for particles 0.3 µm in size. The device provides a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of 9 per hour with 1.8 of them being outdoor air.</description>
