  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications are common in Veno-venous ECMO therapy. The aim
      of this study is to provide a detailed analysis of the activity of different coagulation
      factors and changes in functional coagulation measurements as in rotational thrombelastometry
      and multiple electrode aggregometry in the course of ECMO therapy.
