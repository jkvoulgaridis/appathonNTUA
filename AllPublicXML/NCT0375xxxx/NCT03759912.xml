  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVI) is the cornerstone of current ablation
      techniques for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) because the PV is the most common
      trigger of AF. Wide bi-antral circumferential ablation (WACA) is more effective than
      segmental PV isolation in achieving freedom from total atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence at
      long-term follow-up. Therefore, it is widely accepted as initial ablation strategy. However,
      the WACA technique requires a much larger number of ablation and higher energy to achieve
      complete isolation because of thick atrial myocardial sleeves with multiple muscle layers
      present in most of the PV antrum, which is less likely to achieve homogenous transmural
      lesions in the entire circumference with the currently available ablation technologies.
      Meanwhile, muscular discontinuities and abrupt changes of the fiber orientation in human
      PV-Left atrium (LA) junction are previously reported, and electrical PV isolation can usually
      be achieved without complete circumferential ablation. However, the current electroanatomical
      mapping (EAM) system has a limitation to understand the complex relationship of PV-LA
      junction mainly due to relatively low resolution.

      The Rhythmia mapping system (BostonScientific, Inc, Cambridge, MA) is a new system provides
      ultra-high-resolution EAM using a small basket array of 64 electrodes (IntellaMap Orion,
      Boston Scientific). Owing to better resolution, this new system capable of rapidly and
      accurately identify critical isthmuses and low-voltage regions of interest and also allows
      automatic acquisition and accurate annotation of the electrograms, without the need for
      manual correction.

      In this context, we hypothesized that rapid and precise identification of activation pattern
      of PV-LA junction by Rhythmia system could allow complete, durable electrical isolation of
      PVs without circumferential antral ablation.
