  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local treatment in addition to endocrine treatment as 1st line for oligo-metastatic
      ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local treatment included surgical resection, stereotactic body radiotherapy, palliative
      radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is preferred as a
      radiation modality.

      Endocrine therapies with/without target therapy including CDK4/6 inhibitors or mTOR
      inhibitors are the mainstay of 1st line treatment for ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic
      breast cancer.

    <intervention_model_description>Endocrine therapy is a standard-of-care for 1st line treatment in the patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
Local treatments for metastatic lesions will be added in this group.
All patients will undergo local treatments in addition to endocrine therapies.
Local treatments include modalities described below:
i) Surgical resection: the achievement of tumor-free margin is not obligatory.
ii) Stereotactic body radiotherapy
iii) Radiofrequency ablation</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Endocrine therapy is a standard-of-care for 1st line treatment in the patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
Endocrine options included aromatase inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors, fulvestrant, fulvestrant with CDK4/6 inhibitors, everolimus with exemestane, tamoxifen. For premenopausal women, agents for ovarian function suppression using GnRH agonists or surgical ovarian ablation including bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are allowed.
Local treatments for metastatic lesions will be added in this group.

    <description>RFA is a localized thermal treatment technique designed to induce tumor destruction by heating the tumor tissue to temperatures that exceed 60℃. The alternating current of radiofrequency waves passing down from an uninsulated electrode tip into the surrounding tissues generates changes in the direction of ions and creates ionic agitation and frictional heating. This tissue heating then drives extracellular and intracellular water out of the tissue, resulting in tissue destruction by coagulative necrosis.</description>
