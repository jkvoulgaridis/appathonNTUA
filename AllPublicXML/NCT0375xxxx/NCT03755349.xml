  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical-functional result after frontal and parietal burr-hole trepanation for the
      treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is effective with regards to control of the
      hematoma and regression of symptoms (headache, decreased vigilance and neurological
      deficits). However, in patients the treatment may leave visible depressions of the scalp,
      just above the trepanation sites, that typically develop gradually after weeks - months after
      the procedure. A considerable proportion of patients find this aesthetically, functionally
      and psychologically disturbing; the skin depressions may even cause pain or interfere with
      activities of daily living, such as combing, etc.

      An effective method would exist to avoid this undesired treatment effect: Before the skin is
      closed, a permeable titanium burr-hole plate could be attached above the trepanation site in
      order to prevent the skin from sinking into the bony defect. However, this is rarely done
      today, likely because there is no evidence that this treatment modification is effective and
      safe. Moreover, as material is implanted, this causes additional costs.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the application of burr-hole plates on
      both the frontal and parietal burr-hole in the context of burr-hole trepanation for the
      treatment of cSDH can improve patient satisfaction with the aesthetic result of the surgery.

      In addition, the study is intended to demonstrate that this additional measure will not
      result in poorer hematoma control, poorer clinical/neurological outcomes, or additional
      complications for the patient.

      In a prospective, single-blind and controlled approach, we randomize 80 patients with uni- or
      bilateral cSDH into an intervention group (with burr-hole plates) or into a control group
      (without burr-hole plates).

      The primary end result of the study is the patient's reported satisfaction with the aesthetic
      outcome of the surgical scar. Secondary results are pain, functionality, neurological status,
      health-related quality of life, residual hematoma volume, and complications (according to
      Clavien-Dindo scale; especially re-operation rate for recurring cSDH and infections).

      The study corresponds to a modern approach, since today's patients not only expect favorable
      treatment results for their disease, but the therapy should also avoid permanent undesired
      side-effects, if possible.

    <intervention_model_description>As the evacuation of a cSDH encompasses trepanation of the skull with 2 burr-holes per side (each one in the frontal and parietal skull region), we will perform the study as follows:
In patients with unilateral cSDH, we will cover either both (intervention group) or none of the burr holes with a burr hole cover (control group).
In patients with bilateral cSDH, we will cover one side with burr hole covers (intervention side), while on the other side no burr hole covers are applied (control side).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be blinded for allocation to the study group/side, but surgeons will not be. Patients will not be aware of the study group/side, since the operation takes place under general anesthesia. After surgery, it is not possible to see through the skin, whether or not a burr hole cover has been placed.
The fact that patients are blinded for the study group allocation will be mentioned in the discharge letter (in order to inform the family physician), and the neurosurgical team of nurses and physicians will also be informed not to &quot;unblind&quot; the patient.
Unblinding (and revealing a participant's allocated intervention) towards the patient is permissible only if the trial is suspended, prematurely terminated due to security concerns or completed.</masking_description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the aesthetic result of the scar</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days postoperative +/- 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary outcome, patient satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the scars is determined using a patient-rated outcome measure (PROM), the Aesthetic Numeric Analogue (ANA) scale ranging from 0 (dissatisfied) - 10 (very satisfied). Here, on each side, the frontal and parietal scars are measured separately, and the mean scar satisfaction score per side is built by adding the two values and dividing the sum by two in each patient.</description>
