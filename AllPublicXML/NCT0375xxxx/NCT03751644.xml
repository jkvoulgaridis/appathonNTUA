    <textblock>
      Systemic autoimmune myopathies are a heterogeneous group of rheumatic diseases with
      progressive skeletal muscle weakness. The relevance of the peripherical neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation has never applied in the patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.
      Therefore, the main objective of the present prospective, randomized, investigator-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the application of an
      acute peripherical neuromuscular electrical stimulation session in patients with systemic
      autoimmune myopathies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic autoimmune myopathies are a heterogeneous group of rheumatic diseases that primarily
      affect the skeletal muscles. Despite these advances, this group of diseases still continues
      to be associated with high morbidity and functional disability, mainly due to the proximal
      muscular weakness of the scapular and pelvic girdles that may prevent the total recovery of
      these patients. On the other hand, the importance of the peripherical neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation has never applied in the patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.
      Therefore, the main objective of the present prospective, randomized, investigator-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the application of an
      acute peripherical neuromuscular electrical stimulation session in patients with systemic
      autoimmune myopathies.

    <description>After local antisepsis, 4 electrodes will be placed at the proximal and distal extremities of the lateral and vastus medialis muscles of dominant limb. A positive, single-phase pulsating (intermittent) current with a rectangular waveform will be delivered with a duty cycle of 10 to 15 seconds shutdown at a frequency of 60 Hertz with a pulse width of 400 microseconds for 30 minutes. To control the degree of muscle activation, electrical stimulation will be administered at an intensity that will consistently produce a target torque equal to 15% of maximal voluntary contraction, as monitored in real time through torque output. The desired intensity of stimulation and intensity adjustments throughout the treatment will be evaluated in all patients.</description>
