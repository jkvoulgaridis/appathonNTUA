  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of Trauma-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (TFPP) in
      comparison with TAU (at the VA) in a 2:1 ratio in 75 Veterans with PTSD who have not
      responded to standard treatment at the VA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with PTSD are a highly vulnerable population with tremendous disability and unmet
      needs. Few VA patients with PTSD now actually receive evidence-based psychotherapy because
      current exposure-based treatments have low uptake. The project goal is to expand the range of
      PTSD psychotherapy treatments available at Veterans Administration Medical Centers. This
      pilot trauma recovery proposal takes the next step in translating a brief efficacious
      psychotherapy developed and tested for panic disorder, Panic Focused Psychodynamic
      Psychotherapy (PFPP) for Veterans with PTSD at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System (VA
      NYHHCS). PFPP was developed, manualized, and studied in RCTs over the past two decades. We
      hope that Trauma-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (TFPP), an adaptation of PFPP, with its
      high response rates in panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, and non-exposure protocol,
      will fill crucial gaps in Veteran care. A major challenge facing psychotherapy research is
      translating and implementing efficacious therapies to the community. No psychodynamic
      psychotherapy for anxiety or PTSD has achieved this in the US. This pilot RCT represents a
      paradigm shift in its approach to trauma. TFPP will be the only PTSD treatment for Veterans
      to incorporate Veterans' input into refinement of the treatment as this project progresses.
      TFPP targets aspects of traumatic experience and approaches Veterans' lives more broadly than
      the symptom-focused treatments the VA currently offers our traumatized Veterans.

    <time_frame>baseline, 16 weeks (termination), 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12). The results of the VR-12 are summarized as two scores - a Mental Component Score (MCS) and a Physical Component Score (PCS). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Therefore, each increment of 10 points above or below 50 corresponds to one standard deviation away from the population average.</description>
