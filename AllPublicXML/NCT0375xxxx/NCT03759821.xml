  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the independent and combined effectiveness of engaging both
      mothers and fathers in peer group sessions and bundling parenting and nutrition behavior
      change packages on early child nutrition and development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of EFFECTS is to develop, implement, and evaluate nutrition and parenting
      interventions that will be delivered by community health workers in the Mara region of
      Tanzania. We will use a 2x2 factorial cluster randomized controlled study design, plus a
      local standard of care control group, to evaluate the effectiveness of EFFECTS on the primary
      outcomes of early child nutrition and development. In total, there will be five study arms:
      nutrition intervention with mothers, nutrition intervention with mothers and fathers, bundled
      nutrition and parenting intervention with mothers, bundled nutrition and parenting
      intervention with mothers and fathers, and a local standard of care control. We hypothesize
      that an intervention approach that engages fathers will benefit the primary outcomes; a
      bundled nutrition and parenting package will benefit the same primary outcomes; and that the
      combined intervention approach - that both engages fathers and bundles nutrition and
      parenting messages - will have additive benefits on the primary outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>Eighty villages in the Mara region of Tanzania will be randomly selected and randomly allocated with equal probability and in equal numbers to one of the 5 EFFECTS study arms. In each participating village, a sampling frame of all households in that village will be created with the help of local leaders. Households will be selected from this sampling frame using simple random sampling. The selected households will be listed in random order and visited by study staff, who will assess whether a household meets all inclusion criteria and provides informed consent. Households will be visited until 12 households are enrolled in each village.</intervention_model_description>
