  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised trials are considered the gold standard in medical research. The CONSORT
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement aims to improve the quality of
      reporting of randomised trials. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the
      reliability and validity of trial findings, and therefore these findings cannot inform
      clinical practice. Different stakeholders, including biomedical journals, have taken
      different actions to try to improve author adherence to CONSORT. The most popular action
      among biomedical journals is to instruct authors to submit a completed RG checklist with page
      numbers indicating where the CONSORT items are addressed when they submit their manuscript.
      However, this measure alone has been proven not to be effective. In this study, the
      investigators intend to evaluate in a real editorial context whether assessing during peer
      review the consistency between the submitted CONSORT checklist and the information reported
      in the manuscripts of randomised trials, as well as to provide feedback to authors on the
      inconsistencies found, improves the completeness of reporting of published trials.

      Randomised trials are considered the gold standard in medical research. The CONSORT
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement aims to improve the quality of
      reporting of randomised trials. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the
      reliability and validity of trial findings, and therefore these findings cannot inform
      clinical practice.

      In recent years, different stakeholders have acted to boost the completeness of reporting of
      the published randomised trials, and therefore their transparency and reproducibility. In a
      recently completed scoping review, the investigators identified and classified 31
      interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines. This review revealed that it is
      primarily journals that have taken most efforts to improve the completeness of reporting of
      randomised trials - although most of their actions have been shown not to have the desired
      effect.

      One of the most popular strategies used by journals to improve adherence to CONSORT requires
      authors to submit a populated checklist together with their manuscript indicating page
      numbers corresponding to each item. However, journals usually lack further actions throughout
      the editorial process to ensure that the corresponding information to each item is reported
      in the randomised trial manuscript. This has been hypothesized to be one of the reasons why
      this editorial strategy has not achieved optimal results.

      In an effort to take full advantage of requiring the submission of populated checklists, the
      investigators intend to evaluate in a real editorial context whether assessing during peer
      review the consistency between the submitted CONSORT checklist and the information reported
      in the manuscripts of randomised trials, as well as to provide feedback to authors on the
      inconsistencies found, improves the completeness of reporting of published trials.

    <description>The completed CONSORT checklist submitted by authors of manuscripts randomised to the intervention group will be assessed by the lead investigator (DB) as to whether it is consistent with the information that was actually reported in the manuscript. This evaluation will be focused on 8 core CONSORT items.
DB will produce a standardised report containing precise requests for authors in order to improve the completeness of reporting of the items where reporting inconsistencies were found. This report will consist of a brief introduction followed by a point by point description of the inconsistencies found together with precise requests related to the information missing and examples extracted from CONSORT. DB will upload this report to the submission on the managing system of the journal (Scholar One) to make it accessible to the handling editor of the manuscript.
This editor will include the report in the letter to authors alongside the standard peer review reports.</description>

    <ipd_description>The content of the interventional peer review reports will appear as part of the review history of the manuscripts. However, in order to protect confidentiality, no dataset including individual manuscript data or outcome data identifying the performance of individual participants will be released. When the study is finished, DB will assign a study number to each paper and store that code with the manuscript ID, password protect it, and store it (File 1) in the BMJ Google Drive folder for the study. In this file, we will also include all identifying variables (Submission date, Trial registration number, Title, Latest editorial decision, applicable CONSORT extensions). For the file containing the peer review reports and the study outcomes (File 2), DB will strip all identifying variables other than the study code and store that file separate from File 1. DB will stick all study files in one folder, compress this folder using WinZip, password protect it, and store it in the same folder.</ipd_description>
