    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in department of Hepatology at ILBS, the patients will be
      recruited from the OPD or IPD . The obese cirrhotic patients with NASH will be observed for
      standard of care and also patients who undergo IGB placement as part of weight reduction
      policy in these group of patients and will undergo an UGI endoscopy followed by placement of
      intragastric balloon. Then the patients will be admitted for 2-3 days and followed up till 6
      months.
