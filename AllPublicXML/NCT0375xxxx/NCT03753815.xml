  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two EUS-guided tissue
      acquisition devices; the 19G Echotip Ultra Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) device and the 20G
      Echotip ProCore Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) device for the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis.

      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue acquisition has emerged as a valuable method to
      diagnose autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and exclude malignancy. During Endoscopic Ultrasound
      (EUS), tissue samples can be obtained for pathological evaluation with different devices.
      Previous studies suggest 19-gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle provides a reliable
      specimen for diagnosis of AIP. However tissue architecture and cell morphology are essential
      for accurate pathological assessment. Therefore, pathologists generally prefer a histological
      specimen. Fine needle biopsy (FNB) has the advantage of obtaining a histological specimen,
      which may lead to better diagnostic performance. However, the superiority of histology over
      cytology in EUS-guided tissue sampling for diagnosis of AIP has not been proven yet. In this
      study, we aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two EUS-guided tissue acquisition
      devices; the 19G Echotip Ultra Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) device and the 20G Echotip
      ProCore Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) device for the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis.
