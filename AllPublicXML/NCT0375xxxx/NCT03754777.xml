  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) is a widespread surgical procedure. Patients may develop
      considerable postoperative pain and dyspepsia resulting in prolong in-hospital stay. Almost
      10% of patients develop postoperative complications. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)
      program has proven its effectiveness in elective surgery and can theoretically improve
      outcomes of LA. To date there is no ERAS program for LA. The aim of the study was to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of a modified ERAS protocol in LA.

      A modified ERAS (mERAS) protocol was investigated. The study is a prospective, randomized
      nonblinded. All patients underwent LA. Modified ERAS protocol included patient informing,
      limitation of drainage use; intraperitoneal anesthesia with long-acting anesthetics;
      low-pressure pneumoperitoneum; early mobilization and oral nutrition. Pain level was assessed
      in rest using visual analogue scale (VAS). The primary endpoint was postoperative length of
      stay (pLOS).
