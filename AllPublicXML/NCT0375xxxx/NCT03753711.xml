  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniation is the most common diagnosed degenerative pathology in the lumbar
      spine with a prevalence of 2 to 3% in the adult population. Unilateral lumbar disc herniation
      is characterized by compression or irritation of the lumbar nerve roots or dural sac by
      either protrusion, extrusion or sequestration of the nucleus pulposus, mostly in the
      posterolateral region. Compression or irritation of the lumbar nerve roots and dural sac can
      induce unilateral sensory and motor symptoms. Therefore, it is the principal cause of lumbar
      spinal surgery.

      Different imaging studies have investigated asymmetry of the paraspinal muscles in patient
      with unilateral low back pain due to lumbar discus herniation. Both animal and human studies
      indicate a reduction in total muscle cross-sectional area, increased fat infiltration and
      fibrosis within the lumbar multifidus at the affected side.

      Increased fat infiltration is clinically important because there is a correlation between the
      amount of intramuscular fat and lumbar muscle dysfunction. Not only fat infiltration
      correlates with lumbar dysfunction, also a lower multifidus cross-sectional area is
      associated with and predictive for low back pain. This indicates that there is an association
      between paraspinal muscle changes/ remodeling and muscle dysfunction that could lead to low
      back pain.

      The aim of this research is to quantify the decrease in muscle and muscle fibre size, the
      amount of fat infiltration, and the amount of fibrosis present within the multifidus muscle
      at the herniated side in relation to the unaffected side. The second aim is to investigate
      the possible role of different cell types in the process of muscle remodeling. The last aim
      of this study is to correlate these muscular changes with long-term functional outcomes such
      as pain, fear and disability. This information can possibly contribute to the etiology of
      paraspinal muscle changes, and provide a handgrip to future research.

    <description>this is a tool to provide an indication of the amount of pain a participant is feeling. It's a scale with 11 scores (0-10). It's a scale in which score 0 means 'no pain' and score 10 means 'the highest imaginable pain'. An improvement of 2 levels is considered clinically relevant.</description>

    <measure>Modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>day1</time_frame>
    <description>this is a questionnaire than has been proven valid and reliable to evaluate the restrictions that people with low back pain experience during their daily living. It consist of 10 items that will be scored on a 5 point scale. Using the total score you can calculate a percentage restriction degree. The score is calculated using the sum of the scores (0-5) from all 10 questions and multiply them times two. The final score is interpreted as following: 0-20%: minimal disability, 21-40%: moderate disability, 41-60%: severe disability, 61-80%: crippled, 81-100% bed bound.</description>
