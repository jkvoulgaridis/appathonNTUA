      Background: Inadequate nutrition has been associated with growing risk of falling and
      impaired ability in elderly patients. Falling is a significant threat to the health of the
      elderly. It is estimated that one third of people over the age of 65 experience at least one
      falling each year. Over 60% of the falls cause serious injury or disability. Adequate
      nutrition increases the muscle strength of the elderly. Therefore, determining and managing
      the nutrition level is important for preventing falling. As far as we know emergency medical
      services has never before reported being a part of prevention by performing risk
      identification.

      Aim: The purpose of the study is to assess whether it is possible to use a simple screening
      tool to find out the risk of falling, the nutritional status and the level of cognitive
      functioning activity when the EMS faces the elderly over the age of 70 years. In addition,
      the flow of information between primary care and emergency services and nutritionists is
      examined.

      Material and method: Identification of poor nutrition is carried out in the Helsinki
      University hospital area. All people over the age of 70 requiring ambulance transport will be
      included in the study for 4 months during 2018. A structured electronic form is used to
      identify the malnutrition, the level of cognitive functioning activity and the risk of
      falling. The assessment is performed during the transport. The data is analyzed by the SPSS
      statistical program both by descriptive and statistical significance by looking at the
      methods suitable for the data.

      Conclusion: The information produced by the research aims to develop (a) Identifying in the
      ambulance those patients who are at risk; and (b) activating nursing staff and nutritionists
      and, by means of these measures, increase the number of patients receiving effective
      nutrition therapy.

    <description>to use a simple screening tool to find out the risk of falling, the nutritional status and the level of cognitive functioning activity when the EMS faces the elderly over the age of 70 The risk-screening tool is based on valid scales. RISK SCREENING TOOL;
Risk of falling:
Prediction of falls (4 items, 0-3 points) Self-reporting of falls over a 12-month period (3 items, 0-3 points)
Malnutrition Risk:
Home care and meal services (3 items) Nutritional status (4 items, 0-3 points) Effect of the diseases on nutrition (4 items, 0-3 points) Age (1 item, 1 point)
Delirium and cognitive functioning:
Alertness / memory / attention deficit / symptoms (4 items, 0-3 points)
Complete when:
&gt; 70 years patient The patient's physical state allows. Mostly completed during transport (no need to add actual time on scene). Possible risk points are reported at donation to the emergency department.</description>
