    <textblock>
      There is little epidemiological data in the literature on the therapeutic compliance of
      epileptic children. Yet it is a fundamental issue in the therapeutic education and balance of
      this pathology. To obtain more epidemiological precision on the observance of epileptic
      children and to propose, according to the factors involved, the improvement of practices
      (therapeutic education ..). Propose an evaluation of the quality of life of their children by
      a suitable self-questionnaire.
