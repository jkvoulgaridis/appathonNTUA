  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test the system composed by a 3D virtual environment, attached to the Leap
      Motion, evaluating its effects on the rehabilitation of hand movements in patients with motor
      alteration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to elaborate the virtual environment, softwares for 3D content creation were used.
      The virtual environment is formed by four phases, each one having three spheres that are
      supposed to be inserted, one by one, into a hole located on the scenario floor. Each phase
      presents a level of difficulty, from pushing the object to performing the grip movement. By
      the end of each phase, a log file is generated with the time spent on it.

    <description>The intervention was composed by 8 sessions of 15 minutes each, where the volunteers used a virtual environment attached it to a Leap Motion, which is a sensor that allows to capture the movements that are produced by the hands and reproduce them in a computer through a 3D virtual environment in order to stimulate the execution of their finer movements.</description>

    <description>The motor coordination evaluation was made in the first, fourth and eighth sessions. Each volunteer used three balls, or spheres, of different sizes (small, medium, large). The objective was to insert each ball in each orifice. The time was measured with a chronometer.</description>

    <description>For the tests, the volunteers used the access device (Leap Motion) and a computer that were previously installed. The intervention was composed by 8 sessions of 15 minutes each, where the volunteers used a virtual environment attached it to a Leap Motion, which is a sensor that allows to capture the movements that are produced by the hands and reproduce them in a computer through a 3D virtual environment in order to stimulate the execution of their finer movements. The strength (Jamar) and motor coordination (wooden box) evaluations were made in the first, fourth and eighth sessions with the objective of checking the gain progression or not of motion coordination and grip strength.</description>

    <intervention_name>Jamar</intervention_name>
    <description>The grip strength was evaluated through a dynamometer JAMAR 5030-J, formed by two parallel steel bars, one stationary and a mobile one, which can be adjusted in five different positions. The volunteer was sitting with a neutrally rotated abducted shoulder, elbow flexed at 90°, the forearm in neutral position, and the wrist between 0° and 30° of extension, 0° to 15° of ulnar variance and it was requested that he or she made the grip movement. This test was performed three times with a one-minute-break between each one.</description>

    <intervention_name>Wooden box</intervention_name>
    <description>The motor coordination evaluation was made through the measurement of the time spent to perform the task of fitting. To do so, a wooden box was built. In its upper part, there is a circular orifice with 6 cm of diameter.</description>

    <description>The system proposed is composed by a virtual environment and an access device. The Leap Motion was used as the access device, making it possible to capture the movements performed by the hands.</description>
