  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who received neoadjuvant therapy for TNBC prior to surgery
      and did not get pCR. Given the relatively poor prognosis for these patients, this population
      is considered novel therapeutic as adjuvant treatment. Currently, capecitabine monotherapy
      could be beneficial to this group of patients according to CREATE-X trial results. The
      investigators are addressing the effect of anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab combined with
      capecitabine in patients with TNBC who did not get pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      compared to capecitabine monotherapy.
