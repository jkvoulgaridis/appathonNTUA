  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of mental practice combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation on
      muscle strength of upper limb were measured in 60 healthy students Subjects were randomly
      assigned to either proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) group or mental practice
      (MP) group. PNF group: 30 individuals, these subjects received only PNF training. MP: 30
      individuals, these subjects received mental practice.

      The effects of mental practice on muscle strength of upper limb were measured in 60 healthy
      female students with right dominant hand,. Their age ranged from17 to 23 years old. Subjects
      were randomly assigned to either proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) group or
      mental practice (MP) group. PNF group: 30 individuals, these subjects received only PNF
      training. MP: 30 individuals, these subjects received MP. training program has been
      administered for every group for 12 sessions over 4 weeks with 3 x 45 min training sessions
      per week. Pre-post test design was used. EMG device was used to measure the electrical
      activity of muscles. Measurements conducted at pre-intervention, during intervention and
      post-intervention testing with 20 days.
