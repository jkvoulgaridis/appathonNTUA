    <textblock>
      Open-label, baseline-controlled, evaluator-blind, multi-center study evaluating a 1060 nm
      diode laser for non-invasive fat reduction of the flanks. The study will enroll up to 50
      subjects requesting non-invasive lipolysis of the flanks. Each subject will receive a single
      study treatment. Subjects will be followed at six weeks and twelve weeks post-treatment.
      Twelve week outcome will be compared to baseline.
