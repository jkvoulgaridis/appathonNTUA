  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      False diagnosis of penicillin allergy are frequently reported, and have been proven
      detrimental to patients. Current guidelines for the assessment of drug allergies recommend
      that penicillin allergy be evaluated first with prick and intradermal skin tests, and then
      completed with a graded oral challenge, spread over at least two doses. However, it has been
      shown that these skin tests, in addition to consuming resources and time, are of limited, or
      even doubtful validity, given the poor predictive values that have been reported in the
      modern penicillins era. It now seems unreasonable to continue their use without addressing
      other, more efficient diagnostic stategies. Several groups have now demonstrated the safety,
      validity, and efficiency of a direct, two-step amoxicillin oral challenge (starting with 10%
      of the standard therapeutic dose, followed by 90 % of the dose), without prior skin tests,
      first for any type of reaction in the pediatric population, then for any non-immediate
      reaction in the adult population. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety,
      efficiency, and validity of direct, two-step graded oral challenge with amoxicillin for the
      evaluation of any reported penicillin allergy in the adult population, excluding high-risk
      patients (documented anaphylaxis to a penicillin in the last 5 years). Skin tests will first
      be performed according to the protocol currently in use at the CHUL, then consented patients
      will proceed with the graded oral challenge still according to the protocol currently in use
      at the CHUL, but regardless of the skin tests results. The results of the two tests will be
      compared to determine the safety, efficiency and validity of proceeding directly to the
      graded oral challenge.

Graded oral challenge with amoxicillin : a first dose of 50 mg of amoxicillin; 20-minute observation period; in the absence of any objective symptom of an allergic reaction, a second dose of amoxicillin of 450 mg; final observation period of 60 minutes, under nurse and medical supervision.</description>
