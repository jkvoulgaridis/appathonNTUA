  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect data regarding ligation of the left atrial appendage
      at least 12 months after surgery for patients that had exclusion of the left atrial appendage
      as a primary minimally invasive procedure or in conjunction with other open cardiac or
      minimally invasive cardiac procedures.

      The purpose of this study is to collect data regarding ligation of the left atrial appendage
      at least 12 months after surgery for patients that had exclusion of the left atrial appendage
      as a primary minimally invasive procedure or in conjunction with other open cardiac or
      minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The patient will undergo a transesophageal
      echocardiogram (TEE) to collect the following data: Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction; Left
      Atrial diameter size; confirmation of Left Atrial Appendage exclusion defined by the absence
      of left atrial to LAA (left atrial appendage) communication measured in millimeters and
      absence of LAA pocket measured in millimeters; presence of thrombus in left atrium.
