    <masking_description>Two laser devices of the same appearance are used, i.e. one with 3x60 mW output power and one with 0 mW output power (sham). Participants in one group is treated with the sham laser device and the other group is treated with laser. The laser beam is invisible for the eye (wavelength 904 nm) and of such low power that heat is not detected. Thus, the participants, therapists and assessors are unaware of which laser device is active/inactive. The laser devices were randomly coded by a secretary who is not otherwise involved in the study.</masking_description>
