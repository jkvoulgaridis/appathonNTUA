  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Total hip- and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) is recommended for relieving pain
      and restoring function for end-stage osteoarthritis, when non-surgical treatment has failed
      to relieve symptoms. Following THA and TKA post-discharge physical rehabilitation is common
      practice, but vary significantly regarding content, duration, intensity and mode of delivery.
      Recent systematic reviews have found home-based rehabilitation to be as good as outpatient
      rehabilitation in terms of pain and physical function. Additionally, no long-term benefits
      seem to persist compared to minimal or no intervention following THA or TKA; questioning the
      true effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation. However, a true &quot;no intervention&quot; (e.g.
      no prescribed exercises) has never been investigated following total THA or TKA. The purpose
      of this present trial is to compare the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, unsupervised
      rehabilitation and no rehabilitation to enhance recovery following THA and TKA.

      Methods: This pragmatic, randomised controlled trial will include 168 patients following
      discharge after THA or TKA. Patients will be randomized into one of the three 6-week
      interventions: telerehabilitation, unsupervised rehabilitation or no intervention. The trial
      is designed as a superiority trial to test the hypothesis that rehabilitation
      (telerehabilitation and unsupervised rehabilitation) is superior to no rehabilitation. The
      primary outcome will be the difference between intervention groups in terms of the mean score
      of the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)/ the Knee injury and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-subscale: function of daily living at first follow-up
      (end of the 6-week intervention). Additional follow-up are scheduled at 3 and 12 months.
      Outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded to group allocation.

      Discussion: As the number of THA and TKA procedures are expected to increase, the need to
      find effective postoperative rehabilitation strategies are warranted. Knowledge on the
      effectiveness of the three investigated rehabilitation strategies will help guide the future
      direction of post-discharge rehabilitation following THA and TKA.

    <masking_description>A physiotherapist will assess the outcomes at baseline after which the patients are randomized. The same physiotherapist will then deliver the allocated intervention and no longer assess outcomes for this patient. A different physiotherapist, who is blinded to treatment allocation, will assess outcomes at the follow-up visits in this patient. At all follow-up visits, patients will be asked not to disclose any information regarding group allocation, and the physiotherapists will be instructed not to ask questions regarding group allocation.
The patients are blinded to the trial hypothesis in order to prevent ascertainment bias. The principal investigator is not an outcome assessor and will not be blinded.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, follow up at 6 weeks, 3 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline the patient's perception of his or her overall functional ability will be assessed using a single numeric rating scale, as recommended by OARSI. The patient will be asked a single question: &quot;How would you rate your current level of function during your usual activities of daily living?&quot; During follow-up assessment patients will be asked the same question as at baseline. Their answer will be rated on a 0-100 visual rating scale with end-points anchored as &quot;Inability to perform any daily activities&quot; (0) and &quot;No problem with any daily activity&quot; (100)</description>

    <description>Performance-based assessment will be performed using the 30-s chair-stand test, which represent the sit-to-stand activity. The test counts the number of sit-to-stand repetitions the patient can perform in 30 seconds. The straight-back chairs used for testing during all outcome assessments will be of the same model, same height (approximately 43 cm), and will be placed against a wall. Any other adaptations (i.e. the use of armrests or assistive devices) will be reported. To assure understanding, two slow-paced repetitions will be practiced before the test initiates. The 30-s chair stand test has proven good reliability to measure functional performance following THA and TKA.</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction.: 4-Likert ordinal scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to answer four questions to indicate their level of satisfaction. The answers will be based on a 4-Likert ordinal scale with the categories: very satisfied (100 points), somewhat satisfied (75 points), somewhat dissatisfied (50 points), and very dissatisfied (25 points). The score is the unweighted mean of the combined scores. The four questions are: &quot;How satisfied are you with the results of your surgery and rehabilitation?&quot;, &quot;How satisfied are you with your surgery and rehabilitation for improving your pain?&quot;, &quot;How satisfied are you with the results of your surgery and rehabilitation for improving your ability to do home or yard work?&quot; and &quot;How satisfied are you with the results of surgery and rehabilitation for improving your ability to do recreational activities?&quot;. The questions are modified from the Self-Administered Patient Satisfaction Scale for Primary Hip and Knee Arthroplasty.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this group will receive interactive virtual rehabilitation using a mobile app. The telerehabilitation is based on sensor technology, developed by ICURA. This technology consists of motion sensors that can measure and analyse the quantity and quality of the exercises, and a mobile application that can guide the patient with visual response. A unique feature of ICURA trainer allows the physiotherapist to remotely supervise the individual patients exercise adherence and progress. This technology has already been successfully implemented in several different rehabilitation facilities across Denmark, and, hence, reflects current clinical practice.</description>
