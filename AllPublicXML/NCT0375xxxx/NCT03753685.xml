    <textblock>
      In this phase Ⅱ, open-label, single arm, multicenter study, efficacy and safety of oral X-396
      capsule (Ensartinib) in 37 Chinese ALK-positive NSCLC patients with brain metastases will be
      assessed. Eligible patients will receive 225mg X-396 capsules once daily and objective
      responses of brain metastasis based on investigator assessment according to Response
      Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) are primary outcome measures.
