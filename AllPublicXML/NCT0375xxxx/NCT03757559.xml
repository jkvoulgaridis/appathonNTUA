  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the abuse potential of single doses of
      cebranopadol (GRT6005) relative to hydromorphone (immediate-release formulation [IR] and
      placebo in 48 non-dependent recreational opioid users.

      Secondary objectives were to evaluate the abuse potential of hydromorphone IR compared to
      placebo (trial validation), to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses of
      cebranopadol (200, 400, and 800 micrograms), and to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      cebranopadol and optionally some of its metabolites.

    <textblock>
      The study comprised an Enrollment Visit, a Qualification Phase, a Treatment Phase with 7
      double-blind treatment periods for each participant, and a Final Examination.

      In the Qualification Phase, all participants completed a naloxone challenge test to confirm
      that they were not opioid-dependent. The Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale was used to record
      the signs or symptoms of withdrawal observed during the naloxone challenge test. Following
      the naloxone challenge test, participants received a single oral dose of hydromorphone
      immediate-release (IR) 12 milligrams (mg) and placebo in a double-blinded, randomized
      crossover manner to ensure that they could discriminate between an active drug and placebo
      and could tolerate hydromorphone IR 12 mg. After a washout phase of at least 3 days,
      participants could continue with the Treatment Phase.

      In the Treatment Phase, each participant received single oral doses of the 7 different
      investigational medicinal products (IMPs) (Treatment A to Treatment G) in 7 sequential
      treatment periods. The treatment sequences per participant were randomly assigned, except for
      one administration of placebo (Treatment G) which always followed the highest dose of
      cebranopadol (Treatment C). Each IMP administration was given under fasted conditions and was
      separated by a washout period of at least 14 days.

      Participants were confined to the study site from Day -1 until 48 hours after the first IMP
      administration in the Qualification Phase and from Day -1 until 56 hours after the IMP
      administration in the treatment periods. Pharmacodynamic assessments and blood sampling for
      pharmacokinetics were performed from pre-dose until 56 hours post-dose in each treatment
      period.

      The Final Examination was conducted 5 days to 10 days after the discharge from the last
      treatment period or upon early discontinuation from the study.

Based on the assigned treatment sequence, each participant was randomly allocated to receive a single oral dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in each of 7 periods. One administration of placebo (Treatment G) always followed cebranopadol 800 micrograms (Treatment C). Each IMP administration was given under fasted conditions and was separated by a washout period of at least 14 days.</intervention_model_description>

             examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs (pulse rate, systolic
             blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation
             using pulse oximetry) at enrollment.

          6. Adequate contraception is being used or women of non-childbearing potential may be
             enrolled if surgically sterile (i.e., after hysterectomy) or post-menopausal for at
             least 2 years (based on participant's report).

               -  For women of childbearing potential: A medically acceptable and highly effective
                  method of birth control is defined as any form of contraception with a low
                  failure rate defined as less than 1 percent per year. For example:

                    -  Hormonal contraceptives for at least 8 weeks prior to the Enrollment Visit
                       and at least until 4 weeks after the Final Examination.

                    -  An intra-uterine device. Additional barrier contraception should be used by
                       the partner for the duration of the study, defined as from the time of the
                       Enrollment Visit until 4 weeks after the Final Examination. A single barrier
                       method alone is not acceptable.

               -  For men: Participants must be willing to use medically acceptable and highly
                  effective methods of birth control. Participants must be willing to use barrier
                  contraception (condom) during sexual intercourse with females from the first
                  administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP) until 4 weeks after the
                  Final Examination. Participants must be willing to take care that their female
                  sexual partner uses at least 1 additional method of contraception with a low
                  failure rate defined as less than 1 percent per year (e.g., hormonal
                  contraceptives, diaphragm) during this time frame. A single barrier method alone
                  is not acceptable.

               -  The ability to tolerate hydromorphone, as judged by the investigator based on
                  available safety data (e.g., respiratory rate greater than or equal to 8 breaths
