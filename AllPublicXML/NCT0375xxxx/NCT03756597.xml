      The PAN Cancer Early Detection study is a prospective cross-sectional observational
      case-control study evaluating whether Breath Biopsy (developed by Owlstone Medical Ltd.Í¾ the
      Sponsor of this study) can differentiate between patients with and without different cancer
      types, by comparing breath biomarkers of patients with gastric, oesophageal, pancreatic,
      renal, prostate and bladder cancer from matched controls. In total 82 cases (cancer) and 82
      matched controls for each tumour type will be recruited at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS
      Foundation Trust, with an additional 164 healthy volunteers. Participants who consented to
      participation will be asked to provide 1 breath sample, using the ReCIVA breath collector
      (developed by Owlstone Medical Ltd. and CE-marked). For controls and cases,medical metadata
      (general medical history) will be collected as well as information on the diagnostic work-up
      and follow up data (general health data, details on therapy response for patients with
      confirmed cancer diagnosis, development of a malignancy during follow-up for matched
      controls) on the basis of the participant's medical charts. Follow-up data will be collected
      up to 12 months after the breath sample was collected. For healthy volunteers, clinical
      metadata and a telephone based follow up at 6 and 12 months will be collected. In a small
      subset of 15% of the participants, up to additional 4 breath samples will be collected to
      contribute to the development of a validated assay that can then be validated in further
      studies.

      The anonymised breath samples will be analysed at the clinical laboratories of Owlstone
      Medical Ltd. in Cambridge. The study is a collaboration effort between Owlstone Medical Ltd.,
      Cancer Research UK and University Cambridge Hospitals NHS Foundation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need for techniques that allow detection of cancer at an earlier stage
      when curative treatment is more likely. Exhaled biomarkers are known to reflect a wide range
      of metabolic processes, including those related to cancer such as the Warburg effect.
      Owlstone Medical Ltd (hereafter referred to as Owlstone Medical) has developed Breath Biopsy;
      a workflow to collect and analyse breath Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in a highly
      standardised way. The PAN-study is a collaborative effort between Cambridge University
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), University of Cambridge (UoC), Cancer Research United
      Kingdom (CRUK) and Owlstone Medical to evaluate the potential of Breath Biopsy to detect
      various types of cancer by profiling breath metabolites.

      The PAN-cancer Early Detection study or PAN-study is a prospective cross-sectional
      observational case-control study evaluating whether Breath Biopsy can differentiate between
      patients with and without different cancer types by comparing breath biomarkers for a range
      of cancer types including patients with gastric, oesophageal, pancreatic, renal, prostate and
      bladder cancer. Subjects with a histologically confirmed cancer will be recruited from CUH by
      local research staff. Breath samples will be collected by means of the ReCIVA breath sampler
      which requires tidal breathing into a face mask for around 10 minutes. A cancer free control
      subject matched for age, sex and tumour specific risk factors will be recruited and sampled.
      Breath samples will be shipped to Owlstone Medical for analysis of breath biomarkers by Gas
      Chromatography-Time Of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Field
      Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-FAIMS).

      This study will be the first step towards evaluating VOCs analysis as a test to improve early
      detection rates for cancer with future applicability to primary care. Ultimately, such a
      research program could enable low cost and widespread targeted screening programs for cancer.

    <description>The ability of the breath-test to discriminate between patients with and without any cancer or a specific tumour type will be investigated for both the GC-FAIMS and GC-TOF-MS data separately. A similar approach will be taken for both datasets: Data will be curated after clinical and technical monitoring to assure maximum validity of the data utilised to construct the algorithm.After curation subjects will be partitioned into a 2:1 training and validation set split equally between cases and controls. This partitioning will be done en bloc for cases and matched controls. Model selection will be conducted in the training set with a 10-fold internal cross-validation to reduce model overfitting. Subsequently, the validation set will be utilised to estimate the performance of the model in an independent sample.</description>

Initial data-analysis will be performed after the diagnostic work-up has been completed for study subjects and sufficient subjects have been recruited into a single study group. The metadata and classification of subjects can be updated up to 6 months after breath sampling based on the data obtained through chart-based follow-up.

    <description>The ReCIVA breath sampler contains a CO2 and pressure sensor, which allows the operator to monitor the breath sampling procedure and patient comfort. Both the operator and the patient can pause or abort the breath sampling procedure within seconds by removing the mask. The time investment required from patients is approximately 15 minutes for consenting and medical history and 10 minutes per breath collection.</description>

      Patients will inhale room air from which environmental VOCs have been removed to prevent
      contamination of the sample. The mask contains a CO2 sensor that drives two micro-pumps in
      the mask that sample alveolar and bronchial breath separately. This is relevant because
      different cancer biomarkers can be found in different portions of breath. During the
      procedure the breath will automatically be sampled onto four sorbent tubes to collect a total
      of 1.5L of breath. The procedure will normally take around 10 minutes, very rarely exceeding
      15 minutes if exhaled volumes are small. After collection, the sorbent tubes are stored in
      the refrigerator at 4-8Â°C until shipment to Owlstone Medical.
