    <textblock>
      Prospective analysis included patients, 18 years or older, scheduled for 60 daily HBOT
      sessions between 2016-2018. Each session was 90 min of 100% oxygen at 2 ATA with 5 minutes
      air breaks every 20 min, five days per week. Pulmonary functions,measured at baseline and
      after HBOT,included forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second
      (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF).

      After signing an informed consent form, the participants underwent a pulmonary function
      baseline evaluation. Participants were treated in a multiplace chamber (HAUX-Life-Support
      GmbH) for 60 daily sessions, 5 days a week. Each session consisted of 90 minutes of exposure
      to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA with 5 minute air breaks every 20 minutes. Participants repeated
      their pulmonary function evaluation after the last HBOT session.

      Pulmonary function Measurements of pulmonary functions were performed using the MiniSpir
      testing apparatus (MIR- Medical International Research, USA). The equipment was calibrated
      using a 3-liter syringe before performing measurements according to the manufacturer's
      instructions. Measurements were performed by a trained technician. The forced expiratory
      maneuvers were performed as recommended by the guidelines[13].

      The forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak
      expiratory flow rate (PEF) were taken as the highest readings obtained from at least three
      satisfactory forced expiratory maneuvers. Mean forced mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%)
      and forced expiratory flow rates at 25, 50 and 75% of FVC expired (FEF25%, FEF50% and FEF75%)
      were taken as the best values from flow-volume loops not differing by &gt;5% from the highest
      FVC.
