  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and potential effectiveness of an
      active, music-instruction intervention in improving psychological health and social
      functioning among Veterans suffering from moderate to severe Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a prospective, delayed-entry randomized pilot trial.
      Regression-adjusted difference in means were used to examine the intervention's effectiveness
      with respect to PTSD symptomatology (primary outcome) as well as depression, perceptions of
      cognitive failures, social functioning and isolation, and health-related quality of life
      (secondary outcomes).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms as measured by the PTSD Checklist Civilian (PCLC), a self-report scale that measures PTSD presence and severity. The 17 items correspond to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. The level of distress produced by each symptom is rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). A score &gt;50 on this measure is considered clinically significant (maximum score = 85).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), a 21-item self-report scale measuring the presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the two weeks preceding test administration. Each answer ranges in score from 0-3. Total scores indicate minimal (0-13), mild (14-19), moderate (20-28), and severe (29-63; maximum = 63) levels of reported depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptions of Cognitive Failures</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) was used as a self-reported measure of everyday cognitive lapses for perception, memory, and motor function, such as forgetting appointments or having word finding difficulty. Total scores range from 0 to 100 with higher numbers indicating worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale was administered to assess subjective feelings of social isolation. This is a 20-item scale summed to give a total score ranging from 0-60 with higher numbers indicating worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life (EuroQoL) Scale, a validated preference-based scale for which population norms are available in the US and elsewhere, was used as the global evaluation of veteran's health-related quality of life. The 5-item EuroQoL measure combines data on activity restrictions (ADL, IADL limitations), limitations in participation (usual major activity and other social activities) and self- perceived health status (excellent, good, fair or poor) to measure one's overall satisfaction with health and well-being. Scores range from -0.594 to 1.000, higher values represent better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Following the baseline interview, veterans randomized to the immediate entry group directly engaged in the Guitars for Vets Intervention and were interviewed at the end of the intervention period, roughly 6 weeks later. The intervention content and duration (6 weeks) was the same across both groups.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to the delayed entry group had their baseline interview repeated at the end of the delayed entry period (4 weeks) prior to receiving the 6-week Guitars for Vets Intervention as well as after intervention completion. The intervention content and duration (6 weeks) was the same across both groups.</description>

    <intervention_name>Guitars for Vets Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>This was an active intervention providing veterans with an acoustic guitar, guitar pick, tuning instruments, a music book, practice CDs, and individual and group sessions of music instruction during a 6-week intervention period. Six tailored 1-hour individual guitar instruction sessions were scheduled (1 session per week). In addition to the 6 tailored individual lessons, the intervention provided 3 group sessions. Veterans were given a guitar that they could keep upon completion of the program. The same instructor was assigned to a subject for the duration of the study, and group sessions were supervised by the Education Director of Guitars for Vets.</description>
