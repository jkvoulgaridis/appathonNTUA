    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Micra Atrial TRacking Using A Ventricular AccELerometer 2 (MARVEL 2) study
      is to demonstrate safe and effective operation of the MARVEL 2 features for providing AV
      synchronous pacing in patients with normal sinus node function and AV block
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MARVEL 2 study is an acute, prospective, global, multi-center, software-download clinical
      study. The study is planned to be conducted in US, Europe, and Asia. The study is expected to
      be conducted at approximately 15-20 centers in up to 100 subjects to obtain at least 70
      usable Holter datasets to meet the objectives of the study. The expected total study duration
      (from first subject enrollment to the exit of the last subject) is approximately 6-months;
      this represents the time necessary to enroll the target sample size of at least 70 subjects
      with usable Holter datasets. Software will be downloaded into patients implanted with a Micra
      device to allow the new algorithm performance to be measured in patients where a Micra device
      has already been chosen as most appropriate for the patient.

      Most enrolled subjects will complete the study procedures during a single study visit.
      However, subjects enrolling in the study at the time of their Micra implant (anticipated to
      be approximately 10 subjects) will have the investigational algorithm downloaded following
      Micra implant, prior to hospital discharge, and approximately 1-month post-implant. This
      subset of subjects with de novo Micra implants will allow the MARVEL 2 features to be tested
      at multiple points in the device life cycle.

      Since the download algorithm running in a Micra device significantly increases current drain,
      a 2-4 hour acute study is used to limit the reduction in device longevity.

    <description>A subject will meet the primary endpoint if a paced or sensed ventricular beat is within 300 ms following an ECG confirmed P-wave for at least 70% of the ECG confirmed P-waves. The primary endpoint will be evaluated during the MARVEL 2 setup phase during MARVEL 2 Algorithm monitor mode (VDI pacing which is effectively VVI pacing) and during the 20-minute resting period in which the MARVEL 2 Algorithm is programmed to Adaptive mode (VDD pacing)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Free From Inappropriate Pacemaker Function Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion an average of one day</time_frame>
    <description>A participant will meet the primary endpoint if they are free from the following MARVEL 2 software related events during the entire Holter monitoring period where the MARVEL 2 features are enabled.
Inappropriate pacemaker function events are defined as:
Cardiac pauses lasting longer than 2 cardiac cycles (where cardiac cycle length is defined by the programmed lower rate interval of the pacemaker), OR
Pacemaker oversensing induced tachycardia exceeding 3-minutes, defined as oversensing of the pacemaker's accelerometer signal leading to a heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral</measure>
    <time_frame>12 cardiac cycles</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI) as obtained from echocardiogram while the MARVEL 2 features are in adaptive mode (VDD pacing) and while the MARVEL 2 features are in monitor mode (VDI pacing which is effectively VVI pacing). This was measured by the echo core laboratory that was blinded to the study participant and MARVEL 2 algorithm mode.</description>
