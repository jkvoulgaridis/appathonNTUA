  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, with the increasing intensities of the tobacco industry and air pollution in
      China, the incidence and mortality of lung cancer have become the most important issue that
      threatens human health.Over the past two decades, the treatment of EGFR+ NSCLC is molecular
      target therapy (EGFR-TKI). However, only about 30 percent patients with T790M mutation could
      accept 3rd generation of EGFR-TKI（AZD9291) , most of the patients with progressive disease
      statuses still stays in the mode of treatment based on radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This is
      a prospective, single-center, one-arm clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of apatinib plus chemotherapy for 30 patients who progressed after EGFR-TKI treatment
      without T790M mutation. The participants will receive apatinib 250mg qd orally combine with
      chemotherapy, if the patient has a grade 3/4 adverse reaction during such treatment, it can
      be reduced to apatinib 250mg orally once per two days. Chemotherapeutic agents are limited to
      platinum-based double drugs chemotherapy.The primary outcome endpoint was progression-free
      survival.
