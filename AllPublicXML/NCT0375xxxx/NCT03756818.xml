      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of TAK-659 and paclitaxel in
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors. TAK-659 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving TAK-659 and
      paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of spleen tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor TAK-659 (TAK-659) and paclitaxel.

      II. To define the safety profiles of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To evaluate clinical response signals to the combination. II. To
      analyze pharmacokinetic interactions between TAK-659 and paclitaxel. III. To assess
      predictive biomarkers (baseline molecular mutation status) and/or resistant pathways by
      comparing molecular signatures at baseline versus at time of relapse in patients who have
      achieved objective responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 and
      paclitaxel.

      Patients receive spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
