  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators will begin to explore the possibility that, as in mice,
      janus kinase inhibitor 1 (JAK1) inhibition with haploidentical-hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) may mitigate graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS) while retaining Graft-versus-Leukemia (GVL) and improving engraftment. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety of itacitinib with haplo-hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT) measured by the effect on engraftment and grade III-IV GVHD.

Itacitinib 200 mg/day from Day -3 to Day 100, followed by a 1-2 month taper. During the tapering period, itacitinib dose should be decreased to 100 mg daily for 30-60 days then discontinued.
To address concerns of engraftment failure using itacitinib throughout the transplant period, for the first three patients the investigators will consent the donor for a second CD34+ collection to use as a rescue in the case of engraftment failure.</description>
