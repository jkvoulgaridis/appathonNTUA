    <textblock>
      The study seeks to enroll 501+ patients to use a HIV self testing device to test for HIV in a
      blood sample drawn by finger prick. The purpose of the trial is to assess the usability of
      the device by providing participants with video and written instructions on how to correctly
      obtain a result from the device.
