  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Girl Empower (GE) is a program designed to equip girls with the skills and experiences
      necessary to make healthy, strategic life choices and to stay safe from sexual exploitation
      and abuse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GE program is unique in its approach because it addresses girls' needs holistically. The
      girls' activities will take place in girl-only safe spaces located in their communities and
      contains the following components: Mentorship: girls have access to older female mentors.
      Mentors both provide weekly group-based and one-to-one interaction with girls as well as
      teach them critical skills; Asset building: Girls will have access to life skills and
      financial literacy training. This includes setting up savings accounts so girls practice
      their financial literacy skills, Monthly caregiver discussion groups among guardians of
      program girls, Capacity building and training of local health and psychosocial service
      providers to provide quality services to survivors of gender-based violence Intervention
      communities will either receive the GE program alone or the GE program with the plus small
      cash transfers to the girls' families as an incentive to attendance in weekly sessions (GE+).

    <masking_description>The impact evaluation is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with three study arms: control (no program), GE, and GE+. GE refers to the Girl Empower program alone, while GE+ adds small cash transfers to the families of eligible girls as an incentive to increase take-up of GE attendance in weekly sessions. The study team will conduct a baseline survey of all girls age 13-14 and their caregiver in 100 communities in Nimba County, Liberia. Communities will then be randomized, blocking on number of girl in the community and % of girls enrolled in school, to one of the 3 study arms. Two years following the baseline survey (1 year following program completion), the study team will conduct an endline survey in all 100 communities with the same girls and caregivers and compare outcomes in the three study arms.</masking_description>
