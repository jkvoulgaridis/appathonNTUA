  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel
      group study of Isoxsuprine in MS subjects experiencing a typical relapse.

      Evidence from preclinical stroke models and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis suggest
      that isoxsuprine hydrochloride may have neuroprotective activity and reduce disability in
      animal models. Given its potential neuroprotective effects in CNS injury models, the
      investigators propose to test it as a safe, tolerable add on treatment for acute relapses in
      patients with relapsing forms of MS.

      This is a proof of concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel
      group study of Isoxsuprine in MS subjects experiencing a typical relapse.

      All subjects will have a documented diagnosis of relapsing MS or a clinically isolated
      syndrome by international criteria. The relapse will be of sufficient severity that their
      physician recommends treatment with a high dose corticosteroid pulse. All subjects will have
      a physical examination and history with questions on drug sensitivities. Subjects
      experiencing the onset of objective neurological deficits consistent with relapse within 7
      days of randomization are eligible for screening for this study. Those currently on MS
      disease modifying therapy will have received a stable regimen of the medications for at least
      30 days prior to screening and will continue the same doses and regimens for the duration of
      their study participation.

      Consented subjects will be assessed for relapse criteria and those who meet study eligibility
      criteria and agree to be treated with a standard 3 to 5 day pulse of high dose
      corticosteroids, will be randomized with equal probability to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
      placebo capsule or active Isoxsuprine (ISX).

      The Screening Visit will take place within 7 days of relapse onset and within 48 hours of
      initiating high dose steroids. Subjects may start corticosteroids anytime during this 7 day
      window. During the screening period, subjects will be assessed with the Expanded Disability
      Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), and cognitive testing
      prior to treatment with ISX or placebo (1:1 ratio). Safety Assessments during screening will
      include a physical exam, electrocardiogram, vital signs, weight and a urine pregnancy test
      for females of child bearing potential. At 7 (± 1) days following the completion of the 5-day
      ISX dosing, subjects will be re-assessed with the EDSS.

      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment response using the EDSS and other standard measures.

      Study drug will be administered as one (1) 10 mg capsule, 3 times daily for 5 days in
      conjunction with concomitant dosing with high dose corticosteroids. This can be any accepted
      regimen, including daily iv methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day or 600mg oral prednisone two times
      a day at approximately 8AM and noon, with food, as typically provided by UNM MS Specialty
      Clinic.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the potential efficacy of Isoxuprine as add-on treatment for improving neurological disability on Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS is based on a standard neurological examination to determine 7 Functional Systems Scores (FSS) (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral function). Each FSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6. The EDSS is a composite ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments. It is calculated from standard tables based on the individual FSS scores.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Treatment Efficacy Measures (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite)</measure>

    <description>The MSFC requires the 1) Timed 25-Foot walk; 2) 9-Hole PegTest (9-HPT); and 3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT-3&quot; version). The results from each of these three tests are transformed into Z-scores and averaged to yield a composite score for each patient at each time point (higher scores represent more disability). The MSFC score is a continuous variable that can be used as a numerical variable in analyses. Each of the 3 MSFC tests can also be analyzed and compared as individual measures.</description>
