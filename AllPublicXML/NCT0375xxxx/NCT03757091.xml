    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well flexible intubation scope with or without video laryngoscope
      works in supporting endotracheal tube placement in patients with head and neck cancer before
      surgery. Flexible intubation scope and video laryngoscope are devices that have a small
      camera to help the doctor see the patient's airway on a screen. Both devices may help the
      doctor who gives anesthesia prevent complications from placing the breathing tube (such as
      pain or mouth injury).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rates of difficult endotracheal tube (ETT) placement using a flexible
      intubation scope (FIS) versus a combination of flexible intubation and video laryngoscopy in
      difficult airway management.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the ease of using a flexible intubation scope (FIS) with and without the use of
      the video laryngoscope (VL).

      II. Total time for securing the airway. III. Number of attempts required for intubation. IV.
      Rate of failure at intubation. V. Incidence of desaturation. VI. Assessment for hoarseness,
      sore mouth, neck, or jaw, dysphonia, dysphagia, lip injury, tongue injury, or tooth damage.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo flexible scope intubation up to 2 attempts following induction of
      general anesthesia and adequate manual ventilation. In case of failed 2 attempts, patients
      undergo a third attempt utilizing another technique or device.

      ARM B: Patients undergo flexible scope intubation and video laryngoscopy up to 2 attempts
      following induction of general anesthesia and adequate manual ventilation. In case of failed
      2 attempts, patients undergo a third attempt utilizing another technique or device.

    <description>For complications, researchers will assign a '0' for no complication arising and a '1' for any complications arising. The total score will range from 0 to 3 and will be summarized using frequencies and percentages related to each level of the total score and using the mean score and standard deviation, whichever is more appropriate.</description>
