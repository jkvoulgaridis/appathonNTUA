      This study will be done in people living with HIV to see if an investigational vaccine made
      from a person's own white blood cells is safe and tolerated. This study will also look at the
      body's immune response to the vaccine and evaluate four different methods of making the
      vaccine to see which method may result in better immune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of strong medicines for HIV infection, there is no cure for the
      infection. The current anti-HIV drugs, used in combination, are effective in slowing the
      growth of the virus and delaying the progression of the infection. There is increasing
      information to suggest that a vigorous immune response (a strong response of the body to
      fight infection) to HIV may also result in improved control of the HIV infection. Such strong
      immune responses are found in a small number of HIV-infected individuals, but not in the
      majority.

      Dendritic cells, or DCs, are a type of white blood cell that works together with other immune
      cells to fight infection. The DCs role is to bring substances foreign to the body, such as
      viruses including HIV or cancer cell proteins, to the body's immune system. Large numbers of
      DCs can be made from blood samples and administered back to the same person as an
      individualized vaccine. Vaccines made from DCs have been studied in HIV and numerous types of
      cancer.

      The vaccines will be created by two different laboratory methods, standard or improved, using
      an individual's own DCs and either an individual's own inactive HIV that has been killed with
      heat or manmade HIV proteins called peptides. The peptides have not been studied for this use
      in humans, and these vaccines are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      prevent or treat HIV infection.

      This study will be done in two steps. During Step 1 (Entry-Week 12), participants will have 4
      study visits for tests, procedures and exams. At Week 4, participants will be randomized by
      chance into one of six study groups, like rolling dice. Four of the study groups will receive
      a DC-HIV vaccine while two of the study groups will receive a &quot;control&quot; vaccine with only
      DCs. Participants will have a 4:1 chance of receiving a DC-HIV study vaccine.

        -  Group 1: enhanced DC-HIV vaccine with inactive HIV

        -  Group 2: enhanced DC-HIV vaccine with HIV peptides

        -  Group 3: enhanced DCs only (control)

        -  Group 4: classic DC-HIV vaccine with inactive HIV

        -  Group 5: classic DC-HIV vaccine with HIV peptides

        -  Group 6: classic DCs only (control)

      Each participant will receive 6 study vaccinations at 4-week intervals beginning at Week 12.
      Researchers will compare the results from participants who get the active study vaccines with
      results from participants who get the control vaccines. Participants, the researchers and the
      clinic staff will not know which vaccine participants are getting.

      In Step 2 (Weeks 12 - 80), participants will have 18 study visits to receive the 6 study
      vaccinations and for tests to monitor health and safety and to see how the study vaccine
      affects the immune system and the virus.

             (IND) studies.

          2. Receiving continuous ART for at least 24 months (defined as no interruptions longer
             than 14 consecutive days) and with no changes in the components of the ART for at
             least 8 weeks prior to study entry. A change in formulation (for example tenofovir
             disaproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide) will not be considered a change in ART.

          3. Screening CD4+ cell count â‰¥350cells/mm3 obtained within 60 days prior to study entry
             by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

          4. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/ml for at least 24 months prior to study entry
             using a FDA-approved assay performed by any laboratory that has a CLIA certification
             or its equivalent. Participants must have at least one documented HIV-1 RNA less than
             50 copies/ml &gt;24 months prior to study entry and at least one HIV-1 RNA less than 50
             copies/ml within 12 months prior to study entry. All available HIV-1 RNA measurements

             the following note.

             NOTE: Unconfirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 50 copies/ml but &lt;200 copies/mL is allowed if

          5. Screening HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL using a FDA-approved assay performed by any
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent within 60 days prior to
             entry.

          6. Men and women age 18 to 65 years, inclusive.

          8. Ability and willingness of participant to provide informed consent.

          9. In the opinion of the investigator, no medical, mental health or other condition that
             precludes participation.

         10. For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within
             48 hours prior to entry by any US clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification
             or its equivalent, or is using a point-of-care (POC)/ CLIA-waived test. Females of
             reproductive potential include women who have not been post-menopausal for at least 12
             consecutive months, (i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 12 months) or
             women who have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy). Self- report is acceptable
             documentation of menopause and sterilization.

         11. All participants must agree not to participate in the conception process (eg, active
             attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization),
             and if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the
             participant/partner must use at least one reliable form of contraception (condoms,
             with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an
             IUD; or hormone-based contraceptive), while receiving study treatment and for 12 weeks
             following the final study vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently breastfeeding or pregnant

          2. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study vaccine or
             their formulation.

             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease
             (i.e., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), chronic pancreatitis, or autoimmune
             hepatitis, myositis, or myopathy.

          4. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          5. Serious medical illness that requires systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within
             30 days prior to entry.

          6. Use of systemic immunomodulators (eg, interleukins, interferons, cyclosporine),
             systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 60 days prior to
             study entry.

             NOTE: Participants receiving stable physiologic doses of glucocorticoids, defined as
             the equivalent of prednisone â‰¤10 mg/day, will not be excluded. Stable physiologic
             glucocorticoid doses should not be discontinued for the duration of the study. In
             addition, participants receiving inhaled or topical corticosteroids, or topical
             imiquimod will not be excluded.

          7. Participation on any HIV immunotherapy or therapeutic vaccination trials within 6
             months prior to study entry.

          8. History of positive HCV antibody with detectable HCV RNA in plasma within 48 weeks
             prior to study entry.

             NOTE: Persons with positive HCV Ab but negative plasma HCV RNA are allowed to
             participate. Sites must document negative HCV RNA within 24 weeks of study entry.

          9. History of positive HBsAg within 48 weeks prior to study entry.

         10. Treatment for hepatitis C within 6 months prior to study entry.

         11. Initiation of ART during acute HIV-1 infection (as determined by the site investigator
             by history and/or available medical records).

         12. Lack of adequate venous access that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with study requirements.
