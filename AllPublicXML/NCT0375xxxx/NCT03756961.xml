  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid consumption has exploded in the western world 1, and for some patient populations
      such as obese patients, patients with sleep apnoea or patients undergoing cancer treatment,
      opioid-sparing/ opioid-free strategies could have positive effects on outcomes. Studies
      suggest that opioids could have opioid-induced immunosuppression, induce chronic
      post-operative pain syndrome and hyperalgesia in addition to the more well-known side effects
      such as respiratory depression, nausea, bladder, and bowel dysfunction. Hence, new studies
      are needed on the impact of person-centered care programs that combine pharmaceutical and
      non-pharmaceutical strategies to reduce the adverse short and long-term effects of opioid
      therapy.

      Aim To evaluate the effects of opioid sparing care pathways compared to conventional
      opioid-based treatment for pain relief, opioid consumption, recovery after surgery,
      self-efficacy and health economy in patients undergoing obesity surgery. The aim will be
      investigated by a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, non-commercial single site study (Nov
      2018-Dec 2022), approved by the Swedish Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2017003830-97) and the
      ethical review board (DNR 1006-17).

      Hypothesis

      1. An opioid-free care pathway provides non-inferior pain relief as the conventional care
      with opioids during the post-operative phase.

      Primary outcomes &quot;No difference in pain (NRS pain (0-10) between opioid-free intervention
      compared to conventional postoperative treatment (control group) during the post-operative
      phase until discharge to the surgical ward.

      Secondary outcome &quot;An opioid-free treatment provides improved combined outcomes (composite
      score) consisting of 1) General Self-Efficacy Scale, 2) Postop Quality of Recovery Scale
      (PostopQRS), hospital rehospitalization or death compared to conventional treatment after
      three months.

      &quot;An opioid-free treatment improves recovery after surgery measured with the PostopQRS
      compared with conventional postoperative therapy (20 min, 40 min), during hospitalization (24
      hours, 48 hours) and afterward (14 days, 30 days, three months, six months, 12 months and 24
      months).

      &quot;An opioid-free treatment results in reduced opioid consumption during the post-operative
      care period compared with conventional treatment.

      &quot;An opioid-free treatment provides similar care time compared with conventional therapy
      during hospitalization.

      &quot;An opioid-free treatment improves self-efficacy, measured with the General Self-Efficacy
      Scale compared to conventional treatment at three months, six months, 12 months, 24 months.

      &quot;An opioid-free treatment provides increased quality of life measured with the RAND-36 as
      well as EQ5D compared to conventional therapy during hospitalization (3 months, six months,
      12 months, 24 months).

      &quot;An opioid-free treatment provides increased patient experience and satisfaction, measured
      with the PPE-15 and PostopQRS compared to conventional therapy during hospitalization (2
      weeks, three months, six months)

      &quot;Mapping the long-term prescription and usage pattern of analgesic drugs between the
      intervention group and conventional group.

    <description>Investigating recovery after surgery measured with the The Post-operative Quality of Recovery Scale (PostopQRS) compared with conventional postoperative therapy.
PostopQRS: Is a validated 5-dimensional instrument (Physiology, Nociception, Emotion, Cognition, ADL) in addition to questions about patient satisfaction.
The scoring of recovery is 'return to baseline values or better' which requires a change score ≥ 0 for each question. The postoperative value for each test ( Cognition has a 2 scale tolerance due to day-to-day variation) is subtracted from the baseline value, and if no difference, then the patient is recovered.</description>

The 10 answers are summed and a mean is calculated. Higher scores are better.</description>

Each item has response alternatives ranging from no problem, some problem, problem. Each response is coded either as &quot;a problem&quot; ( problem, some problem) or as &quot;no problem&quot;. Problem is scored as=1, no problem=0. The mean is calculated both on item level and as a total score.</description>

    <measure>Change in health status</measure>
    <time_frame>(3 months, six months, 12 months, 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigating the change in health status measured with the EuroQol 5 dimension (EQ5D).
EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status, covering five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.
Each dimension has 3 responses: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. This response results into a number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>
