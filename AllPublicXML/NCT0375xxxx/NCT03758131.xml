    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test whether a Peer-Enhanced Motivational Interviewing
      (PMI) intervention, which has been successful with college students, results in superior
      alcohol and marijuana use outcomes for emerging adults (EA), ages 18-29, who are clients of
      Federally-qualified Health Centers, and their peers. In the first phase of the study,
      seventy-five peer dyads (total n = 150, ntarget client = 75, npeer = 75) will be randomized
      to receive either Peer-Enhanced Motivational Interviewing (PMI), Motivational Interviewing
      only (MI) or Waitlist Control (WC.) In the second, expanded phase of the study, an additional
      325 peer dyads (total n = 650, ntarget client = 325, npeer = 325) will be randomized to
      receive either Peer-Enhanced Motivational Interviewing, Motivational Interviewing only (MI)
      or Waitlist Control.

      This project randomizes peer dyads, consisting of one Emerging Adult (EA), 18-29 years old,
      who both has a substance use problem and attends a Federally-qualified Health Center (i.e.
      target client), and one peer, to one of three conditions. In the Peer-Enhanced Motivational
      Interviewing (PMI) condition, target clients and peers will receive separate one-hour
      sessions of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an empirically-supported treatment that helps
      individuals work through ambivalence about making changes in substance use. MI is thought to
      work because it is a non-confrontational intervention where a therapist empathetically
      reviews substance use behaviors, listens empathetically, and reinforces any client statements
      indicating a desire to change. With the &quot;peer&quot; of each PMI dyad, the therapist presents peer
      with data about the extent of the target client's substance use, builds the peer's motivation
      to help their friend, and teaches the peer communication skills they can use to influence the
      target client's substance use. In the Motivational Interviewing only (MI) condition, the
      target client alone will receive the MI intervention with no peer participation. In the
      Waitlist (WC) condition, target clients and peers can receive the intervention at 2 months
      into the follow-up period for the PMI group.
