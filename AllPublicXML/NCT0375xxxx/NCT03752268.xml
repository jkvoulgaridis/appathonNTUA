    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to understand how patients with chronic cancer pain take
      their long-acting opioid medications, and to develop an intervention to enhance cancer pain
      management.

    <textblock>
      Long-acting opioids are a common treatment for cancer pain. The purpose of this study is to
      develop a program for patients who are taking a prescribed long-acting opioid for their
      cancer pain. Participants will be enrolled in this study at the Massachusetts General
      Hospital Cancer Center. This 14-week study involves completing a set of questionnaires at
      three different times during the study period. . During the study period, participants will
      use electronic pill caps to monitor their pain medication taking. They also will attend a
      series of three visits with one of the nurse practitioners on their care cancer team. The
      visits will focus on learning and practicing skills for managing cancer pain. The information
      that the investigators collect will help identify whether the sessions are feasible and
      useful to patients during the course of treatment for cancer pain.

      This trial will consist of two parts:

      Part 1: This is a single-group prospective observational study. Investigators will use
      quantitative and qualitative methods to examine rates, predictors and outcomes of adherence
      to LA opioids over a period of approximately eight weeks. This information will be used to
      inform Part 2 intervention development and testing.

      Part 2: Investigators will test the behavioral intervention in a non-randomized open pilot,
      over a period of approximately six weeks. Intervention process data, psychosocial and medical
      data, and post-intervention feedback will be collected to assess feasibility and
      acceptability. In an iterative process, ongoing data from exit interviews and therapist
      experience will be used to modify the intervention protocol.

The 3 individual manualized sessions will be conducted (approximately 20 minutes each), led by a nurse practitioner, to provide sufficient dose for change in adherence behaviors.
Learning and practicing skills for managing cancer-related pain and adhering to prescribed LA opioid regimens.
Study staff will provide participants with MEMS caps and bottles at time of enrollment, to monitor LA opioid intake over approximately 14 weeks.</description>
