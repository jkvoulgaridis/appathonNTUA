    <textblock>
      In this work, we evaluated the biometry data of lens subluxation inducing acute angle closure
      which were misdiagnosed as primary angle closure at the first visit, and compared with the
      data of chronic angle closure glaucoma, cataract, primary acute angle closure.

        This retrospective case study included 17 eyes of 17 patients with ASAC-LS, who were
        misdiagnosed with APACG on their first visit. In addition, 56 eyes of 56 patients diagnosed
        with APACG, 54 eyes of 54 patients diagnosed with CPACG, and 56 eyes of 56 patients
        diagnosed with cataract were also included. All of the patients were admitted from Jan 10,
        2016 to Dec 28, 2017 in Tianjin Medical University Hospital. This study was conducted in
        accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of
        Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital.

        ASAC-LS was diagnosed according to the following criteria, including sudden pain in the
        eye, decreased vision with or without nausea and vomiting. Slit lamp microscopy reveals
        phacodonesis, lens inclination or vitreous herniation into the anterior chamber, central
        and peripheral shallow anterior chamber, and asymmetric iris bulge. All patients were
        confirmed during the surgery to have LS.

        APACG was diagnosed with the following criteria6, 7 8, including substantially elevated IOP
        and closed angle, acute eye pain, blurred vision, or nausea and vomiting. More importantly,
        ischemic injury caused by acute ocular hypertension, ciliary or mixed congestion, corneal
        edema, and glaucoma flecks should be detected.

        The diagnostic criteria of CPACG included narrow angle with anterior synechiae of varying
        widths, IOP &gt; 22 mmHg, and glaucomatous optic disc damage and visual field shrinkage9-11
        The angle closure should be more than two quadrants, yet there was no ischemic injury in
        the anterior segment caused by acute ocular hypertension.

        Exclusion criteria were history of laser peripheral iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy,
        glaucoma filtration surgery, angle closure caused by ocular trauma, uveitis,
        neovascularization or lens swelling or hyper mature lens. The patients with acute angle
        closure in both eyes were excluded. The subjects in which Lenstar LS900 examination could
        not be performed because of severe lens opacity or corneal edema were also not included in
        the study.
