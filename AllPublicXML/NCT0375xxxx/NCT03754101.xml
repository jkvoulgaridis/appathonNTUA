  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic mutations has been proved to be associated wth the onset of cardiomyopathy. In the
      present study, we intend to identify new related variants or genes. From March, 2003 to
      November, 2017, patients diagnosed as cardiomyopathy were consecutively recruited, and their
      sampled were drawn from peripheral blood. Paired control group were also enrolled. The whole
      exome sequencing was used to find out the variants associated with the onset of
      cardiomyopathy and its prognosis.
