    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy
      of ginsenoside compound K (GCK) tablets in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This study is
      to be run in China involving 10-12 sites. It will enroll approximately 240 patients to ensure
      128 randomized with active rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment period is 12 weeks and total
      study duration per patient is approximately 14 weeks.

      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase Ib study, 128 patients with active RA are
      planned to be enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo, or different doses
      of GCK tablet (100/200/300 mg). This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary efficacy of GCK tablets in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
