  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic dental injuries are one of the commonly encountered dental emergencies. Missing
      anterior tooth in children due to any injury can be a source of considerable physical and
      psychological discomfort for the child. These consequences also have significant impact on
      parents, who are generally concerned with esthetic and economic aspects of this problem. It
      varies from small crack in the enamel to complete loss of the tooth. Injury to children teeth
      can be both painful and traumatic to the children

      Traumatic injuries to anterior teeth have reported by several investigators. In Asia and
      Africa, the prevalence of TDI to anterior teeth among adolescents ranges from 4% to 35% and
      15% to 21%, respectively and in America and Europe, the prevalence varied from 15% to 23% and
      23% to 35%, respectively . 50% of school children have sustained traumatic injuries prior to
      graduation . A contributing factors make children susceptible to injuries have been widely
      investigated. These factors included Class-II, div.1 malocclusion, increased overjet . 71% to
      92% of all injuries sustained in a lifetime occur before the age of 19 years, which occur at
      home, followed by school and public places.The aim of this study is to assess the mean
      overjet value in Libyan children and to examine the relationship between increased overjet
      and trauma to permanent incisor teeth
