  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, prospective, non-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled
      trial with an experimental and a control group with the aim of evaluating the clinical impact
      of a home-based falls prevention program using a new biofeedback system on community-dwellers
      older adults with fall risk in comparison with standard of care.

      The experimental group will perform a 12-week exercise program at home, under remote
      monitoring from a clinical team, whereas the control group will benefit from standard medical
      care currently in place at the participating primary care facility.

      The hypothesis is that the home-based falls prevention program will lead to a lower risk of
      falling than standard medical care.

    <measure>Change in the 5 Times Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; week 4; week 8; week 12 and then week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 5 Times Sit to Stand Test is a performance test that measures the strength and the lower limb mobility. It consists of the time it takes to stand up from a chair five consecutive times. A cutoff value of 15 seconds is used to distinguish between individuals with and without risk of recurrent falls</description>

    <description>The TUG is a performance test that assesses the mobility, balance and gait in elderly individuals, consisting of the time it takes to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, come back and sit down again.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; week 4; week 8; week 12 and then week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale was developed to evaluate the static and dynamic balance in three domains: sitting, standing and changing posture. It is a scale composed of 14 items graded by an external observer on 5 levels (from 0 to 4). Scale scores range from 0 to 56, with higher scores representing a higher level of functionality.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Shorts Falls Efficacy Scale-International</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; week 4; week 8; week 12 and then week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Shorts Falls Efficacy Scale-International was developed in order to systematize on a scale the fear of falling. It is a questionnaire of 7 items filled by the user, evaluating from 1 to 4 the fear of falling during the execution of a series of activities of daily living. It is a standardized and comparable measure over time, which provides an additional dimension in the characterization of participants. The cutoff levels are: low fear (7-8); moderate fear (9-13) and high fear (14-28).</description>
