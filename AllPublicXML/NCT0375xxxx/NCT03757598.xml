  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quasi-experimental study to evaluate whether clinical care offered to clients was more
      appropriate and in line with WHO recommendations for care in normally progressing labor and
      in labor with complications, among providers using the novel intervention, ePartogram (an
      electronic version of the WHO paper partograph) vs. providers who offered care using the
      standard paper partograph, and whether fetal/newborn outcomes were improved among cases where
      partograph was used.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ePartogram is an electronic version of the WHO Partograph and is developed by Jhpiego.
      Seventy-eight clinical rules, programmed into the ePartogram, are based on global guidelines
      in the WHO manual &quot;Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth: a guide for midwives
      and doctors&quot; and the expert opinion of Jhpiego physicians and nurse-midwives. The rules
      underwent a validation process by 65 expert skilled birth attendants (SBAs) (working in
      maternity wards of health facilities) from a variety of geographic and clinical settings
      affiliated with Jhpiego. In the ePartogram application (&quot;app&quot;) that is put on an Android
      tablet computer, the clinical rules trigger &quot;reminders&quot; to SBAs to take a routine clinical
      measurement, such as fetal heart rate (every 30 minutes) or maternal temperature (every 2
      hours). The rules also trigger &quot;low-level&quot; alarms indicating a measurement that falls in the
      abnormal range that could be cause for concern (i.e. meconium-stained liquor), and
      &quot;high-level&quot; alarms that could indicate need for immediate action (i.e. maternal systolic
      blood pressure â‰¥160 mm Hg).

      Litwin et al. reported on the feasibility and acceptability of use of an electronic partogram
      in Zanzibar and concluded that health workers felt the ePartogram improved timeliness of care
      and supported decision making. Health workers quickly became competent and confident in using
      the tablet device and ePartogram application. This study in Kenya has an objective to
      evaluate whether providers' use of the ePartogram improves labor outcomes and labor
      management in health facilities. The study design is a quasi-experimental design evaluation
      comparing data collected at 6 intervention sites and 6 comparison sites with similar facility
      characteristics and in two regions of Kenya.

    <intervention_model_description>There are two study groups, each with 6 health facilities. All providers offering maternity care were trained in labor management practices and use of the partograph approved for national use in Kenya. In the intervention group only, providers were offered training and Android tablets to use the electronic partogram with clients. The 6-month intervention phase was simultaneous in both groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To support the objective of supporting decision-making and actions to maintain normal labor, there were additional items added to both the paper partograph and the electronic partogram that providers answered by ticking off actions to maintain normal labor. These 5 actions were: encouraging ambulation, giving food, giving fluids, offering the position of choice, encouraging a companion to be present. This indicator refers to any of these actions, and among all partographs or partograms</description>

Seven actions included: providing oxygen, changing the position of the laboring woman in response to FHR abnormalities, checking for bleeding, consulting with a supervisor, and referring a client to another facility, inducing labor during the first stage, and conducting an episiotomy. The indicator is any action taken.</description>
