      Periprosthetic bone remodeling in femoral neck fracture patients: a 5-year follow up study
      addressing the influence of surgical approach on periprosthetic bone mineral density.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between January 2014 and July 2017 a RCT was conducted at Sorlandet Hospital Kristiansand,
      Norway. The trial was approved by the regional ethics committee (2013/1853/REK) and
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02028468).Patients between
      70 and 90 years of age with displaced femoral neck fractures, intact cognitive function and
      the ability to walk with or without a walking aid prior to falling were asked for their
      agreement to be enrolled and partition occurred after informed consent.A subgroup analysis
      looking at periprosthetic bone mineral density around the femoral component was part of this
      level 1 single-center randomized trial. 51 patients were enrolled in this DEXA study, and
      future examination of bone remodeling in these patients is now planned.

    <intervention_name>Dual-energy X-ray absorbtiometry to evaluate periprosthetic bone mineral density around an uncemented stem implanted using either lateral or anterolateral approach to the hip joint</intervention_name>
    <description>The measurement will start in the area about 2 cm proximal to the greater trochanter and will stop slightly below the tip of the prosthesis. This is the baseline scan and will be carried out twice with the patient lying on the table, but with movement between each scan. This is done to calculate the CV, Coefficient of Variation. We will use the formula from Wilkinson and associates, where delta is standard deviations (SD) of the difference between the two BMD measurements for each patient. BMD has been measured at baseline, 3 and 12 months. A DXA scan is now planned at 60 months. Changes in BMD related to the 7 Gruen zones will be registered.</description>
