  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single center Phase 1 dose escalation trial of the combination of standard-of-care
      blinatumomab plus Haplo-Mismatched Cellular Therapy (HMCT). HMCT refers to the infusion of
      donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected via pheresis from a haploidentical family
      member - the procedure is analogous to giving a donor lymphocyte infusion outside of the
      setting of an allogeneic stem cell transplant; also known as 'microtransplantation'. The HMCT
      is an unselected mix of lymphocytes and leukocytes, but the product dose escalation will be
      done based on the T cell content.

      Ten recipients are planned. Each subject will be administered one infusion of HMCT during the
      first cycle of blinatumomab and two infusions during cycle two of blinatumomab; the CD3+ cell
      dose of the HMCT infusion is governed by dose escalation / de-escalation following a Bayesian
      method.

      This single center, phase 1 study will examine the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of
      combining the investigational use of Haplo-Mismatched Cellular Therapy (HMCT) in combination
      with blinatumomab. Investigators plan to give HMCT starting on day 15, after the initial CRS
      caused by blinatumomab has resolved. The investigational treatment will start with 1% of the
      typical HMCT dose (10e6 CD3+ cells/kg) and will employ a modified dose escalation design as
      an additional safety measure. The primary end points will be DLT of the combination of
      blinatumomab and HMCT.

             discretion of the treating physician if they are no longer candidates for further TKI
             based therapy. Prior therapy with a minimum of 2 prior 2nd/3rd generation TKI is
             required. (TKI therapy is not allowed while on trial).

          -  Patients with prior blinatumomab treatment are eligible if last treatment was at least

             will be obtained from parent/guardian (assent from the minor is required).

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined below (note there are no marrow
             function criteria, cytopenias will not result in exclusion):

               -  Total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5x the upper limits of institutional normal, unless elevated
                  bilirubin is attributed to liver involvement of leukemia or Gilbert's disease.

               -  AST/ALT â‰¤ 2.5 x the upper limits of institutional normal (â‰¤ 5 x ULN for patients
                  with suspected liver involvement of leukemia).

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and estimated survival of at least 3 months.

             form.

          -  The effects of treatment on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or complete abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study, and for two months after study participation. Should
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject and ability for subject to comply with
             the requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant

          -  Prior treatment with fludarabine or cladribine within the last six months prior to

             chemotherapy - POMP, hydroxyurea, low dose prednisone - is allowed until 24 hours
             prior to starting blinatumomab).

             procedures, including follow-up visits, and/or to comply with all required study
             procedures to the best of the subject and Investigator's knowledge.

        History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease
        (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the Investigator or
        Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the
