      Aim: to determine the effect of gender on the sensory and metabolomic responses to a standard
      probe meal. Participants (12 men and 12 women) will be instructed to eat a standard dinner
      the day before, to consume a standard breakfast at home after overnight fast, and to report
      to the laboratory, where the test meal will be administered 4 h after breakfast. Studies will
      be conducted in a quiet, isolated room with participants sitting on a chair. Participants
      will ingest a standard probe meal (750 Kcal). Perception of homeostatic sensations
      (hunger/satiation, fullness) and hedonic sensations (digestive well-being, mood) will be
      measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after ingestion and at 10 min intervals
      up to 60 min after the probe meal. Heart rate variability, blood pressure and body
      temperature were measured before and after the meal. Blood samples for metabolomic analysis
      were taken before and 30 min after the meal.
