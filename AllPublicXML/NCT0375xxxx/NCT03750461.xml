  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hernia formation at sites of ostomy closure is a common complication. The investigator
      believes that using evidence based hernia repair techniques as a preventive measure during
      closure of ostomies will reduce the incidence of hernia formation. In this trial, the
      investigator will pilot a novel technique of large pore monofilament polypropylene mesh
      reinforcement of the abdominal wall defects that remain after closure of an ileostomy to
      evaluate for safety and begin to evaluate the effectiveness compared to standard techniques.
