  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double blind randomized study is the evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy of the Moderato System. The Moderato implantable pulse generator is indicated for
      patients who have hypertension and also require a dual chamber pacemaker in order to reduce
      their blood pressure.

      In this amended CS-03 protocol Version 3.0, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      in a randomized, double-blind study following active treatment vs. a control patient
      population for a period of 3 month for efficacy and 12 months for safety (In comparison to 6
      months for patients under protocol CS-03 Ver 1.1, NCT02837445).

      The device will be considered to have a clinical effectiveness with regard to its
      anti-hypertension function if there is a statistically significant and clinically meaningful
      reduction in mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure in the treatment group compared
      to the control group. The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated 3 months after
      randomization. The Primary safety analysis will compare the treatment and the control after
      12 months of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol CS-03 Ver 1.1 (NCT02837445) was amended at the advice of the Scientific Advisory to
      protocol CS-03 Version 3.0 with more stringent hypertension inclusion criteria and different
      observation intervals for efficacy and safety.

      In CS-03 Version 3.0 the time of the primary efficacy endpoint was reduced from 6 months to 3
      months post randomization which was deemed a suitable interval for the chronic effect,
      whereas for the safety endpoint, the period was lengthened to 12 months post randomization to
      better monitor potential risks of the treatment on cardiac function (Blinding period was
      increased from 6 months to 12 months). Protocols were thus split in order to allow better
      clarification to the difference in the time to the primary endpoints for efficacy and safety
      between the two CIP versions and simplify data analysis.

      Protocol Ver 3.0 prescribes data analysis of all patients randomized under version 1.1 to be
      performed once they complete the 6 months follow-up as set in protocol version 1.1
      (NCT0283744). It is expected that ~40 patients will be randomized according to protocol
      version 1.1 prior to the enrollment of patients according to protocol version 3.0. The
      results will be considered as interim analysis.

      The recruitment for the protocol version 1.1 is now completed. Total of 47 patients were
      randomized according to protocol version 1.1 and all patients completed the follow-up period
      for the primary endpoint.

      Patients are currently being followed up for the study &quot;extension period&quot;.
