  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance
      were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and
      9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,envisage
      using anlotinib plus docetaxel treat the advanced Non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer to
      further improve the patient's PFS or OS.

      This is a multicentre single arm clinical trial conducted in China,the purpose of this study
      is To Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Anlotinib (12mg QD PO d1-14, 21 days per
      cycle)Combined with Docetaxel (75mg/m2 IV d1) for advanced Non-squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer.According to the result of TAX317,the PFS of second line standard chemotherapy was 3
      month. Expected the PFS was 5.7. Using PASS11, That calculated the sample size of this study
      was 41 , according to 10% censoring,the expected sample size is 46.
