  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a 6-week, open-label, randomized clinical trial study to compare
      efficacy and tolerability of the natural treatments omega-3 fatty acids, inositol, and
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in the treatment of mood dysregulation in children and adolescents
      with non-verbal learning disability (NVLD) or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Subjects will
      include youth ages 5-17 years with a non-verbal learning disability (NVLD) or autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) and current symptoms of emotional dysregulation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in the Parent-Young Mania Rating Scale (P-YMRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS consists of 11 items rated on a scale from 0 (symptoms not present) to 4 (symptoms extremely severe). It is used to assess manic symptoms. The YMRS score ranges from 0-60. Questions are asked about the last week. This scale is generally accepted as the main outcome measure in studies of pediatric bipolar disorder and is linked directly to the core symptoms of mania.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in the Parent-completed Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDI consists of 27 items quantifying symptoms such as depressed mood, hedonic capacity, vegetative functions, self-evaluation, and interpersonal behaviors. Each item consists of three statements graded in order of increasing severity from 0 to 2; parents select the one that characterized their child's symptoms best during the past 1 week. The item scores are combined into a total depression score, which ranges from 0 to 54. A higher CDI score means a higher depressive state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in the NIMH Clinical Global Improvement scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a measure of illness severity adapted for specific disorders. It allows rating of mania, depression and overall bipolar disorder illness, as well as other conditions frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder. The severity score ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). The improvement score ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
