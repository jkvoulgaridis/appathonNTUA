  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our study is to investigate whether the use of obstetric gel shortens the
      first and second stage of labor and exerts a protective effect on the lower genital tract in
      women undergoing a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent literature shows that birth injury is associated with postpartum pelvic floor
      dysfunction (pelvic organ prolapse and fecal and urinary incontinence). Prolonged labor,
      namely during the 2nd stage, is one of the main obstetric risk factors responsible for anal
      sphincter rupture and fecal incontinence. In addition, it is associated with increased
      maternal and neonatal morbidities including increased risk of lower genital tract
      lacerations. In an effort to shorten labor and decrease lower genital tract trauma many
      techniques have been investigated.

    <description>A sterile obstetric gel( K-Y Jelly 82GM; manufactured by Johnson&amp;amp; Johnson) will be used for this trial. The obstetric gel is a birth gel with no pharmacologic effects that has a purely physical activity. Starting with the first vaginal examination the obstetric gel will be used. After each vaginal examination, 3-5 mL of obstetric gel will be introduced into the vaginal birth canal in the area in front of the child using the sterile obstetric gel applicator without any manipulation or massaging. Additional obstetric gel will be added 15-30 minutes after rupture of the membrane since the head of the child is visible, the mouth and nose region will be wiped clean. A dry towel will be used to liberate the child in order to prevent the child from slipping</description>
