  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to data in the literature, patients with head and neck cancer, who undergo combined
      treatment of radio-chemotherapy, have, to a greater or lesser extent, swallowing changes.
      Most of the time, these patients undergo traditional speech-language interventions, performed
      weekly. This project proposes a brief and intensive therapy program for dysphagia, with daily
      interventions, showing that this therapeutic modality generates benefits in a shorter time
      interval when compared to traditional therapy. This short service period contributes to the
      reduction of hospital costs and reduces the total number of interventions, which is
      beneficial for both the patient and the service that performs the care. The present study was
      to verify the efficacy of a brief and intensive therapy program for dysphagia in patients
      with head and neck cancer submitted to radio-chemotherapy treatments, since they present, to
      a greater or lesser extent, changes of swallowing. This is a randomized clinical trial pilot
      project that will be developed in an oncology hospital. The population of this study is
      composed of patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer, over 18 years of age, with
      indication of combined radiotherapy , referred for speech therapy through the
      Multidisciplinary Oncology Outpatient Clinic of Santa Rita Hospital (AMOHR).

      he sample will consist of 20 patients who will be randomized into two groups: 10 in the
      intervention group with intensive brief therapy and 10 in the control group with traditional
      weekly therapy. In both groups, instruments related to swallowing assessment and quality of
      life will be applied before and after speech therapy. The control group will receive speech
      therapy with weekly frequency, and the intervention group will participate in a brief and
      intensive therapy program that will take place during five days a week for three weeks,
      totaling fifteen sessions. The sessions will be of 40 minutes and, in both groups, the
      patients will receive care of individualized form, according to their needs.

    <description>oral intake, skale. It is composed by a seven-level scale, which graduates oral intake of patients.
Scale of seven levels, graduates the oral intake of patients. At level 1, the patient is exclusively using an alternative feeding route, with no oral conditions. At levels 2 and 3, it still depends on a consistency. At levels 4,5 and 6 it can be oral total in one of the most consistencies, with or without compensation, but with some restrictions. At level 7, the patient had total oral conditions, without restrictions.</description>

    <description>strength of language, assessment, equipment. Instrument developed in 1992, which allows to evaluate the strength and resistance of the tongue, by inserting a bulb into the oral cavity. The patient should lift the dorsum, and / or the anterior portion of the tongue against this bulb, pushing as hard as he can. Afterwards, the pressure transducer circuits of the apparatus will detect bulb compression, indicating the peak pressure result (Solomon et al, 2008; Robins et al, 2007).</description>
