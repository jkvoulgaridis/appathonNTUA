  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data on the clinical and functional outcomes of
      surgical management for recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using flexor tenosynovectomy.
      It is hypothesized that the outcomes of patients undergoing flexor tenosynovectomy for
      recurrent CTS will compare favorably to published data regarding alternative types of
      surgeries for the same condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary carpal tunnel release (CTR) is the most common surgical procedure of the hand, but
      reported rates of symptom recurrence are not uncommon. Many surgical techniques have been
      proposed and reported for management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptom recurrence,
      however there is a paucity of data on flexor tenosynovectomy for management of recurrent CTS.

      This study will evaluate clinical and functional outcomes using information from pre- and
      post-operative physical exams, surgery data, patient-reported satisfaction and symptoms, and
      scores on functional measures, such as the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH)
      questionnaire.
