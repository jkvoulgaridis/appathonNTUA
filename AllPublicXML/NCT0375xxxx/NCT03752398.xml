    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multiple dose, ascending dose escalation study to define a MTD/RD and
      regimen of XmAb23104, to describe safety and tolerability, to assess PK and immunogenicity,
      and to preliminarily assess anti-tumor activity of XmAb23104 in subjects with selected
      advanced solid tumors.
