  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous paravertebral analgesia and erector spinae plane blockade (ESP) are accepted
      techniques at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for the management of thoracic
      pain following surgery and trauma. Recently, an increasing number of erector spinae plane
      nerve blocks are being performed as it has been demonstrated in our institution, and via case
      reports that the blocks provide clinical effectiveness, but may have a better side-effect
      profile than the paravertebral nerve block. However, the relative efficacy of ESP compared to
      paravertebral nerve block remains to be established for video assisted thoracoscopic surgery
      (VATS). This is a prospective randomized study intended to assess the efficacy, safety and
      side-effect profile of continuous erector spinae plane analgesia versus continuous
      paravertebral analgesia for VATS procedures. It will include 60 patients presenting to UPMC
      Passavant for a VATS procedure. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a nerve
      block via continuous paravertebral infusion or via erector spinae plane infusion. In
      addition, to treat breakthrough pain, the patients in both arms will receive multimodal
      adjunctive therapy per routine. Bupivacaine and ropivacaine are FDA approved for use in nerve
      block catheters. The primary outcome will be to compare analgesic efficacy between the two
      nerve blocks as defined by total opioid consumption and pain scores on the numeric pain
      rating scale. Secondary outcomes include incentive spirometer amounts (baseline vs daily
      score postoperatively), length of stay, duration of catheter and report of adverse events or
      complications. Other data points include number of chest tubes and location and level of
      catheter and nerve block placement as well as number of blocks per case.

      Background and significance:

      Multimodal analgesia for thoracic surgery is key to allow faster recovery and diminish
      postoperative complications. Paravertebral nerve blocks as well as epidurals are among the
      regional anesthetic techniques utilized for these procedures. Recently, a newer technique,
      the erector spinae plane block, has been used and described to be effective in treating pain
      for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. At UPMC, the investigators have had clinically
      significant pain control for thoracic surgery with both types of blocks. The previous case
      reports/series and our clinical observation has led us to propose this study of comparing the
      clinical efficacy of erector spinae plane block vs. paravertebral nerve block.

      Though ESP and paravertebral blocks have been documented to be efficacious for this
      procedure, there has been no direct comparison between the two approaches. The ESP block is
      considered to be a safer technique with less theoretical adverse events possible and thus,
      would become a viable alternative to the more technically challenging paravertebral nerve
      block. If ESP is found to be superior or non-inferior to paravertebral in terms of pain
      management and safety, this would be a major finding, as ESP is considered safer and
      technically easier to perform than paravertebral nerve block.

      Study design and methods

      The investigators present a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy of continuous
      paravertebral nerve blocks vs. ESP blocks for video assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) at
      UPMC Passavant.
