  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if tummy time and parent education helps motor
      development among infants born preterm. Participants will be recruited from Ann and Robert H.
      Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago neonatal intensive care unit.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control trial will be to investigate the effects of a tummy
      time intervention, as compared to standard care, on motor outcomes among premature infants
      over a four-week period. Additionally, the study will measure tummy time adherence rates
      between groups post intervention for an additional four weeks.

      To meet this purpose, the following objectives will be addressed:

        1. To determine if there will be a difference in motor outcome scores on the Test of Infant
           Motor Performance (TIMP) among infants born preterm and utilizing a tummy time
           intervention and parent education compared to those in the standard care group receiving
           parent education only.

        2. To determine if there will be a difference in adherence rates (average minutes/day)
           between groups among infants born preterm utilizing a tummy time intervention and parent
           education compared to those in the standard care group receiving parent education only.

    <description>The TIMP is a functional motor scale for newborns, including those born premature, up to infants four months corrected age, and was specifically designed for use in neonatal intensive care units (Rose &amp; Westcott, 2005).</description>

    <time_frame>Change in adherence will be measured at initiation and at 8 weeks. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 8 weeks. The study is expected to be completed within 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The PT Pal application will be utilized to generate information back to the PI on adherence with tummy time outcomes of the prescription recommendations and thus serves as an adherence component for both the intervention and the standard care group.</description>

    <description>This group will receive tummy time and parent education and be encouraged to perform tummy time on their own. They will utilize the PT Pal application to record their tummy time adherence. The primary investigator performs the intervention to the participants two times a day for 10 minutes for 4 weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group will receive parent education only and utilize the PT Pal application to record their adherence. The primary caregiver will be encouraged to perform the same dosage of tummy time (2x/day, 10 minutes each, 4 weeks) and record their adherence on the PT Pal application.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive tummy time positioning while awake for 10 minutes two times a day. Physiological monitoring will be maintained throughout the entire intervention and the intervention will be adjusted if needed to maintain stability. Participants will also receive parent education on tummy time prior to the tummy time intervention. The primary investigator will perform the tummy time intervention. Participants will be encouraged to continue performing tummy time on their own and record their adherence via the PT Pal application.</description>
