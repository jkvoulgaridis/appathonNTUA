  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonsurgical root canal retreatment may become essential when the initial endodontic treatment
      fails because of the persistent intracanal or extracanal infections.It has been stated that
      the one of the main cause of posttreatment disease is the persistent or reintroduced
      microorganism such as enterococcus faecalis. Supplementary disinfection techniques such as
      irrigation agitation methods can help elimination of bacteria from root canal systems.

      The aim of this in vivo study was to compare the effect of passive ultrasonic irrigation,
      manual dynamic activation and photodynamic therapy in reducing bacterial load in endodontic
      retreatment cases with periradicular lesion by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)in a
      single visit root canal treatment.

      Thirty-six teeth with a single root and a single canal with posttreatment apical
      periodontitis which needed retreatment were selected for this study. Teeth were randomly
      divided into 3 groups according to the supplementary disinfection techniques used: Passive
      ultrasonic irrigation, Manual dynamic activation and Photodynamic therapy. Microbiological
      samples were taken before any intervention, after conventional chemo-mechanical preparation,
      and after disinfection techniques with sterile paper points and held in thioglycollate broth,
      and then were transferred to the microbiological laboratory. The amounts of e.faecalis in
      these samples was measured by using PCR.
