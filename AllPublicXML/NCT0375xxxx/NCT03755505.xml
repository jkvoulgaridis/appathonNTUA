  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensive studies suggest composition of microbiome of respiratory samples or lung tissues in
      COPD patients is different from the composition of healthy smokers. Aim of this study is to
      analyze composition of microbiome of various samples (e.g. feces, sputum, and urine) and to
      describe difference of composition between COPD patients and healthy smokers.

      After the introduction of the Gut-Lung axis theory, extensive studies revealed diversity of
      microbiomes among healthy smokers and COPD patients form the respiratory samples or lung
      tissues. In the previous study, distinct difference in composition of microbiome in lung
      tissue between healthy smokers and COPD patients was reported. This is a cross sectional
      study to analyze composition of microbiome of various samples (e.g. feces, sputum, and urine)
      and to compare difference of composition between COPD patients and healthy smokers. This
      study would help establishing gut-lung axis model in humans.

    <description>DNA is extracted from each sample from each patient by using a DNA Isolation Kit. The 16S universal primers are used for amplification of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. After amplication, sequencing is performed using the GREENGENES database, after which a metagenomic analysis was performed by the MD Healthcare corporation using MDx-Pro software (Ver.1, Seoul, South Korea). Taxonomic assignment of these sequences is carried out with an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoff of 3%.</description>
