      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, confirmatory study to evaluate the
      safety and performance of the Biop Digital Colposcope and the accuracy of the image
      registration procedure between the Biop Digital Colposcope unit and the Biop Micro Colposcope
      probe unit.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, confirmatory study to evaluate the
      safety and performance of the Biop Digital Colposcope and the accuracy of the image
      registration procedure between the Biop Digital Colposcope unit and the Biop Micro Colposcope
      probe unit.

      The Biop Digital Colposcope is intended for magnified viewing of the tissues of the vagina,
      cervix and external genitalia in order to assist doctors in diagnosing abnormalities such as
      lesions or cancer, and selecting areas for biopsy. The images from the digital colposcope are
      to be viewed on a color display. The digital colposcope is intended for use in hospitals,
      clinics, and doctor's offices.

      The Biop Micro Colposcope probe unit is an imaging tool intended to be placed in the vagina
      for acquisition of images of the cervix. It is intended as an adjunct to the Biop Digital
      Colposcope. It should NOT be used as a substitute for a thorough colposcopic evaluation. The
      Biop Micro Colposcope Probe unit is not intended for use on the vulva and vagina.

      It is anticipated that it will take approximately 3 months to complete active enrollment.
      Study duration for each subject is 1-2 days, including screening, enrolment and procedure.
      The study will be completed when the final study subject has completed the procedure.

        1. Performance - to confirm that average image registration error is less than or equal to
           (≤) 2mm.

        2. Safety - to evaluate the safety of the Biop Digital Colposcope in women undergoing
           cervical colposcopy procedures.

    <description>The primary performance endpoint is the image registration success. Image registration success is defined by the registration error (distance between corresponding control points following registration). Average image registration error should be less than or equal to (≤) to 2mm.</description>

    <description>The procedure stages:
Scanning of the cervix - the cervix is scanned using the micro colposcope probe unit, to produce a total of 51 micro-images and one macro image from the panoramic camera.
Colposcopy exam - during the standard colposcopy exam, the doctor acquires a panoramic image of the cervix with the digital colposcope.
A questionnaire completed by the subject after the Biop procedure, with regards to any unusual sensations or events experienced during the procedure.
A questionnaire completed by the user after the Biop procedure, with regards to system usage
