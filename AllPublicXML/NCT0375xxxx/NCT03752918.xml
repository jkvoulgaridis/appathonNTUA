  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of MDMA on prefrontal and amygdala activation, and
      to explore the relationship between these MDMA-induced neural changes and the acute
      behavioral effects of the drug in patients with PTSD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to utilize state-of-the-art validated Human Connectome Project (HCP)
      style approaches to determine the effects of MDMA on prefrontal and amygdala activation, and
      to explore the relationship between these MDMA-induced neural changes and the acute
      behavioral effects of the drug in patients with PTSD. In addition, the investigators will
      collect preliminary data on the MDMA effects on large-scale intrinsic functional connectivity
      using novel graph-based network analyses.

      Specifically, the investigators will measure medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala
      activation in response to negative stimuli in patients with PTSD. The investigators
      hypothesize that MDMA will increase mPFC, but decrease amygdala, activation in response to
      negative stimuli.

      The investigators will also explore the relationship between the MDMA-induced mPFC and
      amygdala activation, and performance on Ekman's Emotional Facial Expression task. This task
      is modulated by the mPFC and amygdala and as well as trauma severity in participants with
      PTSD. And finally, to explore the effects of MDMA on resting-state functional connectivity
      (rs-fcMRI) the investigators will use Coupled Intrinsic Connectivity Distribution
      (Coupled-ICD); an innovative, graph-based, fully data-driven approach that is particularly
      sensitive to paired rs-fcMRI data (e.g. pre/post-treatment).

      Adult participants with PTSD will be recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      within-subjects, crossover-dose neuroimaging study in which they will initially receive
      either a single dose of MDMA 1.5mg/kg or a placebo (niacin 250mg), with a crossover dose to
      follow. Doses will be separated by 2 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Initial and Second Drug Dose, 24 hours after initial and second drug dose, 1 week after initial and second drug dose.</time_frame>
    <description>This 9 item self-report scale measures the moral injury, or distress due to the contradiction to a deeply-held belief about the world that often accompanies a traumatic incident. The injury is assessed in terms of &quot;perceived transgression&quot; and &quot;perceived betrayal.&quot; Items are assessed with a Likert-type Scale (1 to 6, 1 = &quot;strongly disagree,&quot; 6 = &quot;strongly agree,&quot; with no neutral option). Higher scores indicate greater severity of associated event.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week after second drug dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures evaluation of the sense of existential purpose and enthusiasm for life in a three part self-report survey. Part A is a 20 point scale test which uses a 1-7 scale in which low number answers correspond attitudes such as boredom and directionless-ness. Parts B and C are not empirically useful, but ask for participants to completes sentences and compose a paragraph respectively. Higher scores indicate a greater existential sense of purpose, with scores above 113 indicate a high degree of purpose, scores below 92 suggesting a lack of purpose, and scores between 92 and 112 indicate moderate levels of purpose.</description>

             *(Hormonal contraceptives are exclusionary because MDMA increases production of
             oxytocin which is heavily modulated by other hormones (e.g. estrogen). Therefore,
             women need to be naturally cycling/ovulating and not taking any hormonal medications
             to participate in this study).
