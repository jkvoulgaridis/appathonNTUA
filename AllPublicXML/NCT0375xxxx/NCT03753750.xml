  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) affects 12-30% of the world's population. The accompanying urinary
      urgency, urinary frequency and incontinence can impair the ability to work, interact in
      social activities and can result in poor social functioning. Multiple treatment modalities
      are available for overactive bladder. However, each therapy has drawbacks that limit its
      application in certain patient populations. For example, oral medications have significant
      side effects and suffer from poor adherence. Botulinum toxin injection into the bladder wall
      is invasive, requires re-treatment on a regular basis and carries a risk of urinary
      retention. Current neuromodulatory techniques are invasive and require highly-specialized
      care. Therefore, a need exists for a non-invasive, well-tolerated and easily administered
      therapy for OAB. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) has been developed and tested
      in able bodied individuals to initiate locomotor function as well as in the SCI population
      for lower extremity and upper extremity function. More recently, we have tested this SCI
      patients to enable lower urinary tract function and decrease detrusor overactivity, resulting
      in improved continence.

    <description>A voiding diary records the amount of fluid intake, the number of urinations and the number of incontinence episodes over 72 hours. The number of daily urinations and incontinence episodes will be compared at the beginning and the conclusion of the study. Changes in the number of daily urinations and incontinence episodes will be compared between participants in the stimulation and sham arms of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on overactive bladder questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>4-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will complete two validated questionnaires pertaining to overactive bladder: OAB-q and ICIQ-OAB. The OAB-q generates a total score ranging between 33 points (best) to 198 points (worst). The ICIQ-OAB generates a total score ranging between 0 points (best) to 58 points (worst). The questionnaires will be completed at the initiation and completion of the study. Change in questionnaire scores between initiation and completion of the study will be assessed. Changes in questionnaire scores will be compared between participants in the stimulation and sham arms of the study.</description>

    <measure>Cystometric bladder capacity, number of detrusor overactivity episodes during urodynamic studies.</measure>
    <time_frame>4-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urodynamic studies will be performed at the initiation and completion of the study. Urodynamic studies will be performed according to ICS (International Continence Society) criteria. Changes in cystometric capacity and number of detrusor overactivity episodes between initiation and completion of the study will be assessed. Changes in these parameters will be compared between participants in the stimulation and sham arms of the study.</description>
