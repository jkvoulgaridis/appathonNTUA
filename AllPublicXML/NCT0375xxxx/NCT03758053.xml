      Aversive childhood experiences (ACE) and their relation to the development of an alcohol use
      disorder will be measured with fMRI.

      The aim of this study is to examine the impact of ACE on stress sensitivity, cue-reactivity
      and emotion processing in individuals with AUD. (Neuro-) biological and physiological
      mechanisms underlying AUD after ACE will be studied.

      Neural correlates of stress-sensitivity, emotion processing and alcohol cue-reactivity will
      be assessed using fMRI. Furthermore, blood and saliva samples will be used to assess
      biological and physiological mechanisms (e.g. salivary cortisol level or genetic markers of
      AUD and possible gene-environment-interactions).

      The question whether individuals with AUD and ACE might tend to use alcohol to cope with
      stress, negative affect or intrusions (according to the self-medication model) will be
      explored. On the other hand, individuals with AUD and low levels of ACE might use alcohol for
      its positive effects (according to a positive reinforcement model).

      90 individuals (30 HC and 60 individuals with AUD and varying levels of ACE) will be examined
      using interviews, questionnaires and fMRI tasks as well as saliva and blood samples. All
      ethical votes and informed consents of participants are and will be obtained according to the
      declaration of Helsinki.
