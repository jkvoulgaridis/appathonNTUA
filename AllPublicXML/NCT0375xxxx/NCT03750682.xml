  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related cognitive decline has a profound impact on the daily functioning of older adults,
      their families and healthcare systems. Despite its significant personal, societal and
      economic impact, no pharmacologic therapies presently exist to mitigate age-related cognitive
      decline. As the population of older adults continues to rapidly increase, the implementation
      of effective and scalable low-cost interventions that may maintain the cognitive independence
      of broad populations of older persons are now of urgent public health priority.

      ENGAGE-B is a single blind, parallel-group, community-based randomized controlled pilot
      study. The overall objective of the study is to build on our recently completed ENGAGE pilot
      study and further examine and characterize the feasibility and effectiveness of translating
      the LIFE study physical activity intervention (PA) into a real-world community-based senior
      center setting. ENGAGE-B will target the recruitment of older adults with subjective memory
      complaints and slow gait (motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR)). Participants with MCR will
      be randomized to a 24-week PA intervention (n = 20) or to a healthy aging education control
      intervention (HE) (n = 20). ENGAGE-B will also test a highly practical and scalable
      innovation for the delivery of exercise programming for at-risk older adults in the community
      setting. An existing community-based senior center employee (&quot;Community Health Promoter&quot;),
      without a formal background in exercise physiology, will be trained by the study
      investigators to deliver the PA intervention among older adults with MCR. The primary
      feasibility outcomes will be assessed by quantifying intervention adherence and the
      occurrence of adverse events across the PA and HE intervention arms. Secondary and
      exploratory outcomes will include the comparative evaluation of specific domains of cognitive
      performance (executive function, global cognition, working memory, computerized cognitive
      testing and complex walking tasks), non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy
      (fNIRS) derived measures of prefrontal brain activation, mobility, accelerometry-derived
      estimates of physical activity, depression, quality of life and costs associated with
      delivering the respective interventions. Results from this proposed pilot study are intended
      as the basis for a larger and more definitive pragmatic trial in older adults. If successful
      this pilot work will serve as an exciting preliminary model to potentially target and
      mitigate the loss of cognitive independence across a variety of community-based locations.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accelerometry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Regular activity level will be measured using accelerometry (GT3X+, Actigraph, Pensacola, FL). The actigraph, attached to an elastic belt, will be worn around the waist of the participant. These accelerometers are small enough to be unobtrusive and produce little interference with normal physical activity. Participants will be instructed to wear the actigraph for a 7-day period during waking hours and remove it for sleep and bathing only. Activity will be recorded using 1-second epochs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT tests functional exercise capacity by measuring the distance a participant can walk within a 6 minute time period. The 6MWT is a beneficial tool in assessing functional exercise capacity in older adults. The 6MWT will be performed in a corridor of the Holland Street Senior Center in Somerville, MA on a 40 meter course. Participants will be instructed to walk as far as they can in six minutes without running or jogging. Cones will be set up at each turnaround point of the course and participants will be instructed to complete as many laps as they can without overexerting themselves. The test will be stopped if any of the following symptoms occur: chest pain, severe dyspnea, muscle cramping, diaphoresis, or any other symptom the investigator deems unsafe. Subjects' walking distance will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Grip Strength Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength will be measured in the dominant hand with a Jamar Handheld Dynamometer (Patterson Medical, Warrenville, IL). The participants will perform the test while sitting comfortably with shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, the elbow supported on a table and flexed to 90 degrees, forearm and wrist in neutral position. The patients will be instructed to perform a maximal isometric contraction. The test will be repeated after 10 sec. and the highest value will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complex Walking Tasks (CWT's)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>During the CWTs, subjects will first be asked to walk on an even surface for 7 meters, as fast as possible while remaining safe. Subjects will be then asked to repeat the walk in their usual pace at the same time as subtracting 3 from 50 and keep subtracting until the 7 meters walk is completed. Subjects' complex walking speed will be timed with a stopwatch and each subtraction will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Well Being</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered version of the Quality of Well-Being Scale will be used to assess general quality of life. This instrument provides a comprehensive measure of health-related quality of life that assesses health symptoms and functioning. This scale has 6 parts. Part 1: acute and chronic symptoms, part 2: self care, part 3: mobility, part 4: physical activity, part 5: usual activity, part 6: general health. There are 79 questions total. Each question is uses the scale: have you... in the past 0 days, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days. There is no scoring or total scoring mechanism. Outcome depends on the question being asked. For example, if a participant reports no hospital visits in the past 3 days that is considered better than reporting no hospital visits in the past 1 day.</description>

    <description>The PA intervention will consist of a twice per week group- based moderate-intensity multimodal program that includes aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training, as previously described. The Community Health Promoter will be trained and certified by Dr. Reid to deliver the PA intervention. PA will be conducted at the Holland Street Senior Center in Somerville, MA. The center is equipped with a large dining hall and corridors which will be utilized to perform the various components of the PA intervention for ENGAGE-B. This real-world approach was shown to be safe, feasible and effective in the initial ENGAGE study among older adults with severe mobility-limitations. Throughout PA, walking will be the primary mode of exercise, given its widespread applicabilityThe study staff will administer an Adverse Event/Concomitant Medication Questionnaire biweekly to all PA subjects.</description>
