  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study to provide effect size estimates for a brief intervention
      designed to reduce hazardous drinking and sexual risk behavior among men who have sex with
      men. The intervention consists of an &quot;in-person&quot; brief motivational intervention followed by
      a series of text messages related to alcohol and sexual risk reduction. The primary outcome
      is heavy drinking episodes and frequency of unprotected anal intercourse at 3 months.

      This is a pilot study designed to provide initial effect size estimates for an intervention
      addressing hazardous drinking and sexual risk behavior among men who have sex with men. In
      this study, 24 participants initially recruited through advertisements in the community will
      be randomly assigned to either Assessment Only or Intervention Condition. Those in the
      Assessment Only condition will complete baseline, 6-week, 3-month and 6-month assessments.
      Those in the intervention condition will receive a 50-min brief intervention in person
      followed by 6 weeks of tailored app-based messaging to support the intervention content, then
      another 6-weeks of goal setting text-based messages. Data will be analyzed to determine
      effect sizes of the intervention on key alcohol use and sex risk outcomes. The primary
      outcome will be 3-month outcomes, controlling for corresponding baseline outcomes.
