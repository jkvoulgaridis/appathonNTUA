  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary dysfunction is a condition inherent in cardiac surgery because of various
      interventions, such as general anesthesia, a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass and
      establishment of internal thoracic artery dissection.

      In situations when there is a deterioration in oxygenation, increased positive pressure on
      the airways end pressure (PEEP) can be used as therapeutic mode by reversing severe hypoxemia
      resulting pulmonary shunt. But the use of PEEP has been associated to reduced cardiac output,
      due mainly to decrease systemic venous return consequent to increased intrathoracic pressure,
      and thus might reduce tissue oxygenation. Moreover, the increased transpulmonary gradient may
      also impair right ventricular ejection exacerbating the hemodynamic consequences in some
      patients, which in clinical practice this diagnosis may be difficult to perform.

      In hypovolemic patients or those with cardiac changes may become even more pronounced,
      resulting in accentuation of low flow and systemic hypotension entailing changes in markers
      of tissue perfusion commonly measured by venous saturation central difference venoarterial
      carbon dioxide and lactate. The hypothesis of the investigators is that PEEP of 10 cmH2O and
      15 cmH2O can be applied to reverse lung damage in patients in the immediate postoperative
      myocardial revascularization without repercussion tissue importantly in markers of tissue
      perfusion.

      The objective is to evaluate the effects of different optimization levels of PEEP on gas
      exchange and influences the tissue perfusion after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

      This is a prospective, randomized study and will be performed on patients who accept coronary
      artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, the conscious openness to participate in
      the study. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, diagnosis, additional diseases,
      drugs used, surgery, intervention, peroperative supportive treatments, left ventricular
      ejection fraction, post operative blood and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (min), cross
      clamp time (min), duration of operation, postoperative extubation period, intensive care day
      of hospitalization, day of hospitalization will be recorded.The study was planned in 3
      groups. Group G5 (control group: no changes will be made to the value of PEEP). Group G10
      [after 30 minutes of admission (time 0) the PEEP will be raised to 10 cmH2O (time1) for 30
      minutes and then returned to 5 cmH2O (time 2)]. Group G15 [after 30 minutes of admission
      (time 0) the PEEP will be raised to 15 cmH2O (time 1) for 30 minutes and then returned to 5
      cm H2O (time 2)]. At each time of protocol (0, 1 and 2) will be collected: arterial blood gas
      measurements (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] and partial pressure of carbon
      dioxide ([PaCO2]), the ratio between the partial oxygen pressure, inspired oxygen fraction
      (PaO2/FiO2) and pH. Also, will be performed parameters of tissue perfusion: central venous
      oxygen saturation ([SVO2]), arterial blood lactate, venoarterial CO2 difference ([Dif VA
      CO2]) and vital signs. In all other respects, treatment will follow the standard of care.
