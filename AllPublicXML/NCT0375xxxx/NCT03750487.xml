  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to test the impact of an
      electronic screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) on reduction in substance use (measured
      via self-report), associated symptoms (depression and parenting stress), and improvement in
      home visiting retention and substance use treatment engagement.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to pilot test an electronic screening and brief
      intervention (e-SBI) that will be adapted for use with pregnant and postpartum women in home
      visiting (HV) programs. The e-SBI will be tested in a small randomized trial in two home
      visiting sites, with 10 home visitors and 40 clients. Home visitors will be randomized to
      routine home visiting (control) or routine HV + e-SBI. Research assistants will interview
      clients at baseline, and 3- and 6- month follow-up to track e-SBI impacts on reduction in
      substance use (measured via self-report), associated symptoms (depression and parenting
      stress), and improvement in home visiting retention and substance use treatment engagement.

    <measure>Parenting Stress Index-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>36-item measure of stress associated with parenting. Subscales include parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child, leading to a total stress indicator. Scores are calculated as percentiles: 15-80 are typical percentiles, with clinically significant levels starting at 85 for the parent-child dysfunctional interaction subscale and 90 for all other subscales. Defensive responding is defined as a raw score below ten.</description>
