  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize UV exposures among NMSC patients (those with a history of
      skin cancer) and to pilot an innovative behavioral intervention to decrease modifiable UV
      exposures. It will use UV dosimeters to objectively measure UV exposure and provide time and
      activity specific UV data on an individual level. These data will be used to develop a
      targeted and personalized behavioral feedback plan with counseling aimed at effective sun
      exposure behavior change

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on helping to prevent NMSC and its associated morbidity through learning
      when patients are unintentionally exposed to extreme UV radiation. It will then help to
      create manageable and realistic behavioral interventions to reduce exposure, while also
      educating patients of the dangers of abundant sun exposure.

    <description>Participants will self-report their knowledge and attitudes related to UV exposure. They will then wear a dosimeter for 3 weeks. After, the study team will counsel the participants on their UV levels and exposure, creating a personal plan and advice for avoiding sun exposure before letting the participants wear the dosimeter for an additional 3 weeks.</description>
