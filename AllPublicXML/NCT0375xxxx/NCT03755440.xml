  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EBV positive tumor accounts for 8-9% of all gastric cancer (GC) patients. PD-1 antibody has
      been proved as third line therapy for PD-L1 positive gastric cancer. Previous studies showed
      that EBV(+) tumors exhibit high response to PD-1 antibody. In this phase II study, we will
      investigate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody in EBV positive metastatic GC patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EBV positive metastatic GC patients who failed to standard chemotherapy will receive therapy
      of single agent, PD-1 antibody, SHR-1210, 200mg, every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint is
      response rate. Secondary endpoint is progress free survival, overall survival, safety and
      quality of life. Using the Simon two-stage sample size calculation, the sample size is 19. We
      will collect tissue and blood sample for exploratory analysis, including PD-L1 stuatus, tumor
      mutation burden, et al.
