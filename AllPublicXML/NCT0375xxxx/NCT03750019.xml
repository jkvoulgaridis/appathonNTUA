      This study examined whether remembered meal satisfaction (encompassing memory for meal liking
      and satiety) can be manipulated in the laboratory and whether this influences later food
      intake.

      This study examined whether remembered meal satisfaction (encompassing memory for meal liking
      and satiety) can be manipulated in the laboratory and whether this influences later food
      intake. In a between-subjects design participants consumed a fixed lunch and then rehearsed
      the satisfying or dissatisfying aspects of the meal, or a neutral experience (control), in
      order to manipulate memory for meal satisfaction. Three hours later, in a second visit to the
      laboratory, participants completed a bogus taste-test to measure food intake and meal memory
      measures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ad libitum snack intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured during second visit that took place 3 hours after the baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Energy intake (kcal) measured from a bogus taste-test task. Lower intake in those in the satisfying rehearsal condition compared to the control condition and greater intake in the dissatisfying rehearsal condition compared to the control condition were expected.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory for general satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured during second visit that took place 3 hours after the baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Memory for general satisfaction with the lunchtime meal was measured via five questions: 'Overall, how satisfying did you find the lunchtime meal?', 'Overall, how dissatisfying did you find the lunchtime meal?', 'I liked the lunchtime meal', 'How satisfied were you with the taste of the lunchtime meal?' and 'How dissatisfied were you with the taste of the lunchtime meal?'. Responses were measured using 100-point visual analogue scales with anchors 'not at all' and 'extremely' (0-100). A higher score in those in the satisfying rehearsal condition compared to the control condition and a lower score in the dissatisfying rehearsal condition compared to the control condition were expected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory for satisfaction with meal satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured during second visit that took place 3 hours after the baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Memory for general satisfaction with the lunchtime meal was measured via two questions: 'How satisfied were you with how filling the lunchtime meal was?' and 'How dissatisfied were you with how filling the lunchtime meal was?'. Responses were measured using 100-point visual analogue scales with anchors 'not at all' and 'extremely' (0-100). A higher score in those in the satisfying rehearsal condition compared to the control condition and a lower score in the dissatisfying rehearsal condition compared to the control condition were expected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hunger before lunch</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured before lunch (during baseline visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Hunger before lunch was measured via a single question asking 'How hungry do you feel right now?'. Responses were measured via a 100-point visual analogue scale with anchors 'not at all' and 'extremely'. No directional hypothesis was made for this outcome.</description>
