  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methods are needed to help decrease interdialytic weight gains in hemodialysis patients. One
      potential method for accomplishing this goal is to develop an app for smartphones that allow
      patients to track their fluid intake throughout the course of the day. This protocol is
      designed to test the safety and efficacy of this app, followed by use of the app in patients
      with large fluid weight gains between HD sessions. In the Vanguard phase, patients without
      large interdialytic fluid gains (less than 4%) will use the app to to determine the
      association between the interdialytic weight gain and the fluid consumed as recorded by use
      of the app for each interdialytic period. The app will be modified, if needed, prior to
      initiation of the full scale trial.

      For the Vanguard phase of the trial, a survey will be used to assess the usability of the app
      as well as to collect recommendations for changes to the app itself (appendix one). For this
      Vanguard phase study, the survey for participants will be designed to assess the usability of
      the app (ease of use in general, ease of capturing fluid intake data, including the choice of
      preselected volumes for fluid containers, reasons for not using the app more frequently, the
      usefulness of the app notifications, ease of sending data to the study coordinator for
      review). The survey for the study coordinator will be designed to assess the ease of
      reviewing data from participants and the perceived difficulty of patient use of the app.
