    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is currently the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The
      multi-center study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the convolutional neural network
      based algorithm in differentiation of glaucomatous from non-glaucomatous visual field, and to
      assess its utility in the real world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blind, characterized by progressive
      retinal nerve fiber layer thinning and visual field defects. Visual field test is one of the
      gold standards for diagnosis and evaluation of progression of glaucoma. However, there is no
      universally accepted standard for the interpretation of visual field results, which is
      subjective and requires a large amount of experience. At present, artificial intelligence has
      achieved the accuracy comparable to human physicians in the interpretation of medical imaging
      of many different diseases. Previously, we have trained a deep convolutional neural network
      to read the visual field reports, which has even higher diagnostic efficacy than
      ophthalmologists. The current multi-center study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the
      convolutional neural network based algorithm in differentiation of glaucomatous from
      non-glaucomatous visual field, compare its performance with ophthalmologists and to assess
      its utility in the real world.
