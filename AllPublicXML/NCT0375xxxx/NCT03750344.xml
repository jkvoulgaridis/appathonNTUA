      20 volunteer test subjects will be entered into an accuracy study that is designed to
      validate accuracy of the respiratory rate of the Polso Monitoring system.

      A range of stable respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject. The
      rates will be approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 breaths per minute; with
      some natural variation from these exact numbers.

      Each subject will be instrumented with an open system mask that allows for measurement of the
      end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) respiratory rate and tidal volume. The EtCO2 monitor will be
      used as the Accuracy Reference Device (Reference) in this study.

    <description>Respiratory Rate of test subject as compared to CO2 of End Tidal Carbon. Twenty second periods will be averaged to provide one respiratory rate value. Each stable respiratory rate plateau will result in four of these respiratory rate values which will be included in the ARMS calculation. The endpoint of interest is accuracy as measured by the Accuracy root-mean-square (Arms) difference between the device under test (DUT) and the reference respiratory rate system (Ref) for all stable respiratory periods.
