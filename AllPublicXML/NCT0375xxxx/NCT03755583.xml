  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases. It is believed that the
      inflammation results from sustained abnormal immune response towards altered or pathogenic
      microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts. Malnutrition is common in IBD, especially in
      pediatric Crohn's disease(CD). Exclusive enteral nutrion(EEN) has been shown to improve
      nutritional status and inflammatory markers in pediatric CD. But there is limited data about
      the effect of EEN on Chinese children with CD. In this study, investigators focused on
      disease process,nutritional status and gut microbiome of Chinese children with
      newly-diagnosed CD after EEN treatment.
