  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence suggest that sleep apnea-associated oxygen desaturations may induce
      cardiovascular morbidities in the long term, whereas arousals associated with sleep apneas
      seem to induce mainly transient nocturnal hypertension. Reducing the occurrence and the
      magnitude of sleep apnea-associated oxygen desaturations could therefore have a beneficial
      effect on sleep apnea-associated comobidities. Since sleep apneas usually end with an arousal
      allowing pharyngeal muscles reactivation, a treatment option could consist of generating an
      early short awakening to anticipate apnea termination and decrease the risk of oxygen
      desaturation. The aim of this study is thus to determine if an early sleep apnea termination
      through the emission of a sound can achieve lower oxygen desaturations compared with
      &quot;untreated&quot; sleep apneas.

      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of short sound stimulations on sleep apnea
      associated desaturations

      20 OSA subjects will be recruited and studied with polysomnography and a head band allowing
      to emit short sound stimulations during sleep. the study will take nplace at the Center for
      investigation and research in sleep (CIRS)

      The magnitude of oxygen desaturations following apnea with and without sound stimulations
      will be compared. The effects of different types of sound stimulations on the magnitude of
      cortical and autonomic reactions will also be studied as well as the patients' subjective
      perception of the sounds.
