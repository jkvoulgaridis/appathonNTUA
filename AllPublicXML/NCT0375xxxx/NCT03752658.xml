    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, real-world study, males and non-pregnant,
      non-lactating female HBeAg positive or negative patients (above 18 years of age) who were
      mono-infected with HBV, either NA treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced, but TAF naïve
      will be enrolled in this study, and they will be treated with TAF, alone or in combination
      with other HBV antivirals. During 36 months of treatment, efficacy and safety will be
      evaluated.

      This study is a multi-center, prospective, real-world study, aiming to investigate the use of
      TAF in routine clinical management of chronic hepatitis B patients and evaluate its
      effectiveness and safety across a heterogeneous population in China. Approximately 500
      patients will take part in this study, 10 sites will be included which distribute in China's
      major cities, thus each site will enroll 50 patients. Male or female HBeAg positive or
      negative patients (above 18 years of age) who were mono-infected with HBV, either NA
      treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced, but TAF naïve will be enrolled in this study, and
      they will be treated with TAF, alone or in combination with other HBV antivirals. During 36
      months of treatment, efficacy and safety will be evaluated.
