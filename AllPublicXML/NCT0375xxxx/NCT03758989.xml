  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goals of this study are to measure levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in
      patients with early stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), to assess the change in
      ctDNA during treatment in order to prospectively identify markers of treatment failure, and
      to use ctDNA as a future tool for response adapted therapy.

    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine the correlation between FDG-PET and
      MRD, as measured by ctDNA in patients with early stage DLBLC.

      Patients will be treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy and radiation based on the recently
      completed SWOG S1001 study, however no radioimmunotherapy will be used (NCT01359592).
      Response to treatment will be determined by contemporary Deauville criteria. Assessment of
      ctDNA (non-invasive disease monitoring) will be determined at diagnosis and will continue at
      pre-defined specific time points after therapy is complete.
