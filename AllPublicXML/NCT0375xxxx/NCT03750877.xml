  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia (SA) is frequently used as anesthesia in many surgeries such as lower
      abdominal, inguinal, urogenital, rectal and lower extremities.

      Conventional median approach (MA) is preferred more frequently, although MA or paramedian
      approach (PA) is used in SA. Especially in geriatric patients due to degenerative changes
      Although we are told that degenerative changes are less affected in PA during SA in the
      geriatric age group, few studies have been conducted on the subject and we aimed to evaluate
      the superiority of the two methods.

      In our study, 100 cases were planned to be evaluated prospectively. Patients scheduled for
      surgery under spinal anesthesia will undergo routine spinal preparation. After routine
      motorization, patients will be treated with MA or PA.

      MA will be performed in a conventional manner and PA will be performed by adding 1 cm lateral
      and 1 cm caudal from the planned vertebral space to 10-15 degree medial and cephal.

      If one of the patients with MA or PA fails, despite three attempts, the other method will be
      tried by another specialist. If the procedure fails or there are not enough blocks, a
      different anesthesia method will be applied.

      The data of the patients included in the study were evaluated by a different researcher other
      than the SA physician; demographic data of the cases, type of operation, MA or PA in SA and
      the number of repeated attempts / trials for the procedure will be evaluated.

    <intervention_model_description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the success rate of median and paramedian approach in spinal anesthesia in geriatric patients, number of trials, number of attempts at another interval due to failure, duration of procedure, patient comfort, change to other method in case of failure and success rate. In the study, two groups were formed: the median approach and the paramedian approach.</intervention_model_description>
