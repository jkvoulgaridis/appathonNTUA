  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a placebo controlled study, with two parallel arms, in which participants will
      be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either active (200 mg safinamide) or placebo
      in a double blind manner. Study population is patients diagnosed, with possible or probable
      parkinsonian variant of Multiple System Atrophy who are on a stable treatment of levodopa

      The overall design is a parallel group, placebo controlled, double blind study. The target
      population are participants diagnosed with possible or probable parkinsonian variant of
      Multiple System Atrophy who are on stable doses of levodopa.

      Trial participation will be up to a maximum duration of 14 weeks and will comprise a
      screening period (up to 2 weeks), a 2-week run in period during which subjects will receive 1
      tablet (either 100 mg safinamide or matching placebo), followed by a 10-week period, during
      which study participants will take 2 tablets of study medication (200 mg safinamide or
      placebo) once daily, taken in the morning in addition to their morning levodopa dose. A
      telephone follow-up call will be performed 2 weeks after the end of treatment.

    <description>To evaluate the potential efficacy of safinamide 200 mg od, as add-on therapy, on quality of life (change from baseline in Unified MSA Rating Scale). UMSARS is a validated, disease-specific scale representing the diverse signs and symptoms in MSA. Higher scores on the UMSARS scales mean poorer health.
UMSARS has an Activities of Daily Living score (UMSARS-1, 12 questions) that evaluates motor including autonomic activities and the Motor Examination score (UMSARS-2, 14 questions). UMSARS-3 measures supine/standing BP and UMSARS-4 is a disability scale.</description>
