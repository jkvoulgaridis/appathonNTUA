  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To elucidate the longitudinal development of intestinal microbiota in patients with IL10RA
      deficiency after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The investigators planned to
      collect fecal samples from IL10RA-deficient patients who received HSCT. Samples were
      collected more than once every three days after engraftment in lamina flow ward and at least
      once a week before discharge. Microbial DNA was extracted from the fecal samples. And all
      analysis was based on the next generation sequencing data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered the only curative therapy for patients
      with interleukin-10 receptor-A(IL10RA) deficiency. The investigators aimed to collect the
      fecal samples of these patients throughout the conditioning, transplantation until discharge,
      providing a dense insight into the longitudinal development of intestinal microbiota.
