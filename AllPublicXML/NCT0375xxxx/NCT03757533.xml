  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC)
      is a chronic idiopathic intestinal disorder involving the interplay of environmental,
      immunomodulatory and genetic causative factors. Treatment for IBD is multimodal and includes
      lifestyle modification, chronic pharmacotherapy and surgery. Given the need for chronic
      pharmacotherapy, medication adherence is a crucial therapeutic goal in the management of IBD.
      In fact, medication non-adherence has been associated with greater risk of relapse and
      increased healthcare costs.

      In a previous study, the investigators found clinically identifiable risk factors for
      non-adherence for self-injectable biologic medications in a population with moderate to
      severe CD. These risk factors included smoking, prior biologic use, psychiatric history, and
      current narcotic use. The primary objective of this study is to use a multidisciplinary team
      approach that implements a targeted coaching intervention to promote behavioral change and
      improve medication adherence in adult patients with IBD who are at high risk of
      non-adherence.

    <description>Participants in the Health Coaching (HC) arm will be assigned to a health coach for a period of 5 months along with receiving usual care (UC). An initial telephone call with the coach will include a discussion about the participant's self-assessment of health perceptions and goals. This self-assessment creates the foundation for the personalization of the behavioral intervention. From this point, the participant schedules the remaining 9 biweekly sessions (30-45 minute in length), for a total of 10 coaching calls over 5 months. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychosocial data will be collected over a period of 24 months by surveys and from the medical record.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control arm will receive usual care (UC). Sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychosocial data will be collected over a period of 24 months by surveys and from the medical record. To enhance recruitment, those subjects randomized to the usual care control group will be offered to participate in the health coaching arm of the study as well after a period of 6 months. If they refuse, they will continue in the usual care control group.</description>
