  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of renal functional reserve (RFR) has been proposed for the risk
      stratification of patients undergoing potentially nephrotoxic procedures. The investigators
      hypothesized that there is a correlation between IRRIV and RFR under normal conditions. For
      this purpose, externally validation of IRRIV test is performed in a validation cohort of
      healthy subjects.

      Normal subjects display a significant capacity to increase in baseline GFR under
      physiological needs (e.g. pregnancy) or pathological states (e.g. solitary kidney). This
      capacity is known as renal functional reserve (RFR), and it is calculated as the difference
      between the measured maximum GFR achieved through a renal stress test and the baseline GFR
      measured in rest conditions.In clinical practice, the most common renal stress test is
      performed as a standardized protein loading test. In a pilot study, the investigators
      demonstrated a significant correlation between RFR and the intra-parenchymal renal resistive
      index variation (IRRIV) during an echo renal stress test in a cohort of healthy volunteers.
      IRRIV test has proven to be rapid, safe, bedside and easy to perform and it might represent a
      preliminary test in screening patients' RFR. For this purpose, externally validation of IRRIV
      test is performed in a validation cohort of healthy subjects.

    <description>A weight of 10% of the patient's body weight was applied on the abdomen. RRIs were recorded in a middle interlobular artery, every minute for 10 minutes during the echo-renal stress test. The lowest RRI reached was taken as reference (stress RRI). The IRRIV was defined as the percentage difference between baseline RRI and stress RRI.</description>

    <description>Correlation between IRRIV and RFR is tested through a Pearson analysis. Concordance between presence of RFR (i.e. a RFRâ‰¥15ml/min/1.73m2) and a positive/uncertain/negative IRRIV is evaluated.</description>

    <description>All subjects underwent protein loading test and IRRIV test on the same day. The renal resistive index (RRI) measurements were performed by one trained sonographer using a multi-frequency convex probe through a manual RRI calculations. The RRIs were measured on three interlobular arteries (superior, middle and inferior) in each kidney, and expressed as a mean value. RFR was measured using an oral protein loading test and was then defined as the difference between the highest CrCl obtained after the protein load and the baseline CrCl measured on rest conditions. Urinary creatinine and sCr were measured by the enzymatic method (IL testTM Instrumentation(R), Laboratory SpA, Milano, Italy) and by ILab650 (Instrumentation Laboratory, Werfen Group, Barcelona, Spain).</description>
