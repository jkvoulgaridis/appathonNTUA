  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a human, prospective, single centre, single blind randomised controlled
      clinical tria conducted to explore the feasibility and efficacy of self-inflating hydrogel
      expander (Osmed®) to gain keratinised tissue around the dentulous area. The trial is in
      accordance to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria, 2010.

      Ten healthy individuals satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for
      the study. A detailed, thorough medical and dental history was obtained and each patient was
      subjected to comprehensive clinical and radiological examination. All patients were informed
      about the nature of the study, surgical procedure involved, potential benefits and risks
      associated with the surgical procedure and a written informed consent was obtained from all
      patients.

      All the patients were implanted with self-inflating hydrogel expander (Osmed®) in
      subperiosteal positions using the pouch technique in the mandibular anterior region. The
      clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, two weeks post expander retrieval, three
      months and six months post-operatively.

    <measure>Optical scanning for analysis of tissue thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>alginate impressions were made at the baseline prior to expander placement, immediately after the removal of expander and 6 months post-augmentation. The prepared casts were assessed for soft tissue changes by optical scan using 3D camera (Intellidenta AG, Basel, Switzerland). The obtained digital images of the casts reflecting the different treatment time were then superimposed and matched in one common coordinate system. The buccal surfaces of the study teeth were used as a reference point for the superimposition of different images. Subsequently, a defined area of interest at each site were measured and the difference in the linear distance between the time points were calculated.</description>

    <description>Under local anaesthesia, a small vertical incision, adapted to the diameter of the Osmed® sself-inflating hydrogel expander, was made with #15 scalpel blade at the mesial line angle of the adjacent tooth which started below the gingival margin extending from the keratinized tissue above the MGJ to the non-keratinized tissue beyond the MGJ. A minimally invasive preparation of a subperiosteal pouch was performed with KPA tunnelling knife. Size of the pouch was controlled with the specific surgical template to ensure the device easily fits into the prepared pouch without tension. Expanders were secured in the correct position with a bone fixation screw, at the flat end, which does not possess an expansion capability. The wound was closed with 3-0 silk suture using simple interrupted sutures.</description>
