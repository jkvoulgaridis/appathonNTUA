      A new clothing robotic arm was developed for multi-joint coordinated upper limb
      rehabilitation after stroke. Patients after stroke will be recruited to evaluate the
      rehabilitation effectiveness of the device assisted upper limb rehabilitation. Both patients
      with chronic stroke and subacute stroke will be investigated.

    <textblock>
      A new robotic arm, named mobile exo-neuro-musculo-skeleton, was developed for upper limb
      rehabilitation. The system integrated the advantages of exoskeleton, soft robot, and
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation. It is noninvasive, light in weight, comfortable to
      wear, and can support the motions at the elbow, the wrist and the fingers. The device is a
      mobile system interfaced with a mobile app by a user.

      The device assisted upper limb rehabilitation will be applied to inpatients with subacute
      stroke. The rehabilitation effects on the motor restoration in the upper limb will be
      compared with the conventional physical and occupational therapies. The rehabilitation
      effects of the device assisted training also will be evaluated on patients with chronic
      stroke. The motor improvements after training will be investigated by comparing the pre- and
      post- clinical assessments. It is hypothesized that the device assisted upper limb
      rehabilitation will be effective in both subacute and chronic patients.
