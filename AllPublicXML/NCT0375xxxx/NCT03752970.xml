      The primary objectives of this trial are:

        -  To explore the pathomechanisms involved in the generation and healing of Crohn's Disease
           (CD) associated perianal fistulas

        -  To understand the mode-of-action (MoA) of BI 655130 in patients with CD and draining
           perianal fistulas

             able to use highly effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a
             low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
             Restrictions regarding women of childbearing potential. Restrictions regarding
             contraception for female patients are not applicable for Screening Cohort.

             endoscopic evidence and corroborated by a histopathology report

             CD, confirmed by MRI at screening*) actively draining with clinical indication for
             seton drainage **.

             *A historical MRI might be sufficient if all these conditions are met:

               1. the MRI is performed within ≤ 4 weeks prior to screening visit 1a

               2. the patient has not experienced any clinical significant changes regarding its
                  perianal CD which may induce suspicion of newer complications since the
                  historical MRI was done (in this case a new MRI at screening is mandatory)

               3. the historical MRI meets quality and technical imaging requirements described in
                  the Imaging Acquisition Guideline in the ISF

             distal from fistula(s), short gut syndrome, or any other manifestation that might
             require surgery, could preclude the use of the PDAI and CDAI to assess response to
