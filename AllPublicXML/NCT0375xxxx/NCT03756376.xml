  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of renal functional reserve (RFR) has been proposed for the risk
      stratification of patients undergoing potentially nephrotoxic procedures. The present pilot
      study is designed to explore the correlation between IRRIV and RFR under pathologic
      conditions.

    <textblock>
      Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or pathological stimuli or
      conditions.

      RFR is calculated as the difference between the measured maximum GFR achieved through a renal
      stress test and the baseline GFR measured in rest conditions. In clinical practice, the most
      common renal stress test is performed as a standardized protein loading test. Recently, in a
      pilot study, the investigators demonstrated a significant correlation between RFR and the
      intra-parenchymal renal resistive index variation (IRRIV) during an echo renal stress test in
      a cohort of healthy volunteers. IRRIV test has proven to be rapid, safe, bedside and easy to
      perform and it might represent a preliminary test in screening patients' RFR.The present
      pilot study is designed to explore the correlation between IRRIV and RFR under pathologic
      conditions.

    <description>Enrolled patients will receive IRRIV test and RFR assessment. RFR will be evaluated through a protein loading test. (1.2 g of protein/Kg of body weight) performed with cooked beef. The RFR was then defined as the difference between the highest CrCl obtained after the protein load and the baseline CrCl measured on rest conditions. Concerning the IRRIV test, a weight of 10% of the patient's body weight is applied on the abdominal wall. RRIs is recorded in a middle interlobular artery, every minute for 10 minutes during the echo-renal stress test. The lowest RRI reached is taken as reference (stress RRI). The IRRIV is defined as the percentage difference between baseline RRI and stress RRI</description>
