  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Electrical stimulation has been used in critical patients as an adjunct strategy
      of early rehabilitation. In septic or septic shock patients there are reports of only two
      studies in the literature, with conflicting results.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of high frequency electrical stimulation in the prevention
      of muscle mass loss in patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or septic shock.

      Methods: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Thirty-six patients
      with a diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock in the experimental group (high frequency
      electrical stimulation) and sham group will be randomized. They will be evaluated in relation
      to muscle mass, peripheral muscle strength and functional status. They will also be submitted
      to the collection of inflammatory, metabolic, damage and muscular trophism markers.

      Expected results: High-frequency electrical stimulation is expected to be able to prevent
      loss of muscle mass in patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or septic shock. In addition,
      it is expected to be able to preserve strength in this population without increasing the
      pro-inflammatory or metabolic response.

    <description>Medical Research Council Scale will be used to measure the peripheral muscle strength. The patient's effort is graded on a scale of 0-5:
Grade 5: Muscle contracts normally against full resistance. Grade 4: Muscle strength is reduced but muscle contraction can still move joint against resistance.
Grade 3: Muscle strength is further reduced such that the joint can be moved only against gravity with the examiner's resistance completely removed. As an example, the elbow can be moved from full extension to full flexion starting with the arm hanging down at the side.
Grade 2: Muscle can move only if the resistance of gravity is removed. As an example, the elbow can be fully flexed only if the arm is maintained in a horizontal plane.
Grade 1: Only a trace or flicker of movement is seen or felt in the muscle or fasciculations are observed in the muscle.
Grade 0: No movement is observed. The total score ranges from 0 (complete tetraparesis) to 60 points (normal muscle strength).</description>

    <description>Functional status will be assessed using the Surgical Intensive Care Unit Optimal Mobilization Score. This score classifies mobility from 0 to 4:
The SOMS &quot;0 - No mobility&quot; indicates that no mobilization should be considered due to the patients' clinical status.
SOMS &quot;1 - Passive mobilization&quot; indicates that passive mobilization can be carried out in bed.
SOMS &quot;2 - Sitting&quot; demonstrates that the patient is already able to sit on the bed or in a chair.
SOMS &quot;3 - Standing&quot;, indicates that the patient can perform orthostatism, with or without assistance.
The highest level of SOMS &quot;4 - Ambulation&quot;, shows that the patient is capable of ambulation.</description>
