    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare volume controlled-ventilation (VCV) and
      pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) in terms of pulmonary gas exchange, respiratory
      mechanics and arterial blood gas values in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, morbid obesity has become a global problem. It is not clear which mechanical
      ventilation mode will be used in bariatric surgery, which is one of the treatment options of
      these patients. VCV is the most commonly used mode to ventilate anesthetized patients.
      However, especially in obese patients, high airway pressures and hypoxia may occur due to
      increased intrapulmonary shunts. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential of PCV
      strategy to improve pulmonary gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gas
      values according to VCV in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
