      This is a multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, &quot;no-treatment&quot; controlled study
      conducted in normal, healthy subjects. This study is anticipated to enroll approximately 236
      male and/or female subjects between the ages of 20 to 75 years, inclusive, who desire volume
      augmentation to correct deficit in their mid-face volume.
