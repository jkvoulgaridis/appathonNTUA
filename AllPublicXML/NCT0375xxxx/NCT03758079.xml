    <textblock>
      This is a single blind randomized trial to compare efficacy and side effects of Gabapentin
      with Doxepin. Hemodialysis patients with uremic pruritus at one dialysis center of Saint
      George Hospital University Medical Centre were included in this study. Patients were divided
      into 2 groups to receive either 10 mg Doxepin daily or Gabapentin at a dose of 100mg after
      each hemodialysis session (increased as tolerated) for 4 weeks, after which patients were
      treated reversley. Pruritus severity and its effect on quality of life will be assessed by
      using visual analog scale (VAS), 5-D pruritus scale and dermatology life quality index
      (DLQI). Include patients will have to fill these forms at baseline and at end of week1, week2
      and week4

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pruritus is one of the frustrating skin manifestations of advanced renal failure. Many
      options have been used for the management of uremic pruritus (UP) such as Pregabalin,
      Gabapentin, Doxepine and Desloratidine. Gabapentin, a GABAergic drug, has been found to be
      effective in the treatment of uremic pruritus. Doxepin, a potent antihistamine drug, is used
      orally or topically in many pruritic conditions such as UP, idiopathic pruritus, atopic
      dermatitis, neurogenic, or psychogenic pruritus and, in the management of the UP in
      hemodialysis patients.

      No comparative head to head study between Gabapentin and Doxepine has been conducted to date.
      The aim of this study was to compare Gabapentin and Doxepin in treatment of uremic pruritus
      in hemodialysis patients.

    <description>a 10cm horizontal line marked from zero (no pruritus) to 10 (worst possible pruritus). The pruritus will be assessed subjectively and scored as follows: no pruritus (VAS score 0), mild (VAS score 1-3) with episodic and localized pruritus without disturbance in usual work and sleep, moderate (VAS score 4-7) with generalized and continuous pruritus without sleep disturbance and severe (VAS score 8-10) with generalized, continuous pruritus and sleep disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in 5-D Itch Scale score at week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>multidimensional questionnaire. The five dimensions are degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution. The scores of each of the five domains will be achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total 5-D score ranging between five (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus). For the distribution domain, the number of affected body parts is tallied (potential sum 0-16) and the sum is sorted into five scoring bins: sum of 0-21⁄4score of 1, sum of 3-51⁄4score of 2, sum of 6-101⁄4score of 3, sum of 11-131⁄4score of 4 and sum of 14-161⁄4score of 5</description>
