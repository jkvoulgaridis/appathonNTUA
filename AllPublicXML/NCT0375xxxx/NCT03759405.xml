  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the safety evaluation of primates, the best cell transplantation scheme was
      integrated. One patient with CHF caused by coronary heart disease, one patient with CHF
      caused by dilatation and one patient with CHF caused by Keshan disease were selected and
      treated with autologous iPS differentiated cardiomyocyte intravenous transplantation. The
      safety evaluation of human body was completed and combined with subjective and objective
      indexes respectively. Structural and functional indicators were used to evaluate the
      therapeutic effect of cell transplantation. The results of animal experiments confirmed the
      safety and effectiveness of intravenous myocardial cell transplantation, and clarified its
      possible mechanism.
