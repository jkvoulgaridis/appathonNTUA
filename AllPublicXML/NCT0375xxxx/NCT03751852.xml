  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labelled randomised controlled trial (RCT) that aims to examine the
      effectiveness of exercise coaching approach in improving the physical activity engagement in
      patients with psychosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with psychosis will be recruited from the out-patient department (OPD) of the Kwai
      Chung Hospital (KCH). The patient with informed consent will be randomly assigned to exercise
      coaching or psychoeducation group to prevent decline in cognitive and functional outcomes
      known to be common in this group. This comprises locally-tested evidence-based intervention
      strategies such as exercise and Yoga intervention, combined with exercise coaching to
      consolidate the exercise habit. Each of the intervention includes 28 sessions spanning
      for16-week.

    <measure>Working Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6- and 12- month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Digit Span backwards test. In this test, the subject was asked to recall a series of numbers in reverse order. The correctly recalled series were scored as 1, and the test contains 14 sequences of numbers. The range of working memory score is from 0 to 14, with higher values representing better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Attention and Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6- and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Letter Cancellation test Q score. The basic version of the task consists of six 52-character rows in which the target character is randomly interspersed approximately 18 times in each row. Subjects were asked to cancel the letter &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; as quickly as possible. The time to completion, number of error and omission items were recorded. A &quot;quality of search&quot; index (Q), developed by Geldmacher et al., was applied for the analysis. Q is the ratio of correct number to total number of targets multiplied by the ratio of correct number per second. Higher Q scores represent more efficient performance and better attention and concentration. Q scores could range from 0 (worst possible outcome) to 1 (best possible outcome)</description>
