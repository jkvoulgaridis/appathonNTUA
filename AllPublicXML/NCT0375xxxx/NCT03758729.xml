  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety of nivolumab in
      combination with radiation therapy in patients with mucosal melanoma of the head and neck
      (MMHN). Target Accrual and Study duration We will accrue up to 26 patients. It is estimated
      to take up to 2 years. The sample size is calculated by use of SWOG CRAB (Cancer Research And
      Biostatistics) to control the type I error at 5 % for null hypothesis that the true response
      rate was 25 % or below and to have 80 % of power if the true response rate was 50 % or
      higher. Although the target number of evaluable patients is 23, we planned to recruit 10%
      more than the target number of patients considering dropout, total 26.

      This is a phase II, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the response rate, efficacy
      and safety of nivolumab in combination with radiation therapy in subjects with of locally
      advanced, unresectable head and neck mucosal melanoma.

      A cycle is defined as 14 days. The nivolumab dose will be fixed at the recommended phase II
      dose of 3mg/kg as a 60-minute IV infusion every two weeks. Patients will continue on
      nivolumab up to 8 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator's
      decision to remove patient from the study, patient refusal to continue, or alternative
      treatment.

      Concurrent radiotherapy of 70Gy for 6-7 weeks will be initiated on the same day of first
      nivolumab dose of cycle 1.

      The combination of 70 Gy radiotherapy for 6-7 weeks begins on the day of initial
      administration of nivolumab, radiation therapy dose and treatment schedule 2.0, based on NCFC
      practice.

      Nivolumab is administered every two weeks in in combination with radiation therapy and has
      elapsed since 8 weeks (after 4 cycles) The administration of clinical trials in is terminated
      but nivolumabs is sustainable at the discretion of investigator. (This is carried out
      independently of the clinical trial) The response rate of radiation therapy is assessed by
      performing a tumor assessment every two months up to the end of radiation therapy.

    <description>RR, as determied by irRECIST criteria, is defined as the proportion of all subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is either a CR or PR. BOR is determined by the best response designation recorded between the date of treatment initiation and the date of first objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever is the first. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent anti-cancer therapy, all available repsonse designations will contribute to the BOR determination.</description>

          -  Measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria

          -  Be willing to provide fresh tissue for biomarker analysis, and, based on the adequacy
             of the tissue sample quality for assessment of biomarker status. Repeat samples may be
             required if adequate tissue is not provided. Newly obtained endoscopic biopsy
             specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
             (FFPE) block specimens are preferred to slides.

          -  Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to
             initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be
             provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived
             specimen.
