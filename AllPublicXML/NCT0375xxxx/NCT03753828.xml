  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the project &quot;MucoFong&quot; (19021906 national french program n which
      Vaincre La Mucoviscidose participated: N82006/ 351) was to determine the fungi present the
      respiratory tract of CF patients responsible for either colonization or authentic infectious
      diseases. The Mucofong data allowed the team to provide for the 1st time national French
      guidelines for the management of CF sputum mycological analysis (MucoMicrobes work group
      coordinated by Prof. Pl√©siat published in 2015 in the REMIC book). Nevertheless, the team has
      a comprehensive database that it still has to analyze beyond these initial results. The main
      goal today is to clarify the role of fungi in the lung function degradation of these patients
      by studying the overall risk and estimated impact of fungal colonization in our cohort.

      The material includes data from the followup of the 300 patients (3 visits per patient for
      which the team collected and verified the biological radiological and clinical data).

      Relations between Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans and lung function or clinical
      outcome of patients will be longitudinally analyzed taking as output variable FEV1, according
      to bibliography data available.

      To assess the attributed fungal risk, the team will focus on the 57 patients de novo
      colonized by fungi at the second visit. Three physician experts will determine the impact of
      such fungal colonization on the patient clinical and respiratory parameters.

      The expert conclusion concordance and statistical significance will be evaluated using the
      kappa score.

      This project will be realized in collaboration with the groups of Prof. R. Thiebaut
      (Methodology and Epidemiology Service Bordeaux University Hospital, INSERM U1219 / INRIA
      SISTM) and Prof. M. Fayon (Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric reference centre) University
      Hospital of Bordeaux.
