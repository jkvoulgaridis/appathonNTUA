  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory Phase 2 trial of BMX-010 in patients with Rosacea which will be
      conducted in two parts. Up to 210 subjects with Rosacea will be enrolled.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A is designed to confirm the optimal formulation, strength, and dosing frequency of the
      study drug. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled in this part.

      Part B is designed to be a randomized, double-blind trial studying the optimal formulation,
      strength, and dosing frequency of BMX-010 as determined in Part A, compared to Placebo. Up to
      150 subjects will be enrolled in this part.

      In both parts, adult subjects with Rosacea will be enrolled.
