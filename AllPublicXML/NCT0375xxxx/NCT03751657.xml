  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares 2 medicines for people with type 2 diabetes: insulin 287 (a new medicine)
      and insulin glargine (a medicine doctors can already prescribe). The study doctors will test
      insulin 287 to see how well it works compared to insulin glargine. The study will also test
      if insulin 287 is safe. The study participants will either get insulin 287 or insulin
      glargine (100 units/mL) - which treatment the participants get is decided by chance. The
      participants will need to inject their selves every day about the same time. Once a week the
      participant will need to take 1 extra injection on the same day of the week. The participants
      will have 16 clinic visits and 14 phone calls with the study doctor. During the study, the
      doctors will ask you to: 1) measure your blood sugar every day with a blood glucose meter
      using a finger prick, 2) write down different information in a paper diary daily and return
      this to your doctor, 3) wear a medical device to measure your blood sugar all the time for 2
      weeks 5 times during the study.
