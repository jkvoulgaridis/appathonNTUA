  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a set of biomarkers for imaging of small vessel disease in diabetic individuals
      using advanced MRI techniques. With this the investigators want to document progression of
      disease both radiologically and clinically.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will use a paradigm developed at Yale University called Cognitive
      Predictive Modelling (CPM) which takes connectivity data and reduces it to two smaller
      network which predict higher and lower performance in a particular task for which these
      networks have been optimized. Vascular measures will complement this measure.

        Our study population are those with type 2 diabetes in mid-life and old age, who may or may
        not have cognitive deficits, whose cognitive deficits (when present) cannot be better
        explained by other factors. We exclude those who are unable to have MRI or cognitive
        testing due to a variety of reasons.
