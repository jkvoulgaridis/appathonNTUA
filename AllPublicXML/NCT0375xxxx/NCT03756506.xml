      The purpose of the study is to investigate additional clinical uses for DuraDerm®. DuraDerm®
      is a FDA approved, 510k, medical device, but has not been approved for use on patients with
      pin track sites as a way to lower the infection rate and is investigational for this purpose.
      The approved uses include wound care and post-operative care.

      About 20 subjects will take part in this study.

      Study Objectives Research participants eligible for the study will be those undergoing
      Deformity Correction and Traumatic Provisional Fixation. These research participants have a
      number of pins placed to ensure this required rigid fixation. The number of external fixation
      pins averages approximately ten per research participant.

      DuraDerm® is a 510K FDA cleared medical device indicated for providing a covering over minor
      wounds and scrapes that are clean and dry. The microbicidal liquid solution consists of
      organic polymer dissolved in methylene chloride organic solvent. The unique formulation
      eradicates any organisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses) it comes in contact with. This is a
      result of the methylene chloride's activity against an infinite number of organisms. The
      methylene chloride evaporates leaving a clear, elastomeric, non-odorous film for covering
      minor wounds. The film protects the wound against entry of water, dirt, and germs. The film
      is elastomeric and protects in difficult regions where flexing, bending and creasing skin
      occurs. The clear film forms in less than a minute. Application is commonly accomplished
      using a cotton tip applicator. The liquid is applied on and around the wound extending at
      least an inch and a quarter beyond the edges of the wound. Momentary stinging may occur upon
      initial application. The film commonly remains intact for one to three days or longer
      depending on exposure to rubbing, flexing, or soap and water. This film is resistant to
      degradation by water alone, but can be easily removed with the combination of soap and water
      or it can be gently peeled off starting at the outer edges. DuraDerm® is for external use
      only. DuraDerm® is not intended for use on deep or infected wounds or puncture wounds, or for
      use near the eyes, mouth, or nose. Intentional inhaling of the contents may be harmful or
      fatal. The bottle should be tightly capped after each use to prevent evaporation of the
      solvent.7

      This Principle Investigator has previously utilized topically applied DuraDerm® as an
      additional step in the treatment protocol for pin site care for several reconstructive
      surgery patients (approximately 25) with over 200 pin sites with only 2 pin site infections.
      This represents a significant reduction from the average incidence of pin site infections
      reported in the literature (&lt;1% vs 27% on a per research participant basis). A recently
      published retrospective case series evaluating this microbicidal polymer dressing reported 6
      patients and 66 pins had no infections when Duraderm® was used as part of their pin site care
      regimen.8

      This study was undertaken to formally evaluate whether DuraDerm® used on pin sites leads to a
      reduction in pin track infections when compared to a control group as well as the reported
      average incidence in the literature.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will enroll 12 total research participants (6 control research participants and 6 DuraDerm® research participants) with approximately 120 pin sites (approximately 60 in the Control group and 60 in the DuraDerm® group). Each research participant undergoing Deformity Correction and/or Traumatic Provisional Surgery will be asked to participate in the study to evaluate if the topical application of DuraDerm® as an additional step in the management of post-operative pin track site care reduces the incidence of pin track infections. Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval will be obtained and informed research participant consent will be obtained from each research participant.</intervention_model_description>

Research participants seen by the Primary Investigator who will be undergoing deformity correction or traumatic provisional fixation, will be invited to take part in this research study. No recruitment of the Principal Investigator's own students, employees, or family members will be allowed. Research participants who do not wish to participate in this randomized study will be provided the standard pin track care protocol this investigator utilizes for his research participants and will not have the opportunity to receive DuraDerm®.</description>

These include redness around pin site, discharge,tenderness in the soft tissue, loosening of the pin, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills.
Step 1: Brush the pin sites with saline using an ordinary soft toothbrush or gauze with sterile gloves Step 2: If following Step 1, debris remains, use forceps (tweezers) to gently remove debris. Step 3: Apply DuraDerm® with Q-tip on clean dry wound around (extending approximately one inch around pin site) and on the pin. DuraDerm® will be applied daily while in the hospital and then at a minimum of at least three times a week until pin removal.</description>

        <title>Pin Track Infection Rate Among Research Participants Based on Number of Pins Undergoing Deformity Correction and Traumatic Provisional Fixation</title>
        <description>Research participants identified for the study will be those undergoing Deformity Correction and Traumatic Provisional Fixation who are under the care of the Primary Investigator. These research participants have a number of pins placed to ensure this required rigid fixation. The number of external fixation pins averages approximately ten per research participant. Research participants seen by the Primary Investigator who will be undergoing deformity correction or traumatic provisional fixation, will be invited to take part in this research study. No recruitment of the Principal Investigator's own students, employees, or family members will be allowed. Research participants who do not wish to participate in this randomized study will be provided the standard pin track care protocol this investigator utilizes for his research participants and will not have the opportunity to receive DuraDerm®.</description>

            <description>All pins and wire sites will be cleaned daily while hospitalized. Basic pin care will be performed once daily by hospital nursing staff prior to discharge. Following discharge from the hospital, the pin care protocol will be continued by research participant’s caregiver.Research participants will be instructed to notify the Principal Investigator if they observe any signs or symptoms of infection. These include redness around pin site, discharge,tenderness in the soft tissue, loosening of the pin, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills.
Step 1: Brush the pin sites with saline using an ordinary soft toothbrush or gauze with sterile gloves Step 2: If following Step 1, debris remains, use forceps (tweezers) to gently remove debris. Step 3: Apply DuraDerm® with Q-tip on clean dry wound around (extending approximately one inch around pin site) and on the pin. DuraDerm® will be applied daily while in the hospital and then at a minimum of at least three times a week until pin removal.</description>
