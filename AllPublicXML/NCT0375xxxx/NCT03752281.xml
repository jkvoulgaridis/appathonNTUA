    <textblock>
      There is a group of social assistance recipients which have difficulties in entering the
      labor market and thus remains in a long-term dependency on social assistance. More knowledge
      about individuals receiving long-term social assistance is needed in order to improve into
      work interventions for this group. Therefore, this study aims to describe variables of
      health, function and activity in participants receiving long-term social assistance.

      There is a group of social assistance recipients who have difficulties in entering the labor
      market and thus remains in a long-term dependency on social assistance. More knowledge about
      individuals receiving long-term social assistance is needed in order to improve into-work
      interventions for this group. Therefore, this study aims to describe variables of health,
      function and activity in participants receiving long-term social assistance. Individuals who
      have received social assistance during more than three years, who report physical and/or
      psychological difficulties, and/or have a complex social situation will be asked for
      participation in a six months activity-based investigation including contact with social
      worker, psychologist, occupational therapist, physical therapist and labor market consultant.
      The intervention aims to clarify the participants hinders and resources for entering the
      labor market. The participants are going to answer a questionnaire about health, function,
      and activity before and after the investigation. In addition, the participants function and
      ability to perform activities will be classified using the International Classification of
      Functioning (ICF). Data from the questionnaires and from ICF recordings will be used to
      describe variables of health, function and ability to be active. Participants who manage to
      get closer to, or enter into, the labor market will be asked to participate in a qualitative
      interview study about the experiences of the change. In addition, social workers will be
      asked to participate in focus-group interviews about experiences from the professional
      contact and work with the participants. The quantitative data will be analysed using
      traditional statistics and multivariate data analysis. Qualitative data will be analysed
      using qualitative content analysis.

        Individuals who have been social assistance recipients for at least three years and who not
        have a plan how to get closer to the labor market. There may be signs of different kinds of
        ill-health such as physical, pshychological and/or social ill-health. The social worker
        responsible for decision about the monetary support identifies a need for establishing the
        working ability of the individual with the aim to agree on a plan towards self-sufficiency.
