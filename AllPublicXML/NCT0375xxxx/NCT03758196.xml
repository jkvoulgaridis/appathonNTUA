    <textblock>
      As one of the most common chronic diseases,The adult prevalence of hypertension is
      approximately 26.4% at present and will rise to 29.2% by 2025.Renal sympathetic denervation
      from the intima of renal artery has emerged as a potential treatment for resistant
      hypertension. However, renal sympathetic nerve are mainly located in the adventitia,and there
      is no report on renal sympathetic denervation from the adventitia of renal artery.This study
      is a multicenter,randomized,single-blind study,and aimed to observe the safety and efficacy
      of radiofrequency ablation of the renal artery from the adventitia on the basis of
      laparoscopic techniques for patients with resistant hypertension.
