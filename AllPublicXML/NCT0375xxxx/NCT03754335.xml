    <textblock>
      Headache control is one of the major challenges in patients who suffered an acute aneurysmal
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Headache affects 90% of the patient and is resistant to the
      major pain medication. It results from the increased intracranial pressure and the
      inflammation caused by the accumulation of arterial blood in the subarachnoid space.
      Hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal by a lumbar puncture (LP), is well tolerated,
      reduces intracranial pressure and accelerates the clearance of the blood products from CSF.
      Nonetheless it has never been tested in a randomized trial. The investigators aim to compare
      in patients who experienced a low grade aSAH, the variation of headache intensity after CSF
      removal by LP vs. Sham LP in addition to predefined analgesic protocol management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) almost 90 % of patients experience a severe
      headache during their hospital stay. Pain control often requires high doses of opioid drugs
      and sedation that remain only partially efficacious. In addition, there is to the
      investigator's knowledge currently no recommendation or consensus on aSAH related headache
      management. aSAH related headache results from the prolonged increased intracranial pressure
      and meningeal inflammation related to the accumulation of blood products in the subarachnoid
      space. Preliminary studies, suggest that hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal by
      lumbar puncture (LP) or lumbar drain, is safe and decreases intracranial pressure. However
      its impact on headache control has never been tested. A reliable headache evaluation has to
      be performed among conscious patients experiencing a &quot;low-grade&quot; aSAH.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate in patients experiencing low-grade acute aSAH (WFNS
      1-3), the efficacy of CSF removal by LP vs. sham LP, on headache control. 74 patients with
      secured aneurysm by coiling, will be randomized (1:1) between day 3 and day 5 after
      aneurysmal rupture. The procedure will be performed in addition to a pre-specified antalgic
      protocol.

      Mean headache intensity will be measured with the numeric verbal scale during the 24 hours
      before and the 24 hours after the procedure. The variation of mean intensity will be compared
      between the 2 groups.

      The investigators hypothesize that this treatment may significantly decrease headache
      intensity after an aSAH. If this hypothesis is confirmed CSF removal by LP could be a simple
      cost effective and worldwide available strategy to improve

    <description>Patient will be managed according to the current international recommendations in the Toulouse acute stroke center.
In the absence of clear recommendation in the literature headache will be treated according to our local predefined analgesic protocol: paracetamol 1g/6 h, and if the numerical scale ≥ 4 : continuous intravenous morphine starting at 1mg/h and increased per 0.5 mg/h every hour if numerical scale remains ≥ 4.
Lumbar puncture will be performed between day 3 and day 5 after subarachnoid hemorrhage onset by an independent scientist from our clinical investigator center. 30-mL CSF will be removed by LP.
Sham LP consisting in superficial skin puncture by a subcutaneous needle (27 gauge needle) during the usual procedure will be performed at the same time point.</description>
