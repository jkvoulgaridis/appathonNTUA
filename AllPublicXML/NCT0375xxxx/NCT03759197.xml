  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study (Study 305) has been designed to determine and compare the efficacy and
      safety of 188-0551 Spray and Vehicle Spray applied twice daily for up to four weeks in
      subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects will be instructed to apply the test article
      (188-0551 Spray or Vehicle Spray) to all psoriasis plaques within the designated Treatment
      Area twice daily for four weeks (Study Day 29), unless the investigator verifies the
      subject's psoriasis has cleared at Day 15, then test article application will be for 2 weeks
      (Study Day 15).

    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects with IGA treatment success at End of Study (EOS) where EOS is the subject's last completed post-Baseline visit (Day 29).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects rated a treatment success for each of the clinical signs of psoriasis (scaling, erythema and plaque elevation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Scaling, erythema and plaque elevation will each be scored on a 5-point scale where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. These evaluations are an assessment of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of each of three key characteristics present within all of the subject's psoriatic lesions in the Treatment Area by the investigator or designee.</description>
