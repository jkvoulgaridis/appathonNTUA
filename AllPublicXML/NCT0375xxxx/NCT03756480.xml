  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that the molecular changes present in ectopic
      endometriosis lesions correlate with progesterone-resistant disease (using the criteria
      defined in this study) and are present in matched eutopic endometrium.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissues from 100 patients with endometriosis will be analyzed with droplet digital PCR
      (ddPCR) targeted sequencing and responders (n=50) will be compared to non-responders (n=50)
      after controlling confounding factors.

      From a subset of the 100 cases, whole exome sequencing (WES) and Methylation-Specific PCR
      (MSP)-based methylation profiling on microdissected epithelium and stroma will be performed
      in matched eutopic and ectopic tissues from 20 patients with known cancer-associated
      mutations or 20 controls.
