    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical condition, involving the development of
      arterial hypertension. A Meta analysis study have shown that isometric hand grip training
      promotes blood pressure reduction. It is going to be conducted a clinical trail to determine
      the effects of hand grip training in OSA patients to change the arterial hypertension.

      Background: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical condition, involving the
      development of arterial hypertension. Meta analysis study have shown that isometric hand grip
      strength promotes blood pressure reduction, and its reduction is higher than that observed
      after aerobic training. Objective: to analyze the effects of the isometric hand grip on blood
      pressure changes of patients with uncontrolled arterial hypertension with OSA. Methods: a
      randomized controlled trial involving 18 adults with OSA and uncontrolled arterial
      hypertension of both sexes, randomized between control group (receive general guidelines) and
      hand grip group. 12 weeks of training with load equivalent to 30% of maximum voluntary
      capacity was performed. All participants will be submitted for evaluation of blood pressure
      (BP) central and brachial, pulse wave velocity, full polysomnography,before and after the
      study protocol (the change from the baseline at 12 weeks). Expected results: the authors
      believe that hand grip training can change (reduce) blood pressure in patient with OSA.
