    <textblock>
      A DDI study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of both; doses of FDL176
      with and without co-administration of FDL169 and doses of FDL169 with and without
      co-administration of FDL176.

      This is an open-label, non-randomised study. Enrolment will be in two parallel and
      independent parts. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single
      doses of FDL176 with and without co-administration of FDL169. Part 2 will assess the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of FDL169 with and without
      co-administration of FDL176.
