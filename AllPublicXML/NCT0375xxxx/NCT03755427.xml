  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the inactivated
      whole-virion vaccine for teenagers and adults.

      The investigators will test the vaccine in participants aged above 12 years, for a
      randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study. The investigators designed one dosage
      groups: 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen. Control group is designed to inoculate seasonal
      influence vaccine and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Participants will receive 2 doses of
      vaccine at 21-day intervals. Safety up to 6 months and changes in hemagglutinin inhibition
      (HI) titers at 21 days after each vaccination will be determined.
