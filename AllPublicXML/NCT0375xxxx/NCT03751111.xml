      This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of sublingual naloxone in the treatment
      of chronic, refractory itch in patients under long-term arsenic exposure. In this study, 200
      subjects with a moderate-to-severe symptom of itching (numeric rating scale, NRS≥3) will be
      recruited and randomly treated with either sublingual naloxone (100 subjects) or placebo (100
      subjects). The severity of itching will be evaluated in the wash out phase, baseline, and one
      week after the treatment through reporting of subjective symptomatology (itch NRS) via the
      interview. Quality of sleep measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) will serve as the secondary outcome.
