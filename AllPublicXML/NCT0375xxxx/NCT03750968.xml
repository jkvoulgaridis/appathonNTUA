  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypotheses that (1) the third trimester of pregnancy is a
      period of maternal systemic and ocular carotenoid depletion; (2) prenatal supplementation
      with 6.0 milligrams of lutein and 0.5 milligrams of zeaxanthin will have significant effects
      on ocular and systemic biomarkers of maternal and infant carotenoid status relative to a
      matched, standard-of-care prenatal supplement without added lutein and zeaxanthin; and (3)
      newborn infants with the highest systemic and ocular carotenoid status will have more mature
      foveal structure.

      Mothers will be enrolled in the study during their first trimester, and will take the study
      carotenoid or control supplements for 6 to 8 months. The final study outcome measurements of
      mothers and infants will be completed within two weeks of the baby's birth.
