  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, single-arm registry to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bare
      metal stent-assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the treatment of
      superficial femoral and/or proximal popliteal artery (P1) lesions in patients with
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to collect acute and follow-up (up to 12 months) safety and
      efficacy data on the ZENFlex™ Peripheral Stent System in the stent-assisted angioplasty
      treatment of patients with de novo or restenotic lesion(s) of the native superficial femoral
      artery (SFA) and/or proximal popliteal artery (PPA, P1 segment) when used according to IFU.
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled in this study at up to 5 sites in Germany.

      This study is a prospective, single-arm observational registry and does not include an active
      control arm. Therefore, no formal sample size calculation has been performed. All subjects
      will be evaluated at pre-discharge and during clinical follow-up visits 6 (182 ± 30 days) and
      12 (365 ± 30 days) months post-procedure.

      Primary endpoints are patency rate after one year and composite of freedom from device and
      procedure-related death through 12 months post procedure as well as freedom from both target
      limb major amputation and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization.

    <description>The ZENFLEX Peripheral Stent System is designed to deliver a self-expanding stent to the iliac artery, superficial femoral arteries and / or proximal popliteal arteries to improve luminal diameter. The self-expanding stent is composed of nickel titanium alloy (nitinol); contains a total of 12 tantalum / gold radiopaque markers and imparts an outward radial force on the luminal surface of the vessel to establish patency.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patient is ≥ 18 years old at the time of consent. 2. Subject has provided written
             informed consent prior to participation in the study, understands the purpose of this
             study and agrees to comply with all protocol-specified examinations and follow-up
             appointments.

             3. Rutherford Classification Category 2-4. Subjects with Rutherford Class 2 have gone
             through a conservative therapy without success. 4. De novo stenotic, restenotic or
             occlusive lesion(s) located in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal
             popliteal artery (P1 segment) suitable for stenting after PTA.

             5. Lesion location starts distal to CFA bifurcation (below origin of deep femoral
