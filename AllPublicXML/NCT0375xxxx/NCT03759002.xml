  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major risk factor for death in end stage renal diseases
      (ESRD). Approximately 80% of ESRD patients have some degrees of left ventricular
      abnormalities at initiation of dialysis. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) has been
      widely accepted as an useful marker to assess CVD in ESRD children. In addition, cardiac
      mechanics parameters are used to evaluate cardiac function more precisely. However, measuring
      CIMT and cardiac mechanics parameters are expensive and difficult to perform as a routine
      method. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a hematological index which shows the size of
      platelets. Uremic state causes inflammatory condition that affects MPV. Previous studies on
      people with normal renal function have shown that this parameter can also have association
      with CVD. However the data in children with ESRD is scarce. The aim of this study is to find
      a simple hematologic marker to use regularly in ESRD children finding patients at risk of
      CVD. Therefore, we will investigate the relationship between mean platelet volume and CIMT
      and cardiac mechanic parameters in children with ESRD.
