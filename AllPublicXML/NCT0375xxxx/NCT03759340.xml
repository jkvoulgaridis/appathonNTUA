      This is an open label study Of ATI-502 Topical Solution for the treatment of AA, AU, and AT
      with the following goals:

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ATI-502 Topical Solution in subjects
           with AA, AU or AT following 24 weeks of treatment with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or
           Placebo Suspension.

        -  To assess the ability of ATI-502 Topical Solution to maintain or improve hair regrowth
           in subjects previously treated with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or Placebo Suspension.

      This Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy,
      and durability of efficacy of ATI-502 Topical Solution, 0.46% for the treatment of alopecia
      areata (AA), alopecia universalis (AU) and alopecia totalis (AT) in adult subjects who
      completed 24 weeks of treatment with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or Placebo Suspension.

      Subjects who complete 24 weeks of active treatment with ATI-501 Oral Suspension or Placebo
      Suspension in study ATI-501-AUAT-201 will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study. At
      Visit 9 in study ATI-501-AUAT-201, subjects who did not experience any adverse events (AEs),
      serious adverse events (SAEs), or tolerability issues that met study discontinuation criteria
      in study ATI-501-AUAT-201 and who in the opinion of the investigator are capable of
      re-growing or maintaining scalp hair and meet the entry criteria are eligible to enroll in
      this open-label study.

      Enrolled subjects will apply ATI-502 Topical Solution, 0.46% BID to the entire scalp and if
      applicable, the eyebrow(s) and return for safety and efficacy assessments as detailed in the
      Schedule of Assessments (Table 3). Assessment of response to treatment will be performed at
      Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, and post-treatment Week 28. Safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated at each study visit by assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and
      vital signs, and at Week 24, and physical examination findings

    <description>The efficacy endpoints will compare the assessment from the Baseline visit from both ATI-501-AUAT-201 and ATI-502-AA-203 to the applicable post-baseline visits. For the primary endpoint, the primary efficacy variable will be the mean relative percent change from the original baseline visit in study ATI-501-AUAT-201in the SALT score at Visit 6 (Week 24 on study ATI-502-AA-203). This represents the percentage of hair regrowth. It will be calculated as the mean of the changes from baseline SALT score to the SALT score at each visit, divided by baseline SALT score and expressed as a percentage. SALT score is on a percent scale where 0% is no hair loss and 100 % is total hair loss. A lower score is a better outcome. A large percent change is a better outcome.
