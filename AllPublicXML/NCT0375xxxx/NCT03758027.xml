  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the efficacy of an intervention that could interrupt
      the cycle of emotion dysregulation as it relates to cravings and negative emotions for those
      with problematic substance use behaviors. This will be a quantitative randomized control
      trial study with data collection at three points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and
      same-day follow up. This study will be conducted at the Inova Behavioral Health Merrifield
      Center. Inova's addictions services program is the CATS program (formerly comprehensive
      addiction treatment services), which provides therapeutic interventions for those managing
      substance use disorders. The focus of measurement will be about the current state of the
      participant, and not a cumulative status. This one-session intervention. The goal is to have
      96 participants in the study, 48 in each of the two groups.

      The conceptual framework for the study is built on a foundation of three models found in the
      literature. The first of these is Gross's model of emotional regulation (ER), a goal-oriented
      linear process allowing for interventions at different phases in the experience. The
      individual has choices to: (1) avoid a situation all together; (2) deflect or distract from
      the situation; (3) reframe the situation; (4) or manage the physiological reactions. Adding
      on to this model, Koole expanded the framework, and reclassified the processes as tasks
      toward a goal, while adding an array of functions for each task. This includes where he/she
      is focusing, what he/she is thinking, and how he/she is responding. This allows the
      individual more choices in managing the emotions, depending on what he/she is trying to
      achieve. Finally, applying a taxonomy developed by Webb et al. (2012) of interventions to
      this framework, the identification of types of interventions is clarified. The framework is
      then applied to the proposed intervention, CARESS.

      The proposed study will investigate a specific intervention and its efficacy at managing the
      acute effects for cravings, drug and drinking refusal self-efficacy, physiological responses,
      and affect disturbance for those with problematic substance use behaviors. The intervention
      is a one-time treatment session using CARESS in comparison to a control group who do not
      receive CARESS for those with problematic substance use behaviors. The aim is to investigate
      the difference in variances between pre, post, and follow up measurements for cravings, drug
      and drinking refusal skill self-efficacy, affect disturbance, and physiological responses for
      a one-time treatment session using CARESS in comparison to a control group for those with
      problematic substance use behaviors.

      This is the initial study with respect to CARESS overall

    <description>To identify the change in intensity and characteristics of cravings, using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). The Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) is a self-report tool addressing the frequency, intensity, and duration of craving, as well as the self-efficacy in the resistance to drink, and a comprehensive cravings measurement. Each question is on a Likert-scale with answers from zero (0) to six (6) and scores of questions one through four ranging from zero to 30, with no subscales. The lower the score the lower the craving, therefore a better outcome. The initial study of the PACS supported content, predictive and construct validity. There is an internal consistency of .92 Cronbach's alpha.</description>

    <description>To identify the change in affect disturbance, the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument will be used. The PANAS is a 20-question instrument with 10 emotions listed for positive affect, and 10 emotions listed for negative affect. These are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, measuring the positive and negative affects an individual is experiencing at a specific moment in time. Although both scales are on the instrument, they do not measure the same continuum. The Positive affect subscale: questions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, &amp; 19, with scores ranging from 10 - 50; higher scores indicate more of a positive affect. The Cronbach's alpha for the positive affect subscale ranges from .86-.90. The Negative affect subscale: questions 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, &amp; 20 with scores ranging from 10 - 50; lower scores indicate less of a negative affect. The Cronbach's alpha for the negative affect, a range of .84-.87.</description>

    <description>Identify the change in perception of self-efficacy on drug refusal skills, utilizing Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire. The DTCQ-8 assesses a participant's confidence that he/she would not use drugs or drink in different scenarios of high-risk situations. The 8 questions each correspond to relapse predictors. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, in intervals of 20: 0, 0% not at all confident I would be able to resist; 20, 20% confidence to resist; 40, 40% confident; 60, 60% confident; 80, 80% confident; and 100, 100% very confident. There are two versions of the DTCQ-8, one for alcohol and one for drugs, the measurements are the same and the wording in the instructions is slightly different. It is recommended that the appropriate instrument be used for the drug of choice of the client. In order to score the full instrument, a global self-efficacy score is calculated by averaging the scored items; the higher the score, the greater the self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>The proposed intervention for this study has three stages: communicate alternatively (CA), release endorphins (RE), and self-soothe (SS) (CARESS)
CARESS is a combined skill of three activities. Each section is timed and has specific activities:
CA - will last eight (8) minutes, and will be expression of emotion with drawing with crayons.
RE - will last six (6) minutes, and will be a butterfly hug with a blanket. SS - will last six (6) minutes, and will be a pre-recorded music selection.</description>
