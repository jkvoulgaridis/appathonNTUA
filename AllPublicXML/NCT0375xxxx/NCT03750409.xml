  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will gather data to see if infrared and near infrared light frequency can increase
      the activity of brain cells and provide support for the cell's ability to repair and protect
      themselves against further damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that impaired regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) [flow of blood in certain
      parts of the brain] plays an important role in dementia. Infrared and near infrared light
      frequency has been shown to increase the activity of brain cells and provide support for the
      cell's ability to repair and protect themselves against further damage. This study will
      evaluate the effects of repeated brief exposure to near infrared light stimulation twice a
      day on subjects that have problems such as attention span, working memory, strategies of
      learning and remembering, planning, organizing, self-monitoring, inhibition and flexible
      thinking for an 8 week period.

    <description>Mini Mental State Exam will be performed in beginning of the study (before first treatment), in the middle of the treatment (in 4 weeks) and in the end of treatment (in the end of 8 weeks). This quick assessment will be able to score assessed individuals using 0-30 scoring range. Collected scores will be compared at different time points and any numerical change in score will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>ADAS-Cog test will be performed in beginning of the study (before first treatment), in the middle of the treatment (in 4 weeks) and in the end of treatment (in the end of 8 weeks) to measure cognition. This comprehensive test will measure patient's ability of language and memory. Test consist of 11 parts and will help to assess baseline and determine cognitive change over period of treatment using patient's ability to answer questions and given score.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Electro Encephalography (QEEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before first treatment, at 4 weeks and then at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>QEEG measurement will be performed in beginning of the study (before first treatment), in the middle of the treatment (in 4 weeks) and in the end of treatment (in the end of 8 weeks). This measurement will use modern analytic software to process activity of the brain during cognitive task in the forms of electrical signals received from the surface of the scalp. Analytical software uses algorithms to assess recorded brain impulses and evaluate brain function, helping to track changes in the brain function due to treatment.
Waveforms of EEG being assessed:
Delta frequencies (1-4 HZ) are produced during sleep are widespread in the frontal central region. Delta is necessary for sleep and stillness.
Theta frequencies (4-8 HZ) are associated with selective attention, retrieving newly learned information, and preceding sleep. Theta aids creativity and problem solving.
Alpha frequencies (8-12 HZ) appear in the posterior when the eyes are closed. It is associated with idling and</description>

    <description>The portable device covers the head and weighs about 3.5 lb., and is made of light-weight, durable plastic, it is placed on the head with eye panels facing forward. Elastic straps holding the arrays together easily expand to conform to each subjects' head. Patients may notice slight warming of scalp after usage. This warming effect is similar to wearing a regular motorcycle helmet for a similar duration.</description>
