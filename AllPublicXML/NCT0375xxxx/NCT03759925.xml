  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, wait-list controlled study examining the impact of
      providing medically appropriate meals to patients discharged from Zuckerberg San Francisco
      General Hospital after acute decompensated heart failure. Upon discharge, patients will be
      randomized to either the intervention or wait list control arm. The intervention is the
      delivery of medically appropriate meals and groceries to patients' homes in a tapered manner
      over five months (the equivalent of three meals a day for 60 days, then the equivalent of two
      meals a day for 30 days, then the equivalent of one meal a day for 60 days) and monthly
      assessments with a registered dietician (RD). All food and RD assessments are administered
      via a community partner, Project Open Hand, as a modification of current offerings for
      clients at Project Open Hand. Subjects randomized into the wait list control arm will receive
      the food intervention five months after discharge. The study's primary aim is to examine the
      impact of nutritional support on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores. In
      addition, the study aims to examine the impact of nutritional support on healthcare
      utilization (particularly readmission rates and emergency room utilization), dietary change,
      medication adherence, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The San Francisco Department of Public Health, UCSF, and Project Open Hand (POH), a community
      based organization in San Francisco which provides meals and groceries to chronically ill
      clients in the Bay Area, have partnered to conduct a prospective, randomized, wait-list
      controlled study examining the impact of providing medically appropriate meals and registered
      dietician (RD) support to patients discharged from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital
      after acute decompensated heart failure. Before discharge, patients will be randomized to
      either the intervention or wait list control arm. The intervention consists of the delivery
      of medically appropriate meals and/or groceries to participants' homes in a tapered manner
      over five months (the equivalent of three meals a day for 60 days, then the equivalent of two
      meals a day for 30 days, then the equivalent of one meal a day for 60 days) and monthly
      nutrition education with a registered dietician (RD). All food and nutritional education are
      administered by POH staff and RDs. Participants randomized into the wait list control arm
      will receive the food intervention five months after discharge. The study's primary aim is to
      examine the impact of nutritional support on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
      scores. In addition, the study aims to examine the impact of nutritional support on
      healthcare utilization (particularly readmission rates and emergency room utilization),
      dietary change, medication adherence, and quality of life. The investigators will assess
      outcomes at baseline while patients are hospitalized, 2 months after discharge, and 5 months
      after discharge using quantitative surveys. The investigators will call participants at 3
      months and 4 months after discharge with a shorter quantitative survey assessing a subset of
      outcome measures. In addition, the investigators will conduct a qualitative interview near
      the conclusion of the intervention in a subset of participants to understand perceived
      impacts of the intervention as well as barriers and facilitators to heart failure care.

    <time_frame>Assessed at time of enrollment and 1 and 5 months after hospital discharge. A subset of questions are asked at 3 and 4 months post discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. An overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
