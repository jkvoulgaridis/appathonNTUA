      VXM01 in combination with avelumab in n=30 patients with progressive glioblastoma following
      standard treatment, with or without second surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted as a multicenter, open-label, Phase I/II trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of VXM01 in combination with avelumab in subjects with resectable and
      non-resectable progressive glioblastoma following tumor resection and radiochemotherapy
      containing temozolomide.

      The trial will be performed in 30 subjects with progressive glioblastoma:

        -  24 subjects who will not be candidates for a tumor re-operation (non-resectable
           subjects)

        -  6 subjects who will be candidates for a tumor re-operation (resectable subjects) The
           trial, for each subject, will consist of a screening period, a treatment and
           observatioon phase of 60 weeks including, a treatment phase of up to 48 weeks with prime
           and boosting administrations of VXM01 in combination with avelumab and an observation
           phase of 12 weeks and with an end of trial visit at Week 60.

      Subjects will receive VXM01 in combination with avelumab up to Week 48. The end of study
      (EoS) visit assessments will be performed Week 60.
