  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is studying adolescents between the ages of 12 to 18 years that come to the
      emergency department and are in pain. We want to find out how well art therapy is able to
      decrease the pain they are experiencing. Art therapy will involve making art and working with
      an art therapist to find new ways of expressing thoughts and feelings through art making.

      In adolescents presenting to the emergency department with a painful condition, our aims are
      as follows:

      Aim #1: To determine the degree that art therapy intervention reduces pain and anxiety.

      Aim #2: To determine the degree that art therapy reduces pain and anxiety 1 hour after the
      intervention.

      Aim #3: To explore the qualitative experience of patients undergoing art therapy
      intervention.

      Pain is one of the most common reasons for patients to visit the emergency department (ED),
      and can be treated using both complementary and pharmacological strategies. However, children
      are often undertreated for pain which results in not only short term problems, but long term
      consequences such as trauma and stress-induced disorders; health care avoidance as adults;
      increased pain sensitivity; and decreased response to future analgesia. There have been
      variable efforts made to improve the ED management of pain in children, but adolescents are
      frequently overlooked. A review of the literature revealed that art therapy for pain
      management in adolescents is understudied. The majority of studies describe the effects of
      art therapy on the emotional well-being in surgical and oncology populations in adults and
      children. The studies that did evaluate the effectiveness of art therapy for pain management
      in children focused primarily on surgical and medical oncology populations with children aged
      2-14 years. Of these studies, none evaluated adolescents in the ED, which is a high volume
      and high stress environment that confers a distinct experience for patients compared to other
      medical settings. Evaluation of art therapy interventions using quantitative self-report
      measures with strong validity in children and further delineation of the patient experience
      related to art therapy is necessary. Advanced evaluation of aforementioned interventions
      would expand the evidence base needed to describe effectiveness of these interventions and
      support greater implementation and dissemination. These are the gaps in knowledge that the
      investigators aim to fill with the proposed study.

    <measure>Change in patient anxiety: Short Form STAI</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety measured using the short form State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Consists of six short statements (e.g. &quot;I feel calm&quot;, &quot;I am tense&quot;). For each statement, subject selects a response on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1=Not at all, to 4=Very much.</description>

    <measure>Perception of pain and anxiety: Qualitative questions</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative questions (3): 1. How would you describe this art therapy session? 2. What were some sensations you experienced in your body while you were engaged in the session? 3. Is there anything else you would like to say about what you are experiencing in your body and the art therapy session?</description>
