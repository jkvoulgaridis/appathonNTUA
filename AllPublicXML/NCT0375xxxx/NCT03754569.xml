  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the cytoreductive surgery carried out for the management of ovarian cancers
      is to obtain a complete macroscopic cytoreduction. This means that all visible peritoneal
      metastases must be resected. The peritoneum is the most frequent site of recurrence after
      initial management. There is no data on the existence, prevalence of microscopic peritoneal
      metastases. It nevertheless represents a therapeutic target (intraperitoneal chemotherapy).
      The main objective is the demonstration of microscopic peritoneal metastases in
      macroscopically healthy peritoneum after complete macroscopic cytoreductive surgery.

    <textblock>
      Understanding biology and progression mechanisms of peritoneal metastases (PM) of epithelial
      ovarian cancer (EOC) is a cornerstone in the knowledge and the comprehensive management of
      the disease, as PM will occur in the majority of patients. Indeed, the goal of cytoreductive
      surgery (CRS) in these patients is to completely remove all visible peritoneal invasion
      because the absence of residual disease after surgery is known to improve the prognosis.

      Despite clinical remission after the completion of complete surgery and platinum-based
      chemotherapy, 60% of patient develop peritoneal recurrence. This suggests that microscopic
      lesions may be present that are not eradicated by surgery, not controlled by systemic
      chemotherapy and that may be one of the mechanisms leading to peritoneal recurrence.
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis is responsible for the greatest morbidity and mortality in women
      with EOC.

      There are very few studies in the literature on microscopic peritoneal involvement in EOC,
      its detection and potential role in the progression of cancer. The peritoneum should be
      considered an organ in its own right and the surgeon must treat peritoneal metastases with
      the intent to cure. To follow the recommendations, this microscopic disease must be managed,
      because complete CRS is now a skill that can be mastered skill and its uses is a validated
      guideline. Moreover, &quot;complete CRS&quot; should be defined as &quot;without macroscopic residual
      disease&quot; thus highlighting the presence of microscopic disease.

      The goal of this study is to add scientific evidence for the existence of Microscopic
      Peritoneal Metastases (mPM) and to justify the need for additional diagnostic and therapeutic
      approaches.

    <measure>Identification of microscopic peritoneal metastases on pathological examination of peritoneal biopsies after complete macroscopic cytoreductive surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Random peritoneal biopsies in apparently healthy peritoneum, will be performed at the end of complete macroscopic cytoreductive surgery (CC-0) for epithelial ovarian cancer. If peritoneal metastases are identified on this sample, they will be the subject of a detailed morphological description.
Presence of microscopic peritoneal metastases will be measured (µm) using light microscope on HE slides from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues, by two different expert pathologists</description>

    <measure>Expression of folate receptor by microscopic peritoneal metastases and comparison with primary tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Expression of folate receptor will measured by immuno-histo-chemistry. The intensity of the expression will be evaluated using semiquantitative method.
Expression of folate receptor by microscopic peritoneal metastases will be assessed using immunohistochemistry with mouse monoclonal NCL-L-FRalpha antibody (Leica Biosystems). Expression will be quantified with a light microscope, using H-score according to the following formula : H-score = [1 × (% cells 1+) + 2 × (% cells 2+) + 3 × (% cells 3+)].</description>
