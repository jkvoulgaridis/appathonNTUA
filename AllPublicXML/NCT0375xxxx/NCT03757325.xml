    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of multiple oral doses of DNL747 in subjects with Alzheimer's disease when
      administered for 29 days in a cross-over design

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential and men, aged 55−85 years

          -  AD diagnosis based on the 2011 National Institute on Aging−Alzheimer's Association
             Guidelines

          -  Supportive evidence for diagnosis of AD based upon positive CSF Aβ42 test, or
             documented history of positive amyloid-specific PET scan

          -  Screening MMSE score of 16−26 points

          -  Screening CDR Global Score of 0.5−1.0

          -  Availability of a person (&quot;caregiver&quot;) who, in the investigator's judgment, has
             frequent and sufficient contact with the participant and is able to provide accurate
             information regarding the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, agrees to
             provide information at clinic visits that require input for scale completion, assists
             the participant with compliance for at-home study treatment administration, and signs
             the necessary consent form (note: the caregiver is not required to stay in the unit)

          -  Approved AD treatments (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ± memantine) and other
             prescription medications must be stable for ≥1 month prior to screening and
             anticipated to be stable over the duration of the study

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical history within 2 years of the screening visit or current evidence of any
             neurological or neurodegenerative disorder other than AD that is associated with
             transient or sustained alterations in cognition

          -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening (or within 1 year of screening visit)
             consistent with any neurological or neurodegenerative disorder other than AD that is
             associated with transient or sustained alterations in cognition
