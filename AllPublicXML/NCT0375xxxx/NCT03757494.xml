  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will look at how well a treatment called Cranial Electrotherapy
      Stimulation (CES) works for patients who struggle with symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder. Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation is delivered using a device called Alpha-Stim®.
      This is a safe, non-invasive treatment that applies a low-level pulsed electric current
      through the brain using clip-on electrodes attached to the earlobes. Cranial Electrotherapy
      Stimulation treats conditions such as physical pain, anxiety, and depression.

    <description>We will deem the treatment feasible if ≥ 6 participants complete the protocol, based on completion of ≥ 60% treatments (3 out of 5 treatment days, weekly at home), and attending and completing ≥ 75% of the weekly assessments, including the week 1 baseline and week 4 treatment completion visit</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability, we expect this treatment to be safe, based on the very few adverse events and no serious adverse events in the literature and relative safety when compared to current pharmacologic treatments (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs) for PTSD.</description>

    <description>Efficacy, while the study isn't powered for an efficacy trial, the initial screening to baseline pretreatment to post-treatment change in the magnitude of change in PTSD symptoms (as measured by the PCL-5) during Alpha-Stim® treatment using paired t-tests can be used to determine sample size and power calculations for future studies.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. To ensure participants can safely receive Alpha-Stim®, eligible participants must meet
             all established screening criteria for safety during Alpha-Stim® using a safety
             screener (as assessed during phone screen and medical records review). We are
             screening to access for metal. These are conservative measures require a patient not
             having the following (unless MRI-safe): Cardiac pacemaker, implanted device (deep
             brain stimulation) or metal in the brain, cervical spinal cord, or upper thoracic
             spinal cord. The patient would additionally be required to not have an implanted
             cardiac defibrillator;

          2. Outpatients 18-70 years of age (inclusive);

          3. Meet DSM-V criteria for PTSD (acute or chronic) at the time of the screening and/or
             baseline visit; symptoms.

          4. Have a baseline score of &quot;Moderately Ill&quot; or worse on the CGI-S;

          5. Be on a stable psychotropic regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to baseline, or no
             psychotropic medication at all (for at least 6 weeks prior to baseline), and be
             willing to maintain the current regimen and dosing for the duration of the study
             (unless medically necessary to make changes with notification of research staff);

        (7) If female and of child bearing potential, agree to use an acceptable method of birth
        control for the duration of the study treatment period; (8) Be willing and able to comply
        with all study related procedures and visits; (9) Be capable of independently reading and
        understanding patient information materials and giving written informed consent.

             10 minutes, or any lifetime history of loss of consciousness due to a head injury with
             documented evidence of brain injury (including brain atrophy);

          3. Current (or past if appropriate) significant neurological disorder, or lifetime

             moderate/severe substance use disorders (within the last month as assessed by review
             of the medical records and veteran self-report, excluding nicotine/caffeine). Veterans
             on stable (&gt;3 months), monitored opiate agonist therapy may be included at the
             investigator's discretion;

          6. Past failed treatment with rTMS or ECT; any past treatment with deep brain stimulation
             or vagus nerve stimulation;

             of childbearing capacity are eligible for the study. Contraceptive plans will be
             discussed and if they are determined to be inadequate, the participant will be
             excluded from the study.

         15. Presence of an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker device.

         16. Demonstrate the presence of any other condition or circumstance that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, has the potential to prevent study completion and/or to have a
