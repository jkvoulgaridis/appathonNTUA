  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium
      phosphate fluoride paste (CPP-ACPF) associated with low level laser therapy (LLLT) in the
      symptomatology and on the quality of life of the individuals with dentin hypersensitivity in
      a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Volunteers 18 to 50 years old with
      hypersensitive teeth were randomized into 4 groups: GPlacebo - positioning of the laser tip
      without light emission + placebo dentifrice; GCPPACPF - positioning of the laser tip without
      light emission + CPP-ACPF application; GLaser - laser tip positioning with light emission +
      placebo dentifrice; GLaserCPPACPF - positioning and light emission of the laser beam +
      CPP-ACPF.

      GLaser received the laser application using the infrared light spectrum with wavelength of
      808 nm with its active AsGaAl medium in two points of the vestibular face of the
      hypersensitive teeth. At each point it was applied 60 J / cm², for 16 seconds. Three laser's
      sessions were applied with a time interval of 24 hours between them. GLaserCPPACPF first
      received the CPPACPF application and then the laser application according to the
      manufacturer's recommendations. Before initiating laser therapy, the equipment was calibrated
      with a tester (MMOptics Ltda®, Brazil).

      The GCPPACPF volunteers were submitted to the application of the CPPACPF'S containing tooth
      paste MI Paste Plus™ (Recaldent™, GC América, USA) on the vestibular surfaces of
      hypersensitive teeth with the aid of a microbrush applicator (Microbrush, 3M ESPE, Brazil)
      for 05 minutes. Then, a rubber cup (Unid Microdont, Brazil) mounted on a low speed handpiece
      (500, Kavo, Germany) was used to scrub the desensitizing gel during 20 seconds on each tooth,
      according to the manufacturer's specifications. GPlacebo followed the same protocol used in
      GCPPACPF. In addition to the desensitizing treatments, all GCPPACPF and GPlacebo volunteers
      received the positioning of the laser tip to mimic the light emission produced in GLaser and
      GLaserCPPACPF. The noise emitted by the laser device was mimic through the sound reproduction
      of a smartphone application (HD Voice Recorder - iPhone 6s, Apple®, USA).
