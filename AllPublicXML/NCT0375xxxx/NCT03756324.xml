  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute mastitis affects the health and quality of life of the infants and mothers during the
      lactation. Increasing studies indicate that bacterial infections and/or dysbacteriosis are
      essential to the mechanisms of the disease. Thus, antibiotics is widely used in clinical
      practice, especially cephalosporin in China. However, mistaking antibiotic will affect the
      physical function, even mothers' breastfeeding. The previous clinical trial that the
      investigators had conducted in the Third affiliated hospital of Beijing University of Chinese
      Medicine, has demonstrated that Chinese herbal medicine can act better than Cefdinir in the
      fever-relief time and breast pain scores. Some studies the investigators searched in the
      databases have showed that Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial
      activity, and it can regulate dysbacteriosis. At the same time, Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci)
      can also promote the secretion of milk and maintain the patency of milk well. The main
      ingredient of Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) Granules is Pugongying herbs (Herba Taraxaci).
      Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) Granules is approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)
      to treat acute mastitis. Although Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) Granules is widely used in
      clinical practice, there is no trial to test the efficacy of Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) for
      women with acute mastitis. Therefore, the investigators set three groups with Pugongying
      (Herba Taraxaci) Granules alone, Cefdinir alone and combination of Pugongying (Herba
      Taraxaci) Granules and Cefdinir.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of fever-relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from the beginning to the end of the treatment, every 4 hours for 3 days, total 19 times including the baseline measured, specifically on 2:00 am, 6:00 am, 10:00 am, 14:00 pm, 18:00 pm, 22:00 pm.</time_frame>
    <description>Body temperature will be measured by mercury thermometer and recorded on the prepared card by participants. The temperature of the participants reduces to 37.2â„ƒ or more below, assessing as the normal temperature. And the normal temperature last for at least 24 hours, considered as fever-relief.
To evaluate the effect of drug action time and the temperature changing from the baseline to the end of 3-day treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the sores of breast pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from the beginning to the end of the treatment, every 8 hours for 3 days, total 10 times including the baseline measured, specifically measured on 6:00 am, 14:00 pm, 22:00 pm.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain of breast will be self-reported by participants and recorded. A visual analog scale (VAS) is used to assess breast pain. The scale was tested in the investigator's previous trial. 0 score indicates &quot;no uncomfortable feeling&quot;. 1-3 indicates &quot;mild uncomfortable feeling&quot;. 4-6 indicates &quot;moderate uncomfortable feeling&quot;. 7-10 indicates &quot;severe uncomfortable feeling&quot;.
To evaluate the changing from the baseline to the end of 3-day treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the area of the breast masses</measure>
    <time_frame>The masses will be measured from the beginning to the end of the treatment, once a day for 3 days, and recorded with a camera, total 4 times including the baseline measured.</time_frame>
    <description>The masses are manual outlined by the outcome assessor.

    <measure>The patency of milk</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome will be measured from the beginning to the end of the treatment, once a day for 3 days, total 4 times including the baseline measured.</time_frame>
    <description>The 0-3 scores are used to describe the patency of milk from no stagnation to severe stagnation. 0 indicates that there is no stagnation with breast and milk spurts out by slightly pressure; 1 indicates mild stagnation and milk flows by more pressure; 2 indicates moderate stagnation and milk drops out by much more pressure; 3 indicates there is severe stagnation and no milk excreted. The outcome will be measured by the outcome assessor.
