  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, open-label, rater-blinded prospective Phase II study
      which will assess the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine (IB1001) for the treatment of
      GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff Disease).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of N-Acetyl-L-Leucine
      (IB1001) in the treatment of GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff Disease),
      investigating the efficacy in terms of improving symptoms, functioning, and quality of life
      against the defined endpoints in patients with GM2 Gangliosidosis.

      Patients will be assessed during three study phases: a baseline period, a 6-week treatment
      period, and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. If within 6 weeks prior to the initial
      screening visit, a patient has received any of the prohibited medications defined in the
      eligibility criteria (irrespective of the preceding treatment duration) a wash-out study-run
      in of 6 weeks is required prior to the first baseline assessment.

      All patients will receive the study drug during this study.

      For each individual patient, the study lasts for approximately 3.5 - 4 months during which
      there are 6 study visits to the study site.

    <description>The primary evaluation of the CI-CS will be performed by two independent neurologists whose assessments will be based on videos of the anchor test taken at each visit. These raters will be blinded to the treatment phases and the chronological order of the videos to reduce detection and performance bias.
The CI-CS assessment will instruct the blinded rater to consider: 'compared to the first video, how has the severity of their performance on the 9HPT-D or 8MWT changed (improved or worsened) in 6-weeks as observed in the second video?'
The CI-CS is evaluated on a 7 point Likert scale (+3=significantly improved to -3= significantly worse).</description>

    <description>The SCAFI scale is a validated ataxia rating scale and is an objective measure of ataxia and physical functioning which consists of three sub-scales: the 8 Meter Walk Test (8MWT), the 9-hole peg test with both dominant and non-dominant hands (9HPT-D; 9HPT-ND) and the &quot;PATA&quot; test to measure speech performance.
For the 8MWT and 9HPT tests, a lower score/time indicates a clinical improvement. A higher &quot;PATA&quot; test score indicates improvement in speech performance.
The SCAFI total score, and three subscales (8MWT, 9HPT-D, and PATA) are reported for statistical analysis.</description>

    <description>The SARA scale is an eight-item clinical rating scale (gait, stance, sitting, speech, fine motor function and taxis) with a total score range of 0-40, where 0 is the best neurological status and 40 the worst.
SARA is a reliable and validated clinical scale with a high internal consistency that measures the severity and progression of ataxia.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status consists of two parts: a multiple-choice questionnaire (descriptive system) and a visual analogue scale.
The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.</description>

    <description>The mDRS is used evaluate the overall neurological status. The scale assesses six domains (ambulation, manipulation, language, swallowing, seizures and ocular movements) and can be used to evaluate the severity of disease, monitor disease progression, and assess the effect of both symptomatic and long-term treatments.
The mDRS scale is calculated as a composite score, with a lower score indicating an improved clinical status.</description>
