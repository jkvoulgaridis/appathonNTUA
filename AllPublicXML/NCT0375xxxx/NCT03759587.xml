      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib in Japanese
      participants with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or
      primary peritoneal cancer who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the
      last chemotherapy containing platinum-based anticancer agents.

      The drug being tested in this study is called niraparib. Niraparib is being tested to treat
      people who have platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or
      primary peritoneal cancer. This study will look at the safety and efficacy of niraparib in
      Japanese participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 15 participants. Participants will be enrolled to one
      group and after that will be asked to take niraparib capsules at the same time each day
      throughout the study:

      - Niraparib 300 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 28 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the
      treatment period, and the post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the
      last dose of the study drug.

             Note: The last platinum regimen did not necessarily have to immediately follow the
             next-to-last (penultimate) platinum regimen. For example, if a participant received a
             non-platinum regimen between the penultimate platinum regimen and last platinum
             regimen, she could have been eligible as long as she met all entry criteria.

                  participants must have had platinum-sensitive disease after this treatment,
                  defined as achieving a response (CR or PR) and disease progression &gt;6 months
                  after completion of her last dose of platinum therapy (documented 6 to 12 months
                  or &gt;12 months). Source documentation was required.

                    -  Following the last regimen, participants must have had either: CA-125 in the
                       normal range, OR; CA-125 decrease by more than 90% during the last platinum
                       regimen, and which was stable for at least 7 days (ie, no increase &gt;15%).

                    -  Following the last regimen, participants could not have had any measurable
                       lesion &gt;2 cm at the time of study enrollment.

                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], condoms only, withdrawal,
                  spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of

             Participants with spinal cord compression might have been considered if they had
             received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for
             28 days.

          5. Participants who have known hypersensitivity to the components of niraparib.

             leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the
             study, interfere with the participant's participation throughout the study period, or
             study participation is not in the best interest of the participant.

         14. Participants who are regular user (including &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

          <description>Neutropenia is defined as low level of neutrophils i.e. white blood cells in participants. Neutropenia was graded as per the NCI-CTCAE. As per the NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to Adverse Events (AE). Only categories with participants is reported.</description>

        <description>PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by the Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the SoD (Sum of Diameters) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>
