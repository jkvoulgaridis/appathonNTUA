      SYNOSTE Nitinail System Trial is an international multicenter open label single-arm
      equivalence study to verify whether the leg-lengthening procedure can be adequately
      controlled with the SNS system as measured with the lengthening control index (LCI) at the
      end of the distraction period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SYNOSTE Nitinail System (SNS) is an assembly of an active implantable distraction nail
      (SYNOSTE Nitinail), Locking screws, accessory instruments for surgery and the home care unit
      (also External control unit (ECU) or Halo). It includes also, a software tool, Syndex, that
      supports setting up the number of lengthening activations needed per day.

      The SNS is intended for lengthening of the femur by distraction osteogenesis.

      The study will consist of a recruitment period of 3 months and an observation period of
      roughly 24 months (6 months after explantation). The observation period is split in two
      parts: The first part contains the most critical treatment phases from implantation surgery
      of the device through the actual lengthening phase up to the end of the bone healing. The
      second part contains only two visits: the explantation surgery of the device and a control at
      6 months of further follow-up.

      After the fist part of the trial, a primary analysis of the data including the hypothesis
      testing will be carried out. After the second part of the trial a follow-up analysis will be
      done.

      16 (max 20) patients will be recruited in Finland and Turkey.

    <description>The primary objective is to verify whether the leg-lengthening procedure can be adequately controlled with the SNS system as measured with the lengthening control index (LCI) at the end of the distraction period defined as LCI = DIachieved / DIscheduled
,where DIachieved = Achieved distraction index, ie. the daily rate of distraction has on average occurred during the lengthening phase in mm/d. DIscheduled = mean scheduled lengthening rate in mm/day.

Single item scores as well as health concept scale scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score defines a more favorable health state, with a value of 100 representing full health.</description>
