  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) is the most
      common complication with high costs, significant morbidity and even mortality. The major
      mechanisms of PEP is the papillary edema which is caused by manipulations during cannulation
      or endoscopic treatment. The papillary edema may cause temporary outflow obstruction of
      pancreatic juice, and then increase ductal pressure, resulting in the occurrence of
      pancreatitis. Nitroglycerin can reduce the Oddis sphincter tension, the internal pressure of
      the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct. Therefore, it is widely used in clinical to
      prevent and treat pancreatitis. Many studies found nitroglycerin might be effective in
      preventing PEP. And topical application of epinephrine on the papilla may reduce papillary
      edema by decreasing capillary permeability or by relaxing the sphincter of Oddi. There are
      reports that epinephrine sprayed on the papilla may be effective to prevent PEP.

      The investigators therefore designed a prospective randomized trial to determine whether
      routine using papillary epinephrine spraying in patients received octreotide can reduce
      post-ERCP pancreatitis.
