      The purpose of this research project is to develop a vision surveillance system, in order of
      understanding the vision health status of children and adolescents in Taiwan. It can serve as
      a basis for the government to establish a nationwide vision surveillance system, invest
      research resources, and make national policies.

      This research project also classified the urbanization of sampling school as high, medium and
      low based on the location of school.This research project explored and analyzed the health
      status of myopic schoolchildren and associated factors such as families, genetics, school
      environment, living environment and behaviors among north, south, west and east regions of
      Taiwan.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Axial length</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The axial length is the distance between the anterior surface of the cornea and the fovea and is the primary determinant of non-syndromic myopia. In this research project, investigators measure the axial length in children and adolescents by A-scan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraocular pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure is the pressure created by the continual renewal of fluids within the eye. In this research project, investigators measure the intraocular pressure in children and adolescents by Icare Tonometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal thickness is an important factor in accurately diagnosing eye pressure. In this report project, investigators measure the corneal thickness in children and adolescents by A-scan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fundus examination</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The fundus is the portion of the inner eye that can be seen during an eye examination by looking through the pupil. In this research project, investigators perform the fundus examination in children and adolescents by ophthalmoscope.</description>
