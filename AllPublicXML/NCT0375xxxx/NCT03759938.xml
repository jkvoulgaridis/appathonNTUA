  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OPTIMAS is a large, prospective, partially blinded randomised controlled trial of early
      (within ≤4 days [96hrs]) or standard (between day 7 and day 14 after stroke onset) initiation
      of anticoagulation after stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), using any licensed
      dose of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). The trial will use a non-inferiority gatekeeper
      approach to test for non-inferiority of early anticoagulation followed by a test for
      superiority, if non-inferiority is established.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on the timing of OAC after acute
      AF-related stroke. Current United Kingdom (UK) guidelines for anticoagulation state that
      &quot;delay for an arbitrary 2-week period is recommended&quot; for &quot;disabling&quot; stroke and that
      anticoagulation can be started &quot;no later than 14 days&quot; for other strokes, at the prescriber's
      discretion.

      OPTIMAS will investigate whether early initiation of DOAC treatment, within 4 days (96hrs) of
      onset, in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and AF is as effective as, or better than,
      standard initiation of DOAC treatment, no sooner than day 7 (&gt;144hrs) and no later than day
      14 (&lt;336hrs) after onset, in preventing recurrent ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and
      symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH)? Participants will be randomised 1:1 to the
      intervention or control. The exact timing of initiating treatment within each group is at the
      discretion of the treating clinician.

Participants and their physicians will not be blinded to study arm allocation.The exact timing of anticoagulation within the period specified for the allocated study arm is at the discretion of the treating physician, as is the choice of DOAC. Apart from the timing of DOAC initiation, the DOAC should be prescribed in accordance with usual clinical practice</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The Event Adjudication Committee is a study group (of at least three members) responsible for the review of clinical events to ensure consistent, standardized, objective and unbiased results throughout all participating sites and minimise the likelihood of discrepant interpretations.
This group consists of a panel of experts who have the relevant therapeutic area expertise, are experienced in clinical trials, and have been trained on the specific study protocol.
The Event Adjudication Committee will centrally review events reported using all available clinical and imaging data and evaluate efficacy and/ or safety endpoints in a blinded and unbiased manner on a regular basis to ensure accurate, consistent and standardized assessments of important study events such as recurrent symptomatic ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and death.</masking_description>

The scale consists of 7 category descriptions, where 0 means no symptoms, 1 means no significant disability, 2 means slight disability, 3 means moderate disability, 4 means moderately severe disability, 5 means severe disability and 6 means death. The assessment is carried out by asking the participant or their carer about their activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a questionnaire widely used as a screening assessment for detecting cognitive impairment. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. An abbreviated version of the MoCA assessing attention, verbal learning, memory, executive functions/language and orientation can be performed over the phone. MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. A score of 26 or over is considered to be normal. In a study and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) scored an average of 22.1.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. In instances in which the participant struggles with giving answers on their own, the participant's next-of-kin or a friend who knows the participant well will be asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L proxy version. The proxy is asked to rate how they think the participant would rate their own health-related quality of life, if the participant were able to communicate it. In case a proxy is not available, the research team member who was looking after the participant will complete it on their behalf.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS Global-10 short form consists of 10 items that assess general domains of health and functioning including overall physical health, mental health, social health, pain, fatigue, and overall perceived quality of life. The scoring system of the PROMIS Global-10 allows each of the individual items to be examined separately to provide specific information about perceptions of physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, social health and general perceptions of health where 0 means never experienced this problem or symptoms and 1 means always. The higher score for each response indicate better health.</description>

               3. Other coagulopathy or bleeding tendency (based on clinical history or laboratory

               1. Known presence of haemorrhagic transformation with parenchymal haematoma
                  occupying &gt;30% of the infarct volume and exerting significant mass effect (i.e.

               2. Presence of clinically significant intracranial haemorrhage unrelated to
                  qualifying infarct

               3. Any other contraindication to early anticoagulation as judged by the treating
                  clinician

          3. Contraindication to use of DOAC:

                    -  HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir)

                    -  Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine,
                       phenobarbital or St. John's Wort)

                    -  Dronedarone

          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          5. Presence on acute brain imaging of non-stroke pathology judged likely to explain
             clinical presentation (e.g. mass lesion, encephalitis)

          6. Inability for patient to be followed up within 90 days of trial entry

          7. Patient or representative refusal to consent to study procedures, including the site
             informing GP and healthcare professional responsible for anticoagulation care of
             participants

          8. Any other reason that the PI considers would make the patient unsuitable to enter
             OPTIMAS.

        Note that current DOAC treatment is NOT an exclusion criterion, as long as the treating
        physician considers it appropriate to restart (or continue) according to the timings
        specified in the OPTIMAS trial protocol. Continuation of the DOAC would be recorded as a
        start time of zero hours.
