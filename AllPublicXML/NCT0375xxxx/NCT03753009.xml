  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare 3 year iontophoretic transepithelial corneal cross-linking (I-ON CXL) outcomes
      with epithelium-off collagen cross-linking (epi-off CXL)in pediatric patients.

      Forty eyes of 28 consecutive pediatric patients (mean age 14.3±2.5 [SD] years; range, 9 to 18
      years) with keratoconus were enrolled in the study. Twenty eyes of 15 patients underwent I-ON
      CXL, while 20 eyes of 13 patients underwent epi-off CXL. Corrected distance visual acuity
      (CDVA), spherical equivalent, maximum keratometry (Kmax), posterior elevation of the thinnest
      point and thickness of the thinnest point mean values were evaluated. A Student t test was
      used to compare baseline and 12, 24, and 36 month postoperative data. Keratoconus progression
      in function of preoperative Kmax value and cone location was evaluated at 36 months.

    <description>Epithelium-off CXL was performed according to the Siena (Dresden modified) protocol: 2% pilocarpine was instilled 30 minutes before treatment, the epithelium was removed using a blunt knife. An isotonic solution of riboflavin 0.1% and dextran 20% was instilled for 10 minutes of corneal soaking before starting UV-A irradiation. The solution was administered every 3 minutes for a total of 30 minutes of UV-A exposure at 3mW/cm2.
The iontophoresis device was filled with a hypoosmolar riboflavin 0.1% dextran-free solution enriched with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and trometamol. The device was then connected to a constant current generator initially set at 0.5 mA and increased to 1.0 mA to find out the individual tolerance. Iontophoresis was then performed for 5 minutes. The corneal device was then removed before performing UVA irradiation. During the irradiation phase (10 mW/cm2 for 9 minutes), good fluorescence was clearly detectable. The total treatment time was 14 minutes.</description>
