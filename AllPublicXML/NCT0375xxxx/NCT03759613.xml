  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients with unilateral burn injury, and 60 healthy subjects will be included in this
      study. Participants with burn injury will evaluate with the following assessment tools:
      Demographic data; age, gender, height, body mass index; burn characteristics; type of burn
      injury, degree of burn injury, localization of burn injury and total burn surface area will
      be recorded. Gait parameters (step length, stride length, base support, step time, cycle
      time, cadence, velocity, single support, double support, swing ( % of gait cycle) and stance
      (% of gait cycle). will be recorded via computerized system. And gait symmetry will be
      calculated via formule. Participants' kinesiophobia level will be evaluated with Tampa
      kinesiophobia scale. Their pain will be assessed by visual analog scale. Their arm swing will
      be evaluated by a scale.

      Thirty individuals with lower extremity burn injury and sixty healthy subjects will be
      included in this study. Participants with burn injury will be included if they are aged of
      18-50, able to walk independently at least 10 meters. Healthy subjects will be included if
      there are no orthopedic, neurological or musculoskeletal disorders that affect gait.

        1. Group: 30 Patients with burn injury

        2. Group: 30 healthy subjects (When evaluating the gait analysis, their arm will not be
           restricted (Their natural walking)

        3. Group : 30 healthy subject (When evaluating the gait analysis, their arm will be
           restricted )

      Participants will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic data; age,
      gender, height, body mass index; burn characteristics; type of burn injury, degree of burn
      injury, localization of burn injury and total burn surface area will be recorded.

      All subjects' gait analysis will be conducted via GAITRite (computerized) system.

      GAITRite system for gait parameters (step length, stride length, base support, step time,
      cycle time, cadence, velocity, single support, double support, swing ( % of gait cycle) and
      stance (% of gait cycle), Tampa Kinesiophobia scale for kinesiophobia level, visual analog
      scale for pain, a scale that developed by us for arm swing will be used.

      These evaluations will be applied one time for participants. These evaluations will be made
      within 5 days following burn injury.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>step length</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 5 months</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Swing phase</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by computerized gait analysis system. Swing Phase,which accounts for 40% of a single gait cycle, the phase during which the foot is not in contact with the ground. It is expressed in seconds (sec) and as a percentage of the gait cycle of the same foot. It is calculated both right and left foot.</description>
