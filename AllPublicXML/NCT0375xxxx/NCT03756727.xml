    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications(PPCs) including, but not limited to ,hypoxemia,
      pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS),atelectasis,pleural effusion .PPCs may result in increased resources utilization,
      delayed mobilization, prolonged need of supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation,and a
      longer hospital stay.postoperative pulmonary complications are common after cardiac surgery,
      often increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality.The extracorporeal
      circulation,increased oxygen concentration inhaled and the development of massive atelectasis
      after open-chest surgery commonly activate lung inflammation, amplifying the harm Injury of
      pulmonary .Currently, plenty of interventions have been studied to prevent PPCs after
      surgery. Most of the recent research has focused on physical therapy such as lung-protective
      modes during intraoperative mechanical ventilation, Alveolar Recruitment, and respiratory
      muscle training.These therapies have a certain effect, but still not satisfactory.Ascorbic
      acid is an important cofactor in multiple enzymatic reactions where its main function is as a
      reducing agent.Studies have shown that ascorbic acid can reduce both ischemia-reperfusion
      injury and oxidative stress. Unfortunately, no studies examined whether Ascorbic acid can
      reduce PPCs.

      The possible mechanisms of ascorbic acid to alleviate ischemia-reperfusion injury are as
      follows: 1 Ascorbic acid as a first-line antioxidant in plasma can reduce stress by
      eliminating excess Reactive oxygen species and reduce damage. 2 provides rapid electron
      transfer to react with superoxide and hydroxyl group to scavenge reactive oxygen released
      into the circulation. 3 Ascorbic acid can reduce lipid peroxidation and reduce lung injury
      caused by ischemia-reperfusion by scavenging oxygen free radicals. 4 Vitamin C can promote
      the production of cytokines by immune cells to reduce local inflammatory reactions and
      improve tissue microcirculation.The study aims to explore whether daily used Ascorbic acid in
      the perioperative period has a preventive effect on PPCs in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery, and through short-term and long-term follow-up, to investigate the effect on
      post-hospitalization Prognosis .
