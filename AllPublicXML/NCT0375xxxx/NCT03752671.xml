  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IntraSPINE® is a novel device that, unlike interspinous positioned implants, is unique in
      being placed more anteriorly in an interlaminar position, closer to the normal center of
      rotation of the motion segment. Mechanical advantages are thus conferred over more
      posteriorly positioned devices through the possibility of more physiological 'rocking' type
      movements in flexion and extension . This enables IntraSPINE® to off-load the facet joints in
      extension without blocking movement. Having a more anteriorly placed fulcrum also helps
      control excessive flexion movements by virtue of an improved lever arm in conjunction with an
      intact posterior tension band.

      The underlying hypothesis of this work is that a clinical gain is achieved by adding an
      IntraSPINE® interlaminar device to discectomy in patients suffering from a lumbar disc
      herniation. This should result in an improvement in incapacity level and a reduction in pain.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to 12 months of the degree of functional disability associated with lumbar pain will be measured using the Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry questionnaire provides an assessment of the symptoms and severity of the back pain and repercussions on activities of daily living. The questionnaire contains 10 questions concerning: pain, personal care, carrying loads, walking, seated position, standing position, sleep, sex life, social life and travel. Each question offers six answers with a score of 0 to 6 which the patient must select: a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 6 represents greatly reduced function.
The score obtained is multiplied by 2 in order to obtain a percentage handicap, with 0% for no handicap and 100% for the greatest handicap. It takes approximately 5 minutes to complete the test.</description>

    <description>The surgical technique for excision of the disc hernia is the surgeon's usual technique: patient positioning (lying on his/her back or front or in the knee to chest position) the approach to the lumbar disc hernia (interlaminar or interspinous), closure and drainage of the operation site are performed by the surgeon's usual practice.
IntraSPINE® is positioned once surgery for the disc hernia has been performed. The implant bed is prepared with the assistance of the distractor provided. The choice of implant size is made after positioning the trial device corresponding to the anatomical bed. Once the size has been established the corresponding implant is placed in a cup of physiological saline prior to implantation. Implantation is performed using the appropriate implant holder.</description>
