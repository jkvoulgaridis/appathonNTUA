  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain accounts for 16% of all musculoskeletal complaints in the healthy adult
      population. Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most common cause of shoulder pain.
      Many patients with chronic pain from subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) will fail
      treatment efforts and have longstanding pain. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a
      novel approach to treatment, percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation, for participants with
      chronic shoulder pain due to subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical and socioeconomic impact of subacute and chronic shoulder pain is high, resulting
      in 12 million visits to physicians and over $7 billion in direct costs in the United States.
      The most common cause is subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS), which accounts for 30% of
      all shoulder pain. Approximately 35% of patients who present with subacromial impingement
      syndrome (SIS) are refractory to conservative management. For patients who have failed
      conservative management, there are no established treatments to reduce the pain. The
      long-term goal is to develop a therapeutic intervention to reduce pain related to subacromial
      impingement syndrome(SIS). A pilot trial of 3-week percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation
      (PNS) for participants with chronic shoulder pain due to subacromial impingement syndrome
      (SIS) that was refractory to conservative treatment that showed 60% of participants had
      successful treatment of pain that lasted at least 3 months. Thus, the primary objective of
      this 2 site randomized control trial (RCT) is to confirm the findings of this preliminary
      trial and determine the efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) for chronic
      subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). The secondary objectives of this multisite randomized
      control trial (RCT) is to explore mechanisms of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) for the
      treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS), and to determine which characteristics
      can predict successful treatment with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). In order to
      accomplish these objectives, this trial is a multi-site, placebo controlled, double-blinded
      randomized control trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)
      to sham peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). Measures of pain, pain interference with
      activities of daily living (ADLs), capacity for activities of daily living (ADLs), Quality of
      life (QoL), and measures of central sensitization (pain thresholds, secondary hyperalgesia,
      and temporal summation) will be measured. Participants will be followed for a total of 24
      weeks after treatment has concluded.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)has excellent psychometrics. The developers of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) recommend Brief Pain Inventory (BPI )3, the &quot;pain worst&quot; rating, as the primary response metric. The question asks participants to rate their worst pain in the prior 24-hours OR prior 7-day on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), where &quot;0&quot; indicates &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; indicates &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot;</description>

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. The question asks participants to rate their pain in the prior 24-hours OR prior 7-day on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), where &quot;0&quot; indicates &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; indicates &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; .&quot; In addition, the question asks the participant to rate how their pain interferes with daily activities where &quot;0&quot; indicates &quot;does not interfere and &quot;10&quot; indicates &quot;completely interferes&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Functional Impairment Test-Hand and Neck/Shoulder/Arm (FIT-HaNSA) is a laboratory based objective measure of ADL capacity. The Functional Impairment Test-Hand and Neck/Shoulder/Arm (FIT-HaNSA) is a timed test that provides a brief measure of functional ability of the upper limb while performing multi-level tasks that require grip/manipulation of the hand, elbow/shoulder reaching, sustained overhead work, and sustained positioning with an emphasis on assessing the limitations in functional capacity attributable to shoulder and neck disorders</description>

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use.The question asks severity of pain based on an 0-10 numerical Rating Scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain imaginable. In addition, it asks how much difficulty the participant has on a numerical rating scale where 0 = no difficulty and 10 = so difficult it requires help. Total disability score: _____/ 80 x 100 = % Total SPADI score: _____ 130 x 100 = % Minimum Detectable Change (90% confidence) = 13 points (Change less than this may be attributable to measurement error). lower score is better.</description>

    <description>Quality of life - Short form - 12 (QoL - SF 12) is a health related Quality of life (QoL) measure that assesses physical functioning, role limitation because of physical health problems, bodily pain, social functioning, general mental health, role.
Scoring: Two summary scores are a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. Lower score is better.</description>

    <description>The stimulation system includes an external stimulator, percutaneous lead and pad. The stimulator snaps onto the pad. The pad has an embedded power source but also serves as the anode. The 1-channel stimulator outputs a biphasic current waveform with current pulse parameter ranges suitable for Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS). The percutaneous lead is inserted using an introducer (like a hypodermic needle) which is withdrawn and the lead is retained in the muscle by a barb at its tip. After a 1-week stabilization period, stimulation is initiated (6 hrs/day). The duty cycle and daily dose remain constant, but stimulus parameters may be adjusted by the research staff as deemed appropriate. The treatment period is 3 weeks after which the lead will be removed.</description>

    <description>All participants receive eight 1.0 hr. sessions of physical therapy (PT) over a 4-wk period from a therapist blinded to Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) treatment assignment. Each participant also performs home exercises. The primary objective of physical therapy (PT) and the home exercise program is to prevent re-injury by educating and training participants in the biomechanics and proper use of the shoulder and upper limb. During each in-lab session, participants are trained in the implementation of these exercises, which are individually adjusted and progressed with increasing external loads by using weights and elastic rubber bands.</description>
