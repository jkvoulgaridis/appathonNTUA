        Case Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent has been provided.

          -  Contact Order Form has been provided.

          -  Aged 18 years or older.

          -  Hospitalized within 48 hours of onset of symptoms.

          -  Diagnosis of STEMI, NSTEMI or UA using the following definitions:

             1.Criteria for STEMI diagnosis:

               1. History of chest pain/discomfort and

               2. Persistent ST-segment elevation (&gt; 30 min) of ≥ 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous
                  ECG leads or presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on admission and

               3. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, troponins): at least one value above the
                  99th percentile of the local laboratory upper reference limit.

             2.Criteria for NSTEMI diagnosis:

             1.History of chest pain/discomfort and 2.Lack of persistent ST-segment elevation, LBBB
             or intraventricular conduction disturbances and 3.Elevation of cardiac biomarkers
             (CK-MB, troponins): at least one value above the 99th percentile of the local
             laboratory upper reference limit. 3.Criteria for Unstable Angina diagnosis:

               1. Symptoms of angina at rest or on minimal exercise and

               2. At least 0.5mm ST deviation in at least 2 leads and

               3. No increase in biomarkers of necrosis

               4. OR objective evidence of ischaemia by non-invasive imaging OR significant
                  coronary stenosis as determined by the treating physician at angiography if this
                  is standard practice in study site.

                  Case Exclusion Criteria:

                  Patients will not be eligible to participate if any of the following exclusion
                  criteria are present:

          -  UA, STEMI and NSTEMI precipitated by or as a complication of surgery, trauma, or GI
             bleeding or post-PCI.

          -  UA, STEMI and NSTEMI occurring in patients already hospitalized for other reasons.

          -  Presence of any condition/circumstance which in the opinion of the investigator could
             significantly limit the complete follow up of the patient (e.g. tourist, non-native
             speaker or does not understand the local language, psychiatric disturbances).

          -  Presence of serious/severe co-morbidities in the opinion of the investigator which may
             limit short term (i.e. 6 month) life expectancy.

          -  Current participation in a randomised interventional clinical trial.

        Control Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age and gender are matched with cases.

          -  No Coronary Artery Disease was detected by Coronary CT examination.

          -  Normal biochemical indicators.
