    <textblock>
      In this study study two different groups of medicine users are recruited. Both groups have 50
      patients each. In the first study the participants are using oral medication for diabetes and
      in the second study the participants use new direct oral anticoagulants.

      Participants use medicine reminder system consisting of an electronic device and an smart
      phone application. In the beginning of the study the reminder system is collecting data on
      how the patients are taking their medication for the first two months. Smart phone
      application is not providing any reminders and participants can't access the app to see the
      details.

      After two months the application will be unlocked so that it starts reminding the users to
      take their medication at the right time. in this phase the patients can view their medication
      data from the application. The reminder phase of the study lasts for two months. After these
      two plus two months, the results are analyzed and published.

      The study continues after these four months for the next four months and after that, the long
      term results are analyzed.'

      The primary outcome is the possible change in the adherence between control and active
      period.
