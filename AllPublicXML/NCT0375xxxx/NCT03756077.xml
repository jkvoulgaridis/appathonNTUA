  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the latest data from the China National Cancer Center, prostate cancer has
      become the most common tumor in the urinary system since 2008. However, conventional imaging
      techniques including transrectal ultrasound , computed tomography and bone scintigraphy are
      not sensitive or specific. About 40% of resectable lesions cannot be detected by these
      techniques. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and
      staging of prostate cancer. Recently, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a new
      novel positron tracer has shown to be effective to detect primary lesions, recurrent and
      metastatic lesions of prostate cancer. In this prospective study, the investigators will use
      the most advanced imaging equipments, integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with prostate
      cancer-specific imaging agent 68Ga-PSMA and conventional imaging agent
      [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose to image patients with or suspected of prostate cancer, the aim is
      to explore the value of hybrid PET/MR and PET/CT in prostate cancer.

      prostate cancer, the investigators aim to evaluate the roles of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT
      in differential diagnosis, detecting primary and metastatic lesions, guilding biopsy, staging
      and determining treatment plan prior to treatment; for the patients with a history of
      prostate cancer, the aim is to evaluate the value of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT for
      treatment response assessment, detection of recurrences and metastatic lesions.
