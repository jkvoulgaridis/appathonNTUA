  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with suspected cervical spine injury, cervical immobilization, such as manual
      in-line stabilization or cervical collar has been adopted to prevent further neurologic
      injury due to cervical motion. In these patients, tracheal intubation with direct
      laryngoscopy is often challenging due to limited mouth opening, neck flexion, and head
      extension. In this situation, videolaryngoscope and fiberoptic bronchoscope have been used
      for tracheal intubation in such patients. We compared the initial success rate of tracheal
      intubation and intubation time between the videolaryngoscope and fiberoptic bronchoscope.
