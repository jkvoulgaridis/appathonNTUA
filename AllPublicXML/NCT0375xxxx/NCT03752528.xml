  <brief_summary>

      To characterise the long-term plasma exposure to buprenorphine after stopping SUBLOCADE
      treatment. There are no interventions planned.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data indicate that after discontinuing SUBLOCADE patients may have detectable concentrations
      of buprenorphine in plasma and urine for 12 months or longer. Previous Phase II/III studies
      did not evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of buprenorphine beyond 2 months after the last
      injection; this study will characterize the long-term plasma exposure starting at least 12
      months after the last injection. The study will also assess relationships between plasma drug
      concentrations, free drug concentrations in urine and urine drug screen (UDS) results in
      order to provide refined guidance to patients and physicians with respect to long-term
      exposure to buprenorphine after stopping SUBLOCADE treatment.
