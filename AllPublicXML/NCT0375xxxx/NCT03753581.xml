  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect on the healing of pressure ulcers in
      elderly people using a care protocol plus the application of microcurrent patches during 12
      hours per day compared to the effect of the same protocol plus placebo electric stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study is a multicentric, parallel, randomised, triple blind clinical trial
      with placebo control.

      The size of the sample will be 30 participants older than 60 years old who are
      institutionalized in some nursing homes in Spain.They will be randomized in two groups:
      control or experimental.

      The variables of the study will be collected at three time points: before the intervention,
      14 days after the start of the intervention and at the end of the intervention.

      The statistical analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis. For the main outcomes
      variables a two-factor ANOVA will-be performed (intervention-time) with a post-hoc analysis
      with Bonferroni correction

    <masking_description>Masking of the researchers: the assignment of participants to the groups will be carried out by a researcher who will not apply the interventions and will not collect the outcome variables. The interventions will be carried out by researchers different from those who will perform the evaluations of the outcome variables.
Masking of the participants: it will be done using the same electrodes and microcurrent devices in both groups. In the placebo stimulation, the device will emit a luminous signal of operation as well as the devices of the intervention group, however, it will be manipulated and tested with an oscilloscope to ensure that it does not emit microcurrents. The participants of both groups will not perceive any sensation of current, since the electrical stimulation with microcurrents is below the sensitive threshold.</masking_description>

    <measure>Ulcer healing 1 day before the intervention start</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before the start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated with the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH). It was developed by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) to monitor the change in the status of pressure ulcers over time.
The ulcer is categorized according to the surface area, exudate and type of wound tissue. A partial score is recorded for each of these ulcer characteristics:
Surface area (in cm2): 10 points (0 points=0 cm2; 10 points= &gt;24 cm2)
Exudate amount: 3 points (0 points= none; 3 points=heavy).
Tissue type: 4 points (0 points= closed; 4 points= necrotic tissue).
To obtain the total score, the sub-scores are added. The minimum score is 0, which means that the ulcer is healed and the maximum score is 17, which means that the ulcer surface is greater than 24 cm2, that there is a heavy exudate and necrotic tissue.
A comparison of total scores measured over time provides an indication of the improvement or deterioration in pressure ulcer healing.</description>
