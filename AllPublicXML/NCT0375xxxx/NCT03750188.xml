      Safety and Efficacy Study in pediatric subjects &lt;2 years of age who have undergone Brain or
      Spine MRI pre and post 0.1 mmol/kg ProHance administration. Imaging conditions will represent
      those in routine clinical practice. Retrospective enrolment with a prospective blinded read.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively enroll children younger than 2 years of age
      who have undergone brain or spine MRI with 0.1 mmol/kg PROHANCE and to gather safety data as
      well as to collect MR images for a prospective blinded read to evaluate the efficacy of
      PROHANCE in terms of visualization and enhancing properties.

      The study will be conducted in 4-8 sites in the United States and Europe. It is estimated
      that 120 patients will be enrolled to provide 108 evaluable patients.

      Three radiologists unaffiliated with enrolling centers (blinded readers), blinded to the
      patient's identity and clinical profile will independently evaluate the MRI images. The
      efficacy analysis will be primarily based on the blinded reader evaluations.

      Imaging conditions will represent those in routine clinical practice, inclusive of pre and
      post-contrast images.

        The study will include patients younger than 2 years of age who have previously undergone
        MRI of the CNS (brain or spine) with PROHANCE at the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg as part of their
        clinical work-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is male or female and was younger than 2 years of age at the time of the MRI with
             PROHANCE injection at the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (±25% in volume administered).

          -  Has demographic information, reason for the ProHance-enhanced MR examination, relevant
             medical history, final diagnosis, and safety data available.

          -  Has documented known or highly suspected enhancing disease of CNS (brain/spine) and
             previously underwent a cranial or spinal MR examination requiring an injection of
             PROHANCE contrast agent.

          -  Has both predose and postdose T1 SE/FSE and/or GRE and T2 SE/FSE, and FLAIR MR images
             (when available) for submission to Bracco or designee to be evaluated in a fully
             blinded read.

          -  Has complete information on the imaging protocol used for the ProHance-enhanced MR
             exam including type of exam (brain or spine), MR scanner and field strength (1.0, 1.5
             or 3.0 Tesla)

          -  Has a documented dose of PROHANCE administered for their MRI exam and/or the volume
             (mL) and weight of the patient available to be used to calculate the exact dose of
             PROHANCE that was administered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Exclude a patient from this study if the patient does not fulfill all of the inclusion
        criteria.
