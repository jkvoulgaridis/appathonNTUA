      Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS) of the auricle for acute pain management
      post cardiac surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A well formulated analgesic protocol is fundamental to fast tracking post cardiac surgery.
      Traditional analgesic methods have their own set of drawbacks unique to cardiac surgery.
      Opioids have well established side effects like nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression,
      urinary retention. Regional anesthetic techniques in anti coagulated patients may result in
      potentially catastrophic neurological, bleeding and thromboembolic sequelae. Non steroidal
      Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with increased cerebrovascular events,
      renal dysfunction, sternal wound infections. These make alternative therapies, including non
      pharmacological modalities, attractive options for optimal analgesic therapy during the post
      operative period.

      Alternative methods like topical application of COX -2 inhibitors, intravenous magnesium,
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) have been tried with varied results in
      cardiac surgery. A somatotopic relationship has been described between the auricle and the
      other anatomical regions of the body. When specific points are accurately identified along
      the meridians of the ear and stimulated electrically, analgesic effects are known to occur.
      Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS) of the auricle and its efficacy in
      management of post midline sternotomy pain has not been evaluated previously. Primary Relief
      v 2.0 is a device which provides continuous PENS aimed at non pharmacological post operative
      pain management.
