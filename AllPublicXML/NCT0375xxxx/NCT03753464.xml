      The aim of this pilot, exploratory, single blind clinical trial is to evaluate the epigenetic
      changes associated with peri-implantitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients will be voluntarily enrolled in two groups: 10 healthy participants, and 10
      participants with peri-implantitis. Periodontal and peri-implant clinical and radiographic
      measurements, as well as body mass index, medical and dental history will be recorded within
      the following timelines: at baseline (for both groups), and 6 months after baseline for the
      peri-implantitis group only. At baseline, gingival biopsies and blood will be harvested from:
      a) healthy gingival sites during either surgical removal of wisdom teeth or gingivoplasty, in
      the healthy group; and, b) from a peri-implantitis site during surgical treatment of
      peri-implantitis, and when possible, from a healthy gingival site within the same
      participant, in the peri-implantitis group. After harvesting of biopsies, peri-implantitis
      subjects will be re-evaluated 6 months after treatment. During the 6-month visit, if a second
      surgical treatment of peri-implantitis in the same implant treated at baseline is indicated
      as standard of care of the participant, a new gingiva biopsy and blood will be collected.
      Gingival biopsies and blood collected from each participant will be used to perform DNA
      methylation analysis.
