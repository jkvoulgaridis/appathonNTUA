  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an eye disease that results in damage to the optic nerve that progresses over
      time. One of the main risk factors in glaucoma is an increase in intraocular pressure, caused
      by a build-up of fluid in the eye. Glaucoma can result in blindness if left untreated and as
      such it is extremely important to diagnose and treat the condition.

      Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a laser treatment that facilitates the outflow of
      fluid from inside the eye. This has the potential of reducing the intraocular pressure within
      the eye (the main way in which this disease is treated since there is no cure) and may assist
      in helping to control the progression of this disease.

      SLT (standard treatment) is a technique routinely carried out by glaucoma specialists. It is
      conducted using a special type of lens (goniolens) that gently sits on the front surface of
      the eye. The procedure takes approximately 5 minutes in duration.

      This new treatment, Direct Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (DSLT) is performed directly,
      without there being any need to use a goniolens which sits on the eye, and it is a shorter
      and simpler technique to conduct when compared to the standard SLT technique.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the hypothesis that the treatment by new automated
      device for DSLT is not worse in comparison with the standard SLT and determine that it is
      effective in reducing intraocular pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma can result in blindness if left untreated and as such it is extremely important to
      diagnose and treat the condition.

      Usually doctors treat the first symptoms of glaucoma or ocular hypertension by prescribing
      eye drops. Unfortunately, there can be side effects associated with the use of these eye
      drops and there are reports of non-compliance due to difficulties in inserting these drops,
      all of which can impact on how effective this treatment regimen is.

      The purpose of this study is to assess how well the new automated DSLT device for laser
      treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension works in comparison with the standard SLT and
      determine that it is as effective in reducing intraocular pressure.

      DSLT or SLT will be performed in the study eye according to the randomization assignment.
      Eligible patients who sign the informed consent will be enrolled at each of the study sites,
      and undergo a washout (in the case of being medicated). After washout there will be a
      baseline visit, where continued eligibility is confirmed. Following confirmation of continued
      eligibility, 50% of patients being randomized to each treatment group. Randomization will be
      to a pre-determined randomization list.

      The un-masked investigator(s) will open the envelope corresponding to the subject ID and
      administer the treatment as indicated by the randomization envelope. The masked
      ophthalmologist(s), who will perform the follow up, will be masked as to the nature of the
      treatment the patient underwent.

      Only one eye per participant will be included in the study and they will be treated using
      either DSLT or SLT as per the randomized treatment allocation.
