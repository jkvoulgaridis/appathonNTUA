  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, more than 50% of surgical procedures were performed in outpatient settings.
      Successful pain management after outpatient surgery is crucial, and requires a perfect
      cooperation between caregivers and patients, with clear information on the analgesics use at
      home. Different strategies to control postoperative pain were adopted by hospitals performing
      outpatient surgery. However, up to half of patients receive little or no information about
      the treatment of postoperative pain, and at least one third of them are not able to follow
      postoperative analgesia instructions. There is a clear unmet need in pain treatment during
      first 48-72 hours after discharge, with important number of emergency calls and readmissions.
      The most common causes of rescue calls after outpatient surgery are uncontrolled pain and
      questions about medications or post-operative care.

      Structured education interventions using psychological techniques to enhance engagement and
      behavior were found to be beneficial for better acute pain management in outpatient settings
      after orthopedic surgery.

      We hypothesize that an educational intervention based on the rational perception of
      postoperative pain and discomfort, and the proper use of analgesics would improve the quality
      of pain management at home and reduce analgesics-related side effects.

      Principal objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a preoperative educational
      intervention on effectiveness of postoperative pain self-management in outpatient settings
      compared to the current practice.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the prevalence of analgesics use and the incidence of
      severe pain episodes, as well as side effects. The occurrence of neurological pain, quality
      of sleep, and patient's comfort will be evaluated at 30th day after surgery.

    <measure>Time-weighted sum of Pain Relief - Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) during 5 postoperative days</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR is a global score based on relief of pain. A numerical scale has at its left end the words &quot;no relief = 0&quot; and at its right end &quot;complete relief = 100%&quot;. The pain relief score is calculated using the area under the curve for a defined period of time. TOTPAR is also expressed as a percentage of the maximum TOTPAR that would be achieved by treatment that would provide complete relief during the observation period. In order to measure this area under the curve, at least 3 measurements per day will have to be reported in the patient diary.</description>
