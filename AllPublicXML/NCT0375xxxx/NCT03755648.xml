  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is one of the most important source of disability among children and its
      incidence is almost 3.6 in thousand live births.Children with Cerebral Palsy presents with
      ambulatory difficulties.The current study highlights the effect of treadmill training as
      compared to DeLorme resistance exercises on locomotor activities in cerebral palsy child.The
      present study would add to the clinical knowledge of physical therapists by promoting the
      implementation of treadmill training and DeLorme resistance exercises for this prevalent
      pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder. The study would decrease the burden of disease among
      community and enhance the social participation of cerebral palsy children. This in turn would
      improve the quality of living of these disabling diseased children.

    <description>Locomotor ability was assessed using ABILOCO-kids questionnaire. It consisted of 10 locomotion activities of which difficulty was rated by the parents. It has good reliability r=0.97 and reproducibility of 0.96. Parent is asked to fill in questionnaire by estimating their child's ease or difficulty in performing each activity. Activities are presented in 10 different random orders to avoid any systematic effect. During evaluation, 3-level response scale is presented to parent. Parent is asked to rate his perception on response scale as 'Impossible', 'Difficult' or 'Easy'. Activities not attempted by child within last 3 months are not scored and are entered as not applicable. Activities that child doesn't perform because they are too difficult must be scored as 'Impossible'. Child's locomotion ability and its 95% confidence interval are located on locomotion ability scale expressed in logits. Higher the ability of a child the more the measure will be located to the right.</description>

    <description>Group A: received treadmill training along with traditional physiotherapy.. The motorized treadmill was used keeping treatment parameters as 50 Hertz, 10 Ampere and 220 Volts The treadmill training was provided by giving instructions first and then warm up was given for 5 minutes prior to the training. The children were upright with the feet flat on treadmill platform. The height of handrails was adjustable according to every child thus keeping their gaze forward. The training was ended at cool down period of 5 minutes</description>

    <description>Group B received delorme resistance exercise with traditional physiotherapy. Delorme Resistance Training was also initiated with 5 minute warm up period. It was started with 10 Repetition Maximum and was gradually increased. The treatment session was thirty minutes for each group, six times a week for three months.</description>

    <description>The motorized treadmill treatment parameters considered will be 50 Hertz, 10 Ampere and 220 Volts. The speed of treadmill will be controlled with a single finger tip allowing an individual to exercise in safe environment with sufficient space.The treadmill training will be provided by giving instructions first and then warm up will be given for 5 minutes prior to the training. The children will be upright with the feet flat on treadmill platform. The height of handrails will be adjustable according to every child thus keeping their gaze forward. The training will be ended at cool down period of 5 minutes.The treatment session will be thirty minutes for each group, six times a week for three months.</description>
