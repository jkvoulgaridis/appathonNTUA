  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a public health problem, given its prevalence (15% in France in 2012, Ob√©pi
      survey) but also by the complications that it generates. We were firstly, intersted in bone
      mineral density during obesity.

      We were able to confirm in an observational study that BMD (Z-score)was augmented. We also
      showed, for the first time, that this increase in Z-score was dependent on sex, severity of
      obesity and age but also bone site. If the increase in BMD at the level of the bearing zones
      seems logically to be explained by the hypothesis that the mechanical stresses have an
      osteogenic effect on the bone tissue, the latter can not in any way respond to the
      concomitant increase in BMD at non-bearing areas such as the radius.These results suggest
      that changes in certain systemic compounds induced by obesity may interfere with bone
      metabolism. recent data also suggest a change in the concentration of pro-glucagon peptides
      (GLP-1, glicentin, glucagon, etc.) in obese subjects and in bariatric surgery). Although body
      composition and its variation after surgery could be largely involved in the modification of
      these peptides, no data on these potential relationships is currently available. However, no
      data are available for baseline body composition and weight loss data. Finally, 80% of
      obesity is associated with insulin resistance, a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of type
      2 diabetes. A metabolically healthy obesity phenotype is described, although the definition
      criteria are not consensual.The evolution of this phenotype with aging and with the duration
      of evolution of obesity is not well described.

      Our goal is to create a database of weight-bearing patients in the care setting and to
      determine the &quot;hormonal dialogue&quot; between peripheral (muscular and adipose) and bone tissues,
      which may be associated with changes in body composition during obesity and aging, and that
      according to sex.
