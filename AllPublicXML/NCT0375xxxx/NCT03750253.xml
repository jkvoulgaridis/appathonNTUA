      Arthroscopic surgery is effective in treating osteochondral lesions of the talus. However,
      there are still some patients with postoperative ankle pain. This study aims to investigate
      the clinical efficacy of shock wave adjuvant therapy in the treatment of postoperative pain
      caused by cartilage injury of talus after arthroscopy and to provide basis for further
      popularization and application.

      Arthroscopic surgery is effective in treating osteochondral lesions of the talus. However,
      there are still some patients with postoperative ankle pain. This study was conducted to
      investigate the clinical efficacy of shock wave therapy in the treatment of postoperative
      pain caused by cartilage injury of talus after arthroscopy.

      Patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus treated by arthroscopic microfracture
      surgery and still complained ankle pain three months after surgery were enrolled. Radial
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy was used to give energy to the injured region of the talus
      and the adjacent area.Treatment was done once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. After shock
      wave therapy,the patients were followed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the American
      Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale(AOFAS-AHFS) , and followed finally by
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the ankle.

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale scores of the patients before and after the shock wave therapy are recorded. The scale ranges from 0-10 points, and decreases of the value represent a better outcome. The data analyses are performed with SPSS version 16.0 statistical software. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals are determined. The data are compared by paired t test or rank-sum test. P value &lt; 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.</description>
