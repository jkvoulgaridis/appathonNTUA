    <textblock>
      Study to analyze electronic medical records of women using an intrauterine device (IUD) for
      birth control. The study is required by the FDA for the marketed IUD Mirena (US
      Post-marketing requirement; short name of study: APEX IUD).

      The study will analyze the risks that the IUD is expelled or perforates the womb for the
      following group comparisons:

        -  Women who are breastfeeding at the time of IUD insertion versus women who are not
           breastfeeding at the time of IUD insertion.

        -  Women who had a first observed IUD insertion within different time periods after
           childbirth (i.e., ≤ 6 weeks, &gt; 6 weeks and ≤ 14 weeks, &gt; 14 weeks and ≤ 52 weeks) versus
           women who had their first observed IUD insertion more than 52 weeks after childbirth,
           including women without a recorded delivery within the past 52 weeks.

      The study will also analyze the risks that the IUD is expelled or perforates the womb for
      different types of IUDs. In addition, the study aims to assess the following interactions:

        -  The extent to which the type of IUD (IUDs releasing the hormone LNG versus Copper IUDs)
           modifies the risk that an IUD is expelled or perforates the womb in relation to
           breastfeeding and/ or in relation to the point in time when the IUD was inserted after
           childbirth.

        -  The extent to which the breastfeeding status modifies the risk that an IUD is expelled
           or perforates the womb in relation to the point in time when the IUD was inserted after
           childbirth.
