      Maxillofacial defects create unique challenges for the reconstructive surgeon, often
      involving bony and soft tissue components of the midface. Surgical reconstruction following
      maxillectomy is currently a topic of interest for reconstructive head and neck surgeons.
      maxillary defects were reconstructed with maxillofacial prosthetics including obturation.
      While the latter is an effective reconstruction. Over the past two decades, there has been
      increasing interest in the use of free tissue transfers of bone to reconstruct the maxilla.

      Scapular flap It is an excellent candidate for maxillectomy defects because of its unique
      feature, which is characterized by additional skin paddles or muscles. and can be harvested
      along with a part of the scapular bone for bony reconstruction

      Traditional reconstructive techniques often lead to suboptimal reconstructions due to inexact
      planning, poor communication between the resective and reconstructive teams or surgical
      difficulties in adjusting a free flap and osteosynthesis plates into a three-dimensional (3D)
      defect without the help of any templates or surgical guides The advent of 3D modeling in head
      and neck reconstruction has allowed surgeons to improve upon functional and aesthetic
      outcomes, which are crucial to patient satisfaction and can be difficult to achieve in
      maxillectomy defects The cutting guides used or not used, however debate still present for
      its benefits and worth for patient and surgeon. current study to evaluate how such virtual
      planning with using of customized cutting guide is effective and worth for patient aesthetic
      and operation time.

      our priori-hypothesis is that utilization CAD/CAM assisted with customized osteotomy guide is
      not related to an altered result regarding aesthetic outcome and operation time in patient
      undergoing maxillary reconstruction using free scapular flap.

      In order to test this hypothesis, we will compare aesthetic outcome and operation time in
      group of patients receive FSF by CAD/CAM-assisted with customized osteotomy guide to results
      of another group of patients receive FSF but without customized osteotomy guide. only model
      will be performed as conventional method aiding in reshaping of reconstruction plate which is
      another well-established concept of management of maxillary defect.

    <description>This began with the acquisition of a high-resolution CT scan of the patient's maxilla and scapula. The CT scan will be sent to the modeling company that produce 3D autoclavable models and cutting guides to be used during resection and scapular harvesting as well as a model of the final reconstructed maxilla.
surgery will performed by two surgical teams one for tumor resection and the other harvesting the flap.
access to the maxilla was obtained and the cutting guides were secured in the planned position; the cuts were completed. The scapular guides were secured to the harvested scapula to replicate the cuts that were planned previously.
The scapula and plate will be fixed and pedicle anastomosis is performed. the operation then completed with soft tissue reconstruction.</description>

The C.T scan will be sent to the modeling company for planning three-dimensional model of the maxilla. autoclavable model will be prepared to be used during the workflow for plate reshaping to conforme the prices position of the maxilla.
surgery will performed in a single step by two surgical teams, one for cervicofacial resection and the other for harvesting the flap.
Resection-reconstruction then performed in aconventional surgical manner with microvascular anastomosis. finally the operation will be completed with soft tissue reconstruction as needed.</description>
