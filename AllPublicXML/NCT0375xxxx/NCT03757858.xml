  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a non-randomized pilot study.The allocation will be determined by patients or their
      immediate family members who were cooperative with physician's interpretations on the disease
      progression and updated information of cutting of edge treatment, the financial
      affordability, availability of treatment plans, possible tolerance or risks etc.The purpose
      of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of autologous cellular
      immunotherapy combined with hyperthermia in abdominal and pelvic malignancies or metastases
      patients. Furthermore, to characterize response to different regimens,the investigators
      intent to explore the predictive and prognostic biomarker, as well as the changes in immune
      repertoire.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Abdominal and pelvic malignancies or metastases

          2. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          3. Age ≥ 18 years old

          4. At least one measurable lesion according to the Solid Tumor Evaluation Criteria
             (RECIST Version 1.1)

          5. Adequate hematologic function, with WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (it is
             acceptable to have had prior transfusion), platelets ≥ 75,000/microliter; PT-INR &lt;1.5
             (unless patient is receiving warfarin in which case PT-INR must be &lt;3), PTT &lt;1.5X ULN

          6. Adequate renal and hepatic function, with serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 mg/dL (except for Gilbert's syndrome which will allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL), ALT
             and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0,1 or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune related thyroid disease and vitiligo
             are permitted.

          2. Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease
             (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal
             Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.

          3. Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the
             protocol should be excluded.

          4. Concurrent (or within the last 5 years) second malignancy other than non melanoma skin
             cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, controlled superficial bladder cancer, or other
             carcinoma in situ that has been treated.

          5. Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection,
             HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot). Patients with HIV are
             excluded based on immuno-suppression, which may render them unable to respond to the
             vaccine; patients with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that
             hepatitis could be exacerbated by the injections.

          6. Patients on chronic steroid therapy (or other immuno-suppressives, such as
             azathioprine or cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune
             suppression. Patients must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy
             (except that used as pre-medication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced studies or
             for acute treatment (&lt;5 days) of intercurrent medical condition such as a gout flare)
             prior to enrollment.

          7. Pregnant and nursing women should be excluded from the protocol since this research
             may have unknown and harmful effects on an unborn child or on young children. If the
             patient is sexually active, the patient must agree to use a medically acceptable form
             of birth control while receiving treatment and for a period of 4 months following the
             last vaccination therapy. It is not known whether the treatment used in this study
             could affect the sperm and could potentially harm a child that may be fathered while
             on this study.

          8. Patients with acute or chronic skin disorders that will interfere with injection into
             the skin of the extremities or subsequent assessment of potential skin reactions will
             be excluded.

          9. There are metal stents or metal fixtures in the body
