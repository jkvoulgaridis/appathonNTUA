  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop a nomogram that correlates intraoperative, aphakic
      refraction measurements when the anterior chamber is pressurized with either balanced salt
      solution (BSS) or DisCoVisc; and to understand how suggested IOL power selection may differ.

    <description>Following lens removal and removal of all OVD from the anterior chamber during cataract surgery, the chamber will be filled with BSS and the main incision hydrated with BSS. Intraoperative aberrometry, using the Optiwave® Refractive Analysis with VerifEye+ (ORA), will be performed, and the results of aphakic refraction and suggested IOL power will be recorded in triplicate. Immediately following, the BSS will be replaced with DisCoVisc; and, triplicate readings will be measured under the same conditions.</description>

          -  Conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including capsular or

          -  Irregular astigmatism based upon investigator judgment

          -  Inability to achieve keratometric stability

             silodosin (e.g., Flomax, Flomaxtra, Rapaflo) likely, in the opinion of the

             standard cataract surgery

          -  Aniridia

          -  Optic nerve atrophy
