  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, to test the
      hypothesis that RDD1609 is effective in treating idiopathic pruritus ani.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over design study in
      patients with idiopathic pruritus ani. 24 patients, male and females, aged 18 -65 with severe
      idiopathic pruritus ani (VAS score above 60), will be randomized to this study.

      Patients that meet all inclusion criteria and do not have exclusion criteria at randomization
      visit will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

      Group 1 will receive 3 weeks of RDD1609 for 3 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of treatment with
      placebo.

      Group 2 will receive 3 weeks of treatment with placebo followed by 3 weeks of treatment with
      RDD1609.

    <description>Change in severity of itch, measured using Visual Analogue Scale score for itching from baseline through the end of treatment. The Visual Analogue Scale is a 10-cm long line (oriented horizontally), on which patients indicate the severity of their itching by crossing the line at the point that corresponded to their itching severity. The left end of the line indicates &quot;no itch&quot; and right end of the line indicates &quot;worth itch ever&quot;.</description>
