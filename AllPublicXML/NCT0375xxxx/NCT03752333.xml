    <textblock>
      An open label, non-randomised, single arm, sequential phase (two sequential cohorts) study,
      evaluating the preliminary efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Cancer of unknown Primary (CUP).

      Cohort 1:

      Cohort 1 will enrol a maximum of 20 patients, who have had at least one prior line / regimen
      of chemotherapy (at least 2 cycles) appropriate for CUP and who have not had a RECIST
      response to first-line chemotherapy, or are progressing after an initial response, or are
      treatment intolerant to first-line chemotherapy, due to unacceptable toxicity.

      As soon as there has been one documented response in cohort 1, the study then proceeds to
      enrol cohort 2 in parallel. Cohort 2 will not be initiated, if have been no cohort 1 (0/20)
      patients who have benefitted and 20 cohort 1 patients have completed at least 12 weeks of
      therapy. Benefit for this study is defined as either a RECIST or irRECIST response; stable
      disease for a minimum of 12 weeks. This allows a go / no-go decision to proceed/ not proceed
      to enrolling cohort 2 by the trial management group

      Cohort 2:

      Cohort 2 will enrol a maximum of 57 patients who are chemo-naïve (first-line setting) for
      CUP*, with a PS 0-2. Benefit for this study is defined as either a RECIST or irRECIST
      response or stable disease at 12 weeks.

      *Previous chemotherapy for other cancers is allowed

      For both cohorts, patients will undergo screening procedures during a standard 28-days time
      window from initiation of the study, under standard Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and informed
      consent. Restaging will be performed by computerized tomography using ir-RECIST criteria at 3
      months from initiation of systemic treatment and on an 8 weekly basis thereafter until
      radiological proven disease progression or intolerance or patient choice.

      The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) questionnaire (to assess the quality of
      life) will be done at baseline after 3 months and then at discontinuation of study treatment.

      Correlative translational study samples (blood) and tissue (used for histological
      confirmation and to document Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression) will be collected
      at baseline, and blood and serum samples monthly (after an informed optional consent and
      banked for retrospective immune-modulating and other biomarkers for future research and
      analysis).

    <description>This would be a retrospective analysis of blood samples collected for future research purposes only. Research bloods will be used to examine DNA and measure various blood biomarkers. These biomarkers may predict possible response to study treatment. As these samples are being taken before, during and after treatment, they will help us understand how the study treatments work. This will also enable us to learn whether or not the treatments have the desired effect, and to understand if these effects may be beneficial for the treatment of cancer of unknown primary (CUP). This information may also be used to develop and test other new treatments in the future. The panel of potential biomarkers against which the blood plasma will be tested has not been established yet. Information gained from this research component is not directly beneficial to patients taking part in this clinical trial.</description>

    <description>All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis. Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).</description>

    <description>Pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1, based on preclinical in vitro data. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical and clinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.
The PD-1 pathway represents a major immune control switch, which may be engaged by tumour cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized mAb of the Immunoglobulin (IgG4)/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and ultimately immune rejection.</description>
