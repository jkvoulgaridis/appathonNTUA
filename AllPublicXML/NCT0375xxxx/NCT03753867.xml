  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow a group of healthy male participants for about 18 weeks to see the
      effect of taking Acitretin on their immune cells

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinoids have been shown in in vitro and ex vivo models to have the ability to reverse
      latency reactivating the HIV reservoir and the potential for selective eradication of
      HIV-harbouring cells. We feel that acitretin shows significant potential as a potential
      adjuvant to current ART regimens, however, there is a lack of data to demonstrate that
      treatment with acitretin at normal are able to induce molecular and transcription changes
      consistent with the above activities. In order to provide a scientific basis for retinoid
      therapy in HIV infection, a Phase I trial of acitretin in human subjects is proposed.

    <description>Acitretin will be provided to participants in the formulation Soriatane. Soriatane doses are oral tablets taken daily by the participant. Participants will then receive 35mg of oral acitretin (Soriatane) daily for 8 weeks during the intervention phase. Participants will be asked to return two months after completion of the acitretin course for clinical follow-up and additional phlebotomy for laboratory testing.</description>
