  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each winter, viruses belonging to two kinds of influenza A (&quot;A/H1N1&quot; &amp; &quot;A/H3N2&quot;) and two
      kinds of influenza B (&quot;B/Yamagata&quot; &amp; &quot;B/Victoria&quot;) can cause illness. Historically, the
      yearly influenza vaccine that was recommended in children was designed to protect against
      both kinds of influenza A but only one kind of influenza B. In a series of trials conducted
      between 2008-09 and 2010-11 (TITRE I, II, and IIB), the TITRE investigators measured antibody
      response to influenza B in children who were primed with two doses of trivalent inactivated
      influenza vaccine (TIV) containing B/Yamagata. Overall, the investigators found that 2 doses
      of vaccine containing B/Yamagata did not adequately prime children for response to the
      alternate B/Victoria antigen and that subsequent vaccine doses containing B/Victoria-lineage
      antigen strongly boosted antibodies to the B/Yamagata antigen that was introduced during
      first immunization priming, but with lower responses to B/Victoria.

      For the first time since 2009-10, the recommended B/Victoria component of the seasonal
      influenza vaccine has been changed, from B/Brisbane/60/2008 to B/Colorado/60/2007 for the
      coming 2018-19 season. The investigators thus have a unique opportunity to clarify
      lineage-specific influenza B responses in a well-characterized cohort of children originally
      primed to Yamagata. The investigators' main interest is to assess whether TITRE I children
      primed with two doses of B/Yamagata in 2008-09 have since or are now capable of achieving a
      sufficient antibody response to B/Victoria following a single dose of 2018-19 QIV, ten years
      after their initial TIV B/Yamagata priming exposure.
