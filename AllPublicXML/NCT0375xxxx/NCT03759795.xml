  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The challenges that characterise surgical practice may result in a myriad of stressors that
      impact upon the personal and professional lives of surgeons. This includes a high likelihood
      that surgeons will have to deal with adverse patient outcomes due to surgical complications
      and errors, sometime during their careers. Such stressors can have undesirable effects on the
      surgeon in terms of quality of life and psychological well-being (e.g. anxiety, feelings of
      regret), as well as lowered professional confidence and impaired perceptions of professional
      competence. Furthermore, there is evidence that these kinds of negative impacts can also lead
      to burnout and depression. As well as the detrimental effects on surgeons and those around
      them, this in turn may lead to more errors and poorer outcomes for patients. This study will
      examine the efficacy of an ACT based training intervention to enhance resilience and
      psychological flexibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research in a range of occupational settings has indicated that resilience plays an important
      role in ameliorating the impact of adverse events in high pressure environments. This project
      will use a randomised controlled trial research design to assess the efficacy of brief
      one-to-one Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACTr), designed to enhance surgeons'
      psychological resilience. According to the model ACTr is based on, psychopathology is
      primarily the consequence of psychological inflexibility i.e. inability to persist or change
      behaviour according to long-term values due to language and cognition skills, which has
      particular significance when an individual is confronted with stress or adversity.

      The main aim of this research is to assess the efficacy of a brief one-to-one Acceptance and
      Commitment Training course. Researchers wish to ascertain whether such a course can increase
      surgeons' resilience by increasing psychological flexibility, valuing and self-compassion
      (all of which are expected to be positively impacted by this training). This research will
      fill a gap in the relevant research literature; namely that no research project as far as we
      are aware has evaluated ACTr as a means to enhance resilience in surgeons. In fact any
      research conducted on resilience training with a surgical population is rare.
