  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the mass balance and biotransformation pathways of HSK3486
      in healthy Chinese male subjects administered with a single intravenous dose of [14C]HSK3486,
      so as to characterize the drug's general pharmacokinetics and safety in humans and provide
      supportive data for reasonable use.
