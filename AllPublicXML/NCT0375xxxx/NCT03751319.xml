  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is an established approach for better detection of
      frailty-related problems and includes individualized treatment plan with multi-discipline
      supportive and treating measures for the older frailty patients. However, there is limited
      evidence of feasibility and efficacy of the CGA when provided in the emergency department
      setting.

      In the GAOPS-study the efficacy of the CGA in emergency department setting will be studied by
      randomized controlled study protocol. We aim to study if the CGA provided in the ED is
      feasible, safe and efficient method when added with standard emergency care for older frail
      patients.
