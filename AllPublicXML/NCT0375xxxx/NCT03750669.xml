  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor. Current guidelines recommend
      Nab-paclitaxel, Gemcitabine and modified Folfirinox as the first-line chemotherapeutic
      regimen. Studies have shown that sequential chemotherapeutic regimen can effectively delay
      the drug resistance and improve the effect of chemotherapy. Here investigators intend to
      assess the effect of sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified
      Folfirinox as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators chose resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. The planned treatment was
      given to the participants after randomization. Tumor size, recurrence-free survival, overall
      survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed,
      to assess the sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified
      Folfirinox could or couldn't benefit the prognosis of resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
