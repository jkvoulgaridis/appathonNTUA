  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety of IRX-2 Regimen combined with Nivolumab in patients
      with recurrent metastatic solid tumors. Researchers believe that this combination will have a
      tolerable safety profile and will increase the response rate in comparison to Nivolumab
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of this trial is to establish the safety of IRX-2 Regimen combined with
      Nivolumab. The IRX-2 Regimen is a 21-day regimen of cyclophosophamide on Day 1 and
      subcutaneous IRX-2 injections for 10 days between Days 4 and 18. If no dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment, the enrollment will
      continue in a dose expansion phase. If there is a study treatment related DLT in 1 of 6
      patients, the same dose will be investigated at the dose expansion cohorts. If study
      treatment related DLT is observed in 2 of 6 patients, accrual will be stopped and new dose
      levels or treatment sequences will be considered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell
             carcinoma,urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of
             the head and neck or melanoma.

          -  Participants must have recurrent or metastatic disease that is not amenable to local
             therapy with curative intent (surgery or radiation therapy with or without
             chemotherapy).

          -  Must be willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to protocol therapy;
             written informed consent and any locally required authorization must be obtained from
             the participant prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including
             screening evaluations

          -  Prior exposure to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy, or prior exposure to CTLA-4
             inhibitor monotherapy is allowed.
