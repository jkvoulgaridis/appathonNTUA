      Participants will be recruited through the following routes: 1) by our partner
      non-governmental organizations, 2) by our research team through community outreach or
      training activities, 3) online screening tool, and 4) referral from organizations that
      provide service to women (e.g., Maternal and Child Health Clinics of Department of Health).
      Eligible subjects with informed consent provided will be randomly assigned to coaching group
      or general mental well-being group. To test the effectiveness of the provided intervention
      programs, symptoms and cognitive assessments and data collection on demographics and
      psychosocial data will be carried out during baseline, immediately after 8 weeks, 6 months
      and 12 months post-intervention.

    <description>Measured by Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) and Role Functioning Scale (RFS). The SOFAS is an observer rating scale. Ratings should be based on subject's behavior during the last 1 month. The score ranges from 0-100. A higher score represents a better outcome. The RFS is comprised of four single rating scaled for evaluating the functioning of individuals in specified areas of everyday life. The four role functions assessed are:(1)Working: productivity, (2) Independent living and self care, (3) Immediate social network relationships, and (4) Extended social network relationship. The values on each of the four scales range from 1 (minimal level of role functioning), to 7 (hypothetically optimal level of role functioning). Each of the seven points on the scales is accompanied by a behaviorally defined description. The two scales will be evaluated separately.</description>
