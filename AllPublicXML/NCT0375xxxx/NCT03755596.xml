      This open-label, self-paired, case-control study will evaluate 180 patients presenting motion
      sickness. The primary study objective is to evaluate the use of dry Z. officinale extract
      160mg (containing 8mg gingerol) in the treatment of patients presenting motion sickness. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the scores and subscores
      of the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) before and after treatment, as well as
      to assess treatment tolerability in this population. The total study duration will be seven
      days. A total of four specific motion sickness assessments will be performed, one
      pre-treatment and three during the treatment period, which consists of an oral dose of 160mg
      ginger extract 30 minutes prior to the trip under evaluation.
