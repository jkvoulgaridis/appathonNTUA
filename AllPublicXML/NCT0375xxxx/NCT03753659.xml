  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, prospective, open-label phase II trial investigating the
      clinical activity of peri-interventional treatment with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab
      in HCC patients who are candidates for local ablation via either radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) or brachytherapy or combination of TACE with RFA, MWA or
      brachytherapy.

    <textblock>
      The multimodal approach of combining peri-interventional administration of an immune
      checkpoint inhibitor and local ablation via RFA / MWA / brachytherapy or combination of TACE
      with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy harbors the potential to satisfy the unmet need for an
      improvement in the outcomes of HCC patients treated with RFA / MWA/ brachytherapy or
      combination of TACE with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy. Furthermore, early clinical data
      indicates that the combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy
      displays an acceptable safety profile, resulting in a positive benefit-risk ratio of this
      trial.

    <time_frame>After 6 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of ORR according to RECIST 1.1 after two cycles of pembrolizumab and before performing local ablation will allow testing of the hypothesis that pre-interventional treatment with pembrolizumab before local ablation will result in conversion / downstaging of borderline candidates for local ablation. Furthermore, ORR is generally accepted as a valid endpoint for efficacy evaluation in one-armed trials without control group.</description>

    <description>TTR and recurrence free survival, have meanwhile been accepted by medicinal agencies in drug approval processes as they allow for quicker efficacy assessment. This is most important in explorative clinical trials in early phases (like this phase II trial) as it allows for more rapid evaluation of the potential of new treatment approaches. Furthermore, many of these parameters are not influenced by follow-up therapies.</description>

         21. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         22. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
