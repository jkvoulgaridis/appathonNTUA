  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and superior effectiveness in
      functional improvement in patients with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCTs) after
      the administration of a single injection of adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) into
      the partial-thickness rotator cuff tear compared to the administration of a single
      corticosteroid injection into the associated subacromial space.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, active-controlled, multi-site, pivotal
      safety and superior effectiveness study in patients with symptomatic partial-thickness
      rotator cuff tears comparing a single ADRC injection generated with the Transpose® RT system
      into the supraspinatus tendon and surrounding area to standard-of-care (SOC) corticosteroid
      injection into the subacromial bursa.

      Up to 20 U.S. centers will be initiated to enroll in the study. 246 subjects assigned to two
      randomization arms will be enrolled: an adipose-derived regenerative cell (ADRC) injection
      arm (ADRC treatment arm) and the SOC corticosteroid injection arm (active control arm). All
      subjects will be randomly assigned to ADRC treatment or active control arms in a 2:1 ratio.

         15. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has a known immunologic or severe
             autoimmune disease that requires chronic systemic immunosuppressive or
             immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). [Note: Topical or inhaled corticosteroids
             are permitted.]

             by the Investigator.

        21. Subjects with a history of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

        22. Subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, unable to comply with the requirements
        of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason. Examples include the
        inability of the subject to complete patient-reported outcome instruments (PROs) and the
        inability of the Investigator to perform the injection procedure properly because of
        anatomic limitations of the subject.

        23. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed
        its primary endpoint. (Noninterventional observational studies are not exclusionary.)

        24. Subject 1) is a litigant in a civil suit that could affect the subject's ability to
        complete the study related activities or 2) is a defendant in a criminal case or 3) has an
        active workman's compensation case in progress.

        25. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the Investigator, is
        unable to give informed consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse personal.
        circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include: individuals with a mental disability,
        persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, persons in emergency situations,
        homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of giving informed consent.
        Vulnerable populations also may include members of a group with a hierarchical structure
        such as university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of
        the Sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.

        26. Uncooperative subjects or those with neurological/psychiatric disorders who are
        incapable of following directions or who are predictably unwilling to return for follow-up
        examinations.
