  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between objectively measured
      physical activity and provider-assessed and patient-reported functional outcomes in patients
      with advanced cancer. Findings from this study will help us better understand how change in
      daily physical activity, as measured using the wearable activity monitor, is related to
      change in a patient's functional status and clinical condition.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients diagnosed with stage 3/ 4 cancer will be enrolled. After providing informed consent,
      patients will be asked to wear a FitBit Charge HR continuously for 8 weeks with the option to
      continue wearing the monitor for up to a year after end-of-study. Baseline assessments
      include a physical exam, medical history, and frailty assessment. The attending oncologist
      will rate the patient's performance status (ECOG PS) at baseline and 8-weeks follow-up.
      Patient-reported outcomes (self-reported physical function, fatigue, sleep, emotional
      distress) will be assessed weekly using NIH PROMIS from baseline up to 8 weeks from
      end-of-study. They will also be collected at 1 year follow-up. Wearable activity monitor data
      will be summarized each week for 8 weeks, and then again at 1 year follow-up. Physical
      activity data (number of steps, stairs climbed, active minutes, heart rate, and sleep
      duration) will be collected and analyzed at end-of-study (up to 1 year from end-of-study).
      Overall survival will also be assessed up to 1 year from end-of-study. Absolute change in
      physical activity levels will be correlated with change in performance status and occurrence
      of AEs and death to better understand the role of remote activity monitoring in cancer
      patients.

    <description>Change in performance status will be calculated based on difference in provider-assessed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status at end-of-study visit and baseline ECOG. ECOG Performance Status is rated based on a 5-point scale where a score of 0 indicates best performance status and 5 indicates death. Only one rating of ECOG PS by provider is completed at each timepoint.</description>

    <description>Physical function will be assessed using the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short form, which includes 20 items and a range of 1 (low physical function) to 5 (high physical function). The total score will be calculated and converted into a standardized t-score will be calculated based on a standard cancer population with a mean of 50 and SD of 10.</description>

    <description>Distress will be measured using using NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which includes short forms: emotional distress, sleep quality, pain, and fatigue. Items range from 1 (worse outcome) and 5 (best outcome) where a total score will be calculated and converted into standardized t-scores.</description>

    <description>Score calculated based on total number of frailty characteristics present using Fried's validated Frailty index. Characteristics of frailty include shrinking (weight loss), weakness (grip strength), poor endurance, exhaustion, slowness, and low activity. The minimal score is 0, indicating absence of frailty, and the highest is 5. Frailty index categories include absence of frailty (score of 0), pre-frail or intermediate frail (1-2 criteria) and frail (&gt;3 criteria present).</description>
