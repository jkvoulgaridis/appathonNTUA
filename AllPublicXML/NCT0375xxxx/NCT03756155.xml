  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at people with lateral elbow tendinopathy (elbow pain). The goal
      is to determine if a one-time isometric intervention will positively change the level of pain
      and strength as compared to baseline measurements. After determining baseline strength and
      pain level, an intervention consisting of several trials of isometric hand/wrist contractions
      will be performed by the participant. Pain and strength will again be assessed immediately
      after the intervention.

      Participants will be randomized into two different groups in 10 participant blocks, meaning
      after every 10 participants eligible and completing the study, there will be 5 participants
      assigned to each group. Group 1 will complete a protocol with 10 sets of 10 second isometric
      holds followed by 10 second rest intervals between sets. Each repetition will be performed as
      closely to the targeted 30%-40% value. Group 2 will complete a protocol with 5 sets of 20
      second isometric holds followed by 20 second rest intervals between sets. Each repetition
      will be performed as closely to the targeted 30% value. Resistance for both testing
      conditions will be performed against the examiner's external resistance/against the Microfet
      hand held dynamometer. Immediately after the intervention, all participants will again repeat
      their maximal grip on their affected arm using the Jamar hand held dynamometer and will grade
      their pain level. (The protocol will be identical to the pre testing procedure from above).
      The pain score and force output will be obtained and documented. Once these steps are
      complete, testing will cease. All participants will be instructed to follow their referring
      provider's treatment intervention.

    <time_frame>Randomization through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the immediate effects of an isometric intervention on pain levels for individuals with lateral elbow tendinopathy. The primary outcome measure that will be utilized is the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) which will measure pain intensity using the 11 point scale with values ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).</description>

    <measure>Assess correlation between force output during max grip strength testing and reported pain levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if there is a correlation between force output during max grip strength testing and reported pain levels, and to determine if there is a correlation between two different time under tension protocols and max grip strength and reported pain levels. The secondary outcome measure with be grip strength, both pain free and max grip strength which will be measured in pounds using a Jamar handheld dynamometer.</description>
