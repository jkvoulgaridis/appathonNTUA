    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of specific training programs on
      the incidence of injuries in recreational runners. 150 runners between the ages of 18 and 55
      years, will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the intervention group or control
      group. The intervention group will perform the training program twice a week in addition to
      their regular training. Injury data will be collected as the injuries occur and documentation
      of injury will follow a predetermined definition of injury. Participants will submit weekly
      updates of their running distance, frequency as well as successful performance of the
      assigned training program for the intervention groups. The primary outcome is the incidence
      of injuries in all groups.

      Injuries and especially overuse injuries within recreational running are a common occurrence
      with higher incidence rates in novice runners but also in recreational runners training for a
      specific event. The mechanisms behind overuse injury development are thought to be
      multifactorial and certain parameters have shown to increase injury risk in recreational
      runners. The aim of this trial is to target these specific parameters and implement training
      programs to which recreational runners will adhere for a period of 18 weeks. 150 male and
      female recreational runners, aged 18-55 years will be randomly allocated to one either the
      intervention 1 (INT-All) or Control (CON).The INT-All group will perform an exercise program
      containing strength and foamrolling exercises in addition to their regular training, twice a
      week. The CON group will continue as per usual with their training. Training data will be
      collected on a weekly basis from all groups and injury information will be submitted by the
      participants upon occurrence. The primary outcome measure is the number of sustained injuries
      in both groups. Participants will be recruited in December 2018 and the intervention will
      start in January 2019 for a period of 18 weeks, ending in May 2019. Data analyses are
      anticipated to be completed in September 2019.

    <description>The intervention consists of an exercise program developed by a team specialised in orthopaedics, physiotherapy and biomechanics, based on the results from a recently performed prospective study in Gothenburg, Sweden. The exercises included cover strength training for the core, abductors, quadriceps and foot pronators, as well as foamrolling for the abductors, quadriceps, hamstrings, calf muscles and gluteal muscles. The runners will be instructed to perform the training program twice a week for the entire intervention period.</description>

    <description>The runners will be asked to perform their specific training program- depending on the intervention to which they have been allocated- three times a week. The interventions consist of either strength and foam rolling exercises for the lower extremities or only foam rolling for the lower extremities.</description>
