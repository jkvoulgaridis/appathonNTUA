  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that implementing laser photocoagulation (IGTL) as an adjunctive treatment
      to intravitreal injections should lead to a significant reduction in the need for
      intravitreal injections in patients with diabetic macular edema without adverse consequences
      for visual acuity.

      This study will be French, multicenter parallel group, 2-arms, randomized, sham
      laser-controlled, double-blind trial evaluating the effect of IGTL as an adjunctive procedure
      to intravitreal injections in patients with DME.

      Acts which are the subject of the study: indocyanine green-Guided Targeted Laser
      photocoagulation (IGTL): this combines routine procedures, that are, the detection of
      macro-aneurysms by ICG angiography, laser photocoagulation and optional post-laser
      verification of the effectiveness of the photothrombosis by OCT.

      Study act: the treatment study includes a baseline laser treatment (experimental group) or
      sham laser (control group) at randomization, repeated if needed 3 month later, administered
      in combination with anti VEGF treatment, consisting of 3 monthly injections in the first 3
      months, and a maintenance phase with monthly visits where retreatment is administered as
      needed through a PRN regimen, based on morphological (retinal thickness on OCT) and
      functional (visual acuity) criteria.

      To evaluate the interest of IGTL in real conditions, the choice of the anti VEGF treatment
      used for intravitreal injection (Ranibizumab or Aflibercept, which have French marketing
      authorizations) is left to each investigator (equivalent therapeutic efficacy). Bevacizumab
      is ruled out due to its lower efficacy compared with Aflibercept among eyes with worse
      baseline VA, that represent the majority of the patients in our study. In addition,
      bevacizumab is currently off-label in France for DME If both eyes are eligible at the time of
      randomization, only one eye will be included and analyzed. However, the fellow eye will be
      treated with the randomization-assigned treatment and the testing will be performed on each
      eye.

      Risks and constraints involved in the study: these procedures are commonly done in
      ophthalmology care settings; no additional risk is expected due to the study.

      Expected benefits for the participants and for the company: These procedures are commonly
      done in ophthalmology care settings; no additional risk is expected due to the study.
