    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a constraint intervention combined with
      visual-spatial cueing strategy in patients with acute stroke to improve their daily life
      activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of treatment in acute stroke (from D0 to D14), the investigators were able to observe
      that despite motor recovery during physiotherapy sessions, it remained difficult for some
      patients to use their affected arm (AA) during activities of daily life (ADL). This mechanism
      of &quot;learned non-use&quot; would be due to a cognitive process decreasing the use of the AA and
      could partly explain that 75% of patients maintain an upper limb deficit at 3-6 month
      post-stroke.

      In order to combat this phenomenon, a bottom up method (sensorimotor action on the deficit)
      of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been developed and consists in immobilizing
      the unaffected arm to force the use of the AA.

      This technique has proved its effectiveness in the chronic phase and has also recently been
      proven to improve motor performance in the acute phase. Transposing progress on ADL, however,
      remains difficult because CIMT does not contain adequate behavioral strategies.

      To help the patient mobilize these strategies, coupling of CIMT with a top-down method
      (conscious action on motor skills) has been successfully tested as an intervention of an
      occupational therapist with the patient at least 1h / day. This intervention remains not
      compatible with the investigators care organization because the caregiver can not spend that
      amount of time with each patient.

      Investigators therefore propose to associate CIMT with another top down technique:
      visual-spatial cueing (use of panels and/or visual messages to encourage the conscious use of
      the AA) and investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment on learning
      transfer to ADL.

      The objective of our study will be to test the feasibility of setting up such an
      intervention.
