        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female, ≥ 12 years and ≤ 75 years of age.

          2. Signed informed consent form that meets all criteria of current Food and Drug
             Administration (FDA) regulations. For subjects who are considered minors in the state
             the study is being conducted (&lt; 18 years in most states), the parent or legal guardian
             should sign the consent form and the child will be required to sign a subject &quot;assent&quot;
             form.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 kg/m2 and 39 kg/m2, inclusive, for subjects &gt; 18
             years old. For subjects 12 to 18 years old, BMI between 15 kg/m2 and 35 kg/m2,
             inclusive.

          4. Female subjects who are of non-childbearing potential must meet one of the following
             criteria:

               -  surgically sterile (e.g., bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, hysterectomy or
                  permanent sterilization procedures), with the procedure performed at least 3
                  months before initial dosing

               -  naturally postmenopausal (no menses) for at least 1 year before initial dosing
                  and/or has a documented FSH level ≥ 40 mIU/mL at screening

               -  pre-menarchal

          5. Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating at Screening or
             Randomization as confirmed by a negative serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of 25
             mIU/mL of human chorionic gonadotropin at Screening, and a negative urine pregnancy
             test with a sensitivity of less than 50 mIU/mL at all other visits. The subject may
             enter the placebo run-in period prior to receipt of test results at Screening, if not
             yet received from the clinical laboratory, but should be evaluated by the Investigator
             for continued participation once test results are received.

             Women of childbearing potential must agree to the use of a reliable method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, intrauterine device, a double-barrier method,
             oral, transdermal, injected or implanted non- or hormonal contraceptive), throughout
             the study. A sterile sexual partner is not considered an adequate form of birth
             control. Subjects on hormonal contraceptives must have been on the same hormonal
             contraceptive for at least one month before the Screening and continue throughout the
             duration of the study.

          6. Diagnosis of asthma (based on National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP]
             guidelines) at least 12 weeks before Screening.

          7. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 40% and ≤ 85% of predicted at Screening and Randomization.

          8. Airway reversibility ≥ 15% of FEV1 within 30 minutes after receiving 4 puffs of
             albuterol inhalation (360 mcg, pressurized metered-dose inhaler) at Screening.

          9. Able to discontinue use of their asthma medications during the run-in period and for
             the remainder of the study.

         10. Able to replace current short-acting beta-agonists [SABAs] with the study supplied
             salbutamol/albuterol rescue inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study.
             Subjects must be able to withhold all SABAs for at least 6 hours before lung function
             assessments on study visits.

         11. Able to continue on stable regimen of theophylline for the duration of the study and
             able to withhold theophylline as judged by the Investigator for the required time
             intervals before study visits. See Section 10.2.4 for required washouts.

         12. Able to discontinue oral corticosteroids, parenteral corticosteroids and oral SABAs
             for the time intervals before study visits as specified in Section 10.2.4.

         13. Able to perform valid and reproducible pulmonary function tests as per ATS American
             Thoracic Society including no evidence of spirometry effort-induced
             bronchoconstriction.

         14. Currently non-smoking (including vapor cigarettes), no use of any tobacco products
             within 1 year prior to Screening and has ≤ 10 pack-years smoking of historical use
             (i.e., one pack per day for 10 years).

         15. Ability to use the inhalation products correctly.

          1. Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnoea; respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s), or asthma-related hospitalizations
             within one year before Screening or during the run-in period.

          2. Allergy or significant history of hypersensitivity, idiosyncratic reactions, or

             pneumonia, viral bronchitis, sinobronchitis, etc.), sinus infection, or middle ear
             infection within four weeks before Screening or during the run-in period.

          5. Current evidence or history of cardiovascular disorders, including uncontrolled
             hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery disease, known aortic or cerebral aneurysm,
             myocardial infarction or stroke, and/or current coronary insufficiency that, in the

             evaluations.

          6. Cardiac arrhythmia or 12-lead ECG abnormalities that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would compromise subject safety or interfere with the evaluations; or a

             phenothiazines, polycyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

          8. History of posterior subcapsular cataracts or glaucoma that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would compromise subject safety.

          9. Any clinically significant finding on physical exam or clinical labs that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would compromise subject's safety or data integrity.

             would compromise subject safety or interfere with the evaluations.

         11. History of convulsive disorders.

         12. History of hyperthyroidism.

         13. History of uncontrolled diabetes.
