  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of blindness is avoidable. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
      that 80% of cases of visual impairment could be prevented or reversed with early diagnosis
      and treatment. The leading causes of visual impairment are cataract and refractive error,
      followed by glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).
      Loss of vision from these conditions is not inevitable; however, identifying at-risk cases
      and linking cases with appropriate care remain significant challenges.

      To address the global burden of avoidable blindness, eye care systems must determine optimal
      strategies for identifying people with or at risk for visual impairment beyond opportunistic
      screening. Outreach programs can prevent blindness both by screening for asymptomatic disease
      like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma and case
      detection of symptomatic disease like cataract and refractive error. Eye care systems have
      developed numerous community-based approaches to these identification methods, including
      screening using telemedicine and case detection via cataract camps or community health worker
      models, but no studies have been conducted on the comparative effectiveness or cost
      effectiveness of these various approaches.

      Technology promises to greatly improve access to sophisticated eye care. AMD, DR, and
      glaucoma can result in irreversible vision loss, and early diagnosis and effective treatment
      can prevent progression.Thus, community screening programs may prevent progression and
      improve the vision of a population.However, mass screening for eye disease is currently not
      recommended. Although self-evident that early detection can prevent blindness for an
      individual, no randomized controlled trial has been able to demonstrate that screening
      improves visual acuity at the community level. However, recent technological advances promise
      to dramatically change the equation by allowing non-medical personnel to use
      mobile,easy-to-use retinal imaging devices to diagnose screenable eye diseases such as AMD,
      DR, and glaucoma. Mobile technology could also transform the way clinics communicate with
      their patients, improving linkage to and retention in care.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an ideal test for community-based screening. OCT can be
      performed through an undilated pupil and is less subject to optical aberrations due to
      cataract than is fundus photography. OCT machines have pre-installed algorithms to screen for
      glaucoma, and major anatomical abnormalities can easily be detected even by novice
      technicians. The infrared image allows detection of referable diabetic retinopathy, and newer
      OCT angiography machines offer even more discrimination of early diabetic retinopathy. OCT
      machines are ever more portable, and could be feasibly used in community-based screening
      programs.

      The investigators propose a large cluster-randomized trial in Nepal to compare two
      community-based blindness prevention programs: (1) a state-of-the-art screening program
      employing OCT and intraocular pressure testing to screen for glaucoma, DR, and AMD followed
      by enhanced linkage-to-care to the local eye hospital, and (2) a screening program involving
      only visual acuity assessment. An initial door-to-door census will assess baseline visual
      acuity in both study arms. The investigators will compare visual acuity between the two arms
      through a second door-to-door census 4 years later (primary outcome). The investigators
      maximize their chances of finding an effect by conducting the study in Nepal, where the
      burden of undiagnosed eye diseases is high. If successful in Nepal, future studies could
      assess the generalizability of such a program to other settings, such as rural communities in
      the industrialized world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will consist of a large cluster-randomized trial in Nepal in which all
      communities receive visual acuity screening during a baseline census, and then half
      subsequently receive screening with OCT and intraocular pressure testing with an iCare
      tonometer. Participants with abnormal results will be referred to the local eye hospital for
      examination and treatment. Repeat visual acuity assessment will be performed 4 years later.
      Those with incident visual impairment at the time of the final census, defined as visual
      acuity worse than Snellen 20/60 (Metric Snellen worse than 6/18; logMAR worse than 0.48),
      will receive a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause of visual impairment.

      Specific Aim 1 - Visual Acuity: To determine whether an intensive screening program results
      in better visual acuity at 4 years than screening with visual acuity testing alone. The
      investigators hypothesize that individuals from clusters randomized to the intensive
      screening program will have better visual acuity compared to those receiving visual acuity
      testing alone.

      Specific Aim 2 - Eye Disease: To determine whether an intensive screening program reduces the
      incidence of visual impairment due to AMD, DR, or glaucoma. The investigators hypothesize
      that incident visual impairment due to AMD, DR, or glaucoma will be less common in clusters
      randomized to the intensive screening program.
