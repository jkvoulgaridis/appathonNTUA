    <textblock>
      Depression symptoms are common in Parkinson's Disease, it affects health-related quality of
      life. The evidence showed that exercise improved depression and HRQOL in PD patients.
      However, studies rarely considered the appropriate exercise program for PD patients, we want
      to find the best exercise program for PD patients.

      Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of a 8-week multimodal exercise program on depression
      and HRQOL in PD Patients.

      Methods: Single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, from March 2016 to January 2017.
      Ninety-eight patients recruited to 2 groups: exercise group (n = 49) and control group (n =
      49). The primary outcomes were depression and HRQOL; the secondary outcomes were activity of
      daily living, motor ability, fatigue, sleep quality and anxiety. Data collection at baseline,
      week 4 and 8 after intervention. Intervention were Multimodal Exercise Program, at least
      three times (30 - 50 minutes per section) a week or 10-15 minutes per section every day to
      accumulate 150 minutes a week for 8 weeks.

    <description>consisting of 15 questions, was the primary outcome evaluator (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986). Scores of 0-4 are considered to be normal; 5-8 indicates mild depression; 9-11 indicates moderate depression; and 12-15 indicates severe depression.</description>

    <measure>PDQ-8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A sub-set of items is then selected from the PDQ-39 to create a shorter form version, the PDQ-8 (Jenkinson, Fitzpatrick &amp; Peto, 1997). The sum of the scores can provide a single figure used to assess the overall health-related quality of life profile of the individual questioned. . Scores for each dimension range from 0 to 100, PDQ-8SI scores can be standardized on a scale from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better HRQoL.</description>

    <measure>UPDRS part II (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease (Fahn &amp; Elton, 1987). The UPD rating scale is the most commonly used scale in the clinical study of Parkinson's disease. A total of 199 points are possible (199 represents the worst disability and 0 no disability). Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs). The scales part 2: motor experiences of daily living (13 items), each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

    <measure>UPDRS part III (motor ability)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease (Fahn &amp; Elton, 1987). The UPD rating scale is the most commonly used scale in the clinical study of Parkinson's disease. Its 42 items are evaluated by interview and clinical observation. The motor section in particular to follow the progression of a person's Parkinson's disease. A total of 199 points are possible (199 represents the worst disability and 0 no disability). The scales part 3: motor examination (18 items), each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale is a 9-item scale which measures the severity of fatigue (Krupp, LaRocca, Muir-Nash, &amp; Steinberg, 1989). The subject is asked to read each statement and circle a number from 1 to 7, the items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. The minimum score=9 and maximum score possible=63. Higher the score=greater fatigue severity.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, &amp; Kupfer, 1989). It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. A total score of &quot;5&quot; or greater is indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety (HAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety Scale (HAS), a self-assessment scale, was developed to detect states of, anxiety and emotional distress, used to screen for the presence of anxiety, in a general medical population of patients (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety. For both scales, scores of less than 7 indicate normal, 8-10 indicate mild anxiety, 11-14 indicate moderate anxiety and 15-21 severe anxiety.</description>
