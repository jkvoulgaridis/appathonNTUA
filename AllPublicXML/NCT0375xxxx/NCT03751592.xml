      This Ib / IIa clinical trial program focuses on the small cell lung cancer (SCLC), Squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and adeniform NSCLC in order to start a better development
      on the broad-spectrum value of chlorogenic acid： Determine the Disease control rate（DCR）of
      phase Ib/IIa of Chlorogenic acid for injection in the advanced Lung Cancer Patients.

    <description>Chlorogenic acid for injection is polyphenols, micromolecular and un-endogenous substance. It might play the role of cancer treatment via balancing tumor micro-environmental immune status according to the stability and rationality of immunodeficiency and endogenous immune material expression around the tumor. Chlorogenic acid for injection is made from chlorogenic acid (purity≥98%) which is extracted from folium cortex eucommiae.Chlorogenic acid and its preparations have not been reported as chemical drug and marketed around the world.</description>
