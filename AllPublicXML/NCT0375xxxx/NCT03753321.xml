  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a constant effort to find ways to make a quicker recovery between demanding workouts and
      football matches, this study is the first to investigate the benefits of protein
      supplementation, and compares two types of proteins, an animal-derived (whey) and a
      plant-derived (soy) protein, after an exercise-induced muscle injury caused by a speed
      endurance training protocol. Soy protein could be a cheaper and more environment-friendly
      alternative for athletes involved in high-velocity strength training.

      A randomized, three-trial (placebo vs. whey protein isolate vs. soy protein isolate
      consumption), cross-over, double-blind design.

        1. A 1-week adaptive period: based on a dietary analysis, participants will be given a
           dietary plan [taking into account the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total daily
           physical activity related energy expenditure], providing a standard protein intake of
           0.8-1 g protein/kg/day over the initial 1-week adaptive period. This protein intake is
           accepted as the average and population-safe protein intake during periods of very low
           physical activity and/or exercise levels. RMR, daily dietary intake and physical
           activity will be measured before the adaptive period. Familiarization with the training
           protocol will take place during this phase.

        2. Baseline performance testing: After the adaptive period and before the pre-loading phase
           of each trial, volunteers will participate in a performance testing procedure at
           University facilities. These measurements include:

           A) measurement of descriptor variables: body composition (DXA), b) VO2max, c) Yo-Yo
           intermittent endurance level 2 (Yo-Yo IE2), d) Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2
           (Yo-Yo IR2), and e) tests of technical skill level B) Measurement of dependent
           variables: a) isokinetic strength (concentric, eccentric and isometric) of knee
           extensors and flexors of both lower limbs, b) counter movement jump height (CMJ), c)
           repeated sprint ability (RSA), d) speed (10 and 30 m), e) delayed onset of muscle
           soreness (DOMS), f) blood sampling for measurement of lactate concentration, creatine
           kinase activity (CK) and inflammatory markers.

        3. Trial 1:

             -  A 7-day Loading Phase: after baseline performance testing, volunteers will receive
                supplement 1. Participants will consume daily for the whole week 0,25 g/kg body
                weight (BW) one of the three supplements randomly (placebo, whey or soy protein).

             -  On the 7th day, participants will repeat performance testing and blood sampling
                (2B).

             -  On the 8th day, participants will perform the experimental protocol. During
                training, participants internal (heart rate) and external load (total distance,
                speed zones, acceleration and decelerations, impacts) will be monitored using heart
                rate monitors and global positioning system (GPS) instrumentation.

             -  Immediately after the training protocol: measurement of blood lactate, CMJ and
                DOMS. Isometric strength testing and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) will
                be measured every hour for the first 3 hours of recovery.

             -  1-Day post-exercise: Blood sampling and measurement of dependent variables will
                take place at 24 hours of recovery.

           During trial, daily diet intake will be monitored so that participants will repeat the
           same feeding pattern during trials 2 and 3.

           • 2-Days post-exercise: Blood sampling and exercise training protocol will take place at
           48 hours of recovery. Immediately post-exercise and every hour for the first 3 hours of
           recovery will be performed the measurements of dependent variables as described for the
           first bout.

        4. Wash-out period: 2-week without any activity or supplementation between trials 1 and 2.

        5. 2nd trial: repeat of stages 3 and 4.

        6. 3rd trial: repeat of stage 3.
