  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS (Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of the week 6 and 12 from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is used to measure changes in joint pain on 6 and 12 weeks after administration in comparison with baseline. It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is presented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>K-WOMAC (Korean-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of the week 6 and 12 from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>K-WOMAC is used to measure changes in joint pain and function on 0, 6, and 12 weeks after administration in comparison with baseline. It measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>KSF-36 (Korean-Short Form Health Survey 36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of the week 6 and 12 from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>KSF-36 is used to measure changes in physical and mental function on 0, 6, and 12 weeks after administration in comparison with baseline. It is a 36-item self-report measure designed to assess health-related functioning. It contains eight subscales with four pertaining to physical functioning and four pertaining to psychological functioning. Scores on each subscale can range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing better health-related functioning. Two composite scores are calculated by averaging all of the scores for four subscales pertaining to each of the two general aspects of functioning.</description>
