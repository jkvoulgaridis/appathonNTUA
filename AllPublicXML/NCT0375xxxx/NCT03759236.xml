  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prevention of cervical cancer and genital warts could be achieved by immunization
      with the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines commercially available. However, in
      the U.S. only 38% of females and 14% of males in the recommended age group (9-26 years)
      receive the complete, three-dose HPV vaccine. Because the HPV vaccine is covered under the
      Vaccine for Children Program, the underinsured and uninsured have no-cost access.
      Nonetheless, data from Los Angeles county suggest that HPV vaccination rates among the
      uninsured and underinsured groups are significantly lower than the national average, likely
      related to knowledge of the vaccine, transportation, number of doses and concern of side
      effects.

      Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of health oriented text messaging to increase HPV vaccine
      uptake versus standard health messaging (Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HPV
      vaccine information flyers).

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that receiving general health messaging, including
      messages regarding the benefits of the HPV vaccine, will increase HPV vaccine uptake. Text
      messaging will also be more successful in reaching the uninsured and underinsured populations
      than will traditional flyers/information pamphlets used in clinics.

      Methods: A cluster randomized trial design will be used to recruit participants from four
      clinics in Los Angeles County which offer pediatric vaccination to uninsured and underinsured
      children. The sample will include women aged 18-45 years of age. Two of the sites will be
      randomized to the text messaging arm and the other clinic will be randomized to the control
      arm (standard messaging: CDC flyers and pamphlets available for patients at the clinic).
      Outcome measures will be HPV vaccinations rates at those clinics. Rates will be defined into
      groups who received 1 dose, 2 doses and 3 doses.

      Anticipated Results: The investigators expect to find statistically significant higher HPV
      vaccination rates among children and women in the text messaging study arm compared to the
      control arm.

      Implications and Future Studies: This pilot study will give us preliminary data to submit a
      larger randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of text messaging.

      Prevention of cervical cancer and genital warts could be achieved by immunization with the
      prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines commercially available. However, in the U.S.
      only 38% of females and 14% of males in the recommended age group (9-26 years) receive the
      complete, three-dose HPV vaccine. Because the HPV vaccine is covered under the Vaccine for
      Children Program, the underinsured and uninsured have no-cost access. Nonetheless, data from
      Los Angeles county suggest that HPV vaccination rates among the uninsured and underinsured
      groups are significantly lower than the national average, likely related to knowledge of the
      vaccine, transportation, number of doses and concern of side effects. The primary objective
      of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of health oriented text messaging to increase
      HPV vaccine uptake versus standard health messaging (Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) HPV vaccine information flyers).

      The investigators hypothesize HPV vaccine uptake will be improved through the receipt of
      general health messaging that includes HPV vaccine messages. Such messaging will increase
      knowledge about HPV vaccine availability, as well as improve the perceptions around HPV
      vaccination. Text messaging will also be more successful in reaching large population groups
      than traditional flyers/information pamphlets used in clinics.

      First, among our three participating clinics, the investigators convened community advisory
      boards (CABs) of individuals who are English and Spanish speaking to identify appropriate
      text messages including content, length of message and frequency of messaging (once a week,
      every other week). Topics included HPV vaccine messages, contraceptive information on
      hormonal contraception, long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, dysmenorrhea,
      frequent menses, and vaginal discharge. The investigators focused on all topics and
      specifically messaging of HPV vaccine that are considered neutral and yet compelling. The
      investigators built upon the feedback obtained from the CAB. Each clinic serves at least 500
      uninsured and underinsured children that offer regular HPV vaccination to these children. Of
      these three clinics, two of the sites will be randomized to the intervention arm (text
      messaging) and 1 site to have CDC flyers only. The sites currently collect information on all
      immunization given at their site. The sites will de-identify their vaccine rates for HPV at
      the end of the study and send us the de-identified data sets for vaccine rates, age (not
      birth date) and number of nursing/doctor visits made by age group.

    <description>Clinics randomized to this arm will receive the health messaging via SMS intervention. Flyers and information cards will be made available in all exam rooms and the waiting room, which contain information about the health messaging program. Patients must voluntarily elect to enroll in the program using their mobile device. Patients who enroll will receive a variety of health messages on topics including HPV Vaccine, Cervical Cancer screening, Birth Control options, Menstrual Problems, diet and exercise. Text messages are sent out using a third party interface, Twilio, at a frequency of 2 times each week for a duration of 1 year. These are one-way messages which only allow for texts to be sent to the participant.</description>
