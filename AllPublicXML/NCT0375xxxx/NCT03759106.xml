  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide and its incidence is on
      the rise. Importantly, loss of arm function occurs in up to 85% of stroke survivors, with a
      significant long-term impact on activities of daily living, leisure activities and work. The
      capacity for recovery following a stroke depends on several factors, including the extent of
      the initial neurological damage, spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation, with possible
      recovery even years after the stroke. Unfortunately, accessibility of much needed
      rehabilitation services poststroke often remains limited, both in terms of intensity and
      duration, as reported in a recent report on post-stroke rehabilitation services in Quebec.
      Recent evidence suggests that homebased telerehabilitation (TR) is a viable approach for
      upper limb training post-stroke when rehabilitation services are not available. Similarly,
      the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care update for 2013 recommends
      home-based patient monitoring be used when frequent monitoring is needed and face-to-face
      visits are not available. Hence, the investigators have developed and propose to examine the
      use of the VirTele system for people who have suffered a stroke who are no longer receiving
      rehabilitation services The VirTele system allows upper limb rehabilitation using exergames
      with ongoing off-line monitoring combined with online monitoring and coaching based on the
      self-determination theory.

      More specifically, the primary objective of the RCT is to provide preliminary evidence
      regarding efficacy of the VirTele program for upper limb motor control recovery in chronic
      stroke. Secondary objectives are to: i. Determine the effect of the VirTele program on upper
      limb function, quality of life and motivation; ii. Determine the feasibility of using the
      VirTele program with users at home (e.g. adherence, safety, technical difficulties,
      facilitators and barriers); iii. Explore the role that shared decision-making and empowerment
      play in exercise program adherence and progression, and in behavior modification for
      upper-limb use.

      This study will also provide evidence of feasibility for conducting a larger-scale RCT
      comparing different technologies and interventions for chronic stroke rehabilitation.

      A single-blind (evaluator) two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed for this study
      with participants who have had a stroke randomly allocated to: (1) 8-week training with the
      VirTele system.i.e. treatment group or (2) 8-week written home exercise program provided by a
      clinician (GRASP), i.e. exercise control group.

    <description>The Motor Activity Log is a questionnaire that the participant completes reporting how much the impaired upper limb is used for various daily tasks, each task is scored from 0-5 (ordinal scale, 0=do not use arm - 6=use as much as before), total score is mean of the scores.</description>

    <description>The Wolf Motor Function test consists of tasks that are performed by the participant with the impaired upper extremity, the tasks are rated for the quality of movement and the time taken. Items are scored on a 6 point scale, from does not attempt to movement is normal. Times tests are truncated at 120 seconds. A mean score out of a maximum of 5 is calculated.</description>
