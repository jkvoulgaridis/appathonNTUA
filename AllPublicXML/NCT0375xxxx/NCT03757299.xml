  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women
      because of the difficulty in implementing screening programs. The main obstacles in these
      countries are poverty, lack of healthcare infrastructures and trained practitioners. With the
      availability of new technologies, researchers are looking for new strategies adapted to low-
      and middle-income countries to identify cervical precancerous lesions.

      Current evidence shows that Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing is more effective than
      cytology (Pap smear) for cervical cancer screening in resource-limited settings. Indeed, the
      GeneXpertÂ® HPV test offers the opportunity to prevent cervical cancer (CC) in a single visit:
      rapid detection of high-risk HPV (HPV) infection followed by same day treatment of
      HPV-positive women during the same visit (screen-and-treat approach).

      However only a small proportion of HPV-positive women will develop cervical (pre)cancer,
      making it important to select those to treat. This triage can be achieved by colposcopy,
      cytology and visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA). Though VIA is the
      triage test recommended by WHO for resource-limited countries, it has not yet been widely
      assessed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

      Our main objective is to assess the performance of HPV-test followed by Visual Inspection
      after application of Acetic acid and Lugol's iodine VIA/VILI to detect cervical precancerous
      lesions in a screen-and-treat strategy in Cameroon (sub-Saharan Africa) where there is no
      cervical cancer-screening program.

      We organized a successful free screening campaign in Cameroon in 2015 that allowed us to
      identify the expectations of women and their eagerness to benefit from prevention of
      gynecological cancers and sexually transmitted diseases.
