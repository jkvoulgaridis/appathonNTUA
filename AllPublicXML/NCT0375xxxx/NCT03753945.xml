  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients implanted with deep brain stimulation (DBS) is
      under strict safety guidelines. Depending on the body part being imaged, the safety may vary.

      Many DBS patients will need a spine MRI based on their clinical symptoms. However, the vendor
      safety guidelines are limiting in terms of possible MR pulse sequences. Based on phantom
      safety data, we designed a set of MR pulse sequences deemed as safe as possible and the
      protocol allows acquisition of diagnostic quality MRI images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who clinically require a spine MRI will undergo a spine MRI with our designed
      protocols to obtain diagnostic quality images. Furthermore, a limited brain MRI will be done
      before and after to ensure no peri-electrode tissue changes.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective cohort study that will enroll patients who have already undergone DBS electrode placement for a variety of disorders including, but not limited to Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, depression, epilepsy, neuropathic pain and Alzheimer's disease. This eligible patient population is broad but unified by the fact that they have undergone DBS to treat specific circuit dysfunctions. Patients with internalized leads and IPG may be included. Patients will undergo routine clinical MRI sequences used for the spine (structural in axial and sagittal planes). The choice of imaging the cervical, thoracic or lumbar will depend on the requisition from the treating physician.</intervention_model_description>

Patients who have already undergone surgery for implantation of DBS electrodes and patients for whom the treating physicians recommends (based on clinical grounds) a spine MRI (cervical, thoracic or lumbar) shall be recruited for the study.This eligible patient population is broad but unified by the fact that they have undergone DBS to treat specific circuit dysfunctions. Patients with internalized leads and IPG may be included. Patients will undergo routine clinical MRI sequences used for the spine (structural in axial and sagittal planes). The choice of imaging the cervical, thoracic or lumbar will depend on the requisition from the treating physician.</description>
