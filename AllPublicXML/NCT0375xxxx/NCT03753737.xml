  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemsex refers to the use of psychoactive drugs in a sexual context, mainly cathinones,
      GHB/GBL, methamphetamine, cocaine and ketamine. This can cause infectious or psychiatric
      complications, addictions, and often goes with high risk sexual behaviours. Recent studies
      have highlighted the relationship between personality disorders, substance use disorders and
      risky sexual behaviours. It is important to understand the factors associated with chemsex in
      order to offer adapted prevention and care plans.

      The study hypothesis is that personality disorders, evaluated with the PDQ-4+ questionnaire,
      are more frequent among man having sex with other men with a substance use disorder linked to
      chemsex than among man having sex with other men who have never practised chemsex.
