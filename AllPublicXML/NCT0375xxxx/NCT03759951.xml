  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observing a lack of research investigating the chronic physiological and psychological
      responses to this type of exercise training the aim of this study is to investigate the
      optimal training configurations of DoIT to produce positive effects on health, performance
      and quality of life markers in sedentary overweight or obese adults aged 30-55 years. The
      DoIT program will be performed in a small-group setting indoor or outdoor implementing a
      progressive manner for 12 months and using bodyweight exercises with alternative modes.

      This controlled, randomized, four-group, repeated-measures clinical trial will be consisted
      of the following stages:

        1. Initial testing: body weight and height, RMR, daily physical activity (PA), daily
           nutritional intake.

        2. a 4-week adaptive period: based on a dietary analysis, participants will be given a
           dietary plan (considering the RMR and total daily physical activity related energy
           expenditure), providing an isocaloric diet over the initial 4-week adaptive period.
           During this adaptive period, volunteers will also be familiarized with exercises
           techniques and overload patterns that will be used throughout the study through 4
           preparatory sessions.

        3. At the end of the adaptation period, participants will participate in assessment
           procedures (baseline testing) at University facilities.

        4. After the adaptive period all participants will be randomly assigned to four groups
           (control, 1 session/week, 2 sessions/week, 3 sessions/week). The exercise protocols that
           will be used throughout the 1-year intervention will be consisted of 8-12 neuromotor
           exercises in circuit fashion applying prescribed time (15-45 sec) of effort and passive
           recovery intervals.

        5. After 12 months of exercise intervention all participants will participate in assessment
           procedures (post-training testing) at University facilities within 5 days after the
           completion of the last training session.

      All participants will be randomly assigned to the following four groups:

        1. Control group (no training)

        2. DoIT-1 (1 session/week)

        3. DoIT-2 (2 sessions/week)

        4. DoIT-3 (3 sessions/week)

    <measure>Change in anxiety.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which is an instrument that has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical self.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical self will be measured using the Physical Self-Perception Profile (PSPP), which is an instrument with 30 questions comprising five 6-item subscales. Each item has a four-point structured-alternative format. Scores range from 6 to 24 on each subscale, with high scores representing positive perceptions. Half of the items are worded in the negative direction.</description>
