  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to use the images a mother would have done as part of her normal medical care and
      make both 3D animations and 3D models of the baby and it's CDH. This will both help the
      parents see what the problem is and also allow the surgeons, who will operate on the baby
      once it has been born, to see the size of the hole and what organs are in the wrong place.
