  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional tissue oxygenation saturation has been shown to increase in innervated regions after
      sympathetic block. The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the
      changes of regional tissue oxygenation saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy after
      successful femoral nerve block with ropivacaine and determine whether the changes of regional
      tissue oxygenation saturation can be affected by the concentration of ropivacaine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful peripheral nerve blocks induce sympathetic blockade, which increases local blood
      flow by vasodilation. The relationship between successful femoral nerve block and the
      variation of regional tissue oxygenation saturation was unclear.

    <description>Patients scheduled for elective knee arthroscopy with peripheral nerve block will receive ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block with 0.5% ropivacaine. Regional tissue oxygenation saturation of the nerve innervation area and pinprick sensory tests at 5 min were assessed before the block and at 5-min intervals till 30 min after the block.</description>
