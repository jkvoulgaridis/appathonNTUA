  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of Stratacel® wound dressing
      on cosmetic outcomes following 1064/532nm picosecond laser (Picoway®, Syneron Candela Corp,
      Wayland, MA, USA) treatment of abdominal striae alba. Secondary objectives include examining
      the effect of Stratacel® wound dressing on post-laser healing and symptomatology.

    <textblock>
      Twenty adult subjects with abdominal striae alba will be enrolled. All striae will be treated
      using the 1064/532nm picosecond laser with designated and standardized settings (Appendix A).
      The abdominal striae treatment region will then be split across the body vertically with one
      half randomized to Stratacel® and the other to placebo, clear ultrasound gel (Aquasonic). A
      blinded study coordinator will apply the products to each randomized half-abdomen immediately
      following laser treatment.

      A total of 3 treatments will be completed at 1 month intervals. Blinded-investigator and
      subject self-assessments will be performed at post-treatment days 2, 5, 7, and 10 after each
      laser session. Assessments will also be performed 1 and 3 months after the final laser
      treatment.
