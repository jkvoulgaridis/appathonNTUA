    <textblock>
      This study compared the cost effectiveness of two-stage algorithm (prolotherapy injections
      (PrT) combined with rehabilitation protocol (RP) prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA)) and
      one-stage algorithm (TKA) in the management of advanced stage knee osteoarthritis.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the cost effectiveness of two-stage algorithm
      (prolotherapy injections (PrT) combined with rehabilitation protocol (RP) prior to total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA)) and one-stage algorithm (TKA) in the management of advanced stage knee
      osteoarthritis.

      A total of 197 patients who had chronic knee osteoarthritis were included in the present
      study. The patients were divided into two groups as two-stage algorithm (PrT combined with RP
      prior to TKA), (Group A, n=98) and one-stage (TKA),(Group B, n=99). Clinical effectiveness
      was evaluated via Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Arthritis Index (WOMAC) at baseline and 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups. Utility scores
      of the groups were obtained by extracting and converting WOMAC scores to health utilities
      index mark 3 scores. Cost-utility per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and Incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of each group were calculated.
