    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this trial is to investigate the iron bioavailability from new
      infant cereals in Malawian infants.

    <textblock>
      In 30 infants aged 6 to 14 months old, the investigator will administer in random order over
      2 phases separated by 14 days, 5 infant cereals containing either ferrous fumarate (4 meals)
      or ferrous bisglycinate (1 meal) intrinsically labeled with stable isotopes. The investigator
      will collect one blood sample at baseline and another sample at the end of each phase, thus 3
      samples total. In these samples, fractional iron absorption and markers of iron and
      inflammation status will be measured . In addition, infant and child acceptability of one of
      the infant cereals will be assessed by using a questionnaire.

    <description>Fractional iron absorption of 54FeFum (test cereal A), 57FeFum (test cereal B), 54FeFum (test cereal C). Based on the shift of Fe isotope ratios in the blood samples and the amount of Fe circulating in the body, the amounts of 54Fe and 57Fe isotopic label present in the blood 14 days after the test meal administrations will be calculated on the principle of isotope dilution and considering that the iron isotopic labels are not mono-isotopic</description>
