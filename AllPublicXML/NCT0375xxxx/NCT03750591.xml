    <measure>NRS change from Baseline NRS at discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (admission), discharge (up to 14 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric rating scale (NRS) of low back pain, and radiating leg pain In pain measurement using NRS, patients are asked to rate their pain by selecting a number from 0 to 10 that best represents their pain severity between the anchors of 0 which indicates 'no pain', and 10 which indicates 'worst pain possible'.</description>

    <measure>ODI change from Baseline ODI at discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (admission), discharge (up to 14 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) The ODI evaluates functional impairment and is a 10-item questionnaire developed to assess the level of disability due to back pain. Each item is graded into 6 levels, each representing a score of 0-5. Higher scores indicate greater limitation relating to back pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PGIC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient global impression of change (PGIC) PGIC grades the level of subjective improvement into 7 levels (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, slightly improved; 4, no change; 5, slightly worse; 6, much worse; and 7, very much worse).</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D change from Baseline EQ-5D at each time point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (admission), 2 weeks after baseline, discharge (up to 14 weeks after baseline), 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5 Dimension(EQ-5D) EQ-5D is a tool developed for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment, and is widely used in the health care sector. Scores range from -1, 'health worse than death' to 1, 'perfect health'. EQ-5D-5L has 5 dimensions covering current health status and functionality: mobility (M), self care (SC), usual activities (UA), pain/discomfort (PD), and anxiety/depression (AD), to be rated out of 5 grades (1, no problem; 2, slight problem; 3, some/moderate problem; 4, severe problem; 5, extreme problem).</description>

    <measure>Lumbar ROM from Baseline Lumbar ROM at each time point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (admission), 2 weeks after baseline, discharge (up to 14 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Lumbar Range of Motion(ROM) (Flexion/Extension/Lateral flexion/Rotation) Pain upon movement in lumbar range of motion (ROM) will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SLR from Baseline SLR at each time point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (admission), 2 weeks after baseline, discharge (up to 14 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Straight Leg Raise test(SLR) The straight leg raise(SLR)is a test done during a physical examination to determine whether a patient with low back pain has an underlying herniated disc, often located at L5 (fifth lumbar spinal nerve).
If the patient experiences sciatic pain when the straight leg is at an angle of between 30 and 70 degrees, then the test is positive and a herniated disk is a possible cause of the pain.[3] A negative test suggests a likely different cause for back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AE</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events(AE) Physicians will monitor and record any unexpected or unintended patient reaction to integrative korean medicine at each visit. Adverse events (AEs) associated with integrative korean medicine will include, but not be limited to, AEs anticipated from previous reports of korean medicine, and will stay open to all possibilities taking into consideration other potential, unknown AEs.</description>
