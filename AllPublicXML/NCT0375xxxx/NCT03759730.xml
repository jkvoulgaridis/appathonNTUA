    <textblock>
      This is a minimal risk feasibility study involving the analysis of patient samples and does
      not involve any therapeutic intervention. The study will involve a prospective cohort of up
      to 60 patients diagnosed with Locoregionally-Advanced Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
      (LA-OPSCC) treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of microbiome evaluation in LA-OPSCC patients undergoing CRT using
      samples collected by four different methods: Saliva, Oropharyngeal swab over the tumor site
      (OP), Stool, and Rectal swab (optional).

      This study is investigating the role of oral microbiota as a biomarker in LA-OPSCC. This is a
      minimal risk study involving the analysis of patient samples and does not involve therapeutic
      intervention. This protocol does not determine eligibility to receive treatment with
      concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is anticipated that patient accrual will be
      completed within 12 months.

      The study will involve a prospective cohort of up to 60 patients diagnosed with LA OPSCC
      treated with CRT at Princess Margaret Cancer Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written and voluntary informed consent.

          2. Patient must be willing and able to provide collection for saliva, OP swab and stool
             specimen analyses at 2 time points. Rectal swab is optional.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years, male or female.

          4. Patient must be diagnosed with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the
             oropharynx (soft palate, tonsils, base of tongue).

          5. Patients must be eligible for curative-intent concurrent treatment with radiotherapy
             and chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with patient
        safety, or evaluation of the collected specimen and interpretation of study result.
