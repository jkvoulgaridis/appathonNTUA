    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and
      tumor celltebiz related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase III study, Patients who failed at
      least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were
      treated with anlotinib (12mg, po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle) or placebo, the
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months.

      It is an open, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to
      Recruiting103 patients who were progressed after first line systemic therapy and
      refused/can't tolerate chemotherapy. Patents receive 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to
      14 of a 21-day cycle until progression of disease, assess safety and efficacy of the drug.
