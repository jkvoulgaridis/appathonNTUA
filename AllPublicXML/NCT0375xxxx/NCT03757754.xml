  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the photosensitizer (PS)
      2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) for injection in patients with
      Esophageal Cancer. It was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of HPPH and efficacy of HPPH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of multiple ascending injection doses of HPPH in Patients with Esophageal Cancer. Up to 30
      patients are planned to be enrolled in 6 cohorts with each cohort consisting of 3-6 patients
      ( male and/or female patients). In each cohort, patients will receive HPPH and Lyophilized
      treatment. The dose escalation in Cohorts was from 2.5 to 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 6mg/m2 of HPPH,
      respectively, administered intravenous drop infusion over 1 hour, once daily, and a fixed
      light dose of 150 J/cm delivered 48 hours after infusion of HPPH.
