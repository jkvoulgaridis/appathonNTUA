  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is one of the major public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. It contributes
      significantly to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in affected countries.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of enhanced case detection using molecular
      testing (LAMP) on maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in a prospective study design.

      A pilot prospective diagnostic efficacy study will be conducted from October 2018 until
      October 2019 in pregnant mothers at three sites in Ethiopia. Both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic first trimester mothers will be included in the study and individually
      randomized to either standard of care or one of two enhanced cased detection arms using LAMP
      for malaria. Mothers in the first trimester will be enrolled during a seven month period from
      October 2018 to October 2019 and then followed until delivery. Given the rate of pregnant
      mothers at the three sites, we anticipate 500 mothers in total enrolled in the study during
      the study period. In the first standard of care arm, venous blood sample will be collected
      from each study participant and the presence of Plasmodium infection will be diagnosed by
      microscopy in symptomatic patients. Pregnant women who test positive for malaria will be
      referred and treated for malaria with quinine or artemisin combination therapies (ACTs) as
      per national guidelines. In the second (test) arm, mothers will be tested by a commercially
      available CE-approved LAMP malaria test at each clinic visit in lieu of microscopy. In the
      third (test) arm, mothers whether symptomatic or asymptomatic will be tested by both
      microscopy and LAMP for malaria at each clinic visit and treated if positive by either test.
      Pregnant mothers who require treatment will be referred and treated with either quinine or
      artemisinin combination therapy (ACTs) as per national guidelines. The primary outcomes are
      (i) maternal anemia (ii) infant anemia at birth and (iii) fetal birth weight in each of the
      three arms.

    <description>One quarter of individuals get allocated to the standard of care arm. If the pregnant mothers are symptomatic, they receive microscopy and then are treated with anti-malarial therapy if microscopy is positive. If it is negative they receive no treatment. If they are asymptomatic, they do not receive any further investigations or treatment.</description>

If they are asymptomatic, they also receive microscopy only and then are treated with anti-malarial therapy if is positive. If it is negative then they receive no treatment.</description>
