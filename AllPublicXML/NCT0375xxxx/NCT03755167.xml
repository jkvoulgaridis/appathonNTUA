    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, follow up study to protocol 101/2 - continued treatment by
      IPL344 IV administered once a day in up to 15 participants with ALS.

      The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of IPL344,
      administered once a day, by IV infusion for up to 36 months

The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 min) ordinal rating scale used to determine a subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. There are 12 questions, graded by the subject 0-4 (4 is normal). Score of 0 (worst) to 48 (best). Reflects speech and swallowing, fine motor skills, large motor skills, and breathing</description>
