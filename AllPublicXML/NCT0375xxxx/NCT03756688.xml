  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel penile traction
      device in restoring penile length loss secondary to diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men with diabetes mellitus experience sexual dysfunctions at an earlier age and higher rate
      compared to men without diabetes. One of these sexual dysfunctions includes diminished penile
      length. It is currently unknown if the decreased length is due to earlier erectile
      dysfunction or secondary to diabetes itself. Penile traction therapy is one of several
      treatments which have been used historically to treat decreased penile length, however, to
      date, no studies have evaluated the role of traction therapy in men with diabetes. To
      accomplish the study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic with a diagnosis of diabetes, type
      II will be enrolled and will be randomized to utilize the device for varying amounts of time.
      Outcomes will be assessed at the 3 and 6 month time points, and the results are to be used
      with the intent to publish in a scientific journal.
