      Patients enrolled into the study will be randomly allocated either to Empagliflozin group or
      control group. In the Empagliflozin group patients will be receiving standard care +
      Empagliflozin 10 mg o.d., in the control group patients will be receiving standard care
      without sodium glucose contransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

The questionnaire is comprised of 21 important physical, emotional and socioeconomic ways heart failure can adversely affect a patient's life. After receiving brief standardized instructions, the patient marks a 0 (zero) to 5 scale to indicate how much each itemized adverse of heart failure has prevented the patient from living as he or she wanted to live during the past 4 weeks. The questionnaire is simply scored by summation of all 21 responses.
Score ranges from 0 (best quality of life) to 105 (worst quality of life).</description>
