  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elective surgery is the most effective treatment option for colorectal cancer, however it has
      been recognized to be associated with high morbidity and mortality risks.

      ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) is a preoperative multimodality treatment package,
      which has been well investigated and proved to be effective in reducing early postoperative
      morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and hospital costs, as well. Still, a good
      proportion of patients are not suitable for ERAS program, mainly based on lack of compliance
      and the impaired physical function before surgery.

      Prehabilitation Program is a recently introduced trimodal preoperative preparation (training)
      program, which addresses improvement of physical, mental and nutritional status of the high
      risk elective surgery patients.

      This study aims to investigate the benefit of all efforts of a 4-6-week preoperative
      preparation program (Prehabilitation) being added to an established ERAS protocol.

      Aim:

      Colorectal cancer patients with a planned resection are tested if a complex, trimodal
      rehabilitation program can hold functional and morbidity benefit for them.

      In the prospective, randomized (1:1) study control patient group will be the well established
      and tested ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) Program.

      Study protocol in details:

        1. First visit: Outpatient Department of Surgery

           On both arms:

           • Physical examination

             -  Operation indication, type of procedure and date of procedure agreed;

             -  Organizing further investigations, anesthesia;

             -  Operative risk assessment (&quot;ACS - surgical risk calculator&quot;);

             -  Study patient identifier Nr generated;

        2. Nurse-led ERAS/Prehab clinic: randomization

           On both arms:

             -  Randomization (Prehabilitation Program / ERAS Program).

             -  Nurse led clinic assessment (&quot;study nurse&quot;):

           MUST, Body fat % measurement). .iv. Mental hygienic status assessment (smoking, alcohol
           consumption, anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders).

           .v. Cardiovascular status (resting HR, RR). .vi. Operative risk assessment (CR-Possum
           score). .vii. Preoperative counseling (operation type, preparation, pain management,
           discharge plan).

           .viii. Preoperative nutritional planning (education, nutrient prescription). .ix.
           Alcohol intake and smoking cessation - information given. .x. Stoma education started.
           .xi. Consent signed, patient workbook handed over. .xii. Respiratory test referral.

        3. Physiotherapy, first visit

           Both on control and interventional arms:

             -  Respiratory function test recorded.

             -  Physical status tested (6MWD) on a treadmill.

           • Physical assessment: 6MWD, FVC.

           • Next week activity planned.

        5. Psychic preparation

           Just on Prehabilitation arm:

             -  Once a week half an hour group relaxation training - regardless of the stage of
                prehabilitation program.

        6. Admission to the Surgical Ward a day before surgery

           ECG. .iii. Respiratory function tests. .iv. Physical status (6MWD) .v. Mental status
           (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) assessment.

             -  Preoperative preparation (as to ERAS protocol).

             -  Postoperative care (ITU, pain management, mobilization, oral nutrition built up,
                drains early removal, complications recorded (Clavien-Dindo-classification)).

                Medical Outcomes Study).

        7. Postoperative follow up:

      Both on control and interventional arms:

      • Assessment (4th and 8th week post op.):

      .i. Anthropometrics (BMI, Body fat %) .ii. Cardiovascular status (resting HR and RR). .iii.
      Respiratory function tests. .iv. Physical status (6MWD).
