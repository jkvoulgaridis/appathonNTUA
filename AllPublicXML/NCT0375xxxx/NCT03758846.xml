  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological impairment such as stroke and aging is a leading cause of adult disability.
      Traditional rehabilitative therapies can help regain motor function and ameliorate
      disability. There are increasing community and other facilities offering rehabilitation in
      the form of conventional, recreational and alternative (Yoga, Tai-chi) therapy. However, the
      implementation of these conventional therapy techniques in individuals with a neurological
      disorder like stroke and the elderly population is tedious, resource-intensive, and costly,
      often requiring transportation of patients to specialized facilities. Based on recent
      evidence suggesting significant benefits of repetitive, task-orientated training,
      investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative therapies such as
      exergaming based therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling
      individuals with neurological impairments and the elderly, compared to conventional
      therapeutic rehabilitation. This pilot study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on
      compliance and efficacy as well as performing power analysis and sample size calculation for
      developing it into a randomized controlled trial for extramural funding purposes. The
      objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility, compliance and efficacy of
      exergaming therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling chronic stroke
      individuals and the elderly population.

      While conventional balance training facilitates balance control and gait functions, the
      exercises involved in the training are labor-intensive, highly repetitious leading to
      monotonicity and decreased motivation levels. Therefore, many health care researchers are
      involved in identifying various methods to reduce the risk of falls addressing the barriers
      in conventional training methods while having the potential to translate it at home. A pilot
      study identified that supplementary cognitive training along with Wii-fit balance training
      resulted in improving dual-task volitional balance control post-stroke. Based on this
      preliminary finding, this current pilot study aimed to identify:

        1. The efficacy of cognitive-motor exergaming (with Wii-fit) compared to conventional
           balance training among people with chronic stroke

        2. Exergaming (with Kinect) on domains of balance control and cognition among people with
           chronic stroke

        3. The efficacy of Exergaming (with Kinect) compared to conventional balance training
           method on domains of balance control and cognition among healthy older adults

      This pilot study used Wii-fit Nintendo/ Microsoft Kinect, an off the shelf, commercially
      available and a cost-effective device that provides similar benefits of exergaming.
      Community-dwelling people with chronic stroke and healthy older adults involved in the study
      underwent 6 weeks of exergaming or conventional balance training in a tapering manner in a
      laboratory setting. Participants were assessed for motor and cognitive performance in the
      laboratory during volitional and reactive balance control while performing a secondary
      cognitive task. The performance outcome determined the effect on cognitive-motor interference
      during dual-tasking.

    <description>A total of 6 Wii-fit games: Bubble balance, Table Tilt, Tightrope walking, Soccer head, Basic Run and Basic Step. A total of 6 cognitive tasks namely Digit recall, repeated letter, word list generation (category and alphabets), mental arithmetic, analogies. Each session was divided into 3 sub-sessions. Every Wii-fit game was played with any 3 cognitive tasks. The combination of games with cognitive tasks was randomized in such a manner that all the cognitive tasks were played with the Wii-fit games in that session. Breaks were provided after each sub-session or when the participant demanded one or when the research personnel noticed any discomfort of the participant.</description>
