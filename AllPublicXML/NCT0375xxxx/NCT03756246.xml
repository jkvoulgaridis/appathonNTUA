      The purpose of this study is to determine differences between the immune responses in healthy
      and depressed people. Specifically subjects are provided a mild immune stimulus, an influenza
      vaccine, and their responses are monitored. The goals are to determine whether patients with
      depression experience a temporary worsening of mood in response to the stimulus and whether
      this is associated with measurable differences in the cytokine response to the vaccine.
      Additionally, patients with depression may be less likely to mount a successful antibody
      response to vaccination as healthy people based on circumstantial evidence, and this study
      will assess whether this the case.

      This study aims to recruit a sample of 15 healthy and 60 depressed participants. The 15
      healthy participants will be age and gender matched to the first 15 depressed participants
      recruited. Three more sets of age and gender matched depressed subjects will be recruited.
      This will result in 15 sets of &quot;quintuplets&quot; (4 depressed and one healthy), that are matched
      by age and gender. The study consists of four visits. The first visit is the baseline
      assessment where participants will receive the influenza vaccine. Participants will then
      return 1, 3 and 28 days after receiving the vaccine to assess their responses.

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedules Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>We will compute change in scores on the PANAS-x subscales between baseline and day 1. Self reported assessment that contains both positive and negative words and phrases that describe different feelings and emotions. Subjects read each item and mark the appropriate answer for how they feel right now as they fill out the form. Possible answers and the associated score are: (1) Not at all, (2) A little, (3) Moderately, (4) Quite a bit, (5) Extremely. To rate, responses to items in each scale are summed. The scales in the PANAS are listed below with the number of items in that scale in parentheses followed by the total range of the scale.
General Dimensions Negative Affect (10) 10-50 General Dimensions of Positive Affect (10) 10-50 Negative Emotion Fear (6) 6-30 Hostility (6): 6-30 Guilt (6): 6-30 Sadness (5) 5- 25 Positive Emotion Joviality (8) 8-40 Self-Assurance (6) 6-30 Attentiveness (4) 4-20 Other Affective States Shyness (4) 4-20 Fatigue (4) 4-20 Serenity (3) 3-15</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cytokine Concentration (pg/mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Days</time_frame>
    <description>We will compute differences in cytokine (IFN- α, IFN-y, IL-6, IL1-β and TNF-α) values for each subject between baseline and day 1 and days 1 and 3. Using OLS regression we will compute regressions between hypothesis appropriate time points using baseline CRP, QIDS, PANAS score and BMI as covariates.</description>

    <time_frame>3 Days</time_frame>
    <description>After determining the difference in the PGE4/LipoxinA4 ratio between days 1 and 3, we will perform a similar regression.</description>

    <measure>Tryptophan Metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate difference between baseline and day 1 in the KYN/TRP and KYNA/QUIN ratios and us them in regression models as above, correcting for two tests.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HPA Axis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Days</time_frame>
    <description>To test the hypothesis that ACTH/cortisol affects peak inflammatory cytokine levels in MDD, we will use similar OLS regression models including HPA-axis response as a covariate and examining its interaction with cytokines as the dependent variables.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fold Change</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>: Fold change from pre- to 28 days post-vaccine will be calculated for each of the three influenza strains targeted by the vaccine. Fold change &gt; 4 to any one of the three strains will be considered &quot;success.&quot; Proportion of successful vaccination will be compared between HC and MDD using a linear model adjusted for age and pre-vaccination titer, which have been shown to affect antibody response.</description>
