  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of novel measurement and fitting methods for individualizing
      CE-labelled Sonova brand hearing instruments (e.g. Phonak hearing instruments) is intended to
      be conducted on hearing impaired participants. The aim of the study is to investigate and
      asses strength and weaknesses of these novel measurement and fitting methods in terms of
      optimizing hearing performance and experience and/or usability of the hearing aids and
      accessories. Both laboratory measurements as well as evaluations in real life environments
      will be carried out. This will be a controlled and randomised active comparator clinical
      evaluation which will be conducted mono-centric at Sonova AG Headquarter based in Stäfa.
