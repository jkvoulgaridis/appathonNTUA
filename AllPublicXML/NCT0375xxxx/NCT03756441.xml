      The research aims to verify the effects of the Mindfulness Based Health Promotion (PSBM)
      program on the quality of life of mothers of person with intellectual disability. Method: A
      randomized, controlled study with pre-post intervention measures and a follow-up measurement
      will be performed after six months of the end of the intervention. Sample: It will be
      composed of mothers of the 209 attended with moderate intellectual disability, adolescents
      and adults of the Service of Socioeducation of the Association of Parents and Friends of the
      Exceptional (APAE) of São Paulo, excluding those who have any psychiatric problem in the
      acute phase and minors, or who have regular practice of mindfulness or meditation in the last

      Outcomes and Instruments to be used: As primary endpoint the quality of life of the family
      caregiver will be observed and as a secondary outcome the caregiver's overload will be
      observed. As explanatory variables will be considered anxiety, depression, functionality and
      level of attention to the present moment (mindfulness). The investigators will use focal
      group, Sociodemographic questionnaire, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale,
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Brief Autocompaction Scale, World Health Organization
      Quality of Life Scale Brief Version, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Qualitative Analysis
      Questionnaire - Semi-Structured, Informal Caregiver Burden Assessment Questionnaire, Number
      of Practices and Adverse Effects. Procedure: The mothers of people with intellectual
      disability (ID) will be invited to participate in the research protocol. Having knowledge of
      the subject, agreeing to participate and signing the consent form, will respond to the
      questionnaires identified above, with a total duration of approximately 1 hour and 30
      minutes. Subsequently the participants will be randomized into two groups, in which one will
      receive the mindfulness intervention and the other, active control, will participate in a
      Problem Solving Training. The protocols of questionnaires and focal group will be performed
      before, immediately after the accomplishment of the groups and in the follow-up of six
      months. The intervention group will last 8 weeks, according to the Mindfulness Based Health
      Promotion Program (PSBM) and during this same period the active control group will occur.
      Hypotheses and expected results: Mindfulness is expected to contribute to the improvement of
      the quality of life of this population, and so the investigators can contribute to the
      scientific increase in the theme.
