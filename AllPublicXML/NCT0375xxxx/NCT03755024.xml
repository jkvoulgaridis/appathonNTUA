  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal mortality and morbidity continue to be major global health challenges strongly
      associated with prematurity and reduced fetal growth, an issue of further interest given the
      mounting evidence that fetal growth in general is linked to degrees of risk of common
      noncommunicable diseases in adulthood. Ultrasound estimation of fetal weight before birth is
      today very widely used in clinical practice, and, while essential for the identification and
      management of high-risk pregnancies,the current reference ranges used worldwide are largely
      based on single populations from a few high-income countries and are therefore of uncertain
      general applicability.

      Against this background, WHO made it a high priority to provide fetal growth charts for
      estimated fetal weight and common ultrasound biometric measurements intended for worldwide
      use. WHO study was conducted in 10 countries including Egypt (Assiut).The study showed that
      fetal growth differs significantly between countries. Growth was to a small extent influenced
      by maternal age, height, weight, and parity, and by fetal sex. The study suggested that these
      WHO charts for growth are more suitable for international use than those commonly applied
      today. However, the differences between countries, with maternal factors, and with fetal sex
      mean that these growth charts may need to be adjusted for local clinical use to increase
      their diagnostic and predictive performance. In our setting, we are using the charts built in
      the ultrasound machines based on studies done in western countries. So, it is prudent now to
      implement the WHO fetal growth charts in our setting
