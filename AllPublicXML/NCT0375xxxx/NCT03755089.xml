  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox速) bladder injections are a highly effective treatment for
      overactive bladder and urgency urinary incontinence. The procedure is typically performed in
      the office setting with one of two medications to control comfort. However, the effectiveness
      of these medications has never been compared. The goal of this study is to determine which
      medication is better at providing comfort during bladder Botox速 injections.

      The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the analgesic effect of oral
      phenazopyridine to that of intravesical lidocaine during intradetrusor injections of
      onabotulinumtoxinA performed for idiopathic overactive bladder. The investigators will
      achieve this by measuring the mean visual-analog pain scores (VAS) in women who are
      randomized to receive either oral phenazopyridine or intravesical lidocaine.

      Secondary aims include assessment of:

        1. Overall Patient Satisfaction: To compare overall patient satisfaction with the
           onabotulinumtoxinA injection procedure in women randomized to pre-procedure oral
           phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation.

        2. Ease of Procedure: To compare the physician's perception of ease of onabotulinumtoxinA
           injection procedure in women randomized to pre-procedure oral phenazopyridine versus
           those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation.

        3. Office Efficiency/Total Appointment Duration: To compare total appointment time or total
           time spent in an office exam/procedure room in women randomized to pre-procedure oral
           phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation.

    <measure>Analgesic Effect Measured with 100mm Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale is a visual representation of pain severity rated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Therefore higher numbers represent more pain.The scale is represented visually using a 100 millimeter line and patients indicate their level of pain by pointing to a location on the line.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Overall patient satisfaction with the onabotulinumtoxinA injection procedure in women randomized to pre-procedure oral phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation. Overall satisfaction will be measured with a single-item question utilizing a Likert scale with options ranging from very satisfied to very unsatisfied.</description>

    <description>Physician's perception of ease of onabotulinumtoxinA injection procedure in women randomized to pre-procedure oral phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation. This will be measured with a single item, five point Likert scale with options ranging from no difficulty to great difficulty.</description>

    <description>Total appointment time or total time spent in an office exam/procedure room in women randomized to pre-procedure oral phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation. This will be measured by subtracting the appointment start time (time the patient was placed in the exam room) from the appointment end time (time of patient check-out).</description>
