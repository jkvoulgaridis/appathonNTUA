      The aim of this study is to test the clinical effects of a web and mobile application of
      guided Problem Solving Therapy for depressive symptoms among the general population in
      Turkey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Turkey, there are serious deficiencies in mental health care. Among these, undertreatment
      of mentally ill patients, lack of psychologists and inadequate psychosocial and
      rehabilitation options for patients and their relatives are important prohibiting factors
      that reduce patients' outreach for getting help. While depression is highly prevalent (4.4%),
      only a small number of people seek professional help (18%) in Turkey. Innovative solutions
      are needed to overcome this treatment gap. Online Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) is a brief
      intervention proven to be effective in the treatment of depression, although little is known
      about its clinical effects in Turkey.

      The aim of this study is to test the clinical effects of a web and mobile application of PST
      for depressive symptoms among the general population in Turkey.

      Participants will be recruited through announcements in social media and the Middle East
      Technical University. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 444 participants
      randomized across three groups will be utilized. The first experimental group will receive
      direct access to the web version of the intervention; the second experimental group will
      receive direct access to the mobile app of the intervention as well as automated supportive
      text messages based on PST. The control group consists of a wait-list and for ethical
      reasons, participants in this group will gain access to the intervention (either web or
      mobile application) four months after the baseline. The intervention is based on an existing
      PST for the Turkish population, &quot;Her Sey Kontrol Altinda&quot; (HSKA).

    <measure>Change on Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PSWQ will be used to measure pathological worry. It has 16 items in total. Each item can be scored on a five-point scale from 1 (not at all typical of me) to 5 (very typical of me), with a total score varying from 16 to 80. Higher scores indicating greater worry.</description>

    <measure>Change on Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS will be used to measure the perception of stress. It consists of 10 items for which the total score range is 0-40. Each item is rated on a five-point scale, from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Higher scores indicating greater stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The GSE is a measure to assess self-efficacy beliefs. It contains 10 items, which are rated on a four-point scale from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (exactly true). The total score varies from 10 to 50. Higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy beliefs.</description>

    <measure>Change on EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L will be used to measure quality of life. It consists of 5 items each measuring different dimensions of health status (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The items are rated on a five-point scale from level 1 to level 5 (no problems; slight, moderate; severe and extreme problems). All the answers to each item are combined resulting in 3125 possible health states, ranging from 11111 (full health) to 55555 (worst health). Furthermore, there is a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) measuring a global rating of self-perceived health. This is scored by 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine).</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with the intervention questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 weeks after baseline only in the two experimental groups</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about each module to define their satisfaction with the module concerned ('Was this lesson useful to you?'). The answers can be rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very useful).</description>
