  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will introduce cancer survivors to the sport of CrossFit with the expectation that
      the program proposed will ultimately result in superior improvements in functional
      performance, body composition and quality of life compared with the current American Cancer
      Society (ACS) guidelines for cancer survivors.

      A 13-week pilot intervention study introducing a high-intensity functional training program
      (CrossFit) to 16 cancer survivors and evaluate the effects of this program on patient quality
      of life, functional capacity, and body composition. Response rates will be determined using
      various recruitment methods and estimate differences in response rates by patient
      characteristics including race, gender and age. Barriers to participation in the program in
      contacted patients who do not enroll as well as patients who enroll and do not complete the
      program will be described, as will participant satisfaction with enrolled participants who
      complete the program. The goal of this pilot study is to help refine the recruitment and
      program methods for a larger intervention study to test the superiority of a high-intensity
      interval functional training program compared with current American Cancer Society guidelines
      in improving functional capacity, body composition and patient reported quality of life.

      Surveys will be completed by each participant weekly and physical assessments will be
      completed monthly.

    <description>Quality of Life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G), developed by Dr. David Cella. The FACT-G is 27 items assessing physical, social/ family, emotional and functional well-being. The survey uses a five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scoring the FACT-G is performed through a sum of item scores. Higher scores indicate a better health state.</description>

             patients will have completed treatment, however if a patient is currently under
             treatment, this should be their oncologist. If the patient is not currently undergoing
