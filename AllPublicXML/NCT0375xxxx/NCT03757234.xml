  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (iv) or
      iv/per oral (po) omadacycline as compared to iv or iv/po levofloxacin in the treatment of
      female adults with acute pyelonephritis.

      This was a randomized (1:1:1:1:1), double-blind, double-dummy, adaptive designed, Phase 2
      study. Based on review of the efficacy and microbiology data, the DMC modified the
      randomization algorithm, and no further participants were enrolled in the following treatment
      arms after May 2019: the omadacycline 200 iv/100 iv, omadacycline 200 iv/300 po or 100 iv,
      and omadacycline 200 iv/450 po or 100 iv arms. After this change, participants were
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the omadacycline 200 iv/200 iv or levofloxacin arms.

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response at the Post Therapy Evaluation (PTE) Visit (ITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21 (A PTE occurred on Day 21 ± 2 days after the participant's first dose of study drug).</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was determined by the investigator at the PTE visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the clinical outcome of Clinical Success, Clinical Failure, or Indeterminate. Clinical Success was defined as the complete resolution or significant improvement of the baseline AP signs and symptoms at the PTE visit such that no additional antimicrobial therapy is required for the current infection. Clinical Failure was defined as no apparent response to therapy or persistence of signs and symptoms of infection or reappearance of signs and symptoms at or before the PTE visit such that use of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy for the current infection was required or death at or before the PTE visit. The clinical outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the PTE visit was not completed.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Microbiological Response at the PTE Visit (Micro-ITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21 (A PTE occurred on Day 21 ± 2 days after the participant's first dose of study drug).</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological response was determined programmatically at the PTE visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the microbiological outcome of 'Success', 'Failure', or 'Indeterminate'. Participants were considered to have a microbiological response of 'Success' if the outcomes of each baseline pathogens were eradication at the PTE visit. Participants were considered to have a microbiological response of 'Failure' if the outcome for any pathogen was persistence. Participants were considered to have a microbiological response of 'Indeterminate', if the outcome of at least 1 baseline pathogen was indeterminate and there was no outcome of persistence for any baseline pathogen.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Resolution of All AP Signs and Clinical Symptoms at PTE Visit (ITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21 (A PTE occurred on Day 21 ± 2 days after the participant's first dose of study drug).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded their assessments using the Modified Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (mPSAQ), a 6-item questionnaire that assessed the levels of 'severity' and 'bothersomeness' for six pyelonephritis signs and symptoms. The sub-scale responses were recorded as 'did not have', 'mild', 'moderate', and 'severe' for 'severity'; and 'not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', and 'a lot' for 'bothersomeness', both scored 0-3. Total scores were calculated by summing the non-missing scores of the 6 items, divided by the number of non-missing items, and then multiplied by 6. For each sub-scale, the total score ranged from 0 (least Severe/ least bothersome) and 18 (worst severity/most bothersome). Number of participants with resolution of all symptoms, without occurrence of new symptoms is reported. Resolution was defined as absence of all baseline symptoms.</description>

For each sub-scale, the total score ranged from 0 (least Severe/ least bothersome) and 18 (worst severity/most bothersome). Number of participants with no worsening and absence of AP signs and clinical symptoms is reported. No worsening meant that each question score is same or better at post baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a study drug or in a clinical study. A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any adverse event that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity on or after the initiation of the study drug.</description>

        <description>Clinical response was determined by the investigator at the PTE visit by assessing whether or not the participant met the clinical outcome of Clinical Success, Clinical Failure, or Indeterminate. Clinical Success was defined as the complete resolution or significant improvement of the baseline AP signs and symptoms at the PTE visit such that no additional antimicrobial therapy is required for the current infection. Clinical Failure was defined as no apparent response to therapy or persistence of signs and symptoms of infection or reappearance of signs and symptoms at or before the PTE visit such that use of additional systemic antimicrobial therapy for the current infection was required or death at or before the PTE visit. The clinical outcome was deemed as Indeterminate when the PTE visit was not completed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Resolution of All AP Signs and Clinical Symptoms at PTE Visit (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Participants recorded their assessments using the Modified Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (mPSAQ), a 6-item questionnaire that assessed the levels of 'severity' and 'bothersomeness' for six pyelonephritis signs and symptoms. The sub-scale responses were recorded as 'did not have', 'mild', 'moderate', and 'severe' for 'severity'; and 'not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', and 'a lot' for 'bothersomeness', both scored 0-3. Total scores were calculated by summing the non-missing scores of the 6 items, divided by the number of non-missing items, and then multiplied by 6. For each sub-scale, the total score ranged from 0 (least Severe/ least bothersome) and 18 (worst severity/most bothersome). Number of participants with resolution of all symptoms, without occurrence of new symptoms is reported. Resolution was defined as absence of all baseline symptoms.</description>
