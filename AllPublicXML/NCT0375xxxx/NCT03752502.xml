  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neuromatrix pain model and new findings on pain chronification process point to a greater
      efficacy of treatments that address central and peripheral rather than only peripheral
      structures. Both cerebral and peripheral electrical stimulations can modulate brain areas
      involved in pain processing. However, their effects on pain modulation systems and clinical
      outcomes are lacking.

      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      and peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) alone as well tDCS combined with PES on pressure
      pain threshold and conditioned pain modulation in healthy subjects.

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and Post-test (immediately after tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>Conditioned pain modulation paradigms consist of the evaluation of a painful test stimulus followed by a second evaluation either at the same time as a distant, painful conditioning stimulus.
PPT will be evaluated following a conditioning stimulus condition (hand immersion in a cold water).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test (before tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) for anxiety assesses anxiety symptoms that we tracked as possible confounding factor.
The VAS for general anxiety is assessed by a horizontal 100-mm-long line. The extreme left end points to no anxiety, and the extreme right end to the worst anxiety possible.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test (before tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>Beck depression inventory (BDI) for depressive symptoms that we tracked as possible confounding factor.
The BDI is a tool of self-assessment of depression using a questionnaire with 21 items whose intensity varies from 0 to 3 (higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test (before tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>Catastrophizing pain scale that we tracked as possible confounding factor.
The pain catastrophizing scale consists of 13 sentences describing pain-related thoughts or feelings. These are divided into 3 domains: rumination, magnification and helplessness.
The total score on the questionnaire can lie between 0 - 52 where a higher score indicates higher levels of pain catastrophizing thoughts.</description>
