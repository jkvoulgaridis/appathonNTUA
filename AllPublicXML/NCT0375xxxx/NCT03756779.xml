  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are performing a pilot cross-over diet study involving 5 patients with heterozygous FH and
      5 patients with unexplained ADH. The patients will be randomized to a low versus high
      saturated fat diet for 4 weeks each. We hypothesize that patients with unexplained ADH may
      have an exaggerated cholesterol response to saturated fat intake. The specific aim of this
      study is to quantify the increase in LDL-C in unexplained ADH patients compared to FH
      patients. The pilot study proposed here will develop preliminary data to be used for future
      funding proposals of larger, randomized studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults, age &gt; 18 years or &lt; 80 years

          2. Pre-treatment LDL-C greater than the 95th percentile for age and sex (corresponding to
             190 mg/dL for most adults), with one of the 2 following criteria: (1) tendon xanthoma
             (proband or first-degree relative) or (2) either first-degree relative with premature
             CHD (age less than 55 years in men or 65 years in women) or pretreatment LDL-C greater
             than the 95th percentile for age and sex.

          3. Willing to come off medical therapy 4 weeks before and during study.

          4. Willing to follow high/low saturated fat diet

          5. Willing to attend dietary counseling sessions

          6. Willing to attend frequent clinic visits

          7. Subjects willing to participate under the conditions described in the informed consent
             form (ICF) and able to sign the ICF and applicable HIPAA forms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of any clinically significant uncontrolled endocrine disease known to
             influence serum lipids or lipoproteins. Note: patients on thyroid replacement therapy
             can be included if the dosage of thyroxine has been stable for 6 weeks prior to the
             first study visit and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is within the normal
             range.

          2. Conditions of severe acute vascular stress (e.g. acute coronary syndrome, ischemic
             stroke, or major vascular surgery) within 3 months prior to the first study visit.

          3. Patients unable to maintain their current activity level or planning to increase their
             activity level (e.g. new exercise regimen).

          4. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          5. Major illness

          6. Secondary cause of dyslipidemia (e.g. obstructive liver disease, hypothyroidism, or
             nephrotic syndrome)

          7. Hospitalization within 3 months

          8. Substance abuse (illegal drug use, chronic alcoholism or problematic use of alcohol or
             total daily alcohol intake &gt;2 drinks per day in men and &gt; 1 drink per day in women).

          9. Immunodeficiency or HIV-positive status

         10. Illiteracy

         11. Severe medical condition that may impair the ability of the person to participate in a
             nutrition intervention study (e.g. digestive disease with fat intolerance, advanced
             malignancy, or major neurological, psychiatric or endocrine disease)

         12. Any other medical condition thought to limit survival to less than 1 year

         13. Difficulties or major inconvenience to change dietary habits

         14. History of food allergy with hypersensitivity to any of the components of olive oil or
             nuts
