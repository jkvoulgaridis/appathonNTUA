  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist that has been licensed for use as
      second line therapy in ITP patients. Diacerein is a slow-acting medicine of the class
      anthraquinone used to treat joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. The project was
      undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 5 well-known hospitals in
      China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag combined with diacerein in
      the management of eltrombopag combined with diacerein.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a prospective, open, multicentre trial of 30 ITP adult
      patients with eltrombopag-inefficient or relapsed from 6 medical centers in China. The
      initial dose of eltrombopag administration is 25 mg orally once daily, which could be
      transited to 50 mg/d in a 2-week cycle according to the need, and the maximum dose was not
      more than 75 mg/d. The dose of diacerein administration is 50 mg orally twice daily. The
      treatment was discontinued after 6 weeks without blood index reaction.

      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and
      safety of eltrombopag combined with diacerein for the treatment of adults patients with
      eltrombopag-inefficient or relapsed.
