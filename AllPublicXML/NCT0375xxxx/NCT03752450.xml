  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypernatremia is frequently encountered in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      and associated with increased mortality and length of stay. Previous studies focused on
      predictors in the development and recovery of hypernatremia by including amount and types of
      administered medication, fluid balance, laboratory results and changes in vital signs.
      However, data of larger populations or data on infusion rates, fluid and salt balance or
      renal replacement therapy is lacking. This study aims to provide better insight in the
      development and recovery of hypernatremia through the collection of detailed information on
      the input and output of fluids and salts in a larger group of patients than studied before.

      Hypernatremia is frequently encountered in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      and associated with increased mortality and length of stay. The main mechanism is an
      imbalance between sodium and total body water. Consequently, this poses multiple factors to
      play a role in the development of hypernatremia. multifactorial. Previous studies focused on
      predictors in the development of hypernatremia by including amount and types of administered
      medication, fluid balance, laboratory results and changes in vital signs. However, data of
      larger populations or data on infusion rates, fluid and salt balance or renal replacement
      therapy is lacking. Few studies investigated the recovery of hypernatremia, which showed that
      correction of hypernatremia can reduce the associated mortality risk.

      This study aims to provide better insight in the development and recovery of hypernatremia
      through the collection of detailed information on the input and output of fluids and salts in
      a larger group of patients than studied before.

        As a cardiothoracic and oncologic center, the ICU in the Catharina Hospital mostly admits
        postoperative patients. Other categories of admission are sepsis, respiratory
        insufficiency, intoxication. However, all patients with an indication for hemodynamic,
        respiratory of metabolic monitoring will be admitted. The Catharina Hospital is a tertiairy
        referral hospital. The ICU has 32 beds.
