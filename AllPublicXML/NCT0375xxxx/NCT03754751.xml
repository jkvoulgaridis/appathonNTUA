  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the most common surgical procedures in the world.
      Elective LC is commonly performed as one-day surgery, while in an emergency setting of acute
      cholecystitis the in-hospital stay averages 4.5 days. Causes of prolonged rehabilitation
      period are often associated with severe pain syndrome, dyspepsia and postoperative
      complications. The complications rate after LC is about 6% and has no tendency to decrease.
      The implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs may potentially reduce
      stress-associated complications and improve the quality of rehabilitation. A few
      retrospective studies examined their advantages and setbacks in the treatment of acute
      cholecystitis with encouraging results. The aim of this randomized control study is to
      evaluate the modified ERAS program for patients with acute cholecystitis.
