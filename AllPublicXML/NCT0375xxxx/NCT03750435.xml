  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia but can be treated by a catheter procedure
      where specialized wires (so-called catheters) are inserted in the left upper heart chamber.
      This requires crossing the wall between the right and left atrium with a long needle (a
      so-called transseptal puncture or TSP). This is typically done using x-ray guidance or echo
      to check if the needle is in the right position. The investigators developed a method to do
      the TSP without x-rays using a specialized needle that can be also shown as a little icon on
      the 3D electroanatomical mapping system (CARTO).3D mapping systems are routinely used to
      track the location of the catheters in cath labs worldwide, but the position of the needle
      was not tracked yet. The investigators seek to demonstrate that these procedures can be
      carried out safely, successfully and in a reproducible fashion without any radiation by
      taking advantage of &quot;faking&quot; the isolated tip of the needle as a catheter on the 3D mapping
      system. The results will be compared with historic procedures done by the same operator in
      the years 2012-2017.

      The hypothesis is that patients who undergo one or more TSP(s) for atrial fibrillation or
      left atrial tachycardia can be studied without the use of fluoroscopy which should result in
      a low or ZERO overall radiation exposure for the entire ablation procedure. The investigators
      will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this new approach.

      The patient will be admitted in hospital as for a standard procedure and discharged the next
      day. Before admission, the patient undergoes a CMR/CT scan (routine in our centre). To avoid
      total radiation CMR would be preferred, if possible.

      The technique of the TSP and the use of the RF needle is commonly used worldwide. The ability
      to visualize the needle tip on the 3D electroanatomical mapping system facilitates the
      procedure. The additional visualization by TOE helps to assure that the fossa ovalis has been
      correctly identified.

      After the TSP, the ablation procedure itself will be carried out as conventionally performed
      using the catheter visualization on the 3D mapping system.

      An ECG and an echocardiogram are performed before discharge (as standard care).

      At 3 months the patient comes for the first visit and has an ECG, a Holter and symptom
      questionnaire.

      At 6 months, the patient has second visit which includes an ECG, a symptom questionnaire, a
      Holter and an echocardiogram.

      If recurrences of any arrhythmia occur, the patient can be scheduled for a second ablation
      procedure without any restrictions.
