      This study will evaluate a low-cost, low-intensity, computer-based model for delivering
      parenting skills to parents of adolescents in a community mental health clinic. This
      intervention has the potential to improve public health and community practice by making
      empirically-supported treatment techniques more available. We believe this approach will
      improve the efficiency of treatment delivery by integrating computerized and therapist
      delivered approaches, and there is potential for significant improvements in efficacy of
      parent training with this model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a low cost, low intensity, technology based model for delivering
      parenting skills to parents of adolescents in a community mental health clinic (CMHC).
      Specifically, we will test a computer-assisted protocol of Parenting Wisely, a computer based
      parenting program with previously established efficacy. Such an intervention is consistent
      with NIMH strategic plan objective 3.3: &quot;to strengthen the application of mental health
      interventions in diverse care settings by examining community and intervention delivery
      approaches and how they may affect intervention outcomes.&quot; Although this is a pilot
      effectiveness study, we will gather information to inform future implementation efforts
      including the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Additionally, we will
      conduct qualitative interviews with relevant stakeholders (providers/program managers) to
      better understand barriers and facilitators of adoption and sustainability. This goal will
      help increase the likelihood of a successful, future larger trial across multiple CMHCs due
      to its focus on external validity and implementation barriers when making critical design
      decisions. This approach mitigates a major criticism of traditional efficacy/effectiveness
      studies, i.e. that the methods do not translate well to the community due to cost and
      resource constraints, as well as contextual factors.

      The intervention has the potential to improve public health and community practice by making
      empirically supported treatment techniques more available in CMHCs and improving the
      efficiency of treatment delivery by integrating computerized and therapist delivered
      approaches. Specifically, this study has the potential to advance treatment by: 1)
      understanding factors that enhance or impede computer assisted parent training in the
      community setting; 2) addressing a high-needs underserved population with significant public
      health relevance; 3) engaging the target mechanism of therapist fidelity, competency, and
      alliance as well as parenting skills and self-efficacy that have been shown to influence
      adolescent behavior problems; 4) increasing access to and engagement in an evidence-based
      treatment that can be personalized to the specific parenting skills of a family by the
      selection of modules in PW; and 5) enhancing the ease of dissemination and implementation.
      Furthermore, we believe this approach has the potential for improving response rate, because
      the parenting skills will be delivered with greater fidelity than would be typical of
      therapists teaching parenting in sessions in CHMCs. This improvement should also result in an
      improved response in adolescent behavior. We believe this is true because: 1) meta-analyses
      typically report moderate effect sizes for parent training at the end of treatment; 2) parent
      training is underemployed in community clinics; 3) fidelity to treatment protocols is often
      poor which has been shown to diminish effectiveness of treatment; and 4) frequent staff
      turnover creates high resource demands. Thus, we believe this approach is not only efficient
      but that there is potential for significant improvements in efficacy of parent training with
      this model.

    <intervention_model_description>In the Open Trial, all participants will receive PW. In the RCT phase, adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. After completion of the baseline assessment, random assignment of adolescents using blocking and stratification will be automatically generated by the electronic data capture software REDCap. Random block sizes of assignments will be generated to prevent guessing of pending treatment assignments. Stratification will be used to ensure a balance on biological sex and disruptive behavior disorder severity (more of less than T=85), as indicated on the CBCL.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Qualitative feedback from interviews with parents, providers, and program managers will also be conducted. All quaAlitative interviews will be videotaped, transcribed verbatim and coded for nonverbal behaviors in addition to verbal content. We will use an interview guide to ensure the adequacy and quality of data. The guide will be refined to reflect unanticipated topics that arise and integrate these emergent topics and questions[40]. We will approach the interview as a collaborative process with participants and interviewers will encourage each participant to talk freely about the therapeutic process, coverage of parenting skills, and topic areas in PW. Broad questions will be followed by probes and unstructured questions based on areas raised by participants to encourage elaboration and clarification but limit influence from the interviewer.</description>

    <description>The TAU condition consists of the standard treatment elements offered to all Gateway (study site) patients, and will be received by patients in both the PW and the TAU-only condition. TAU services during the adolescent's treatment are typically eclectic and mainly entail meeting with the adolescent alone to provide support and psychoeducation, with occasional family therapy sessions. Medication management is offered as needed.</description>

    <description>In addition to TAU services, the PW arm includes in-person sessions where parents complete computer-administered PW sessions, in-person session including therapist coaching to reinforce PW material and personalize treatment by applying PW skills to individual issues, and access to PW material remotely so parents can access information and skills from home as needed.</description>

    <description>PW is a self-administered, interactive, multimedia online program. Parents will complete computer-administered sessions during in-person appointments.The program comes with a parent workbook so that parents can gain additional exposure to and practice with the skills. The complete PW program takes from 3 to 5 hours to complete depending on the users' speed and depth of use. Parents will be given a login at enrollment so that they have the option to practice sessions or view any additional sessions at home. Individual coaching sessions will take place in-person with parents. Coaching sessions are designed to tailor the PW skills to each parent's presenting concerns.</description>
