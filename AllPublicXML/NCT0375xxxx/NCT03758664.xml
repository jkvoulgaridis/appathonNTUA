      The study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period with 21 days of repeated
      treatment per cycle (duration treatment with ICP-192), and a follow-up period (28 days after
      last dose). The recruited patients receive a single dose on day 1, then after a 3-day washout
      period, repeated dosing will be followed. The starting dose is 2 mg, QD, and dose escalation
      will follow accelerated titration and modified 3+3 dose-finding schema. The dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) assessment period consisted of Cycle 0 (single dose and washout period) and
      Cycle 1 (21-day cycle).
