  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is associated with a significant increase in mortality, cardiovascular
      disease, injuries on eyes and kidneys. These risks are largely dependent on glycemic control.
      Multiple strategies of achieving good glycemic control exist. Despite this, only about 20 %
      of patients in Sweden reach the target HbA1c of ≤ 52 mmol/mol.

      It is well-known that when the motivation is high, a large proportion of patients reach good
      glycaemic control with current treatments, e.g. most pregnant women reach a much better
      glycaemic control. The patient is then motivated to a greater extent in managing the disease,
      e.g. by carefully dosing insulin and more closely monitoring blood glucose levels.

      Moreover, besides lack of motivation, specific psychiatric conditions are well-known barriers
      in being compliant with treatments such as depression, eating disorders and attention deficit
      disorders (ADHD). Further, identified specific diabetes-related psychosocial factors include
      severe fear of hypoglycaemia, diabetes-burnout, unrealistic treatment goals, poor
      relationship with physician, feelings of powerlessness and treatment skepticism. These
      parameters can be measured via a diabetes distress scale where a high score is correlated to
      higher HbA1c.

      The majority of outpatient diabetes clinics in Sweden today request the resource of a
      diabetes-educated psychologist. However, more evidence is needed from randomized multicentre
      trials whether such a resource would help to improve HbA1c, reduce diabetes-related distress
      and improve quality of life.

      The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate whether the assistance of a
      diabetes-educated psychologist in the diabetes care of patients with type 1 diabetes improves
      HbA1c. Secondary endpoints include studying its influence on diabetes-related distress and
      quality of life. The study is a 1 year randomized trial where the intervention group will
      meet with a diabetes-educated psychologist in addition to conventional care.
