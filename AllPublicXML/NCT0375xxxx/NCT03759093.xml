      Clinical trial applying CURATE.AI, a Phenotypic Precision Medicine (PPM) platform, to
      Bortezomib, Thalidomide and Cyclophosphamide dosing in multiple myeloma patients to show
      improvement in response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In conventional combination chemotherapy, drug doses are typically determined using dose
      escalation to reach a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or via dose expansion to identify suitable
      regimen administration guideline, and the combinations are subsequently administered at fixed
      doses. During the course of treatment, the patient's response to therapy evolves and changes
      due to the time-dependent, dose dependent, and patient-specific nature of drug synergy and
      resulting efficacy and tolerability. To overcome this challenge, we have developed CURATE.AI,
      a Phenotypic Precision Medicine (PPM) platform, which has been clinically validated and used
      to prospectively optimize patient liver transplant immunosuppression, and tuberculosis
      therapy, among other indications. In this study, CURATE.AI may improve patient response by
      providing dose recommendations for Bortezomib, Thalidomide and Cyclophosphamide to the
      clinical team over the course of the patient's treatment.
