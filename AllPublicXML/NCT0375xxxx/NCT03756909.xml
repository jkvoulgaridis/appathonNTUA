  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between NLR, PLR and postoperative
      complications in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between the dates of February 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018, patients between 2-10 years of age,
      ASA I-II, elective adenotonsillectomy and adenoidectomy under general anesthesia were planned
      to be included in the study. The number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets will be
      taken from the hospital registry system taken preoperatively and the NLR and PLR ratios will
      be calculated.

      All patients in the operating room will be started with routine monitoring and anesthesia.
      Hemodynamic data during surgery will be recorded. The entrance to the operating room (T1), 5
      minutes after the start of anesthesia (T5), 15 minutes (T15), 30 minutes (T30) and 45 minutes
      (T45) will be recorded in the follow-up form of the anesthesia. The fasting period of the
      patients and the drugs and fluids applied during surgery will be recorded from the anesthesia
      form. At the end of the operation, the patients who were taken to the recovery room at the
      end of the surgery will be evaluated with 1 point, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours
      and 6 hours vomiting using the 4 point nausea scale.

      Introduction to recovery room using Modified Eastern Ontario Children's Hospital Pain Scale
      (mCHEOPS), postoperative pain at 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr and 4 hr. Analgesic requirement will be
      recorded. Bronchospasm, agitation, etc. will be recorded by evaluating whether there are
      complications.

    <time_frame>Postoperative 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain level will be evaluated by using CHEOPS (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ) pain score. The scale includes six categories of pain behavior (Cry, facial, verbal, torso, touch, and legs). A score ranging from 0 to 2 or 1 to 3 is assigned to each activity and the total score ranges between 4 and 13.</description>

    <time_frame>Postoperative 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain level will be evaluated by using POVN score. Evaluation of nausea and vomiting was performed by a four-point scale; 0: No nausea and/or vomiting, 1: mild nausea and/or vomiting which does not require treatment, 2: nausea and/or vomiting requiring treatment and 3: vomiting resistant to antiemetic treatment</description>
