  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a long-term lung condition where the airways become abnormally enlarged,
      leading to a build-up of mucus and inflammation that makes the lungs more susceptible to
      recurrent infection. Patients with bronchiectasis have subtle abnormalities in the way their
      airway cells respond to infection that are, in part, responsible for the development of their
      condition. At present there are no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis.

      This study will aim to characterise in depth some of these abnormalities with a view to
      future studies that will try to develop treatments that can directly target those
      abnormalities at a molecular level.

      Patients known to have bronchiectasis who have provided written informed consent will be
      enrolled alongside healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      and cystic fibrosis, for comparison. Participants will give a blood sample and have a
      bronchoscopy. This is a thin telescopic tube, passed through the nose or mouth, under
      sedation, into the airways that will allow a sample of bronchial epithelial cells to be
      taken.

      The main objective of the study is to achieve a greater understanding of some of the key
      biological processes/pathways and disease marker genes that play a role in the development of
      bronchiectasis. This is important because, at present, little is known about the underlying
      disease mechanisms and there are no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis.

      The investigator's hope this in-depth characterisation of specific bronchial epithelial cell
      abnormalities in bronchiectasis will shed light on novel targets for future drug discovery.
