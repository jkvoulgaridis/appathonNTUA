  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Approximately 7000 stomata are created in the Netherlands every year. The occurrence of a
      parastomal herniation is high, with a reported incidence of 4-48%. Also, the former stoma
      site is at increased risk for the development of an incisional hernia. A clinical incisional
      hernia rate of 30% is reported after stoma reversal. Herniation can cause pain, deformity and
      possibly incarceration, which results in a significant impact on the quality of life of the
      patient.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the use of a prophylactic mesh at the time of stoma
      formation leads to a lower incidence of incisional hernias after stoma reversal, an improved
      quality of life and therefore a possible cost reduction in healthcare.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the incidence of incisional hernias after stoma reversal after preventive mesh
      placement compared to no mesh placement. In addition, we aim to assess the effect of
      preventive mesh placement on the quality of life and the effect on healthcare cost reduction
      by avoiding re-intervention.

      Study design:

      A multicentre double blind randomized controlled trial with a total follow up of 24 months.

      Study population:

      Adults (18-99) undergoing bowel resection with the formation of a temporary stoma.

      Intervention:

      A preventive mesh will be placed using a sublay keyhole technique (pre-peritoneal,
      retromuscular) at stoma formation. The mesh will be left in situ after stoma reversal and the
      hole in the mesh will be closed, to prevent incisional herniation.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        -  Primary: Incidence of incisional hernias after stoma reversal

        -  Secondary: Quality of life, stoma related prolapse or parastomal herniation, cost
           effectiveness and mesh related complications.

      Nature and extent of the burden and the risks associated with participation, benefit and
      group relatedness:

      The standard surgical procedure for the treatment of parastomal hernias is used in a
      prophylactic fashion. As this is standard care in parastomal hernias the risks are minimal.
      The mesh that is used is CE approved. The burden of participation in this study is minimal
      for the patient all follow-up visits coincide with the regular visits for colorectal cancer.
      Hence, no extra outpatient department visits, and even no additional diagnostics nor other
      medical procedures that could potentially burden the patient, are required.

    <description>Cost benefit analysis involving health cost and societal cost due to inability to participate in work. Lower health care cost are considered a better outcome, it is hypothesised that preventive treatment results in less cost by avoiding reoperations and readmission on the long term.
Assessment will be performed using questionnaires; the iMCQ questionnaires for cost effectiveness analysis.
The questions of the questionnaire will be analysed separately, for the questions range from yes/no questions to multiple choice or questions regarding number of days/ hours worked.</description>
