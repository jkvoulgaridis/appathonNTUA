  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although remifentanil provides profound analgesia during operation, postoperative occurrence
      of hyperalgesia and tolerance after remifentanil administration could be a challenge to the
      postoperative pain control. Evaluation of analgesia and anti-nociception during anesthesia is
      still a challenging issue. Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) is a non-invasive and simple access
      tool used to monitor autonomous nervous system during anesthesia. This technique is based on
      photoplethysmographic wave and heart beat analysis. SPI values range between 0 (no stress)
      and 100 (high stress level). The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate use
      of Remifentanil for pain control in patients with SPI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized into either SPI-guided analgesia or standard practice (Control). In
      both groups, anesthesia was maintained with total intravenous anaesthesia(TIVA) to keep
      bispectral index values between 40 and 60.

      In the Remifentanil gradual reduction group (test group), 20 minutes before the end of the
      operation, remifentanil was gradually decreased by 25% every 5 minutes. The control group
      stopped remifentanil 10 minutes before the end of the operation.

      SPI was recorded before the intubation, after the intubation, directly before the end of
      surgery. The number of unwanted somatic events, hemodynamics, Patient-controlled
      analgesia(PCA) consumption, narcotic analgesics consumption, and recovery times were
      recorded.

    <intervention_model_description>In this study, remifentanil gradually withdrawal goup (test group) and remifentanil immediately stop group (control group) were divided into two groups. In the Remifentanil gradual reduction group (test group), 20 minutes before the end of the operation, remifentanil was gradually decreased by 25% every 5 minutes. The control group stopped remifentanil 10 minutes before the end of the operation.</intervention_model_description>
