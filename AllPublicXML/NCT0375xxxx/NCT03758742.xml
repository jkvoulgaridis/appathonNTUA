  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes costs the U.S. healthcare system more than any other disease, and nearly half of
      Americans will develop either diabetes or prediabetes in their lifetime. It is therefore
      critical to find new strategies to treat or reverse diabetes.

      One such approach is adopting a healthy diet, which can dramatically improve blood sugar
      levels in adults with type 2 diabetes and even induce diabetes remission. Despite this, not
      much is known about which food groups are most effective at improving blood sugar levels in
      patients with diabetes.

      Interestingly, of the various food groups that comprise the Mediterranean diet, epidemiologic
      data suggests that whole fruit may be one of the most efficacious at both preventing type 2
      diabetes and improving blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, few clinical
      trials have investigated the effects of whole fruit on blood sugar control. This study will
      therefore be the first to determine the effects of increasing whole fruit as a food group in
      type 2 diabetes patients. This supervised controlled feeding trial will test whether
      consuming a diet rich in whole fruit for 12 weeks can induce diabetes remission and can
      improve blood sugar, liver fat, and cardiovascular health in adults with type 2 diabetes.
      Thereafter, participants will be followed for up to one year. As a secondary aim, this study
      will also test whether consuming a large amount of fructose in whole food form negatively
      affects liver fat and cardiovascular health.

      Pre-registration notes: The primary endpoint is glycemic control, which will be analyzed
      hierarchically in descending order of importance as:

        1. Diabetes remission rate (endpoint #1)

        2. Medication effect score (endpoint #2)

        3. Fasting glucose and HbA1c (endpoints #3-4)

        4. Oral glucose tolerance test and continuous glucose monitoring measures (endpoints #5-14)

      while the secondary endpoints (endpoints #15-20) will all be evaluated with equal importance.

    <description>Remission rate will be measured in two ways. At the end of Phase II, it will be quantified as the percentage of patients who achieve non-diabetic levels of fasting glucose without the aid of any anti-hyperglycemic pharmacologic therapy or ongoing procedures.. During the Follow-up period, it will be quantified as the percentage of patients who achieve non-diabetic levels of both fasting glucose and HbA1c without the aid of any anti-hyperglycemic pharmacologic therapy or ongoing procedures.</description>

    <description>Participants will consume a diet rich in whole fruit. During Phase I (Weeks 1-4; supervised controlled feeding), participants will gradually increase the amount of whole fruit they consume, eventually reaching 50% of calories from whole fruit. In Phase II (Week 5-12; supervised controlled feeding), participants will consume a whole fruit-rich, eucaloric diet that provides 50% of calories in the form of whole fruit. The non-fruit portion of the diet will be styled as a Mediterranean Diet. Participants will be required to approximately keep their weight stable during Phases I and II. In the Follow-Up Phase (Months 4-12; free-living), participants will be instructed to continue consuming at least one-third of their diet as whole fruit and to make healthy food choices.</description>
