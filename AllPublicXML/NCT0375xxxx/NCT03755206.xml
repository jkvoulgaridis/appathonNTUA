  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is part of the research project for a National Institute of Mental Health
      K01 grant to Dr. Haroz. The overall research project is focused on understanding how to
      sustain evidenced-based mental and behavioral health programs in tribal contexts. The aim of
      this study is to pilot test sustainment strategy interventions across tribal settings using
      mixed-methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the most pressing issues in mental health Dissemination and Implementation research
      (D&amp;I) is the lack of knowledge about how to sustain mental health prevention and treatment
      services for which there is substantial evidence of impact. Most D&amp;I studies focus on
      adoption and initial implementation, with few studies (&lt;20) rigorously exploring sustainment.
      The sustainment of services has been described as &quot;one of the greatest, yet least understood,
      challenges in the field of implementation science.&quot; The gap in knowledge is even greater for
      low-resource contexts, as few studies have focused on these settings. This project aims to
      address this gap by developing and testing sustainment strategies for an evidenced-based
      youth suicide prevention program in a low-resource, American Indian (AI) contexts.
