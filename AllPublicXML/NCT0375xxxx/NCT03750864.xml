  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study examining the feasibility and acceptability of a novel
      psychotherapy intervention on lung cancer patients who are experiencing stigma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiences of stigma (perception and internalization of negative appraisal and devaluation
      from others) are pervasive for lung cancer patients. Previous work has shown associations
      between lung cancer stigma and detriments in clinically relevant outcomes such as depression,
      lower quality of life, and reduced engagement in cancer care.

      The investigators previously developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Lung Cancer
      Stigma (ACT-LCS) as a patient-focused intervention to reduce the self-blame, guilt and
      inhibited disclosure associated with lung cancer stigma. ACT-LCS is based in Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT), a cognitive-behavioral treatment that promotes psychological
      flexibility through acceptance and valued direction.

      This is a feasibility study examining the feasibility and acceptability of ACT-LCS.

    <description>All participants in Stage 1, and those randomized to the intervention condition in Stage 2, will receive the Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy for Lung Cancer Stigma (ACT-LCS) intervention. The ACT-LC intervention is designed to be delivered as 6 sessions of individual psychotherapy with a trained psychotherapist at a weekly or bimonthly rate, delivered either in person or over the phone. The treatment manual is based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Therapists are instructed to begin treatment with Module 1. Modules 2-5 can then be administered in any order at the discretion of the therapist, based upon what the therapist thinks is most likely to be helpful to the patient. Module 6 is the final session of treatment.</description>
