  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the compound MIJ821 compared to placebo
      in patients aged from 18 to 65 years diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. The study
      will be conducted in the US and in Europe (Spain). The MIJ821 will be administered via
      infusion on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The efficacy will be measured after 24 hours using a
      specific golden standard scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The study
      duration is 6 weeks of treatment plus 1 month of follow up period.
