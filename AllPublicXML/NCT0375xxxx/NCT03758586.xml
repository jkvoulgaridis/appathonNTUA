  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical residents from a single tertiary medical center were divided into 2 groups. All
      residents performed 2 tasks on a Da Vinci robotic simulator system after which they were
      either given a real training session in spatial skills (study group) or shown a short
      presentation regarding robotic surgery. After training/watching the presentation, they
      repeated the for mentioned tasks on the robotic simulator. Improvement in surgeon
      performance, especially regarding tissue damage was documented.

      Importance: Robot-assisted surgery is becoming the mainstay of modern surgery. Efficient
      training techniques are essential for enhanced performance. Optimal performance during a
      surgical task is key to successful surgery and minimal adverse events.

      Objective: To introduce and examine a single session of spatial skill training as an
      efficient means of improving surgical suturing performance in robot-assisted surgery.

      Design: Forty-one surgical residents will be randomly assigned to training and control
      conditions. (1) participants will perform two da-Vinci skills simulator (dVSS) tasks to
      determine baseline performance. (2) the training group will undergo computer-based simulator
      training of spatial skills while the control group will engage in a neutral activity. (3) two
      dVSS tasks will be performed within 2 days of training completion to evaluate post-training
      performance. The experiment will be conducted until December 2018.

      Participants: A convenience sample comprised of 41 surgical residents with non-robotic
      surgical suturing skills.

    <description>The spatial skills training session consisted of six practice trials that were run in a sequence. The objective of each practice was to manipulate the simulated robotic arm to grab the cubes and move them to a desired location using keyboard keys. The participant was required to reach a decision based on the visual-spatial information, before initiating subsequent movements of the simulated robotic arm. Each practice trial presented an initial state of the cubes in front of the robotic arm, and a target position of the cubes.</description>
