  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in patients with MS increases with disease
      duration. Current management of urinary clinical symptoms in MS is mainly conservative. Its
      long-term outcome is often poor because of the progressive disease course and the treatment
      related side effects. Alternative therapeutic options are botulinum toxin injections,
      electrical stimulation of dorsal penile/clitoral nerve, and sacral nerve modulation.
      Posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is a second minimally-invasive method of electrical
      stimulation. Multiple benefits may derive from the development and validation of a dedicated
      protocol of a new self-activated neuromodulation therapy, which may improve therapy
      compliance/effectiveness, quality of life and social life in MS patients with refractory
      LUTS. Furthermore, it may contribute to reduce outpatient visits, health costs and work
      absenteeism.

      To investigate the performance and safety of the medical device eCoin™ for the treatment of
      refractory LUTS in patients with MS over a period of 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, single arm, self-controlled pilot study in patients
      with multiple sclerosis and OAB symptoms with a 6-month treatment period of posterior tibial
      nerve stimulation with the medical device eCoin.

      It is a pilot study to explore the effectiveness and safety of using this device to treat MS
      patients with OAB in daily clinical practice in. Based on feasibility considerations, we plan
      to include approximately 20 patients.

      It consists of:

        1. wash-out period from PTNS treatment of at least 2 months;

        2. baseline assessments;

        3. implantation of eCoin;

        4. system activation; and

        5. treatment and follow-up visits for a 6-month period post implant activation. Seven
           Visits are foreseen during the trial.
