      To investigate the efficacy and safety of orally administered BX-1 compared to placebo in
      patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis not sufficiently controlled by current
      anti-spasticity medication

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present phase III clinical trial is to demonstrate superiority of BX-1, an
      oral solution containing dronabinol, over placebo in patients with spasticity due to MS not
      sufficiently controlled by their current anti-spasticity medication.

      The trial is designed to show that BX-1 is able to reduce spasticity in MS patients not
      showing sufficient response to their current anti-spasticity treatment.
