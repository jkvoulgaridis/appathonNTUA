      Prospective, single-arm, multicenter study that will generate clinical data on 100 adult
      patients using the NEUWAVE MicroWave Ablation System with AC (Ablation Confirmation) software
      in patients undergoing ablation of a soft tissue liver lesion. AC software is a computed
      tomography (CT) image processing software package available as an optional feature for use
      with the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation System. AC imports images from CT scanners for display
      and processing during ablation procedures to assist physicians in identifying ablation
      targets, assessing optimal ablation probe placement, and confirming the adequacy of the
      ablation margin.

      All ablations will be performed percutaneously by an interventional radiologist while the
      patient is under general anesthesia or deep conscious sedation.
