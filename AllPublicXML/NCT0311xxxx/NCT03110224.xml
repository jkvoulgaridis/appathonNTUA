      Post Market clinical outcomes study to collect data on the short - and long-term outcomes for
      subjects who are undergoing or who have undergone the Subchondroplasty (SCP) Procedure in the
      knee in a standard clinical setting. Outcomes to be assessed include pain medication usage,
      pain, function, activity levels and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, multi-center, patient outcomes centered study to evaluate the on-label
      use of AccuFill during the Subchondroplasty procedure. Enrolled subjects will sign an
      informed consent form, satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and have at least one Bone
      Marrow Lesion (BML) in the knee. Demographics, medical history and medications will recorded
      at the time of enrollment. Surgical details including the SCP procedure, concomitant surgical
      procedures and intraoperative safety events will be recorded. Subjects will complete patient
      reported outcomes measures pre-operatively including the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for knee
      pain, International Knee Documentation Committee Subject Knee (IKDC) Form and the Veterans
      Rand 12 (VR-12) Item Health Survey. These measures will also be administered post-operatively
      at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years. Screening for
      adverse events and revision surgeries will occur throughout the study.

      Target enrollment is 1000 subjects at up to 30 clinical sites. Subjects will complete the
      study at 5 years or will be withdrawn if the patient undergoes revision surgery of the
      Subchondroplasty site.
