  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without
      nivolumab works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer or cancer
      that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a
      patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells
      with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Event-free survival (EFS), with events defined as local recurrence, regional recurrence,
      distant metastasis, secondary malignancy (including lung cancer), and death.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Toxicity related to stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy [SABR]) and immunotherapy.

      III. Exploratory analyses of potential predictive markers and immunologic mechanisms of
      action.

      EXPLORATORY/TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify candidate tumor-associated antigens or genes that elicit cellular and humoral
      immune responses in serum samples (with Immunotherapy Platform).

      II. Assess PDL1 expression in tumor biopsy specimens (with Department of Pathology).

      III. Identify potential radiomics features from positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that may predict treatment response
      and toxicity (with Department of Radiation Physics).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy over 1-2 weeks. Beginning within
      36 hours before or after the first fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, patients
      also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with nivolumab
      repeat every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for up to 3 years, then annually thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by either biopsy or
             cytology is required for the primary diagnosis and is recommended for recurrent
             disease. The following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma,
             adenocarcinoma (with or without bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features), large cell
             carcinoma (with or without neuroendocrine features), neuroendocrine carcinoma (either
             NSCLC with neuroendocrine features or atypical carcinoids, but not small cell lung
             carcinoma), bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, or non-small cell carcinoma not
             otherwise specified

          -  Stage I or selected stage IIa according to the 7th version of the International
             Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) system: stage I (T1 or T2a [tumor
             size =&lt; 5 cm] N0M0) stage IIa (T2 [tumor size &gt; 5 cm but =&lt; 7 cm] N0M0)

          -  Patients with multiple primary lung tumors (defined below) are eligible:

               -  Synchronous tumors (diagnosed within 6 months [mo]),

                    -  Different histology,

                    -  Same histology,

                    -  Second tumor in different lobed or lung;

               -  Metachronous tumors (diagnosed &gt; 6 mo apart),

                    -  Different histology,

                    -  Same histology,

                    -  Second tumor in different lobe or lung,

                    -  Tumor-free interval of at least 4 years (y)

          -  Patient with multiple primary lung tumors who will receive multiple courses of
             stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (50Gy in 4Fx or 70Gy in 10Fx) are eligible

          -  Patients with isolated lung parenchymal recurrent/persistent NSCLC (histology as
             defined in eligibility criterion 1) after prior definitive surgery or
             radiotherapy/chemotherapy, when the lesion or lesions are suitable for SABR, are also
             eligible.

               -  Patients with a single metastatic focus in the lung parenchyma with no other
                  lesions are also eligible, because this presentation is challenging to
                  distinguish from recurrent disease.

               -  Recurrent disease can be in the same lobe or a different lobe but should not
                  invade critical structures (esophagus, brachial plexus, major vessels, heart,
                  spinal cord); should not involve any lymph node; and should not include any other
                  suspicious lesions in the lung or any other locations.

               -  Any prior therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic) must have been completed
                  at least 12 weeks before administration of the study drug.

               -  Tumors should be =&lt; 7 cm (measured by CT imaging in the lung window setting) with
                  N0M0; PET) imaging is required for restaging (per eligibility criterion) and any
                  lymph node suspected of harboring tumor should be confirmed by biopsy (per
                  eligibility criterion)

          -  Both Chest CT and PET/CT are required within 16 weeks and at least one of them needs
             to be done within 12 weeks (plus/minus 1 week). Any lymph node suspected of harboring
             disease based on its shape, size, or PET standardized uptake value (SUV) should be
             discussed by treating physician and diagnostic radiologist

          -  Patients with medically inoperable stage I disease (T1 or T2a [tumor size =&lt; 5 cm]
             N0M0) or selected stage IIa disease (T2 [tumor size &gt; 5 cm but =&lt; 7 cm] N0M0) who have
             poor lung function or other significant cardiovascular or other comorbidity such as
             diabetes are eligible. Patients with operable disease who choose to have SABR are also
             eligible.

               -  The standard justification for medical inoperability is based on pulmonary
                  function and can include any of the following: baseline forced expiratory volume
                  in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 50% of predicted value; diffusion capacity &lt; 50% of
                  predicted value; baseline hypoxemia or hypercapnia; exercise oxygen consumption &lt;
                  50% of predicted value; severe pulmonary hypertension; severe cerebral, cardiac,
                  or peripheral vascular disease; and severe chronic heart disease

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status score of 0-2 (2 is included here
             because such patients are typically &gt; 70 years old and cannot tolerate surgery)

          -  The following mandatory staging studies must be done within 12 weeks before study
             registration:

               -  Chest CT or PET/CT scans of both lungs, the mediastinum, adrenal glands and rest
                  of the body; primary tumor dimension will be measured on diagnostic CT and again
                  on simulation CT using the lung window setting.

               -  Mediastinoscopy or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mediastinal
                  lymph nodes is recommended and required for any patients with PET/CT or CT
                  findings suggesting lymph node involvement.

               -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan if symptoms or signs suggest
                  brain metastases.

               -  Invasive mediastinal staging: For all patients with CT or PET evidence of hilar
                  involvement (level 10) or with mediastinal lymph nodes &gt; 1.0 cm in the shortest
                  diameter or clinically suspicious by treating physician and/or radiologist,
                  disease must be staged by cervical mediastinoscopy, esophageal endoscopic
                  ultrasound-guided biopsy, or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy

          -  For patients with left-sided tumors and enlarged nodes (&gt; 1.0 cm in the shortest
             diameter) on the aortopulmonary window setting, the aortopulmonary nodes must be
             biopsied by extended mediastinoscopy, Chamberlain procedure, video-assisted
             thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach, or ultrasound-guided biopsy to ensure that the
             patient does not have N2 disease. At the time of cervical mediastinoscopy, esophageal
             endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy, or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy, the
             following nodal stations must be examined and biopsied, if present:

               -  Ipsilateral nodal station 4

               -  Contralateral nodal station level 4, and

               -  Subcarinal nodes (level 7) For left-sided tumors, any lymph node in the superior
                  or anterior mediastinum &gt; 1.0 cm in the shortest axis on CT or positive on PET
                  must be identified and biopsied. Eligibility requires that any PET-positive
                  mediastinal or distant sites must be biopsy-negative. However, if the treating
                  physician and diagnostic radiologist strongly suspect PET positivity, the patient
                  should not be enrolled even if the biopsy is negative (to exclude patients with
                  false-negative biopsy)

          -  All patients must sign a study-specific consent form

          -  All patients (men &amp; women) of childbearing potential should use a method of birth
             control that is effective for them throughout their participation in this study.

               -  Women of childbearing potential should use an adequate contraceptive method to
                  avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to
                  undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug; must have a
                  negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
                  units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours before the start of
                  nivolumab; and must not be breastfeeding.

               -  Men who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must use a
                  contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year; men receiving
                  nivolumab will be instructed to use contraception for 7 months after the last
                  dose of nivolumab.

               -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. are postmenopausal or
                  surgically sterile) &amp; azoospermic men do not require contraception

             have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL (within 30 days before study registration)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with tumors &gt; 7 cm or tumors involving the main bronchus or associated
