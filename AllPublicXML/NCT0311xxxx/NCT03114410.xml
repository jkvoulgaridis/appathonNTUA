  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a cluster-level randomized controlled design to evaluate the efficacy of
      Re:MIX in reducing the incidences of early sexual behavior, unprotected sex, oral sex,
      pregnancy, and STIs. Re:MIX is a comprehensive in-school health curriculum and teen pregnancy
      prevention program for adolescents covering a broad range of topics related to sexual health
      and youth development, including healthy relationships, communication, gender, consent,
      reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexual decision making, clinics, parenthood, and life
      planning. Re:MIX also aims to connect students and peer educators with community resources
      and service linkages. The Re:MIX curriculum teaches mixed-gender groups of students in grades
      8 to 10 to delay sex and use protection if they have sex. A co-facilitation team of young
      parent educators delivered the information with professional health educators using
      non-traditional approaches, such as game-based tools, technology, and storytelling. Youth
      received roughly nine hours and 10 minutes of group sessions during the school day over one
      semester (55 minutes per week for 10 weeks). Participants were in 8th, 9th, and 10th graders
      attending three public charter schools in Travis County, Texas. Comparison classes either
      received an alternative program that focused on health, nutrition, and fitness, or business
      as usual. This study was conducted as a Rigorous Evaluation of New or Innovative Approaches
      to Prevent Teen Pregnancy funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office
      of Adolescent Health.
