  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas (GBM) are rare tumors of poor prognosis and their treatment is based on surgery
      followed by radiochemotherapy. Clinical and imaging evaluation is not always straightforward:
      the more or less complete surgery, the pseudo-progression after radiochemotherapy, the
      radionecrosis, the diagnosis of the relapse and the follow-up under anti-angiogenic can pose
      problems Clinicians and radiologists. Accessibility to a plasma tumor molecular marker would
      greatly facilitate the follow-up of these patients.

      It is now established for many cancers that circulating tumor DNA (cTNA) has the same
      molecular abnormalities as those identified in the primary tumor cells. Numerous studies have
      shown the prognostic value and diagnosis of the exploration of cDNA.
