  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obesity, a defining health problem of the century, leads to long-term health
      disparities. This application evaluates strategies to prevent health disparities early in
      life by developing environmental wellness-related interventions focused on child-care center
      staff and families.

      Childcare centers provide an excellent opportunity to build healthy dietary and physical
      activity lifestyle habits and avoid the rapid weight gain that leads to health disparities.
      Building on a statewide survey among childcare centers and a pilot evaluation of an
      environmental intervention, this 3-cell randomized trial evaluates the impact of a staff-led
      wellness intervention and a staff-led and family-focused intervention, against a control
      condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention trial will be conducted in 48-55 childcare centers throughout Maryland,
      enrolling 864 children age 30-54 months from childcare centers serving low-income families.
      The aims are:

        1. to examine the impact of the wellness intervention individually and combined with the
           family intervention versus control on BMI z-score, food preferences and knowledge, and
           physical activity among children

        2. to examine the sustainability of the interventions

        3. to examine whether changes in outcomes measures for children's BMI z-score, gross motor
           skills, food preferences and knowledge, and physical activity are mediated by changes in
           the childcare staff wellness-related attitudes and behaviors and/or parent
           wellness-related attitudes and behaviors (exploratory).

      Findings from the trial will inform programs and policies in childcare centers to prevent
      obesity and reduce disparities, and will be disseminated locally, regionally, and nationally
      through conferences, information briefs, social media, and peer-reviewed journal articles.
      The overall objective is to promote statewide strategies that reduce pediatric obesity and
      the long-term health disparities.
