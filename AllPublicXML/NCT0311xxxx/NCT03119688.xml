      The objective of this clinical study is to assess the relative mildness of a cosmetic facial
      cleanser in comparison to water through repeated application to the volar forearm using the
      FCAT wash procedure.

    <description>Skin dryness was assessed by a trained examiner according to following the scoring scale: 0 (No dryness); 1 (Patches of slight powederiness and occasional patches of small scales may be seen, distribution generalized.); 2 (Generalised slight powederiness, early cracking or occasional small lifting scales may be present); 3 (Generalised moderate powederiness and/or heavy cracking and lifting scales; 4 (Generalised heavy powederiness and/or heavy cracking and lifting scales); 5 (Generalised high cracking and lifting scales, eczematous change may be present, powederiness may be present but not prominent, may see bleeding crack); 6 (Generalised severe cracking, eczematous change may be present, bleeding cracks may be present, scale large may be beginning to disappear). Lower scores reflect less dry skin.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) at Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 5 (3 hours post last wash procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL was measured using Tewameter. TEWL measuring principle was based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 seconds (sec), to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belonged to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 sec were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Skin Moisturisation at Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 5 (3 hours post last wash procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the gold conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allowed the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content, the stratum corneum moisturisation can be measured. The Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the paarticipant's test site for 1-2 seconds per measurement. The Corneometer measurements were taken and an average (mean) reading was calculated for each site and time point. Corneometer values lower than 30 instrumental units (i.u.) represents very dry skin, while values between 30 und 50 i.u are typically for dry skin on the forearm. An increase in Corneometer values, therefore, corresponds to a skin-moisturising effect.</description>

        <description>TEWL was measured using Tewameter. TEWL measuring principle was based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe was held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 seconds (sec), to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belonged to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 sec were averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Moisturisation at Day 5</title>
        <description>Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the gold conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allowed the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content, the stratum corneum moisturisation can be measured. The Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the paarticipant's test site for 1-2 seconds per measurement. The Corneometer measurements were taken and an average (mean) reading was calculated for each site and time point. Corneometer values lower than 30 instrumental units (i.u.) represents very dry skin, while values between 30 und 50 i.u are typically for dry skin on the forearm. An increase in Corneometer values, therefore, corresponds to a skin-moisturising effect.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Moisturisation at Day 5</title>
          <description>Corneometry was used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle was based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the gold conductors of the probe an electrical field was built which allowed the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content, the stratum corneum moisturisation can be measured. The Corneometer probe was placed in contact with the skin of the paarticipant's test site for 1-2 seconds per measurement. The Corneometer measurements were taken and an average (mean) reading was calculated for each site and time point. Corneometer values lower than 30 instrumental units (i.u.) represents very dry skin, while values between 30 und 50 i.u are typically for dry skin on the forearm. An increase in Corneometer values, therefore, corresponds to a skin-moisturising effect.</description>
