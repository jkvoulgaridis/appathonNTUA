  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of crenezumab versus placebo in participants with prodromal to mild AD.
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous (IV) infusion of crenezumab
      or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 100 weeks. The primary efficacy assessment will be
      performed at 105 weeks. The participants who do not enter open-label extension will enter for
      a long term follow-up period for up to 52 weeks after the last crenezumab dose (Week 153).

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was discontinued due to an interim analysis in the BN29552 study, which indicated
    that Crenezumab was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 77 in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 77</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SB rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment = 0, questionable impairment = 0.5 and mild, moderate and severe impairment = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The score range is from 0 to 18 with a high score indicating a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline for this primary endpoint. Data after 29 January 2019 are censored for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses to avoid potential biases due to investigators, participants, raters, etc. being potentially influenced by early closure of the study due to lack of efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease (ZCI-AD) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 53</time_frame>
    <description>The ZCI-AD is a modified version of the Zarit Burden Interview, which was originally designed to reflect the stresses experienced by caregivers of people with dementia. This modified version includes slight modifications in item and title wording (e.g., removal of &quot;your relative&quot; to refer directly to the patient, removal of &quot;burden&quot; from title) and the use of 11-point numerical rating scales. The ZCI-AD scale consists of a total of 30 items. Total scores will be calculated with a total score range from 0 to 300 (higher scores indicate a higher burden on the caregiver). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 53 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up until 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to 117 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <description>Participants were considered positive or negative for ADA based on their baseline and post-baseline sample results. The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined for Crenezumab and Placebo groups. The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels at baseline relative to the total number of participants with a sample available at baseline. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was determined as the proportion of participants with confirmed post-baseline positive ADAs relative to the total number of participants that had at least one post-baseline sample available for ADA analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 77 in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Scale Score</title>
        <description>The CDR-SB rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment = 0, questionable impairment = 0.5 and mild, moderate and severe impairment = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The score range is from 0 to 18 with a high score indicating a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline for this primary endpoint. Data after 29 January 2019 are censored for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses to avoid potential biases due to investigators, participants, raters, etc. being potentially influenced by early closure of the study due to lack of efficacy.</description>

        <description>The ADAS-Cog-13 assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and spontaneous speech. Most of these are assessed by tests although some are rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale. The ADAS-Cog-13 is the ADAS-Cog-11 with 2 further items: delayed word recall and total digit cancellation. The score range for ADAS-Cog-13 is from 0 to 85 with high scores representing severe dysfunction. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 77 on Severity of Dementia, Assessed Using the CDR-Global Score (CDR-GS)</title>
        <description>The CDR-GS represents a semi-structured interview which rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which CDR 0 = no dementia and CDR 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 = questionable, mild, moderate or severe dementia respectively. The range in scores for the CDR-GS is from 0 to 3 and a high score on the CDR-GS would indicate a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <description>The ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living) is the scale most widely used to assess functional outcomes in participants with AD. The ADCS-ADL covers both basic ADL (e.g., eating and toileting) and more complex 'instrumental' ADL or iADL (e.g., using the telephone, managing finances and preparing a meal). The ADCS-ADL consists of 23 questions with a score range of 0 to 78 where a higher score represents better function. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

          <description>The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) is an instrument consisting of 10 items and assesses instrumental, social and cognitive functioning. The score range is from 0 to 30 with higher scores representing higher impairment. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 77 on a Measure of Dependence Level Assessed From the ADCS-ADL Score</title>
        <description>The ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living) is the scale most widely used to assess functional outcomes in participants with AD. The ADCS-ADL covers both basic ADL (e.g., eating and toileting) and more complex 'instrumental' ADL or iADL (e.g., using the telephone, managing finances and preparing a meal). The ADCS-ADL consists of 23 questions with a score range of 0 to 78 where a higher score represents better function. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 53 on Behavior in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Total Score</title>
        <description>The NPI-Q evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavioral disturbances and appetite/eating abnormalities. The severity of each neuropsychiatric symptom is rated on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate and marked). The total severity score range is from 0 to 36 with higher scores representing higher severity. Difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 53 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated.

        <description>The ZCI-AD is a modified version of the Zarit Burden Interview, which was originally designed to reflect the stresses experienced by caregivers of people with dementia. This modified version includes slight modifications in item and title wording (e.g., removal of &quot;your relative&quot; to refer directly to the patient, removal of &quot;burden&quot; from title) and the use of 11-point numerical rating scales. The ZCI-AD scale consists of a total of 30 items. Total scores will be calculated with a total score range from 0 to 300 (higher scores indicate a higher burden on the caregiver). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 53 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire Domain Scores for Participants</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status designed to provide a simple generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It is broadly applicable across a wide range of health conditions and treatment. The EQ-5D assesses five domains to provide a health state index. These are anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort, usual activities, mobility, and self-care. The scores on the EQ-5D ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 77 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline to Week 105 in Ventricle Volume as Determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
        <description>Percentage Change in Ventricle Volume will be measured over time and descriptive summary statistics will include the arithmetic mean, median, range, SD, and coefficient of variation, as appropriate. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>
