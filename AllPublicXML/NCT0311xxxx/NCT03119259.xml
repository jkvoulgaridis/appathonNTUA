    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are 1) to test the trial and intervention feasibility of
      Brain Care Notes (BCN) app, 2) To estimate the effect size of BCN on reducing informal
      caregiver burden at 6 months, and 3) To estimate the effect size of BCN on reducing patient
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) at 6 months. Subjects will be
      recruited from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program of Eskenazi Health and Indiana University
      Health located in central Indiana.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) manage a
      complex spectrum of patient behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). BPSD
      are major contributing factors to caregivers' burden and adverse health outcomes, leading to
      an increase of unplanned hospitalizations and a decrease in quality of life. The National
      Alzheimer's Project Act recognizes the need for interventions that &quot;enable family caregivers
      to continue to provide care while maintaining their own health and well-being.&quot; Furthermore,
      recommendations from 2015 and 2018 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summits include the
      application of technology to improve caregiving research and ADRD care

      This pilot randomized controlled trial, will test the feasibility and estimate the effect
      size of integrating mobile health technology BrainCare Notes (BCN) into an existing, fully
      operational, and self-sustaining clinical program (Aging Brain Care; ABC) and IU Health
      primary care physician clinics (IUHP). BCN is a mobile application (app) for informal
      caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementia (ADRD). The BCN app
      delivers 24/7 psychoeducation and caregiver support, assessment of informal caregiver status
      and patients' behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and engagement tools
      for self-management and communication. Over a 15 month accrual period, we propose to enroll
      from the ABC clinical program and IUHP 60 dyads consisting of an adult patient with ADRD and
      one (primary) informal caregiver. The intervention will continue for 6 months and final
      assessments will be completed at 6 months. Feasibility data will be collected throughout the
      study and assessed at the end of the study by computing: (a) recruitment rate; (b) data
      completion; (c) BCN usability; (d) BCN acceptance; and (e) BCN use. Caregiver burden and
      patient BPSD will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months and evaluated for changes from
      baseline to 6 months in each group. Means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals will
      be computed to test feasibility hypotheses. Mixed linear models will be used to test
      hypotheses comparing the two conditions at 6 months.

    <description>The goal of the ABC Clinical Program is to help primary care physicians achieve the standard of care in the diagnosis, evaluation and management of patients with ADRD. The ABC Clinical Program is delivered by an interdisciplinary team led by a care coordinator. The informal caregiver is also enrolled in the program and caregiver burden is assessed and managed. The ABC team collects all relevant data and formulates an individualized care plan in collaboration with the informal caregiver. The care coordinator communicates the team's recommendations to the primary care physician and finalizes a collaborative plan of action. During the next year, the ABC team uses face-to-face and telephone interactions with the patient and caregiver to monitor and modify implementation of the care plan.
The goal of IUHP Usual Care is to provide preventive care services to their patients. Older adults are assessed for ADRD during clinic visits and refered to brain care specialty as necessary.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data, or results, will be shared through traditional mechanisms such as peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national meetings. The Enhanced Medical Record - Aging Brain Care (eMR-ABC), the dedicated electronic medical record for the Aging Brain Care (ABC) Clinical Program, was developed with the intent of sharing de-identified data with the scientific community. The Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) is a state-wide health information exchange. INPC data is collected for patient care purposes and is not &quot;owned&quot; by Indiana University or the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. — each participating health care system or program retains ownership of their data. At present, Indiana University/Regenstrief Institute scientists do not have the direct authority to share even de-identified patient data. Therefore, any request to use these data for research purposes must be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.</ipd_description>
