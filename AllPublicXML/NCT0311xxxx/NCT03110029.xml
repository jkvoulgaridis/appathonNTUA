  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well efinaconazole solution (Jublia) works to treat toenail fungal
      infections in patients who wear polish compared to those who do not.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical efinaconazole 10% solution is known to be an efficacious and safe treatment modality
      for toenail onychomycosis. This study will examine the compatibility of topical efinaconazole
      and nail polish in patients with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO). It is
      hypothesized that the treatment of DLSO with efinaconazole 10% solution will not be adversely
      affected by the application of nail polish.

    <description>Patients will answer the following question:
Which will be answered using a Likert scale where 0 represents no alteration in polish and 10 represents complete destruction of the polish:
Is the quality of your polish diminished with use of Jublia?</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Disease Improvement Using Onychomycosis Severity Index (OSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 week</time_frame>
    <description>Using 3rd party blinding, DLSO was assessed at baseline and at every subsequent visit using the onychomycosis severity index (OSI), measuring percent of the target nail involved, and grading the infection from mild to moderate to severe. The range for OSI is 0-20 with 20 indicating severe nails disease. Nail growth was measured at each visit. Fungal testing was done at screening, 3 months, 7 months, end of treatment (48 weeks), and end of study (52 weeks). Clinical and mycologic cure was evaluated at week 52.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female age 19-70, as 19 is the legal age in Alabama

          -  DLSO affecting at least 1 great toenail diagnosed with positive potassium hydroxide
             microscopy and culture of a dermatophyte

          -  Suitable for application of topical antifungal therapy, in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Target toenail thickness of 3 mm or less as measured by digital caliper, as thickness
             greater than 3 mm may allow inclusion of patient with severe onychomycosis, and this
             was the criteria used in the pivotal trial using topical efinaconazole for
             onychomycosis

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be required to use birth control and a negative
             urine pregnancy test must be documented prior to initiating treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of immunosuppression or concurrent use of immunosuppressant drugs

          -  History of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          -  History of psoriasis or any other condition that might interfere with the toenail
             evaluation

          -  Three or more dermatophytomas (streaks) on the target nail

          -  Severe DLSO of the target nail

          -  Patients who cannot refrain from wearing gel or plastic based polishes that are used
             in salons and that require curing

          <title>Study Group (Frequently Wears Toenail Polish)</title>
          <description>Patients who self-identified as frequently wearing toenail polish were placed in the study group.
Inclusion criteria consisted of being female and aged 19-70 with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) effecting at least one great toenail. The target great toenail thickness was less than or equal to 3mm. DLSO was diagnosed by having a positive potassium hydroxide microscopy and culture of a dermatophyte. Exclusion criteria included a history of either immunosuppression, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or psoriasis. Patients were also excluded if they had severe target toenail DLSO or three or more dermatophytomas on the target toenail. Patients were required to refrain from wearing gel or plastic based polishes that are used in salons and require curing.
Patients with symptomatic tinea pedis at screening were treated with luliconazole cream for 2 weeks.</description>

        <description>Using 3rd party blinding, DLSO was assessed at baseline and at every subsequent visit using the onychomycosis severity index (OSI), measuring percent of the target nail involved, and grading the infection from mild to moderate to severe. The range for OSI is 0-20 with 20 indicating severe nails disease. Nail growth was measured at each visit. Fungal testing was done at screening, 3 months, 7 months, end of treatment (48 weeks), and end of study (52 weeks). Clinical and mycologic cure was evaluated at week 52.</description>

          <title>Efinaconazole 10% and Nail Polish</title>
          <description>Patients who self-identified as frequently wearing toenail polish were placed in the study group. Inclusion criteria consisted of being female and aged 19-70 with DLSO effecting at least one great toenail. The target great toenail thickness was less than or equal to 3mm. DLSO was diagnosed by having a positive potassium hydroxide microscopy and culture of a dermatophyte. Exclusion criteria included a history of either immunosuppression, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or psoriasis. Patients were also excluded if they had severe target toenail DLSO or three or more dermatophytomas on the target toenail. Patients were required to refrain from wearing gel or plastic based polishes that are used in salons and require curing.
Patients with symptomatic tinea pedis at screening were treated with luliconazole cream for 2 weeks.</description>
