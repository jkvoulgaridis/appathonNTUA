        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant must have a documented diagnosis of a form of primary humoral
             immunodeficiency involving a defect in antibody formation and requiring gammaglobulin
             replacement, as defined according to the International Union of Immunological
             Societies (IUIS) Scientific Committee 2015 prior to enrollment. The diagnosis must be
             confirmed by the sponsor´s Medical Director prior to first treatment with
             investigational product (IP) in the study.

          2. Participant is at least two and below 18 years of age at the time of screening.

          3. Participant has been receiving a consistent dose of Immunoglobulin G (IgG),
             administered in compliance with the respective product information for a period of at
             least three months prior to screening. The average minimum pre-study dose over that
             interval was equivalent to 300 mg/kg body weight (BW)/four weeks and a maximum dose
             equivalent to 1000 mg/kg BW/4 weeks.

          4. Participant has a serum trough level of IgG &gt; 5 g/L at screening.

          5. If female of childbearing potential, participant presents with a negative pregnancy
             test and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the
             study.

          6. Participant /legally authorized representative is willing and able to comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has a known history of or is positive at screening for one or more of the
             following: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
             hepatitis C virus (HCV), PCR for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type 1/2.

          2. Abnormal laboratory values at screening meeting any one of the following criteria
             (abnormal tests may be repeated once to determine if they are persistent):

               1. Persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)
                  &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the testing laboratory

               2. Persistent severe neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≤
                  500/mm^3)

          3. Participant has anemia that would preclude phlebotomy for laboratory studies,
             according to standard practice at the site.

          4. Participant has an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions
             (urticaria, breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) following
             intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin, subcutaneous (SC) immunoglobulin, and/or Immune Serum
             Globulin (ISG) infusions.

          5. Participant has severe immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (&lt; 7.0 mg/dL) with known
             anti-IgA antibodies and a history of hypersensitivity. .

          6. Participant has a known allergy to hyaluronidase.

          7. Participant has active infection and is receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment
             of infection at the time of screening.

          8. Participant has a bleeding disorder or a platelet count &lt; 20,000/μL, or who, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would be at significant risk of increased bleeding or
             bruising as a result of SC therapy.

          9. Participant has severe dermatitis that would preclude adequate sites for safe product
             administration in the opinion of the investigator.

         10. Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an IP or
             investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to
             participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during
             the course of this study.

         11. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.

         12. If female, participant is pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment.
