  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The necessity of Hand hygiene (HH) before donning non-sterile gloves is unknown. Furthermore,
      because of the additional time required to cleanse hands and then don gloves, as well as the
      cumbersome nature of applying gloves to recently washed hands, this practice leads to
      non-compliance with both HH and glove use - placing patients at risk. In a pilot study, the
      investigators performed a randomized trial of 230 healthcare workers and demonstrated no
      difference in total bacterial colony counts or identification of pathogenic bacteria from the
      gloves of persons who either performed HH or did not perform HH prior to putting on
      non-sterile gloves. If unnecessary, HH before non-sterile glove use wastes valuable time,
      which might otherwise be spent engaged in direct patient care. And removing this unnecessary
      step may lead to increased compliance with infection prevention measures. In Aim A, the
      investigators will perform a multi-center randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy
      of a direct gloving strategy to improve compliance with infection prevention practices. In
      Aim B, the investigators will perform a nested multi-center validation study, where the
      gloved hands of healthcare workers will be randomly sampled to determine bacterial
      contamination of non-sterile gloves after donning.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate alternative strategies to hand hygiene (HH) and glove use in
      situations where glove use is required to perform health care activities in an effort to
      increase compliance with infection prevention efforts.

      HH is the cornerstone of infection prevention. Despite the importance of and increased focus
      on HH, compliance remains low in healthcare settings (40% on average in a large
      meta-analysis). Insufficient time, high workload and under staffing are important barriers.
      Glove use, which is common and increasing, is another major barrier. New strategies are
      needed that improve time and efficiency particularly in settings where glove use is required
      (e.g. Contact Precautions). One area for further study is the requirement for HH prior to
      non-sterile glove use. This is a recommended practice with poor compliance that may be
      unnecessary. Furthermore, it may lead to reduced compliance with other recommended infection
      prevention practices, such as glove use. In this proposal the investigators identify a novel
      strategy of directly gloving without performing HH prior to non-sterile glove use as a
      potential solution.

      In this study the investigators aim to perform a multicenter, cluster-randomized trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of direct gloving to improve compliance with infection prevention
      practices (i.e. HH and glove use). Herein, the investigators will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of directly gloving (compared to performing HH prior to glove use) and assess
      whether this strategy will lead to increased compliance with both HH and glove use. The
      investigators previously demonstrated the safety of this strategy in a single-center
      randomized controlled pilot trial where the investigators found no difference in bacterial
      contamination of gloves of healthcare providers who either performed or did not perform HH
      prior to donning non-sterile gloves. Thus, with potentially no added benefit and in a setting
      where the investigators know that HH compliance is the lowest (i.e. prior to glove use),
      mandating HH prior to donning gloves as recommended in current guidelines could actually
      reduce both HH and glove compliance, placing patients at increased risk for developing
      infection.
