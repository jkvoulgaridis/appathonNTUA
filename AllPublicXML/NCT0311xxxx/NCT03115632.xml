  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two aims for this study. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of
      body weight and hormones on airway fibrosis (scarring) and lung function in obese &amp; lean
      asthma subjects compared to obese &amp; lean non-asthma subjects (Aim 1). And in obese subjects
      with asthma undergoing bariatric surgery compared to obese non-asthma subjects undergoing
      bariatric surgery (Aim 2).
