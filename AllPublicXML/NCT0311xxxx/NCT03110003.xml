      In this study the investigator will address the efficacy of using low dose bupivacaine spinal
      anesthesia (SA) in combination with epidural volume extension (EVE) for patients undergoing
      short obstetric procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to risks to both the mother and fetus, neuraxial anesthesia - spinal, epidural, or
      combined spinal-epidural (CSE) - is preferred over general anesthesia for all obstetrical
      procedures. However, one downside to neuraxial anesthesia is the increased time patients have
      to stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) due to residual numbness from the neuraxial
      block. In this study, the investigators will address the efficacy of using low dose
      bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (SA) in combination with epidural volume extension (EVE) for
      patients undergoing short obstetric procedures. This will be accomplished by performing a CSE
      with: 1) injecting the local anesthesia in the spinal space; 2) injecting sterile saline into
      the epidural space to help increase the spread of the local anesthesia in the spinal space.
      The idea is that physicians will be able to use less local anesthetic due to getting a
      greater spread of medication. This lower amount of local anesthetic will lead to a decreased
      duration of the spinal block; therefore, it will significantly decrease PACU length of stay.
      This technique will be compared to our traditional dose of spinal anesthetic without EVE in
      the CSE. Both groups will have an epidural catheter in place to allow us to give any
      additional local anesthetic to keep the patient comfortable throughout the procedure if the
      spinal anesthesia begins to wear off. The aim of this study is to determine if low dose
      spinal bupivacaine in conjunction with EVE can decrease the PACU recovery time for short
      obstetric procedures while still providing an adequate surgical block.

    <description>Motor blockade will be determined by the patient's ability to lift her legs
This is simple scale used to assess motor function in the patients' legs. A numerical value from 0 to 4 is assigned to visual inspection of how well the patient can move her legs. 0=ability to maintain a leg lift for prolonged periods; 1=ability to lift legs briefly; 2=ability to bend knees; 3=ability to wiggle toes; 4=no movement in legs. A score of 0 means complete movement (no blockade) in the legs, whereas a score of 4 means no movement (complete blockade) in the legs.</description>

    <description>Time until score of &lt;2 reached on Modified Bromage scale
This is simple scale used to assess motor function in the patients' legs. A numerical value from 0 to 4 is assigned to visual inspection of how well the patient can move her legs. 0=ability to maintain a leg lift for prolonged periods; 1=ability to lift legs briefly; 2=ability to bend knees; 3=ability to wiggle toes; 4=no movement in legs. A score of 0 means complete movement (no blockade) in the legs, whereas a score of 4 means no movement (complete blockade) in the legs. Once the patient received as score of 0, the time ended. Again, 0=ability to maintain a leg lift for prolonged periods.</description>

This scale is grade from 1 to 10 with 1 being &quot;highly dissatisfied&quot; with the anesthetic technique and 10 being &quot;highly satisfied.&quot; Each patient was asked to rate their experience with the anesthetic technique provide. They could choose any number between 1 and 10. Numbers close to 10 represented a higher satisfaction with the anesthetic technique.</description>

        <title>Degree of Peak Motor Blockade by Modified Bromage Scale</title>
        <description>Motor blockade will be determined by the patient's ability to lift her legs
This is simple scale used to assess motor function in the patients' legs. A numerical value from 0 to 4 is assigned to visual inspection of how well the patient can move her legs. 0=ability to maintain a leg lift for prolonged periods; 1=ability to lift legs briefly; 2=ability to bend knees; 3=ability to wiggle toes; 4=no movement in legs. A score of 0 means complete movement (no blockade) in the legs, whereas a score of 4 means no movement (complete blockade) in the legs.</description>
