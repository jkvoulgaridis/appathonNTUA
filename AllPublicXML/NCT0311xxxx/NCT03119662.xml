  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled study will examine the incidence and
      severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage
      III/IV following an i.v. injection of iso-osmolar iodinated contrast material iodixanol
      (Visipaque™ Injection 320 mgI/mL), as compared with patients who received saline and
      underwent a non-enhanced CT (NECT) and duplex ultrasound (US) during their scheduled
      post-EVAR surveillance imaging.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The Study was conducted at 29 sites in United States of America &amp; Europe from 8 February 2018 to 19 October 2018. A total of 4 participants with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage III/IV were enrolled in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to undergo either contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) or non-enhanced computed tomography (NECT), of which 1 participant withdrew from study.</pre_assignment_details>

Sample size was 4 participants instead of planned 1164 participants, hence no statistical analyses were performed, no tables and listings were produced.</limitations_and_caveats>
