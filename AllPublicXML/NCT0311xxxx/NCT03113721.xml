  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, non-interventional, multi-centre clinical study is to assess
      the clinical validity of the Heparin Binding Protein (HBP) assay for indicating the presence,
      or outcome, of severe sepsis (including septic shock), over 72 hours, in patients with
      suspected infection following emergency department admission.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to use HBP concentration to indicate the presence, or
      outcome, of severe sepsis (including septic shock) at admission and to predict the outcome of
      severe sepsis (including septic shock) over 72 hours, in patients with suspected infection
      following emergency department admission.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to separately evaluate the performance of HBP
      concentration to a) indicate the presence of severe sepsis (including severe sepsis) at
      admission and b) to predict the outcome of severe sepsis (including septic shock) over 72
      hours, in patients with suspected infection following emergency department admission.

      Further exploratory objectives include evaluating the use of HBP measurement to indicate the
      outcome of severe sepsis (including septic shock) in patients with suspected infection 12-24
      hours after emergency department admission, to compare the use of HBP to other markers of
      severe infection and to evaluate whether or not different cut-off values are required for the
      progression and outcome measures.

    <description>The purpose of this measurement is to assess the clinical validity of plasma levels of HBP for indicating the presence, or outcome, of severe sepsis (including septic shock), over 72 hours, in patients with suspected infection following emergency department admission. The concentration of plasma HBP will be compared to the final clinical outcome of the patient to assess the ability of the HBP level to predict clinical progression.</description>
