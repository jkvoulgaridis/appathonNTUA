  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of Tadekinig alfa in patients with
      monogenic, interleukin-18 (IL 18) driven autoinflammation due to Nucleotide-binding
      oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and caspase recruiting domain (CARD domain)
      containing 4 (NLRC4) - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) mutation (NLRC4-MAS mutation) or
      X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency. Because of the likelihood for pathogenic
      IL-18 in certain monogenic diseases, patients known to harbor deleterious mutations in
      NLRC4-MAS or XIAP and who have a history of ongoing inflammation will be enrolled if they
      have ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL or persistent C reactive protein (CRP) elevation ≥ 2 times the
      upper limit of normal (ULN) and the patients should have a Modified Autoinflammatory Disease
      Activity Index (mAIDAI) ≥ 4.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed with single-arm, open-label phase (SAOL) of Tadekinig alfa treatment
      duration for 18-week followed by an 8-week Randomized Withdrawal (RW) period for efficacy and
      safety evaluation, with no interruption between the two phases of treatment. The screening
      period will occur before the SAOL phase and before the first dose of Investigational
      Medicinal Product (IMP)

    <intervention_model_description>Initial phase of 18 weeks is a single arm, open-label (SAOL) period where Tadekinig alfa is administered in addition to the standard of care treatment used for the control of flares. The SAOL period will be followed by an 8-week randomized withdrawal phase (RW). All patients who completed the study without an ongoing flare at the end of the SAOL phase will be enrollled in the RW phase. In the RW phase patients will be randomized to either Tadekinig alfa or placebo.</intervention_model_description>
