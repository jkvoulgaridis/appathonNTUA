    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label phase I study to determine the effect of CD19- CAR-T Cells
      infusion followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation in safety, efficacy and engraftment
      potential in patients with CD19+ B-lineage leukemia and lymphoma.

      Primary objectives

        1. To determine the safety and feasibility of allogeneic stem cell transplantation combined
           with adoptive transfer of T cells modified to express CD19-specific chimeric antigen
           receptor (CD19CAR) for treatment of leukemia and lymphoma Secondary objectives

        2. To measure the efficacy of the CD19CAR T cell infusion combined with allogeneic stem
           cell transplantation
