      Patients with high tumor burden, low grade follicular lymphoma that has never been treated,
      will receive venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.

      Venetoclax is an oral Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. It targets the B-cell lymphoma 2
      (BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients with
      follicular lymphoma. Venetoclax may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause
      cancer cells to die.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether adding venetoclax to obinutuzumab and
      bendamustine improves the response (the tumor shrinks or disappears) in patients with
      follicular lymphoma.

      As of 9/5/2018, a higher than expected incidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was
      experienced among patients receiving venetoclax, obinutuzumab and bendamustine on Cycle 1,
      Day 1 of treatment. TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. These patients
      developed an increase in some of their blood tests (uric acid, phosphorus, potassium and/or
      creatinine). They received a medication called rasburicase and continued with treatment. It
      is unclear if the TLS was due to the venetoclax or the standard treatment of obinutuzumab and
      bendamustine. For the remaining patients, venetoclax will start on Cycle 2, Day 1 (previously
      Cycle 1, Day 1).

      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common low grade lymphoma comprising 70% of low-grade
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 22% of all cases of NHL. The survival rates for patients
      with indolent NHL remained unchanged from the 1950s through the early 1990s, but recent
      evidence suggests that outcomes continue to improve. High-risk patients with FL, defined as
      having advanced stage and high tumor burden have significantly shorter progression free
      survival despite significant advances.

      This is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and
      bendamustine. Patients will receive induction therapy with obinutuzumab and bendamustine for
      six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). Venetoclax will start with 2nd cycle of induction therapy
      (previously started with cycle 1). There will be a formal, detailed toxicity evaluation after
      21 patients complete 3 cycles of treatment.

      Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease will receive therapy with
      obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles and venetoclax every month for 24 cycles. Patients
      who achieve a complete response will receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles.
      Patients with progressive disease will not continue onto the maintenance arm.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 12 weeks during induction and every 6
      months during maintenance therapy.

      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or
      biopsy) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available). Optional tumor
      biopsy samples obtained during treatment or post-treatment will also be requested for
      research.

                  therapy and until at least 2 months following the completion of therapy or until
                  the CD4 cells recover to over 250 cells/mm³, whichever occurs later.

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results or that could increase risk
             to the patient.

          -  No major surgery within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, other than for diagnosis.

          -  A condition that precludes oral route of administration (venetoclax).

          -  No known allergies to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase.

          -  Patient must not require the use of warfarin (because of potential drug-drug
             interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin). Blood thinners
             of other classes are permitted.

          -  Patient may not receive the following agents within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             venetoclax:

               -  Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors

               -  Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers

               -  Consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade
                  containing Seville oranges), or star fruit within 3 days prior to the first dose
                  of venetoclax.

          -  Patient must not have serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with
             participation in this clinical study.
