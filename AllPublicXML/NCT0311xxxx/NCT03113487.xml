      This phase II trial studies how well modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53
      (p53MVA) and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer that has come back (recurrent). Vaccines made from a gene-modified
      virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      p53MVA and pembrolizumab together may work better in treating patients with ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess response rate (complete responses and partial responses) after treatment with
      p53MVA and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess median progression free survival (PFS), clinical benefit (complete response,
      partial response lasting &gt; 6 months), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate if the CD8+ T cell signal exceeds that detected in the single agent p53MVA trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing
      p53.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks and modified
      vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) every 3 weeks for up to 3
      vaccines. Cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks for up to 49 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-3 weeks and every 12 weeks
      thereafter.

             patients must have experienced recurrence or progression within 6 months after
             completion of platinum based chemotherapy (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).

          -  A patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breast-feeding, and
             at least one of the following conditions applies: a.) Not a woman of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) OR b.) A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance
             during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study
             treatment

          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1., or detectable disease; lesions situated
             in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been
             demonstrated in such lesions

          -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured
             in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be
             greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), positron
             emission tomography (PET)/CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); lymph nodes must be
             greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT, PET/CT, or MRI

               -  Detectable disease in a patients is defined as one who does not have measurable
                  disease, but has at least one of the following conditions:

                    -  Baseline values of CA-125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

                    -  Ascites and/ or pleural effusion attributed to tumor

                    -  Solid and/ or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet
                       modified RECIST criteria, immune-related response criteria (irRC) for target
                       lesions

          -  Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 0-6 months following
             platinum-based chemotherapy have platinum resistant or refractory disease; these
             patients are not considered to benefit from additional platinum-based therapy and are
             treated with other sequential single agents; such patients are eligible for this trial

          -  Patients with documented disease recurrence/progression within 6-12 months of
             completing platinum-based therapy, are considered to have 'borderline' platinum
             sensitivity; these patients will not be eligible for this trial

          -  Patients who relapse more than 12 months after completion of platinum-based treatment
             are considered 'platinum sensitive' and will not be eligible for this trial, since
             they have a favorable (33-59%) chance of responding to further rounds of platinum
             based chemotherapy

          -  Patients with confirmed p53 mutation by molecular analysis and/or evidence of p53
             overexpression by immunohistochemistry (&gt;= 10% of cells within tumor staining
             positive) will be eligible; this will be assessed semi-quantitatively by a Clinical
             Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) approved pathology core pathologist, using CLIA
             approved mutational analysis or immuno-histochemistry techniques on formalin-fixed
             paraffin-embedded tissue; in the case of equivocal immunohistochemistry (IHC) results,
             p53 involvement may be confirmed by detection of p53 molecular analysis on tumor
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); patients on whom molecular analysis of p53 mutations is
             already available, will not require IHC analysis; molecular analysis may be performed
             as an additional research procedure at the end of the study (distinct from eligibility
             determination) if the principal investigator (PI) deems it of scientific value and
             research funding is available to cover the cost; patients are not required to have

             considered as a systemic chemotherapy regimen; eligible Patients are those with
