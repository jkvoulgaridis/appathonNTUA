      Study SARO.16.004.02 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of saroglitazar
      magnesium 2 mg, 4 mg in Patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis.

      A total 36 subjects will be enrolled in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive either saroglitazar
      magnesium 2 mg or saroglitazar magnesium 4 mg or placebo. The primary objective is to
      investigate the effect of a 16-week treatment regimen of Saroglitazar magnesium 2 mg and 4 mg
      on ALP levels in patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis.
