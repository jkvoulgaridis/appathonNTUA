  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of REMD-477 in subjects who have Type 1
      diabetes and are currently receiving insulin treatment. This study will determine whether
      REMD-477 can decrease daily insulin requirements and improve glycemic control after 12 weeks
      of treatment in subjects diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes with fasting C-peptide &lt; 0.7 ng/mL at
      Screening.

      The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States. Approximately 150
      subjects with type 1 diabetes on stable doses of insulin will be randomized in a 1:1:1
      fashion into one of three treatment groups.
