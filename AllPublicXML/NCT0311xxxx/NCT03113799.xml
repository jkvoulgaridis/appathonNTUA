  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the performance characteristics of the Smart External Drain (SED) compared with
      standard EVD drains in the hospital setting, specifically:

        -  Number, type and duration of staff interactions.

        -  Regulating and controlling ICP and CSF drainage.

        -  Maintaining system control with patient movement.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this two day clinical trial, subjects will be observed on Day 1 of study during their
      routine treatment and using their already existing EVD. On Day 2 of study; subjects will be
      switched to the Smart External Drain for monitoring and management of ICP and CSF

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stable Neuro - examination on standard EVD assessed as Not Clinically Significant
             (NCS) by PI or delegated Sub-I prior to study treatment.

          2. GCS &gt; 13 (minimum of E3V5M5) prior to study treatment.

          3. Subject must be scheduled to have an EVD placed as part of routine management and for
             a length of at least 48 hours. (e.g. in the setting of a tumor removal or treatment of
             hydrocephalus)

          4. Age 5-80.

          5. Stable Vital Signs - Blood pressure (Systolic and Diastolic), Heart Rate, Respiratory
             Rate and weight assessed as not clinically significant (NCS) and afebrile as per
             PI/Sub-assessment. (Stable Vital signs will be re-assessed again prior to treatment
             with the SED on Day 2)

          6. Able to perform and follow simple commands (ex: sit up in bed, lay down in bed)

          7. Pre-Study CT/MRI Imaging stable per PI Sub-I Assessment post ventriculostomy.

          8. Able to stand

          9. Able to obtain consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractory ICP or needing active ICP management

          2. Unable to tolerate brief clamping of EVD (&lt;5min)

          3. Unable to follow simple commands

          4. Unconscious

          5. Anticoagulant Therapy

          6. Known bleeding diathesis

          7. Scalp Infection
