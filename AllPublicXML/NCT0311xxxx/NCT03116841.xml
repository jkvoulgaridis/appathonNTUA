      The purpose of this study is to exploratorily evaluate the effect of vonoprazan 20 mg on
      sleep disturbance of patients with reflux esophagitis, who have heartburn and/or
      regurgitation and â‰¥ 6.0 in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score despite the
      maintenance treatment with PPI other than vonoprazan.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of vonoprazan on sleep disturbance in the
      participants under maintenance treatment for reflux esophagitis with proton pump inhibitor
      (PPI) other than vonoprazan after initial treatment.

      Participants who have been diagnosed as reflux esophagitis based on Los Angeles (LA)
      Classification Grades A to D, undergoing maintenance treatment with PPI other than vonoprazan
      after initial treatment, and with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score &gt;= 6.0
      at enrolment (VISIT 1) will be eligible for study entry and will be administered vonoprazan
      20 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

      Planned number of participants is 25. The study period is 9 weeks. The number of visits is
      6visits.

    <description>PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire for sleep quality. It includes 18 items across 7 components; C1: Sleep quality, C2: Sleep latency, C3: Sleep duration, C4: Sleep efficiency, C5: Sleep disturbance, C6: Use of sleep medication, C7: Daytime dysfunction. Each component is scored 0-3 (0 = no difficulty, 3=severe difficulty), and total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores are representing worse sleep quality. Reported data were individual scores for each participant (Participant A to C) since descriptive statistics value was not calculated due to small size population (totally 3 participants).</description>

        <title>Changes From Start of Administration (Week 0) in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Global Score at End of Study</title>
        <description>PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire for sleep quality. It includes 18 items across 7 components; C1: Sleep quality, C2: Sleep latency, C3: Sleep duration, C4: Sleep efficiency, C5: Sleep disturbance, C6: Use of sleep medication, C7: Daytime dysfunction. Each component is scored 0-3 (0 = no difficulty, 3=severe difficulty), and total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores are representing worse sleep quality. Reported data were individual scores for each participant (Participant A to C) since descriptive statistics value was not calculated due to small size population (totally 3 participants).</description>

        <description>PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire for sleep quality. It includes 18 items across 7 components; C1: Sleep quality, C2: Sleep latency, C3: Sleep duration, C4: Sleep efficiency, C5: Sleep disturbance, C6: Use of sleep medication, C7: Daytime dysfunction. Each component is scored 0-3 (0 = no difficulty, 3=severe difficulty), and total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores are representing worse sleep quality. Reported data were individual scores for each participants (Participant A to C) since descriptive statistics value was not calculated due to small size population (totally 3 participants).</description>

        <title>Changes From Start of Administration (Week 0) in C7: Daytime Dysfunction of PSQI Global Score at Week 4 and End of Study</title>
        <description>PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire for sleep quality. It includes 18 items across 7 components; C1: Sleep quality, C2: Sleep latency, C3: Sleep duration, C4: Sleep efficiency, C5: Sleep disturbance, C6: Use of sleep medication, C7: Daytime dysfunction. Each component is scored 0-3 (0 = no difficulty, 3=severe difficulty), and total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores are representing worse sleep quality. Reported data were individual scores for each participants (Participant A to C) since descriptive statistics value was not calculated due to small size population (totally 3 participants).</description>

        <title>Changes From Start of Administration (Week 0) in Actigraph-Measured Number of Nocturnal Awakenings at Week 4, and End of Study</title>
        <description>Actigraph is a small device usually that records the activity level of the body by sensing physical movement and that is used especially to measure the amount and quality of sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days at each time point was used for calculation. Reported data were individual times for each participants (Participant A to C) since descriptive statistics value was not calculated due to small size population (totally 3 participants).</description>
