  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aims are twofold: First, to examine physiological correlates of fear of physical
      activity (PA) and second, to examine correlates between fear of PA and interoceptive
      abilities in patients with chronic heart failure and healthy persons. Patients' fear of PA
      will be assessed via the &quot;Fear of Activity in Situations - Heart Failure&quot; (FActS-HF)
      questionnaire. The patient group will be split into two subgroups: One with high fear of PA
      and the second with low fear of PA based on FActS-HF scores. Fear of PA will be assessed via
      an adapted version of FActS-HF in a sample of healthy persons (control group). Each member of
      the high-fear-of-PA group will be individually age- and sex-matched with one member of the
      low-fear-of-PA group and control group. The participants of all three groups undergo the same
      experimental trials.

      Aim 1: The &quot;startle paradigm&quot; will be used to investigate the physiological component of fear
      of PA. The startle paradigm is based on empirical observations that the startle reflex is
      larger after the priming with unpleasant stimuli and inhibited after the priming with
      pleasant stimuli. The participants will be primed with various words including those words
      associated with physical activity that are expected to be unpleasant in patients with high
      fear of PA. The startle reflex will be triggered by air puffs on the eyes (startle probes)
      and measured via facial electromyography (EMG). We assume that startle responses primed with
      PA related words are stronger in patients with high fear of PA compared to the other groups.

      Aim 2: Interoceptive accuracy will be assessed via the &quot;Schandry test&quot; and interoceptive
      awareness will be assessed via the &quot;Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness&quot;
      (MAIA) questionnaire. During the Schandry test the participants will be instructed to
      subjectively count their heart rate without any aid or tools. The heart rate will be
      objectively measured at the same time via ECG. A high congruence of the objective and
      subjective results indicates a high interoception ability, and is assumed to be correlated
      with fear of physical activity. Additionally, we expect the MAIA and FActS scores to be
      correlated.

    <description>The startle reflex will be triggered by air puffs (startle probes) and its modulation in response to a set of verbal stimuli related to physical activity will be measured with the EMG during a time window of 30 minutes. Thereby physiological (EMG magnitude) correlates of fear of physical activity will be assessed.</description>

        The study population will consist of adult patients with diagnosed chronic heart failure of
        all underlying diagnoses. Patients have to be outpatients at time of study participation.
        They will be recruited in primary care clinics, and heart failure outpatient clinics in
        Germany. For the control group healthy volunteers without a chronic heart failure are
        recruited.
