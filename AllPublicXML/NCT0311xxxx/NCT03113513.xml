  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no study has determined prospectively which technique is superior to prevent
      recurrent Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) after vaginal hysterectomy- a major unmet clinical
      need. The aim of the study is to determine objective anatomical recurrent prolapse after
      Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation (SLF) vs McCall.

      The aim of the study is to determine objective anatomical recurrent prolapse after SLF vs
      McCall. The study is designed as a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Primary study endpoint
      will be at 12 months, secondary study endpoint at 24 months. The following parameters will be
      evaluated after one year: anatomical outcome, Quality of Life (QoL), sexual health,
      reoperations, and complications.

    <description>The Kings Health Questionnaire was validated in women with stress urinary incontinence and assesses the impact of incontinence on quality of life. The eight subscales (&quot;domains&quot;) scored between 0 (best) and 100 (worst). The Symptom Severity scale is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); lower scores indicate better QoL. Success in terms of the study is defined as 10 points improvement on the total Kings Health Questionnaire score.</description>

    <description>The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire is a 20 item questionnaire and is the primary measure used to assess sexual function in women with urinary incontinence and prolapse. Mean subscale scores are calculated by summing the valid responses to items in the subscale and then divided by the number of items with valid responses. The higher the subscores, the worse the outcome.</description>
