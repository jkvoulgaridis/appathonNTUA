    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy
      of VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP (Zika virus wildtype DNA vaccine) or placebo. In Part A, the primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine. In Part B, the primary
      objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized study to evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a
      3-dose vaccination regimen with the Zika virus wildtype (ZIKVwt) DNA vaccine,
      VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP or placebo (VRC-PBSPLA043-00-VP). The placebo is a sterile
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The hypotheses are that the ZIKVwt DNA vaccine will be safe
      and will elicit a ZIKV-specific immune response.

      Participants will receive study product intramuscularly (IM) in the limbs as specified by the
      group assignment by PharmaJet needle-free device. In Part A, 90 participants will be
      randomized to vaccine at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg or 8 mg dose of vaccine split
      between 2 or 4 injections. In Part B, about 2400 participants will be randomized to vaccine
      or placebo in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg dose of vaccine or 1 mL of placebo split between
      2 injections.

      Vaccine safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring of clinical and laboratory
      parameters throughout the study. Solicited reactogenicity symptoms will be collected for 7
      days after each product administration. The study schedule will include clinic visits with
      safety and immunogenicity blood samples collected at particular time points.

      The vaccine dose and administration plan for Part B was selected based on Part A and Phase 1
      data. Vaccine efficacy will be evaluated in Part B by comparing incidence of ZIKV cases
      between vaccine and placebo groups. During the study, when participants exhibit any possible
      symptom of ZIKV infection, they will be evaluated by blood and urine ZIKV polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). Stored blood and urine samples will also be assessed retrospectively by ZIKV
      PCR to identify possible asymptomatic cases. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      oversee the study.

    <intervention_model_description>Part A participants (n=90) will be randomized to vaccine at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg or 8 mg dose of vaccine split between 2 or 4 injections. In Part B, about 2400 participants will be randomized to vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg dose of vaccine or 1 mL of placebo split between 2 injections. The concentration and number of injections in Part B was determined by preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial and Part A.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Part A is open-label. For Part A, the participant, investigator and outcome assessor will know what the participant received.
Part B injections will be prepared by an unblinded site pharmacist, designee, or otherwise qualified personnel who will not be involved in any participants assessments and who will not discuss randomizations with study clinicians. Subjects, study personnel, site data entry personnel, and laboratory personnel performing immunologic assays will be blinded to the treatment assignment of all product administrations. The IND Sponsor intends to unblind treatment assignments for Part B of the study once 90 cases of ZIKV infection are detected. The DSMB will be consulted prior to unblinding.</masking_description>
