  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For effective drug delivery using inhalation route, it is important to use the inhalers
      correctly. This open-label study will evaluate the error rates during the use of ELLIPTA DPI,
      alone or in combination, in comparison with other DPIs. The study aims to provide clinical
      evidence in subjects with COPD that the reduced number of steps required to use the ELLIPTA
      DPI could result in fewer errors made by subjects, and therefore a more consistent treatment.
      Approximately 450 subjects prescribed with either of RELVAR® ELLIPTA, ANORO® ELLIPTA,
      INCRUSE® ELLIPTA, SYMBICORT® TURBUHALER®, SERETIDE® DISKUS®, SPIRIVA® HANDIHALER®, ULTIBRO®
      BREEZHALER® or SEEBRI® BREEZHALER will be included in the study and will have 2 clinical
      visits. At Visit 1, subjects will take their maintenance DPIs and the critical and overall
      errors made by subjects will be assessed. After the assessment, subjects will be instructed
      on correct use or informed of their correct use of their DPIs. The total duration of the
      study is approximately 6 weeks. ELLIPTA, SERETIDE and DISKUS are registered trademarks of the

        <title>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error at Visit 1-Primary Device Comparisons</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 1 and any error made by the participant was recorded by the health care practitioner (HCP) in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in patient instruction leaflets (PILs) for the respective DPI.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error at Visit 1 in Primary DPI (Relvar Ellipta DPI Versus All ICS/LABA DPIs With a LAMA Second DPI)</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 1 and any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose. The percentage of participants making at least one critical error in the primary DPI is presented. The aim of the analysis was to compare percentage of participants making at least one critical error with Ellipta versus all ICS/LABA+LAMA DPIs; hence, the arms were combined as pre-specified in the protocol and reporting and analysis plan (RAP).</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 1 and any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose and non-critical when the dose may not be affected, but the participant has demonstrated improper use of their DPI, as per the PIL. Overall errors is the combination of critical and non-critical errors. The percentage of participants with at least one overall error in primary DPI is presented. The aim of the analysis was to compare percentage of participants making at least one overall error with Ellipta versus all ICS/LABA+LAMA DPIs; hence, the arms were combined as pre-specified in the protocol and RAP.</description>

Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose and non-critical when the dose may not be affected, but the participant has demonstrated improper use of their DPI, as per the PIL. Overall errors is the combination of critical and non-critical errors. The percentage of participants with at least one overall error in primary DPI is presented. The aim of the analysis was to compare percentage of participants making at least one overall error with Ellipta and Ellipta+LAMA versus Turbuhaler and Turbuhaler+LAMA and Diskus and Diskus+LAMA; hence, the arms were combined as pre-specified in the protocol and RAP.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Overall Error at Visit 1-Dual Device Comparisons (Relvar Ellipta With or Without a LAMA DPI) Versus Any Other ICS/LABA DPI With or Without a LAMA DPI)</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 1 and any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. Errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose and non-critical when the dose may not be affected, but the participant has demonstrated improper use of their DPI, as per the PIL. Overall errors is the combination of critical and non-critical errors. Percentage of participants making at least one overall error in either one or both devices (where applicable) is presented.The aim of the analysis was to compare percentage of participants making at least one overall error with Ellipta and Ellipta+LAMA versus Turbuhaler and Turbuhaler+LAMA and Diskus and Diskus+LAMA; hence, the arms were combined as pre-specified in the protocol and RAP.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 2 within 6 weeks after they were retrained on the correct use of inhalers. Any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose. The percentage of participants making at least one critical error in the primary DPI is presented. The aim of the analysis was to compare percentage of participants making at least one critical error with Ellipta versus all ICS/LABA+LAMA DPIs; hence, the arms were combined as pre-specified in the protocol and RAP.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 2 within 6 weeks after they were retrained on the correct use of inhalers. Any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose and non-critical when the dose may not be affected, but the participant has demonstrated improper use of their DPI, as per the PIL. Overall errors is the combination of critical and non-critical errors. The percentage of participants making at least one overall error in the primary DPI is presented.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 2 within 6 weeks after they were retrained on the correct use of inhalers. Any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose and non-critical when the dose may not be affected, but the participant has demonstrated improper use of their DPI, as per PIL. Overall errors is the combination of critical and non-critical errors. The percentage of participants making at least one overall error in primary DPI is presented. The aim of the analysis was to compare percentage of participants making at least one overall error with Ellipta versus all ICS/LABA+LAMA DPIs; hence, the arms were combined as pre-specified in the protocol and RAP.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to demonstrate use of their prescribed DPI at Visit 2 within 6 weeks after they were retrained on the correct use of inhalers. Any error made by the participant was recorded by the HCP in the checklist. Checklist of instructions for correct use were based on the steps for correct use listed in PILs for the respective DPI. The errors made during demonstration by participants were defined as &quot;critical&quot;, when the participant received a lesser/no dose and non-critical when the dose may not be affected, but the participant has demonstrated improper use of their DPI, as per the PIL. Overall errors is the combination of critical and non-critical errors.
