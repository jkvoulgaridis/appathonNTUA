    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study to retrospectively evaluate the safety and to describe the
      effectiveness of cabozantinib after immunoncologic treatment with nivolumab or nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab in routine clinical practice. It consists of a retrospective chart review of
      patients who have already completed treatment with cabozantinib after nivolumab or nivolumab
      plus ipilimumab before inclusion.
