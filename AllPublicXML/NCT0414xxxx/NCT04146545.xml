  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of home-dwelling people with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are
      one of the most rapidly growing populations in the United States. Among ADRD caregivers with
      unmet health-related social needs, this study aims to evaluate the effects of the CRx-C
      intervention versus usual care on caregiver self-efficacy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CRx-C intervention is a caregiver-centered adaptation of CommunityRx (Crx), an
      information-based intervention that systematically matches people to nearby community
      resources for health-related social needs. We are conducting a single-blind randomized
      controlled trial and enrolling caregivers through 3 designated clinic sites. Caregivers will
      be screened and asked about unmet health-related social needs at the outpatient visit.
      Eligible, self-identified caregivers will complete an in-person baseline survey on-site (face
      to face), followed by phone surveys at 7, 30, 90 days, and 12 months. Caregivers randomized
      to the intervention will receive tailored information on community resources for their
      identified health-related social needs. They will also be given access to an online
      community-resource tool and shown how to use it, so they can search for additional resources
      in their community beyond the point-of-care and outside of the clinic. All caregivers
      (regardless of research arm) will also receive a series of text messages related to the study
      such as reminders to schedule the phone survey with a member of the research team.

    <description>Self-efficacy is measured with a 4-item sub-domain from the 2015 Caregiver Dementia Care and Self-Efficacy Survey (Jennings et al). Responses to each of the items are scored between 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 = &quot;strongly agree&quot; and will generate an average score.</description>
