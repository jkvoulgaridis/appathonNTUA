  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of the Assistive Device Selection, Training, and
      Education Program (ADSTEP). ADSTEP is a training program of six weekly one-on-one sessions
      with a physical therapist intended to reduce falls among people who use a hand-held walking
      aid, such as a cane or a walker. ADSTEP focuses on training in the use of the walking aid,
      and includes gait evaluation, walking aid selection and fitting, and progressive
      task-oriented training with the walking aid.

      Participants will be randomized to receive ADSTEP or a waitlist control intervention; those
      in the control condition will receive National MS Society brochures on fall prevention and
      walking aid selection, and a letter will be sent informing their care provider that the
      subject reports falling. All subjects will complete an assessment visit at baseline, and
      follow-up assessments at about 8 weeks and about 6 months after that. Subjects will complete
      paper questionnaires of patient reported outcomes (PROs), a modified Functional Gait
      Assessment / Dynamic Gait Index, and will track fall sustained over their participation in
      the study using monthly paper fall calendars. At the end of study participation, all subjects
      in the control group will be offered the opportunity to receive ADSTEP.
