  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women's pelvic-perineal pathologies are a very frequent reason for consultation in
      gynaecology. The symptoms reported are diverse and range from the most frequent (genital
      prolapse, urinary or anal incontinence, dysuria, chronic pain) to new complaints
      (dyspareunia, vaginal laxity, perineum scarring, vulvo-vaginal atrophy).

      Currently, first-line medical treatments are no longer sufficient to improve patients. New
      therapies have emerged, namely LED photobiomodulation, radio frequency, Erbium or
      fractionated CO2 laser and injectable hyaluronic acid.

      These new treatments have been used in common practice for several years, but no studies have
      standardized practices. There are no recommendations regarding these new therapies to give
      specific indications for their use.

      The aim is to standardise the indications for these new technologies.

        -  LED photobiomodulation: management of scar perineas with pain, scarring disorders or
           trophic disorders.

        -  The Erbium laser or fractionated CO2: treatment of vulvo-vaginal atrophy.

        -  radiofrequency: management of chronic pelvic-perineal and postpartum pain.

        -  injectable hyaluronic acid: treatment of vestibulodynia and trophic disorders.
           Non-validated indications are proposed for these therapies (urinary incontinence,
           vaginal laxity and prolapse)

      Initially, this involves the follow-up of patients treated in the Gynaecology-Obstetrics
      department of the University Hospital of Nîmes and the Karis medical centre of Perpignan for
      a pelvi-perineal pathology. Other centres will be gradually incremented. Patients will have
      received a letter of information and no objection to the prospective collection of her data
      as part of routine management without any other intervention. These patients should not have
      any contraindications to the use of these new therapies.

      At inclusion, the patient receives a pelvic-perineal clinical examination and a functional
      assessment (vaginal sampling), pain (EVA). The FSFI questionnaire will be administered.

      During this visit, the investigator will set up a treatment with a new therapy. This
      treatment will be chosen by the operator before recommendations are made. The operator must
      detail the type of device and the protocol chosen.

      The patient will be reviewed 4 weeks after the end of her treatment: she will benefit from an
      evaluation identical in all respects to the inclusion visit with the administration of the
      PGI-I questionnaire.

      All information concerning the discontinuation, continuation or change of treatment will be
      documented in this follow-up phase.

      In case of failure, second line treatment may be offered. Possible adverse reactions will be
      collected at all times.
