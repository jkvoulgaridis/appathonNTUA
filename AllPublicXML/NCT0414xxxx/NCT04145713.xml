  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VISNAT trial is a PILOT STUDY due to absence of previous evidences in literature on using
      probiotic in newborns with perinatal asphyxia.

      It is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, multicentre superiority trial
      with two parallel groups and a primary outcome of mortality and/or disability at 18 months of
      age.

      After informed consent is obtained from both parents, randomization will be performed as
      block randomization with a 1:1 allocation using a computer-generated allocation sequence,
      while the allocation concealment will be performed using locked bags.

      Randomization data and allocation list will be stored in a secure place and will not be
      available to any of the components of the study apart of data collectors.

      Participant files will be stored for a period of 10 years after completion of the study.

      All the components of the study will be blinded including: participants and their parents,
      healthcare providers, outcome assessors, data collectors, data analysts.

    <description>The experimental intervention will consist in administrating a high-dose multi-strain probiotic (SIVOMIXXTM) for 30 days in addition to hypothermic therapy. The administration of probiotics will begin during the first 24 hours of hypothermia, at the dose of 1 capsule open in 5 millilitre of water. It will be administered daily for 30 days, either via nasogastric tube or orally.</description>
