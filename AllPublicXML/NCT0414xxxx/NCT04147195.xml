  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how different single and combination study treatments will work in
      adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who have features of non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH). The study will see if the treatments are safe and see if they can
      improve NAFLD.
