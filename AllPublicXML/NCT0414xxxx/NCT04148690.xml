      Group antenatal care (GANC) is a service delivery model where women with pregnancies of
      similar gestational age are brought together for antenatal care (ANC), incorporating
      information sharing and peer support. This model provides selected aspects of clinical care
      to women in the group at the same time during group visits, as well as creating a support
      group of women at a similar stage in pregnancy, to improve the quality of care and engagement
      of women in the ANC process, ultimately leading to better retention in care. Initial studies
      have suggested that this improves uptake of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
      (IPTp) among women who participate, but have not evaluated the effect at community level. The
      investigators propose to assess whether use of the GANC model in Tanzania can improve the
      quality of ANC as compared to standard individual ANC, by measuring uptake of recommended
      interventions, primarily IPTp.

      Recent data from Tanzania and Kenya suggest that malaria parasitemia prevalence among
      pregnant women correlates with the prevalence among children under five, and could be used to
      track trends over time.3-5 The very high coverage of ANC (&gt;80% attending at least one ANC
      contact), suggests that pregnant women could be a good sentinel population that could be
      readily tracked over time. However, pregnant women represent only about 5% of the overall
      population, thus, it is important to demonstrate that the trends in malaria prevalence and
      household level coverage of interventions reported by pregnant women attending ANC is
      representative of coverage among the general population. If validated, these data could be
      used to augment or even replace the data on coverage of interventions collected through the
      use of malaria indicator surveys, which are expensive and infrequently conducted, and
      generally only powered to the regional level.

      Project Background Group antenatal care (GANC) is a service delivery model where women with
      pregnancies of similar gestational age are brought together for antenatal care (ANC),
      incorporating information sharing and peer support. This model provides selected aspects of
      clinical care to women in the group at the same time during group visits, as well as creating
      a support group of women at a similar stage in pregnancy, to improve the quality of care and
      engagement of women in the ANC process, ultimately leading to better retention in care.
      Initial studies have suggested that this improves uptake of intermittent preventive treatment
      in pregnancy (IPTp) among women who participate, but have not evaluated the effect at
      community level. The investigators propose to assess whether use of the GANC model in
      Tanzania can improve the quality of ANC as compared to standard individual ANC, by measuring
      uptake of recommended interventions, primarily IPTp. Tanzania have been selected as coverage
      of early ANC is high, with 98% of women receiving ANC from a trained provider in Tanzania and
      83% in Benin,1 with a median age of initiation of five and four months, respectively.
      Coverage of 4 ANC visits, however, is sub-optimal: just 36% in Geita region of Tanzania.
      Despite the relatively early initiation of ANC, in Tanzania only 56% and 26% of women
      received two and three doses of IPTp.

      Recent data from Tanzania and Kenya suggest that malaria parasitemia prevalence among
      pregnant women correlates with the prevalence among children under five, and could be used to
      track trends over time.3-5 The very high coverage of ANC (&gt;80% attending at least one ANC
      contact), suggests that pregnant women could be a good sentinel population that could be
      readily tracked over time. However, pregnant women represent only about 5% of the overall
      population, thus, it is important to demonstrate that the trends in malaria prevalence and
      household level coverage of interventions reported by pregnant women attending ANC is
      representative of coverage among the general population. If validated, these data could be
      used to augment or even replace the data on coverage of interventions collected through the
      use of malaria indicator surveys, which are expensive and infrequently conducted, and
      generally only powered to the regional level.

      Study Aims

      Primary Objectives:

        1. GANC: Assess whether GANC is associated with to improved uptake of IPTp; specifically,
           to assess whether the proportion of pregnant women receiving 3 or more doses of IPTp is
           higher in the catchment areas of facilities implementing the GANC intervention as
           compared to the catchment areas of control facilities without GANC.

        2. ANC data for surveillance: Pilot data collection from women at 1st ANC and validate
           whether the results obtained from this population are representative of the population
           as a whole.

      Secondary Objectives:

      GANC

        1. To assess whether implementation of GANC is associated with to a greater proportion of
           women completing the recommended number of ANC visits compared to control facilities
           without GANC.

        2. To assess whether the implementation of GANC leads to earlier initiation of ANC compared
           to control facilities without GANC, as women can only participate in GANC if they
           present &lt;24 weeks.

        3. To assess whether GANC is associated with increased utilization of facility-based
           delivery

        4. To assess whether GANC is associated with improved quality of care (defined as the
           coverage of key ANC interventions- blood pressure, urine test, blood test, tetanus,
           iron-folic acid (IFA), albendazole, insecticide treated bednet (ITN), IPTp)

        5. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of increasing the coverage of GANC

        6. To assess the costs and cost effectiveness of GANC versus individual ANC (standard of
           care)

           ANC data for Surveillance

        7. To understand the acceptability to pregnant women and healthcare workers of being
           asked/asking these additional questions during ANC contacts.

        8. To quantify the time per woman required to collect data on coverage of malaria control
           interventions into ANC

        9. To assess the correlation between the prevalence of malaria by rapid diagnostic test
           (RDT) among pregnant women attending 1st ANC and among children under 5 measured in
           cross sectional household surveys

       10. To explore optimal data collection strategies and determine how best to operationalize
           them (i.e., should data be collected and recorded by ANC providers or another cadre;
           e.g., a community health worker stationed at the clinic).

      Methodology Study design: This will be a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted over
      an 18-month period. Facilities will be randomized 1:1 to control and intervention arms. In
      the control arm, ANC care will be delivered as per standard practice. In the intervention
      sites, women presenting for first ANC prior to 24 weeks will be offered the opportunity to
      join group care (as long as there is still space in an appropriate group) starting with the
      2nd visit; women presenting after 24 weeks or declining to join a group will receive standard
      ANC care.

      Baseline and end line cross sectional household surveys will be conducted 18 months apart to
      measure the proportion of women living in the facility catchment areas who have completed a
      pregnancy (ie. given birth) within the past 12 months in each community who received 1, 2, 3,
      4, and 5+ doses of IPTp, the timing of initiation of ANC, number of total ANC visits,
      facility-based delivery, birth outcomes, as well as validate the representativeness of data
      on parasite prevalence, insecticide treated net (ITN) ownership and use, and care seeking.
      The sample size in each country will be sufficient to allow for an estimate of the effect of
      GANC for each country, as the effectiveness of this model is dependent on the proportion of
      women who attend ANC early, which is somewhat higher in Benin than in Tanzania.

      Implications The results will be used by the Ministries of Health (MOH) in Tanzania to
      decide: whether to expand the use of GANC as a strategy to improve quality of care and
      increase utilization of ANC; and whether pregnant women attending first ANC can be used as a
      sentinel population to improve surveillance of malaria control interventions.

      Expected findings and dissemination The investigators will share the results of this study
      with the MoHs and the partners working in malaria and maternal and child health through:
      country-based technical working groups in malaria and maternal and newborn health; community
      leaders; and women's associations—as well as dissemination events and print materials. The
      findings will contribute to the evidence to determine whether GANC is associated with
      improved ANC attendance, IPTp uptake, and quality of care (as defined as the delivery of
      specific interventions), and whether it should be scaled-up in other suitable malaria endemic
      regions. The findings on ANC surveillance will contribute to the evidence about whether this
      method of surveillance is effective and should be scaled up. The results will also be
      presented in both local and international scientific meetings and published in a
      peer-reviewed journal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Pregnant women for GANC and ANC surveillance:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Pregnant women residing in the facility catchment area, who present for initial ANC
             visit prior to 24 weeks are eligible to participate in GANC provided that they intend
             to remain in the area for the duration of the pregnancy, and agree to participate in
             GANC. All women attending first ANC at participating facilities will be asked to
             respond to a short list of questions regarding the coverage of malaria control
             interventions in their household.

        Exclusion criteria

        • Pregnant women: Women will be excluded from participation in GANC if they initiate ANC
        care &gt;24 weeks gestation, if there are no available groups that they can join, if they do
        not intend to remain in the facility catchment area for the duration of the study, or if
        they are not available during the times the group intends to meet. Women will also be
        excluded if they do not speak Swahili, as group discussions will be conducted in Swahili.

        Recently pregnant women (for cross sectional household surveys) Inclusion Criteria • To be
        included in the women's question portion of the baseline and end line household (HH)
        surveys, women must be between the ages of 15-49 years, have been pregnant/delivered in the
        previous 12 months, consent to participation, and will be eligible for inclusion in surveys
        regardless of where the woman gave birth (i.e., whether at home or in facility). All
        pregnant/recently pregnant women will be included in the cross sectional survey, but the
        sample size is calculated in order to identify those who have completed pregnancies in the
        past 12 months. There will be a short subset of demographic and knowledge questions which
        will be asked of all households (either female or male respondents) during the baseline and
        end line surveys, regardless of whether there are any recently pregnant women in the
        household.

        Exclusion criteria • Women who gave birth in the past 12 months, but are &lt;15 or &gt;49 years
        will be excluded. Those who last delivered a child over twelve months ago will be excluded
        from survey questions specific to recently pregnant women, but may answer questions related
        to community perception or general demographics. For qualitative research, the same
        criteria will be used.

        Children (for blood sampling during the cross sectional household surveys) Inclusion
        Criteria

        • Children between the ages of 6-59 months will be included provided that they are living
        in households interviewed during the baseline or end line cross sectional survey and a
        parent or legal guardian provides consent for their participation

        Exclusion criteria • Children will be excluded if they are &lt;6 months or &gt;59 months, or if
        their parent/guardian is not present or does not provide consent

        Providers:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  ANC provider who has had at least six months of work experience

          -  Health facility in-charge

          -  Health management information system (HMIS) focal person

        Exclusion criteria

        • Those who have been working in the health facility for less than six months will not be
        interviewed due to low levels of relevant experience or exposure to the intervention.

        Policy makers:

        Inclusion Criteria

        • In depth interviews may be conducted with program managers (malaria, reproductive health,
        and statistics/ data collection officers) at the district, regional and national levels

        Exclusion criteria

        • None
