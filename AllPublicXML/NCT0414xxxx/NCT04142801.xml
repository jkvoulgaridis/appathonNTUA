  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory, attentional, and behavioural symptoms are the clinical hallmarks of Neurocognitive
      disorders (NCD) such as Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. The World Health
      Organisation (WHO) guidelines for risk reduction of cognitive decline and dementia indicate
      that Cognitive training may be offered to older adults with normal cognition and with mild
      cognitive impairment to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and/or dementia. The use of
      Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the health domain is progressively
      expanding. The Alzheimer Innovation Association have developed MeMo (Memory Motivation) a
      free web application that can be used at home by patients.

      The objective of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of employing the MeMo
      platform on cognitive performance in patients suffering from NCD.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MeMo cognitive training
      exercise platform in patients suffering from neurocognitive disorders. These exercises ,have
      been developed by the association Innovation Alzheimer and the CoBTeK research team, located
      with the Nice memory Center at the Institut Claude Pompidou. MeMo can be used freely at home
      by patients. More specifically, it is a randomized controlled study that aims to compare the
      evolution of activities cognition and behavior between patients not using these exercises,
      and patients using these exercises for 12 weeks, 4 sessions per week.
