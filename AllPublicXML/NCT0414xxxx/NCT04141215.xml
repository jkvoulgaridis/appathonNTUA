  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autogenous bone graft has been considered the gold standard in Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR)
      technique used for bone augmentation. However, there are disadvantages associated with
      autograft use such as limited amount of available bone and increased morbidity for the
      patient at the sampling site. Several biomaterials have been used as a replacement of the
      autogenous bone. Viral-inactivated bone allograft powder is an alternative that has proven
      efficacy and tolerance. This study aims to assess the non-inferiority of viral-inactivated
      allogeneic bone paste compared to a viral-inactivated cortico-cancellous allogenic bone
      powder in achieving the ideal bone volume.
