  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the therapeutic tool of carcinoma increasing, life span extending, the solicitude for
      the patients'quality of life appear more important. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of
      the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms experienced by people with cancer. It can
      persist for months or years after cancer therapy is completed and has a negative impact on
      all areas of function. Meaningful evidence-based treatment options for CRF are extremely
      limited and finding safe, inexpensive, and effective interventions for managing this
      distressing symptom are urgently needed. Our previous clinical experience have shown that
      traditional Chinese medicine（TCM） had a great effect on improving CRF, Several studies proven
      that its'mechanism were related to the regulation of immune function and endocrine hormones.
      Fufang E'Jiao Jiang (FFEJJICRF) is a commonly-used Chinese patent medicine and successfully
      marketed in China for many years, which are effective in improvement for TCM symptoms of
      deficiency with qi and blood. This proposal will investigate the effects of FFEJJICRF on CRF
      among non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer, so as to find a new
      way for curing it in clinical.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By conducting large sample, multicenter, double-blind, randomized comparison clinical
      research, this test will investigate the effects of fufang E'Jiao Jiang intervening
      cancer-related fatigue (CRF) with deficiency of qi and blood, under the guidance of its
      specification. This test choose the improvement of fatigue degree as key indicator, and
      choose the improvement both symptoms of patients and quality of life as second indicators.
      And last, the study will try to verify its safety and efficacy with some haematological
      indexs and reveal its mechanism from the perspectives of hormone, immune and metabonomics, so
      as to explore the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine（TCM） in the treatment of CRF and
      support some high quality, internationally recognized clinical evidence.

    <description>Piper is composed of 24 questions assessing total CRF, as well as subscales of behavioral, affective, sensory, and cognitive/mood fatigue. Each question is cored from 0 to10 points, where a higher score indicates severe symptoms; 1 to 3 point is mild, 4 to 6 point is moderate, and 7 to 10 point is severe. Piper is taken at the baseline, 1 weeks, 3 weeks,4 weeks, and 6 weeks after treatment</description>
