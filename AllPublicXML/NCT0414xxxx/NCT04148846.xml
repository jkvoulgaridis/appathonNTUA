    <textblock>
      Post-dural puncture headache leads to high morbidity and cost to the health system. Pregnant
      women have a higher incidence than other population groups. There are several treatments for
      post dural puncture headache mentioned in the literature, not all well established, with a
      wide heterogeneity of treatment between services. Sphenopalatine block then appears as an
      alternative treatment, having been described as effective in reports and case series,
      requiring comparative experimental studies.

      Post-dural puncture headache leads to high morbidity and cost to the health system. Pregnant
      women have a higher incidence than other population groups. There are several treatments for
      post dural puncture headache mentioned in the literature, not all well established, with a
      wide heterogeneity of treatment between services. Sphenopalatine block then appears as an
      alternative treatment, having been described as effective in reports and case series,
      requiring comparative experimental studies.

      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of sphenopalatine blockade in combination with
      multimodal treatment in reducing the incidence of epidural blood patch and pain intensity in
      patients who develop headache after dural puncture, compared with the clinical treatment in
      our service.

      METHODS: A prospective randomized clinical, analytical study will be conducted at the
      Obstetric Center of the Central Institute of the University of São Paulo School of Medicine
      Hospital das Clínicas (ICHC-FMUSP). Women will be included who will undergo neuroaxis block
      for cesarean section, vaginal delivery or uterine curettage, and who later present headache
      after dural puncture, after evaluation and diagnosis by anesthesiologist. The patients will
      be divided into three groups at random. In group I, patients will receive clinical treatment
      according to the institution's old protocol for post dural puncture headache. In group II,
      patients will receive clinical treatment, according to the new protocol of the institution.
      In group III patients will receive clinical treatment, according to the new protocol of the
      institution, associated with sphenopalatine block. They will be reevaluated after 12, 24 and
      48 hours, and a visual analog scale will be applied to evaluate improvement. The pain will be
      quantified before and after treatment. Pain intensity will be evaluated by verbal numerical
      scale (EVN), incidence of need for epidural blood buffer in each group, as well as length of
      hospital stay (in days).

    <intervention_model_description>A prospective randomized clinical, analytical study will be conducted at the Obstetric Center of the Central Institute of the University of São Paulo School of Medicine Clinical Hospital (ICHC-FMUSP). Postpartum women undergoing neuraxial block for cesarean section, vaginal delivery or uterine curettage, and who later present with cerebrospinal fluid hypotension, will be studied after evaluation and diagnosis by anesthesiologist. The research will be submitted for evaluation by the Research Ethics Committees, according to resolution 196/96. Patients will be approached as to the eligibility of their participation in the study, and after the necessary clarifications, will authorize or not the proposed interventions and data collection, by signing the Informed Consent Form.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The patients will be randomly divided into three groups according to the reduced distribution of use of the site www.randomization.com to be conducted prior to the commencement of surveys and data collection. Each patient is given an identification number following a search entry order, and this number is already available through prior randomization linked to one of the three intervention groups. The professional who administers as drugs will be external to the research group and may cause non-burdensome form. Researchers who perform the evaluations of the researched variables can obtain the following results for the intervention performed.</masking_description>

    <description>The sphenopalatine block will be performed with the patient in the supine position, with neck extended. Following topical anesthesia of the nasal vestibules with one application of 10% lidocaine spray and one application of 2% lidocaine gel in each nostril, two long cotton swab applicators embedded in 2% lidocaine jelly, one in each nostril, will be introduced. They will be advanced at a 45-degree angle to the floor of the nose until resistance is encountered, indicating that the swab is in the posterior nasopharyngeal wall, superior to the middle nasal concha. It will be held in this position for 5 minutes and then removed. Thereafter, a 14 gauge, non-cutting, teflon blunt catheter will be introduced into each nostril at a 45 ° angle to the hard palate until it touches the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. For it will be applied 2ml of 0.375% Ropivacaine, on each side, slowly.</description>
