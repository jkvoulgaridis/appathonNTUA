  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a NeuroQ supplement designed by
      Dr. Bredesen to complement his Lifestyle modification protocol. Eligible participants will be
      expected to consume the NeuroQ supplement and are recommended to make lifestyle changes based
      on Dr. Bredesen's protocol. Forty participants are expected to enroll into the study,
      completing study assessments at check in visits days 30 and 60, and at the end of study visit
      on day 90. A brief follow up phone call will be conducted approximately 30 days after study
      completion to ask participants if they have continued using the lifestyle changes and if they
      have purchased and continued to consume the NeuroQ supplement.
