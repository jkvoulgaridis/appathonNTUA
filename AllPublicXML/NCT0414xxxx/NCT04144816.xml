    <textblock>
      The VRS (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) study group in Lyon is a working that aims to
      understand, predict and prevent the burden of disease caused by human respiratory syncytial
      virus (RSV) infection in infants. Incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization in the first
      year of life was estimated at 14.5 (95% CI 13.4-15.6) per 1000 births in a cohort study in
      Lyon, France. Related direct medical annual costs were estimated for this cohort at 364,269€,
      mostly attributed to children born during the RSV season (231,959€) and children born
      premature (108,673€). This study will combine existing hospital specimens and databases to
      determine the respective role of socio demographic factors, clinical risk factors, level of
      cord specific antibody at birth, and virus characteristic in the Respiratory Syncytial Virus
      (RSV) Hospitalization outcome in Infants.

      Regarding the introduction of a new RSV vaccine and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies,
      these data are of prime importance to guide future vaccine policies.

      Objective:

      To determine the main predictors of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Hospitalizations in
      Infants

      Study design:

      Prospective epidemiological, observational, one-center cohort study with sample collection.

      Study population:

      Birth cohort of infants born in Lyon before and during the RSV circulation period (October to
      march) with a follow-up until one year old (from birth until the age of 1 year maximum):

        -  Estimate Birth cohort (n=5,000).

        -  Estimate number of RSVH case (n=110).

        -  Estimate number of Blood cordon associated with a RSVH (Respiratory Syncytial Virus
           Human) case (n=60)

    <description>This will be a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study conducted across the Lyon Public hospital maternity (HFME : Hospital for women, mother and children, Croix-Rousse, Lyon-Sud) recruited from the general population.
Infants born between October 2019 and march 2020. At birth the remains (after diagnosis use) of cord blood samples will be store. Groups of RSVh cases and control will be class at one year of age using the hospital data (RSV must be confirmed by RT-PCR). Parents will be informed of the protocol. If enrolled available hospital data will be use and RSV serology testing perform on the store blood cordon.</description>
