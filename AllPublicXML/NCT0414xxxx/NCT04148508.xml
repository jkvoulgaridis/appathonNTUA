      The ECoWeB Project aims to develop and disseminate a mobile application (App) to provide
      engaging and personalized tools and psychological skills to promote emotional wellbeing and
      prevent mental health problems in adolescents and young adults.

      The project team involves 8 European nations (the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Spain,
      Greece, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Switzerland) working together in order to improve
      mental health care and access for adolescents and young adults:

        -  To use technology as a tool to assess and promote emotional well-being.

        -  To deliver empirically supported psychological interventions through a smart phone
           application to address the needs of adolescents and young adults.

        -  To improve mental well-being and prevent mental health problems in European adolescents
           and young adults.

      The ECoWeb project will consist of 2 RCT's within a longitudinal prospective cohort called
      ECoWeB-PROMOTE (indicating PROMOTION of well-being and good mental health) and ECoWeB-PREVENT
      (indicating PREVENTION of general distress, poor mental health and emotional disorders)
      respectively.

      These trials share the same recruitment procedure, interventions, outcomes (including
      self-report measures of well-being, anxiety, and depression) and design. Both are interested
      in the promotion of well-being and the prevention of general poor mental health in young
      people. The key difference is whether the participants are deemed to be at higher or lower
      risk criteria for poor mental health based on their general emotional competence skills,
      i.e., for those at low risk, do the interventions further enhance well-being, for those at
      higher risk, do the interventions prevent the worsening of poor mental health, general stress
      and distress, as well as enhancing well-being. In all cases the recruitment procedure will be
      the same, but the inclusion and exclusion criteria are different and the primary outcome
      measures are different hence they are 2 trials, rather than one, all running within the same
      cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of the personalised self-help on EC, well-being, risk trajectories, general mental
      health difficulties, and social, educational, and occupational outcomes, will be evaluated
      using cohort multiple randomized controlled trials (cmRCTs; Relton et al., 2010). Eligible
      (healthy) individuals within the prospective cohort meeting relevant criteria will consent to
      be monitored for a year using a self-help app and web-site assessments. Some of the cohort
      will be selected at random to be offered additional self-help elements within the app.

      It is important to recognise that all participants in the cohort consent at the outset to
      provide data to be used to assess the benefit of the self-help apps for the outcomes of
      interest. In a cmRCT, a large observational cohort of participants meeting eligibility
      criteria is recruited (N) and their outcomes regularly measured. For each RCT, information
      from the cohort is used to identify all eligible participants (NA). Some eligible
      participants (nA) are randomly selected and offered the app with self-help components. The
      outcomes of these randomly selected participants (nA) are then compared with the outcomes of
      eligible participants not randomly selected; that is, for ECoWeB, those receiving usual
      practice plus the ECoWeB monitoring through the app (NA−nA).

      The cmRCT design has multiple advantages:

      (i) it effectively combines a prospective long-term longitudinal cohort with a randomised
      trial(s): random selection of some participants is equivalent to random allocation of all
      with respect to generating 2+ groups whose selection and treatment have not been influenced
      by anyone or anything other than chance and where all known or unknown prognostic factors are
      distributed evenly at baseline, enabling strong inference about the causal effects of each
      intervention, whilst retaining key comparison groups that provide information as to the
      natural history of the condition and to usual care, essential for assessing primary
      prevention; (ii) consent to &quot;try&quot; a particular intervention is sought only from those offered
      that intervention, thus replicating the information and consent procedures that exist in
      routine health care; (iii) because individuals consent in advance to the option of having an
      intervention offered if eligible, the investigators avoid individuals being knowingly
      allocated to a &quot;lesser&quot; usual care condition, enhancing recruitment and retention; (iii)
      there is the facility for multiple RCTs within one cohort; (iv) increased efficiency and
      representativeness of the sample as longitudinal observational studies typically recruit a
      greater quantity and more representative sample of participants than RCTs; (v) because the
      investigators are recruiting from the general population of interested young people and not
      specifically recruiting individuals with elevated vulnerability or identified problems (and
      not seeking a clinical population - those with current or past history of psychiatric
      disorders are excluded), this approach minimises issues of stigmatization by making
      participation not limited to those with mental health issues but open for all - indeed one
      goal is that this approach to explore EC will spark interest and dialogue about EC and mental
      health in young people generally, and communicate how EC is relevant to everyone on a
      continuum (i.e., an explicitly destigmatizing approach), designed as a public health approach
      for the general population; (vi) there is no re-use of data and permissions as the cmRCT
      approach requires that the original consent is for both participation in the cohort and
      potentially being offered an intervention.

      The cmRCT design enables us to:

      (i) examine the course of mental well-being and general mental health symptoms over time in
      higher-risk and lower-risk young people determined on their EC profiles, who are left to
      their own devices, providing a natural course &quot;baseline&quot; group to assess the trajectory of
      well-being and symptoms over time and its relationship to EC, and to (ii) test if mobile app
      based self-help designed to improve EC can change this trajectory. The investigators thus
      simultaneously test: (a) a central assumption of the EC model that deficits in EC at baseline
      will predict greater symptoms of poor mental health and reduced mental well-being at 3 and 12
      months, controlling for baseline symptoms and well-being; (b) evaluate whether manipulating
      EC enhances outcomes, enabling strong causal inference.

      The ECoWeb project will consist of 2 RCT's called ECoWeB-PROMOTE (indicating PROMOTION of
      well-being and good mental health) and ECoWeB-PREVENT (indicating PREVENTION of general
      distress, poor mental health and emotional disorders).

      These trials share the same recruitment procedure, interventions, outcomes (including
      self-report measures of well-being, anxiety, and depression) and design. Both are interested
      in the promotion of well-being and the prevention of general poor mental health in young
      people. The key difference is whether the participants are deemed to be at higher or lower
      risk criteria for poor mental health based on their general emotional competence skills,
      i.e., for those at low risk, do the interventions further enhance well-being, for those at
      higher risk, do the interventions prevent the worsening of poor mental health, general stress
      and distress, as well as enhancing well-being. In all cases the recruitment procedure will be
      the same, but the inclusion and exclusion criteria are different and the primary outcome
      measures are different hence they are 2 trials, rather than one, all running within the same
      cohort.

      The ECoWeB-PROMOTE trial will recruit participants not showing elevated risk on their EC
      profile. The ECoWeB-PROMOTE trial primarily aims to improve and maintain wellbeing in those
      that are relatively well. A range of indices of poor mental health and wellbeing will be used
      as outcome measures including wellbeing, depression, anxiety and functioning: Because one
      index Is needed for the primary outcome, wellbeing on the WEMWBS is the primary outcome
      measure as potentially most relevant and sensitive for a population that is relatively well.

      The ECoWeB-PREVENT trial will recruit participants who have a hypothesized elevated risk of
      poor mental health based on their EC profile (although they are still well as the
      investigators are excluding participants with current or past psychiatric disorders) with the
      primary aim of reducing that risk through the self-help app and promoting well-being (but not
      selected on clinical diagnoses or symptoms). A range of indices of poor mental health and
      wellbeing will be used as outcome measures including wellbeing, depression, anxiety and
      functioning: Because one index Is needed for the primary outcome, depression symptoms (on the
      Patient health Questionnaire 9) have been selected as the primary outcome, as potentially the
      most sensitive and important index of poor mental health and distress, and as a strong
      predictor of future mental illness.

      Elevated risk will be determined by an assessment of emotional competence (EC). Participants
      EC will be assessed by their scores on the emotional competence questionnaires that
      participants complete at their baseline assessment.

      An algorithm is being developed to decide what combination of scores on the EC measures
      represent high and low risk, based on scoring in the least optimal quartile/tertile against
      normative data for this age group.

      The remit for the Horizon2020 grant scheme is to work towards improving promotion of mental
      wellbeing and primary prevention of mental disorders, hence the ECoWeB-PREVENT and
      ECoWeB-PROMOTE trials exclude those with a history of past depression and current depression
      or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or psychosis. The sample recruited will therefore be as
      inclusive as possible across the wider population of 16-22year olds and by definition are not
      a clinical population.
