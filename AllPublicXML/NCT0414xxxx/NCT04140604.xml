      This is a three-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety of L.
      salivarius AP-32 and B. lactis CP-9 used individually in healthy infants.

      Infants will be given the content of one capsule (mixed in infant formula or breast milk)
      twice daily (morning and evening) for 15 weeks.

      This is a three-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety of L.
      salivarius AP-32 and B. lactis CP-9 used individually in healthy infants.

      Infants will be given the content of one capsule (mixed in infant formula or breast milk)
      twice daily (morning and evening) for 15 weeks. Follow-up visits will take place at study
      days 14±3, 42±3, 70±4 and 105±4.

      Caregivers will keep a diary of the volume of formula intake/minutes of breastfeeding, stool
      frequency and consistency (hard, formed, soft/paste or loose/watery), symptoms of digestive
      tolerance (regurgitation and flatulence), sleeping time, crying/fussing time and episodes for
      3 days before each visit. At each visit, the research team will review the diary and conduct
      physical examination, including anthropometric measurements (weight, recumbent length, and
      head circumference).

      Fecal samples will be collected prior to the first administration of the assigned study
      product and at the end of study for microbiota analysis.

      Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed based on inquires to the caregivers. AEs will be
      classified as related or unrelated based on a relationship to study product intake according
      to the investigator.
