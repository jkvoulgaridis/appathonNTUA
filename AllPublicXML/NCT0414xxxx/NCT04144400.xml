  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare the efficacy of a simple, non-spiritual, self-management
      strategy that can strengthen personal and occupational resources-resources that can
      positively impact adverse reactions to military-specific demands and promote personal and
      work outcomes. Our app-based intervention, designed to strengthen a balanced self-identity
      through affirmation of growth and balance values, will be adapted to military occupational
      contexts, utilizing an existing self-management strategy (QE) to a military occupational
      context to maximize it effectiveness in strengthening participants' balanced sense of self,
      which we expect to have positive benefit on personal and work outcomes in military service
      members.

    <measure>Quiet Ego</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change between baseline and five weeks, the Quiet Ego Scale (QES; Wayment, Bauer, &amp; Sylaska, 2014) will be used to assess an identity that strikes a balance between a strong sense of agency (but not egoism) and a strong concern for the welfare of others. The QES is comprised of 14 items arranged in a 5-point Likert-type format with responses ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). Sample items include: &quot;I try to look at everybody's side of a disagreement before I make a decision&quot; and &quot;for me, life has been a continuous process of learning, changing, and growth.&quot; Higher scores on the QES indicate a stronger quiet ego. The QES has been found to have adequate internal validity (α = .76 to .78; (Wayment et al., 2014).</description>

    <measure>Spiritual Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change between baseline and five weeks, the Spiritual Fitness Scale (SFS; Hammer, Cragun, &amp; Hwang, 2013) will be used to assess the degree to which an individual has a sense of meaning, purpose, and accomplishment in their life that extends beyond the self (Peterson et al., 2011). The SFS is comprised of five items arranged in a 5-point Likert-type format with responses ranging from 1 (Not like me at all) to 5 (Very much like me). Sample items include: &quot;I have a core of beliefs, ethics, and values that give my life a sense of meaning and purpose&quot; and &quot;The work I am doing in the military is meaningful to me.&quot; Higher scores on the SFS indicate a greater capacity to identify one's core self, access resources that facilitate the realizing of the core self and strivings, and experience a sense of connectedness with people and the world (i.e., spiritual fitness). The SFS has been found to have adequate internal consistency (α = .77; Hammer et al., 2013).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change between baseline and five weeks, the positive and negative affect schedule (I-PANAS-SF; Thompson, 2007) will be used to assess positive and negative affect. The I-PANAS-SF is comprised of 10 items arranged in a 5-point Likert-type format with responses ranging from 1 (Very slightly or not at all) to 5 (Very much). Five items of the scale measure positive affect while the other five items measure negative affect. Respondents are asked to rate these positive and negative adjectives according to the extent to which each describes the way they have felt during the past week. Sample positive affect items include 'attentive', while sample negative affect items include 'upset'. Higher scores on both positive affect or negative affect indicate a tendency to experience a positive and negative mood. Both subscales (positive affect and negative affect) have been found to have adequate internal consistency (positive affect: α = .78; negative affect: α = .76; Thompson, 2007).</description>
