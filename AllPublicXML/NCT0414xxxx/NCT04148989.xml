  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a life-threatening complication of infection that can be difficult to recognize and
      treat promptly. Timely administration of antibiotics for emergency department (ED) patients
      with sepsis is challenging. The goal of this study is to determine the potential
      effectiveness and unintended consequences of reorganizing ED care for patients with suspected
      sepsis.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients presenting to the intervention emergency department after implementation of the care reorganization intervention — &quot;Code Sepsis protocol&quot; — will be compared to patients presenting prior to the intervention. Patients presenting to control emergency departments will receive usual care both before and after Code Sepsis implementation and are included in this study to control for changes in intervention-site outcomes over time unrelated to the tested intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Total antibiotic spectrum score for all antibiotics administered in first 24 hours using antibiotic spectrum scoring system developed by Stenehjem et al. (Clin Infect Dis 2016;63:1273?1280). Individual antibiotics have spectrum scores of 1 to 5, with the total score resulting from summation of the spectrum scores for each unique antibiotic administered during the first 24 hours. Minimum total 24-hour score is therefore 1 (administration of a single, minimum-spectrum antibiotic), with no maximum score. Values measured for (1) all ED patients and (2) sepsis patients.</description>
