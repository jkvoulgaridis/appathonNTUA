  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted to collect patients with prolonged
      mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive PAV+ or PSV as weaning
      mode. Weaning outcomes were compared between 2 groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure support ventilation (PSV) the most frequently used mode of ventilator support in
      intensive care units, but has several demerits. Proportional assist ventilation with
      load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) is a promising mode with better patient synchrony and
      weaning advantages. However, weaning outcome of PAV+ in patients with prolonged mechanical
      ventilation has not been evaluated before. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled
      trial in a tertiary medical center. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness between
      PAV+ and PSV for weaning adult patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
