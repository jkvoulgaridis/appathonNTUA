    <intervention_model_description>This study is a double-blinded (investigator- and participant-blinded), sponsor-open, randomized, single-ascending oral dose, 4-period crossover, placebo substitution design in 2 interleaving cohorts of healthy adult participants. An additional cohort, enrolling healthy adult participants in up to 4 crossover periods, may be included to permit assessment of any of the following: repeat of a previously administered dose level; studying additional dose levels as dictated by the evaluated safety, tolerability or PK of earlier dose levels; or any other assessment needed to meet the objectives of this study. A cohort enrolling Japanese participants to receive PF-07081532 or placebo in up to 3 periods, may be included.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female (of non-childbearing potential) participants must be 18 to 55 years of
             age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICD).

          2. Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, including blood pressure
             (BP) and pulse rate measurement, temperature, standard 12-lead ECG, telemetry and
             laboratory tests.

          3. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures. Note
             that participants enrolling as Japanese must have 4 biological Japanese grandparents
             who were born in Japan.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

          5. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal (including pancreatitis), cardiovascular, hepatic,
             psychiatric, neurological, dermatological, or allergic disease (including drug
             allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of
             dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy).

          3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;
             positive testing at screening for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis
             B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) or hepatitis C antibody
             (HCVAb).

          4. Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine
             neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2), or participants with suspected MTC per the
             investigator's judgement.

          5. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          6. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of
             investigational product.

          7. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).

          8. A positive urine drug test at screening or admission.

          9. Screening supine BP &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at
             least 5 minutes of supine rest.

         10. Screening standard 12-lead single ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results
             (eg, baseline Fridericia-corrected QT [QTcF] interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle
             branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial infarction,
             ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree
             atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).

         11. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;=1.25 × upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin
             level &gt;=1.5 × ULN, participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct
             bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin
             level is &lt;= ULN; TSH &gt; ULN; HbA1c &gt;= 6.5%.

         12. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening.

         13. Use of tobacco/nicotine containing products more than 5 cigarettes/day.

             within 60 days prior to dosing.

         15. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations
             section of the protocol.
