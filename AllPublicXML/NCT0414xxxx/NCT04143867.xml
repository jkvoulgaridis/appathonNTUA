  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, prospective, feasibility study with the Nolix device used in subjects
      with SUI, serving as their own controls. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness (both objective and subjective) and safety of the Nolix device when used for
      the temporary management of SUI in women. In addition, the study is aimed to evaluate changes
      in the quality of life (QoL) and comfort during use of the Nolix device. The primary
      effectiveness endpoint is the percent change in the mean Pad Weight Gain (%PWG) between the
      device (during the last 7 days of the 14-days Nolix use period) and control periods , with
      the success criterion defined as at least &gt;-50% of the mean %PWG change during the last 7
      days of the treatment phase as compared to the control phase. Additional effectiveness
      endpoints include the number of self-reported SUI episodes per week, the percentage of
      subjects who experience a greater than -50% change in the number of self-reported daily
      incontinence episodes, as well as the changes in the QoL, leak scores and overall
      satisfaction levels. The safety of the Nolix device is also evaluated by assessing the
      adverse events, including the results of urinalysis, vaginal swab, and vaginal examination.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL Questionnaire (measured on a 0-100 scale) will be performed at baseline and after the device-use period and refer to areas which may have been influenced or changed by accidental urine loss and/or prolapse. A lower score is considered less impact to quality of life and a higher score reflects more impact to quality of life. In the same manner, a reduction in scores from baseline reflects improved quality of life.</description>

    <description>Changes in Leak Score from the baseline period to the Nolix device use period, as measured using the Leak Score Questionnaire. The Leak Score Questionnaire will be performed (on a 0-3 scale) to evaluate the subjective perception of incontinence during eight effort demanding activities: coughing, laughing, sneezing, jumping, lifting heavy objects, walking, running, and going to the gym.</description>
