Responses are give with using a 7-point rating scale ranging from1 (Extremely Unlikely) to 7 (Extremely Likely). Higher scores indicate greater risk taking in the domain of the subscale.
the risk-perception scale evaluates the respondents' gut level assessment of how risky each behavior is on a7-point rating scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (Extremely Risky). Ratings are again added across all items of a given subscale to obtain subscale scores, with higher scores suggesting perceptions of greater risk in the domain of the subscale</description>
