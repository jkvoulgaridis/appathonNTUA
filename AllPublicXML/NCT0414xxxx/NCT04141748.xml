  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to compare hand casting to standing hydrostatic pressure casting
      using a water cylinder in persons with lower limb amputation. Our overall hypothesis is that
      standing hydrostatic pressure casting with a water cylinder will lead to more consistent and
      efficient residual limb shape capture and improved initial socket fit and comfort compared to
      hand casting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important components of restoring function in persons with lower limb
      amputation is the precise fitting of the prosthetic socket to the residual limb. However,
      this is challenging because the residual limb is dynamic in shape and volume. Additionally,
      prosthetic socket fabrication processes influence socket fit. These processes typically
      consist of residual limb shape capture, positive mold rectification, initial diagnostic
      socket fitting, and definitive prosthesis delivery. The most prevalent residual limb shape
      capture method involves a negative wrap cast in a non-weight bearing position and manual
      manipulation of the cast to conform to the residual limb shape. With this technique it is
      challenging to accurately capture the bony contours and distribute pressure evenly around the
      residual limb. To improve shape capture, techniques that rely less on manual manipulation by
      the prosthetist, such as standing hydrostatic pressure casting with a water cylinder have
      been developed. Given the use of physics to shape the residual limb, it has been proposed
      that pressure casting results in better fitting and more comfortable sockets, however this
      has not yet been demonstrated. The overall objective is to compare hand casting to standing
      hydrostatic pressure casting using a water cylinder in persons with lower limb amputation.
      Our overall hypothesis is that standing hydrostatic pressure casting with a water cylinder
      will lead to more consistent and efficient residual limb shape capture and improved initial
      socket fit and comfort compared to hand casting.
