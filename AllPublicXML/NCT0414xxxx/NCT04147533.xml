      In the first phase of the study (first 6 months after the study enrollment), 50% reduction of
      standard TKI dose follows.Physical and clinical examinations (focused on adverse effects and
      possible withdrawal syndrome manifestation) will be performed in predefined time intervals,
      pharmacological history of the subject will be taken, mandatory biochemical, hematological,
      and molecular-biological examinations will be performed.

      In the following 6 months, the dose will be reduced by 50% i.e. medication will be
      administered every other day.

      Twelve months after enrollment, the medication will be stoped. The subject is followed in
      predefined time intervals.
