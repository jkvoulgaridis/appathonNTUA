  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no effective treatment in ALS. Oxidative stress, probably interacting with
      other neurodegenerative processes, is hypothesized to play a leading role in pathogenesis.
      These include mechanisms that promote glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and
      axonal dysfunction.

      In a transgenic mouse model of fALS that develops a disease with a clinical phenotype similar
      to ALS, dietary vitamin E supplementation delayed disease onset and slowed progression,
      although it did not prolong survival. When used as an experimental therapy in human trials,
      vitamin E did not affect survival significantly, but possibly slowed ALS progression. Two
      large, prospective epidemiologic studies suggest that longterm use of vitamin E supplements
      could be inversely associated with risk of ALS or ALS death. In another study, higher
      baseline serum α-tocopherol was associated with lower subsequent risk of ALS. A modest,
      non-significant protective effect from supplementation was seen in subjects with baseline
      serum α-tocopherol levels below median levels. In the current study, we aim to investigate
      the effects of tocotrienols in patients with ALS, particularly in delaying disease
      progression as well as assessing its safety profile in this group of patients.
