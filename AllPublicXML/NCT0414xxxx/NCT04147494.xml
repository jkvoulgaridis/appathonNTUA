    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies a new imaging technique called FAPi PET/CT to determine where and
      to which degree the FAPI tracer (68Ga-FAPi-46) accumulate in normal and cancer tissues in
      patients with non-prostate cancer. The research team also want to know whether what they see
      on PET/CT images represents the tumor tissue being excised from the patient's body. The
      research team is also interested to investigate another new imaging technique called PSMA
      PET/CT. Participants will be invited to undergo a second PET/CT scan, with the PSMA tracer
      (68Ga-PSMA-11). This is not required but just an option for volunteer patients. Patients can
      decide to have only the FAPI PET/CT scan. The PET/CT scanner combines the PET and the CT
      scanners into a single device. This device combines the anatomic (body structure) information
      provided by the CT scan with the metabolic information obtained from the PET scan. PET is an
      established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very
      minimal amounts of, in the case of this research, 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-FAPi. Because some
      cancers take up 68Ga-PSMA-11 and/or 68Ga-FAPi it can be seen with PET. CT utilizes x-rays
      that traverse the body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs where
      it occurs in patient's body. FAP stands for Fibroblast Activation Protein. FAP is produced by
      cells that surround tumors. The function of FAP is not well understood but imaging studies
      have shown that FAP can be detected with FAPI PET/CT. Imaging FAP with FAPI PET/CT may in the
      future provide additional information about various cancers. PSMA stands for Prostate
      Specific Membrane Antigen. This name is incorrect as PSMA is also found in many other
      cancers. The function of PSMA is not well understood but imaging studies have shown that PSMA
      can be detected with PET in many non-prostate cancers. Imaging FAP with PET/CT may in the
      future provide additional information about various cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To define the biodistribution of gallium Ga 68 FAPi-46 (68Ga-FAPi-46) and gallium Ga
      68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) in normal and cancer tissues of patients with various
      non-prostate malignancies. The goal is to determine where and to which degree 68Ga-FAPi-46
      and 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulates in normal and cancer tissues.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether 68Ga-FAPi-46 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation observed by positron
      emission tomography (PET) correlates with the amount of fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
      and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in excised cancer tissue, respectively.

      II. As an exploratory study aim, will also assess the 68Ga-FAPI-46 biodistribution
      correlation with 68Ga-PSMA-11, if the patient volunteers for optional scan, and
      18F-fluodeoxyglucose (FDG), if any FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) has been performed as
      standard-of-care.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-FAPi-46 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 20-50 minutes.
      Patients may also receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 IV and undergo PET/CT scan over 20-50 minutes on a
      separate day (for volunteer patients only, PSMA PET/CT is optional and not required).

IHC will be scored with a semi-quantitative scoring system that accounts for staining intensity (0-2, where 0 is negative, 1 is weak, 2 is strong and eq. stands for equivocal).
