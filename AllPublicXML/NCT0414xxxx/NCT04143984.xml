  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the role of camrezlizumab with or without apatinib in
      addition to carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. According to the plan, a total of 114 will be recruited and randomized into 1 of
      the following 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: 1) CIRT alone group (patients will receive only
      carbon-ion radiotherapy); 2) CIRT plus camrelizumab group (patients will also receive
      camrelizumab in addition to CIRT); 3) CIRT plus camrelizumab and apatinib group (patients
      will receive camrelizumab and apatinib in addition to CIRT).
