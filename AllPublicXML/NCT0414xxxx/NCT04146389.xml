  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of prolactin on adrenal steroid profiles
      in patients with hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinomas before and after initialisation of
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolactin is known to influence many biological processes. One potential target is the
      adrenal gland, where prolactin may stimulate the production of adrenal steroid hormones.
      Conditions of increased prolactin production(hyperprolactinemia) could, therefore, increase
      concentrations of adrenal steroids. One of the potential implications would be false doping
      accusations of athletes engaging in elite sports.

      This interaction between prolactin and adrenal steroidogenesis, however, remains poorly
      understood, and the available research findings are conflicting.

      The investigators, therefore, seek to explore the relationship between prolactin and adrenal
      steroidogenesis by monitoring prolactin levels and blood and urinary steroid profiles of
      patients with hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinomas before and after treatment
      initialisation.
