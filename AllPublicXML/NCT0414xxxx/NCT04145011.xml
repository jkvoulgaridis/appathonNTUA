    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to assess the relative effectiveness of genicular nerve
      ablation with the COOLIEF* Cooled Radiofrequency probe to manage moderate to severe knee pain
      in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee when compared to radiofrequency ablation
      using a Standard Radiofrequency probe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind comparison study examining the
      outcomes of subjects with osteoarthritic knee pain undergoing a procedure to create a
      radiofrequency lesion of the genicular nerves with either Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation
      (CRFA) or Conventional (Standard) Radiofrequency Ablation (SRFA). Approximately 148
      participants from up to 15 sites will be enrolled into this study, with subjects undergoing
      either CRFA or SRFA in a 1:1 randomization scheme. Follow-up will be conducted for 24 months
      post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being completed at month 12. Pain, overall outcome,
      quality of life, pain medication use, and adverse events will be compared between the two
      treatment groups to determine success.

    <description>The change in KOOS JR score from baseline. The KOOS JR is a short form of the KOOS that assesses patient stiffness (1 item), pain (4 items), and functions of daily living (2 items).

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in measured EQ-5D-5L scale from baseline. This outcome instrument is composed of five sub-scales containing five questions each. The point range for each sub-scale is from 1 to 5, with &quot;1&quot; indicating the best study subject condition and &quot;5&quot; indicating the worst study subject condition. Thus, the minimum and maximum scores per sub-scale are 1 and 5, respectively, and such scores for the entire instrument are 5 (best study subject condition) and 25 (worst study subject condition).
