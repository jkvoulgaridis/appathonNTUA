      This research trial studies the incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and
      HPV-associated disease in screening Indian men who have sex with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-positive men. Gathering health information over time from Indian men who have sex with
      men (MSM) may help doctors determine how many HIV -positive MSM develop new HPV infections
      and how many HIV-positive MSM have HPV related disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the prevalence of HPV-associated premalignant lesions in the anus and penis in
      Indian HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men (MSM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe risk factors for prevalent premalignant lesions in the anus and penis in Indian
      HIV-seropositive MSM.

      II. Describe the prevalence and incidence of penile and anal HPV infection in Indian
      HIV-seropositive MSM.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive a questionnaire and undergo a targeted physical and anal clinical exam
      at months 0, 6, and 12. Participants also undergo a penile skin cell and anal swab at months
      0, 6, and 12 for cytology, HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and CD4+ T-cell count at months 0
      and 6 and HIV viral load testing at months 0 and 12. Participants also undergo
      high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and penile clinical exam at month 12.

    <description>Will be estimated for specific types, and for all types combined using the life table approach for incidence. Separate estimates will be made for each anatomical site. Risk factors for site-specific incident infection will be evaluated using regression models for survival events observed in discrete time (e.g. pooled logistic regression), incorporating behavioral and biological predictors measured at baseline, and over time at study visits. Risk factors that will be assessed include behavioral and medical history, CD4+ level, and HIV viral load.</description>
