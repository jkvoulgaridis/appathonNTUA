  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerular hyperfiltration is a major risk factor for accelerated glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR) decline and renal and cardiovascular events despite optimized conservative therapy with
      blood pressure and blood glucose (in diabetics) lowering medications and inhibitors of the
      Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or
      Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs).

      Progressive GFR decline initiated and sustained by glomerular hyperfiltration in subjects
      with diabetes, unhealthy obesity, hypertension and other risk factors, is paralleled by
      progressive glomerulosclerosis and loss of functioning nephrons.

      The inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubular segments
      of the nephrons appears to be an ideal, specific intervention to inhibit the
      tubulo-glomerular feedback and ameliorate glomerular hyperfiltration in subjects with
      absolute or relative hyperfiltration associated with unhealthy obesity or proteinuric chronic
      kidney disease (CKD). Indeed, by reducing tubular sodium reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibitors may
      enhance sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa, restore pre-glomerular resistances and
      therefore limit glomerular hyperperfusion and consequent hyperfiltration. Moreover, because
      of its natriuretic effects, SGLT2 inhibition therapy might reduce the sodium overload and
      volume expansion which, along with secondary hypertension, may further contribute to kidney
      hyperperfusion and glomerular hyperfiltration in obesity and CKD.
