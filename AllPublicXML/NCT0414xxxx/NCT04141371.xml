  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage by aneurysmal rupture is a serious condition associated with a high
      mortality rate. Among the complications presented by these patients, vasospasm is one of the
      main causes of secondary aggravation, in particular the appearance of delayed neurological
      deficits following the induced cerebral ischemia. Classically occurring between the 4th and
      12th day, with a peak on D7, its prevention is currently often ineffective.

      In recent years, many studies have shown that sodium lactate could be an interesting product
      for neuroprotection. In addition to an anti-osmotic effect that has been demonstrated by our
      team in the context of post-traumatic intracranial hypertension, a metabolic action has also
      been observed in periods of metabolic attacks induced by brain attacks. Recently, a
      vasodilatory action of sodium lactate has been observed from an experimental and clinical
      point of view.

      The purpose of this work is to observe the effect of sodium lactate, compared to placebo, on
      cerebral hemodynamics measured by perfusion CT (Mean Transit Time MTT) in a population of
      patients with hemorrhage under the arachnoid.

      This work is the preliminary work of a study that will investigate the potential preventive
      protective effect of sodium lactate on the incidence of vasospasm.
