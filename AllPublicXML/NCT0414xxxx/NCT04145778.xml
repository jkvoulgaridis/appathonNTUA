  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thoracic outlet syndrome is a rare but debilitating pathology, responsible for upper limb
      pain. Its frequency is probably underestimated because of diagnostic difficulties. This
      syndrome encompasses several entities including compressions of neurological, venous or
      arterial origin. In addition to pain, the majority of patients report fatigability and loss
      of strength in the upper limbs. However, the quantification of this loss of strength and
      fatigability has hardly been studied.

      In addition, the rehabilitation treatment is the first-line treatment of this pathology. It
      most often includes a muscle building phase.

      In this project, we would like to evaluate the proximal and distal force of patients
      presenting a thoracic outlet syndrome by comparing them to a population free from any
      pathology in the upper limbs. This evaluation would involve an isokinetic strength analysis
      of shoulder rotators at the proximal level, using an isokinetic dynamometer. At the distal
      level, the evaluation would be done using force clamps.

      In a second step, we will also be able to evaluate the effects of the reeducation on the
      strength and the muscular fatigability of the patients presenting a thoracic outlet syndrome.

        50 patients with an thoracic outlet syndrome will be needed, which corresponds to the
        annual recruitment in this care within the department of the University Hospital of Nantes.

        Patients will be included during their usual management of rehabilitation at the center.

        50 healthy subjects will be included, in order to have a patient for a healthy subject. We
        will call on the staff and student volunteers of the rehabilitation center we will match on
        age, sex and weight.

        For both groups, we will only use major topics that do not benefit from any legal
        protection measures
