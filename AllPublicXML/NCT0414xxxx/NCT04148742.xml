    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma who have relapsed from,
      refractory or intolerant to prior therapy. This study will help understand what type of side
      effects may occur with the drug treatment. It will also measure the levels of drug in the
      body and preliminarily assess its anti-cancer activity as monotherapy.
