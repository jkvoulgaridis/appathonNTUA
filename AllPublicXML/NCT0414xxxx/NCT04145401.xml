      Sponsor is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of its EVOLUTION® Revision CCK Tibia and EVOLUTION® Revision CCK Femur with
      EVOLUTION® CCK Tibial inserts. These type of studies are required by regulatory authorities
      for all devices that have been approved in Europe (EU) to evaluate the medium and long term
      clinical evidence. This study has been designed in accordance with MEDDEV2.12/2 rev 2
      (European Medical Device Vigilance System) and ISO (International Organization for
      Standardization) 14155:2011 guidelines.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To estimate the individual component survivorship of EVOLUTION® Revision Tibia,
           EVOLUTION® Revision CCK Femur, and EVOLUTION® CCK Tibial Insert.

        2. To find out the cumulative incidence of component revision of each component in this
           combination.

        3. To find out the functional outcome scores at early, midterm, and long-term follow-up.

        Primary TKA or Revision

        Single study group with prospectively enrolled patients with EVOLUTION® Revision Tibia and
        EVOLUTION® Revision CCK Femur with the EVOLUTION® CCK Insert.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presents with a primary knee arthroplasty (primary TKA or unicompartmental) or a
             revision knee that requires a revision procedure where other treatments or devices
             have failed.

          2. Decision to perform a complete knee revision with the required study components
             (EVOLUTION® Revision Tibial System and EVOLUTION® Revision CCK Femur with the
             EVOLUTION® CCK Tibial Insert) is pre-determined regardless of the research.

          3. Willing and able to complete required study visits and assessments through the 10 year
             post-operative follow-up visit.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of implantation.

          2. Has an overt infection at the time of implantation.

          3. Has inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or inadequate
             abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint which would
             make the procedure unjustifiable.

          4. Currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which would affect the endpoints
             of this protocol.

          5. Unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document.

          6. Has documented substance abuse issues.

          7. Has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability or
             willingness to participate in the study.

          8. Currently incarcerated or has impending incarceration.

          9. Has a medical condition, as judged by the Investigator, that would interfere with the
             subject's ability to comply with the requirements of the protocol.
