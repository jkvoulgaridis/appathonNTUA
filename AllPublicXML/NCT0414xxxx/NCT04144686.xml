  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is an exercise-based programme to encourage central
      nervous system (CNS) compensation for vestibular dysfunction. There is moderate to strong
      evidence to support VRT as a safe, effective management in reducing dizziness, vertigo,
      associated falls and improving quality of life in people with a unilateral and bilateral
      peripheral vestibular disorder. However, the evidence to discriminate between differing forms
      of treatment is unclear and, although, approximately 50% to 80% of persons with a vestibular
      dysfunction achieve significant subjective symptom, gait, dynamic visual acuity and postural
      stability improvements, full recovery is less common for reasons that currently remain
      unknown. Thus, further studies are required to identify optimal VRT approaches.

      The purpose of this investigation is to identify if the incorporation of dual-task (DT)
      exercises into a customised VRT programme will have an effect on treatment outcomes in
      persons with chronic vestibular disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vestibular system system (i.e. inner ear balance system) is responsible for sending
      information to the brain about how fast our head is moving as well as about static head
      position, is necessary for us to be able to see clearly when turning our heads, to navigate
      in the dark and to balance. Persons who have an inner ear balance disorder will commonly
      report subjective symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, blurry vision, difficulty concentrating,
      imbalance and increased falls. Customised vestibular rehabilitation is the mainstay of
      treatment for persons with an inner ear balance disorder. Eye, head and body movement
      exercises are included (i.e. walking while turning your head left and right to scan the road)
      as appropriate for each individual. Moderate to strong evidence exists to support vestibular
      rehabilitation as a safe, effective management for persons with an inner ear balance
      disorder. However, there is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of
      treatment and although approximately 50% to 80% of persons with a vestibular dysfunction
      achieve significant symptomatic (i.e. dizziness) and objective improvements with regards to
      their balance, walking and activities of daily living, some persons do not improve. The
      reasons for this remain unclear. Thus, although vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to
      be safe and effective, further studies are required to identify optimal vestibular
      rehabilitation treatment approaches. Dual-task training (i.e. simultaneously performing two
      different activities such as walking and talking) has been shown to be beneficial in
      improving balance and complex walking ability (i.e. walking with head turns) in older adults.
      However, no studies have investigated dual-tasking training in persons with a vestibular
      disorder. This is despite evidence showing that the ability to perform complex walking tasks
      is negatively affected in persons with a vestibular disorder when a cognitive (i.e.
      &quot;thinking&quot;) task is added. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of
      customised vestibular rehabilitation with and without the incorporation of dual-task (DT)
      exercises on subjective symptom, objective complex walking tasks, &quot;thinking&quot; function and
      psychological state. The hypothesis is that customised vestibular rehabilitation
      incorporating DT exercises will provide greater benefit compared to customised vestibular
      rehabilitation in isolation.

    <masking_description>This RCT has a single mask (assessor blinded). The blinded outcome assessors will collect all the outcome measure data at baseline (week 0) and follow-up (week 6 and 12). The outcome assessor will be asked to record any incidences of unblinding and how this occurred. Blinded outcome assessors will all be trained by Dr Marousa Pavlou or Ms Viktoria Azoidou on how to complete all assessments for parity. During the course of the study, blinded assessors will be MSc students who will work on the project as part of their MSc thesis or other PhD students in the department.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the Functional Gait Assessment which is a 10-item test that assesses performance on complex gait tasks (i.e. walking with head turns, stepping over an obstacle or stopping and turning). Scores range from 0 to 30. The highest score is 30 and greater outcomes are indicative of better performance while lower scores are indicative of poorer performance. The Functional Gait Assessment has been validated in healthy people, older adults with a history of falls and balance impairments, and people with a vestibular disorder. The minimal detectable change for Functional Gait Assessment is reported to be 6 points in persons with balance and vestibular disorders. Scores ≤22/30 identify fall risk and are predictable of falls in community-living older persons within 6 months.</description>

    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index generates seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality while lower scores indicate better outcomes.

    <measure>Situational Vertigo Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Situational Vertigo Questionnaire −shortened version measures how frequently symptoms are provoked or exacerbated in environments with visual vestibular mismatch or intense visual motion (e.g. travelling on escalators, crowds, scrolling computer screens). Scores range from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate poorer outcomes while lower scores are indicative of better outcomes. Scores ≥0.7/4 indicate visual induced dizziness symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Dizziness Handicap Inventory is a 25-item self-assessment inventory designed to evaluate self-perceived handicap imposed by symptoms of dizziness. It consists of three domains: emotional, functional and physical. Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating greater perceived handicap while lower scores are indicative of better performance. Scores between 0-30, 31-60, and 61-100 on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory indicate mild, moderate, and severe perceived handicap respectively, and can differentiate a person's functional abilities.</description>

    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive and Behavioural Symptom Questionnaire is a measure of subjects' cognitive (i.e. beliefs) and behavioural responses to symptoms of their health condition. This measure includes five cognitive (i.e. beliefs) subscales: Symptom Focusing, Catastrophizing, Damaging Beliefs, Fear Avoidance and Embarrassment Avoidance; and two behavioural subscales: All or- Nothing and Avoidance/Rest.</description>

    <measure>The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised was used to measure participants' illness perceptions. The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised measures the key components in Leventhal's common sense self-regulatory model: Illness identity will measured by asking patients to indicate whether they have experienced and attribute a number of potential symptoms to their dizziness condition. Scores range from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating increased illness identity while lower scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
