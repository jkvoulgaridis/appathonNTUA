      The objective of this research is to compare the effect of irrigation during impacted
      mandibular third molar surgery, with normal saline of 25 ± 2 ° C and 37 ± 1 ° C for control
      and experimental sides, respectively. For this purpose, 40 mandibular impacted third molars
      will be randomly allocated to two groups and surgically removed with the abovementioned
      saline temperatures. Finally, the suctioned liquids and duration of the surgeries will be
      carefully measured and compared between both sides.

          <description>In this study, during impacted mandibular third molar surgery, one side was irrigated with room temperature saline of 25 ± 2 ° C as for the control side, while the other side was irrigated with normal saline of 37 ± 1 ° C as for the experimental side.
The side for each intervention was determined by a table of random numbers.</description>
