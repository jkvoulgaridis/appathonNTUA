  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effects of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela
      on mood, satisfaction with life, happiness, ability to pay attention to the present moment
      and the capacity to make choices in a more conscious and values-oriented way. Other personal
      aspects that could be related to the effects of the Camino and that may also mediate some of
      its effects (e.g., personal reasons for walking, socialization along the Camino, number of
      days walked, physical pain associated with walking, previous pilgrimages to Santiago, etc.)
      will be also assessed.

      Methods: This is a naturalistic study with a 3-month follow-up. Voluntary participation of
      pilgrims doing one of the &quot;Way of Saint James&quot; routes will be requested. Participants will be
      asked to complete an online questionnaire with sociodemographic data and outcome measures
      (e.g. mindfulness, satisfaction with life, depression, stress, anxiety) before starting the
      Camino, at the end of the Camino and 3 months later. These evaluations will help us discover
      the effects of the Camino de Santiago on mental health and well-being in the short- and
      mid-term.

    <description>In the present study we utilized the &quot;Ultreya&quot; dataset. The Ultreya study is an online longitudinal study aimed at evaluating the effects of the pilgrimage on the Way of Saint James on mental health and wellbeing (www.estudiocamino.org). This pilgrimage involves hundreds of paths around Europe with a common termination at Santiago de Compostela (Spain), and it was one of the most important Christian pilgrimages during the Middle Ages. Currently, it is walked by thousands of people (&gt;300,000 per year).</description>
