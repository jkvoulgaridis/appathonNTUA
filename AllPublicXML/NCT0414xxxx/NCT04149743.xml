      Evaluation of the HEMOTAG速 system in a less controlled environment and concurrently develop
      the system for use by patients with heart failure.

      The overall objective of research is to test, adapt, refine and validate the HEMOTAG速 system
      to be used outside the usual medical care environments to reduce hospital readmissions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 22 years old.

          -  An index hospital admission for ADHF presenting with symptoms, clinical signs, and
             chest x-ray (CXR) findings of pulmonary congestion, receiving IV diuretics or
             vasoactive drugs and having a BNP &gt; 350 or NT-pro BNP &gt; 1800 pg/ml.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

          -  Patient's residence has adequate cellular data coverage.

          -  Diagnosis of HF (Assessment of LV systolic function using transthoracic
             Echocardiogram, Gated SPECT, MUGA or right heart catheterization; during the index
             hospitalization or within the preceding 6 months).

          -  Patients with LVEF &lt;40% must have been treated at least 90 days prior to enrollment
             with diuretics and beta-blocker (unless intolerant or contraindicated) and an ACE
             inhibitor or ARB (unless intolerant or contraindicated) or ANRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclude enrollment by consent of a legally authorized representative.

             transplantation or listed for transplantation.

          -  Implantation of a CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) device during index
             hospitalization or intent to implant a CRT device.

          -  Presence of hemodynamically significant mitral and/or aortic valve disease, except
             mitral regurgitation secondary to left ventricular dilatation.

          -  Presence of hemodynamically significant obstructive lesions of left ventricular
             outflow tract, including aortic and sub-aortic stenosis.

          -  Severe primary pulmonary, renal or hepatic disease.

          -  Subjects pregnant or planning pregnancy within 1 month.

          -  History of pulmonary embolism of less than 3 months.

          -  Dialysis dependent or dialysis initiation expected within three months.

          -  Chronic home IV therapy or cardiac inotropes or diuretics

          -  Physical deformity in the chest area or lesion that may prevent proper HEMOTAG
             application or adjustment.

          -  Illness/ Condition which may be aggravated or cause significant discomfort by the
             application of the HEMOTAG (skin issues, e.g. Intolerance to use of skin electrodes).

          -  Impaired cognitive ability or any other state that may prevent full compliance with
             the study protocol, according to investigator's assessment.

          -  Congenital heart malformations (Complex, or uncorrected congenital heart disease).

          -  Severe disease / conditions with life expectancy &lt;6 months according to investigator's
             assessment.

          -  Patient is enrolled in another interventional study (observational or registries are
             not excluded).

          -  Patient HF is managed remotely with another monitoring device or program (for example:
             Pulmonary/ Lt Atrial pressure monitoring, lung fluid monitoring, Weight scale, BNP,
             bioimpedance or ICD with impedance).

          -  Prisoners and wards of the state.

          -  Inability to provide informed consent (English, Spanish, Creole).
