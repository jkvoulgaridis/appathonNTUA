  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The co-ordination and control of body segments are integral in providing and maintaining
      postural stability. It is widely accepted that attentional demands for postural control are
      placed upon the individual, but these vary according to the nature of the task, the age of
      the individual and their postural stability. It is thought that divided attention (a
      technique whereby two tasks are performed at the same time whilst rapidly switching attention
      between the two tasks) is commonly used when multi-tasking. Divided attention may have
      important clinical implications to falls risk, in that older adults that experience falls
      have increased difficulty in switching attention between tasks such as walking and talking.
      Dual tasking paradigms which present postural and cognitive tasks are often used to test
      attentional demands for posture control and interference between the two tasks. At present it
      is not known what impact balance confidence, sleep, activity levels or cognitive ability
      impact on a person's ability to multi-task when performing complex walking tasks that reflect
      the complexity of mobilising in real-life situations.

      The co-ordination and control of body segments are integral in providing and maintaining
      postural stability. It is widely accepted that attentional demands for postural control are
      placed upon the individual, but these vary according to the nature of the task, the age of
      the individual and their postural stability. It is thought that divided attention (a

      important clinical implications to falls risk, in that older adults that experience falls
      have increased difficulty in switching attention between tasks such as walking and talking.
      Dual tasking paradigms which present postural and cognitive tasks are often used to test
      attentional demands for posture control and interference between the two tasks. At present it
      is not known what impact balance confidence, sleep, activity levels or cognitive ability
      impact on a person's ability to multi-task when performing complex walking tasks that reflect
      the complexity of mobilising in real-life situations.

      The proposed study aims to investigate, in healthy adults aged between 18-80 years old, a)
      the effect of combining functional gait tasks with different types of dual-tasks and
      cognitive task categories on total Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score (primary task), and
      task prioritisation; b) the relationship between FGA single and dual task performance, age,
      sleep and PA levels; c) the relationship between age, balance confidence, psychological
      symptoms and sleep with functional gait single and dual task performance, cognitive function,
      quality of life and PA levels.

      Principle Research Questions:

        -  What is the effect of dual-task type and/or cognitive task category on FGA performance
           (primary task), gait speed and task prioritisation?

        -  What is the relationship between age, balance confidence, psychological symptoms,
           quality of life and sleep with FGA single and dual task performance, cognitive function
           and PA levels in healthy adults?

      Hypothesis:

        1. Cognitive dual tasks will affect performance of the primary FGA task, gait speed and
           task prioritisation more than an auditory dual task.

        2. A more sedentary lifestyle, increasing age, poorer sleep state, balance confidence
           and/or lower (i.e. poorer performance) cognitive function test scores will affect
           performance on FGA dual task performance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the Functional Gait Assessment which is a 10-item test that assesses performance on complex gait tasks (i.e. walking with head turns, stepping over an obstacle or stopping and turning). Scores range from 0 to 30. The highest score is 30 and greater outcomes are indicative of better performance while lower scores are indicative of poorer performance. The Functional Gait Assessment has been validated in healthy people, older adults with a history of falls and balance impairments, and people with a vestibular disorder. The minimal detectable change for Functional Gait Assessment is reported to be 6 points in persons with balance and vestibular disorders. Scores ≤22/30 identify fall risk and are predictable of falls in community-living older persons within 6 months.</description>

    <description>All participants that meet the inclusion criteria, will have to attend the research laboratory at Centre for Human and Applied Physiological Sciences, Shepherd's House, Guy's Campus, King's College London, SE1 1UL to be assessed in a single testing session.
The testing session will require them to complete some questionnaires regarding balance confidence, psychological state, sleep and physical function and to undertake some simple tests of cognitive function. They will also undertake a brief dynamic balance assessment and the dual-task gait test. The dual-task component involves two cognitive tasks (a numeracy and a literacy task) or auditory task. The gait test will be performed separately and then together with each of two cognitive tasks or auditory task.
On the day, after the testing, each participant will, also, be provided a physical activity monitor (accelerometer-AX3) to wear on their wrist for 24 hours a day, seven days a week without taking it off.</description>
