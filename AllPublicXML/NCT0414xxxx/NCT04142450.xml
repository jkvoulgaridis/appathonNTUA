        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant (healthy volunteers) has read and signed the study written ICF

          -  1st or 2nd generation, non-mixed race, Chinese descent.

          -  Participant has clearly visible and palpable fat on the left and right lower aspects
             of the upper arms and/or left and right inner thighs, which in the investigator's
             opinion is appropriate and may benefit from the treatment.

          -  Participant has not had weight change fluctuations exceeding 4.5 kg (or 5% of body
             weight) in the preceding month.

          -  Participant has a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.5 to ≤ 30. A BMI is defined as weight
             in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2).

          -  Participant agrees to maintain weight (ie, within 5% of body weight) by not making any
             changes in diet or exercise routine during the course of the study.

          -  Participant agrees to have photographs taken of the treatment area(s) during the
             scheduled time periods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of an invasive fat reduction procedure (eg, liposuction,
             surgery, lipolytic agents, etc), or implants in or immediately adjacent to the area of
             intended treatment.

          -  Participant has a history of prior surgery or scar tissue on the arms and/or inner
             thighs related to the area being considered for treatment.

          -  Participant has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, cold agglutinin
             disease, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.

          -  Participant has a known sensitivity to cold or has any condition with a known response
             to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin, such as cold urticaria, Raynaud's
             disease, or Chilblains (pernio).

          -  Participant with a clinically significant bleeding disorder, or concomitant use of
             oral or subcutaneous anticoagulants, or is taking any medication that in the
             investigator's opinion may significantly increase the participant's risk of bruising.

          -  Participant with a history of carpal tunnel syndrome, compartment syndrome, or deep
             vein thrombosis in the upper or lower extremities.

          -  Participant is currently taking or has taken diet pills or weight control supplements
             within the past 6 months.

          -  Participant has any dermatological conditions, such as moderate to excessive skin
             laxity, infection, open wound, or scars in the location of the treatment sites that
             may interfere with the treatment or evaluation (stretch marks are not an exclusion).

          -  Participant has an active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, drug
             delivery system, or any other metal-containing implant within or adjacent to the area
             being considered for treatment.

          -  Participant is pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 3 months.

          -  Participant is lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.

          -  Participant is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Participant is currently enrolled in a clinical study of any unapproved
             investigational device, investigational product, or any other type of medical research
             judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.

          -  Participant has any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the
             professional opinion of the investigator, potentially affect the participant's
             response or the integrity of the data or would pose an unacceptable risk to the
             participant.

          -  Participant has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in
             the area(s) of intended treatment within the past 12 months.

          -  Participant needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections,

             past 6 months.

          -  Participant with known sensitivity or allergy to fructose, glycerin, isopropyl
             alcohol, or propylene glycol.

          -  Participant with impaired peripheral circulation in the area to be treated.

          -  Participant with neuropathic disorders such as post-herpetic neuralgia or diabetic
             neuropathy.
