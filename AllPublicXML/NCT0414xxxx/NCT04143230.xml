  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every day many patients affected by chronic life-limiting illnesses are admitted into
      Internal Medicine wards, coming from the Emergency Department. Many studies suggest that
      providing palliative care to these patients may improve their end-of-life care while reducing
      costs by minimizing futile treatments and unwanted intensive care unit admissions.
      Consequently, there is a strong need for acute care hospitals to more vigorously identify
      patients entering the final phase of their lives as well as their specific care needs.

      In a previous study the investigators screened for need of palliative care patients affected
      by progressive chronic diseases by means of a tool, based on the Italian Society of
      Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care - SIAARTI - position paper reporting
      criteria for patients with end-stage chronic organ failures, and on the specific clinical
      indicators elaborated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for patients with
      locally advanced/metastatic cancer. In a further pilot study, the investigators compared the
      outcomes of PC patients depending on whether the palliative care team evaluated such patients
      only if requested by the physician staff or routinely, irrespectively of a specific request,
      finding a significant increase of discharges after the activation of an appropriate PC
      service or scheduled PC ambulatory visit.

      In the present study the investigators enroll chronically ill patients admitted to an
      Internal Medicine Unit from the Emergency Department, to be screened for palliative care
      need, using the previously cited SIAARTI/NCCN screening tool (Extended Screening Tool - EST),
      or using a Simplified Screening Tool (SST), derived from the first instrument, which
      preliminary showed a superimposable efficacy. This latter tool has advantages related to much
      more shortness and therefore simplicity in the administration to a seriously ill patient and
      is much less time consuming, allowing the physician to use it routinely.

      The aim of the study is to verify the accuracy of the SST in identifying chronically ill
      patients in need of a PC approach, in comparison to the SIAARTI/NCCN tool (EST). If the SST
      would show good accuracy, an easily manageable tool for the assessment of PC needs in
      chronically ill patients would be available for the daily routine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to population aging and advances in medicine and public health, the prevalence of people
      affected by progressive, chronic, life-limiting diseases is increasing. Many studies
      documented that patients with progressive chronic diseases received care that was more aimed
      at the prolongation of life than palliation of symptoms during their last 6-12 months of
      life, as well as frequent hospitalizations. These data suggested that providing palliative
      care (PC) to these patients may improve their end-of-life care while reducing costs by
      minimizing futile treatments and unwanted ICU care.

      Consequently, there is a strong need for acute care hospitals to more vigorously identify
      patients entering the final phase of their lives as well as their specific care needs.

      Historically, Hospice and PC services have focused on the needs of cancer patients. However,
      the majority of patients needing PC worldwide suffer from life-limiting non-cancer illnesses,
      like cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure,
      cirrhosis of the liver, Alzheimer's and other dementias, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
      disease, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes. The main illnesses requiring PC are
      cardiovascular diseases (38%), cancer (34%), and COPD (10%).

      In order to correctly identify such patients, adequate screening tools are needed.

      In a previous study, the investigators employed for this aim a screening tool derived from
      the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI)
      position paper based on expert panel opinions reporting criteria to identify patients with
      end-stage chronic organ failures. For cancer patients, the screening was done according to
      specific clinical indicators elaborated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN).
      A Simplified Screening Tool was also created, in order to make available an easier instrument
      for the same aim.

      The SIAARTI/NCCN screening tool (Extended Screening Tool - EST) is, in fact, an instrument
      validated by many scientific societies, but it is very articulated and its compilation is too
      much time-consuming. The Simplified Screening Tool (SST) has been created through a
      statistical process in order to include all the critical variables, with the advantage of
      being shorter and therefore easier to administer in a routinely use.

      The aim of the current study is to demonstrate that the SST has accuracy comparable to that
      of the SIAARTI/NCCN tool in identifying chronically ill patients in need of a PC approach,
      thus making available an easily manageable tool for the assessment of PC needs in chronically
      ill patients.

      In order to do this, every enrolled patient will be administered both the SST and the
      SIAARTI/NCCN tool, in a randomized sequence.

      After completion of the enrollment and data collection, an appropriate statistical
      methodology will be employed for the comparison between the established SIAARTI/NCCN tool and
      the SST.

    <description>BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of an Emergency Department (ED)-initiated screening to identify seriously ill patients in need of palliative care (PC) and to develop a simplified screening tool (SST).
METHODS: Eligible patients with a known diagnosis of chronic heart, lung, liver, and kidney failures, or advanced cancer, awaiting to be hospitalized after an ED visit, were assessed with both screening tools (ie, EST and SST).
The outcome of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the SST in identifying chronically ill patients in need of a palliative care assessment in the hospital setting.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of Surprise Question (SQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>BACKGROUND: The surprise question (SQ), &quot;Would the investigator be surprised if this patient died within the next year?&quot; is effective in identifying the end-stage disease patients and therefore potentially unmet palliative care needs. The SG is one of the criteria assessed by screening tools to identify people in need of palliative care assessment.
METHODS: Eligible patients with a known diagnosis of chronic heart, lung, liver, and kidney failures, or advanced cancer, awaiting to be hospitalized after an ED visit, underwent an evaluation of life expectancy using the Surprise Question (SQ).
The outcome of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of SQ in identifying palliative care patients in their last year of life.</description>

    <description>BACKGROUND: Acute palliative care units (APCU) are new programs aimed at improving palliative care in hospitalized patients. Although most deaths in palliative care patients with end-stage diseases are expected, no data are available on survival.
METHODS: Eligible patients with a known diagnosis of chronic heart, lung, liver, and kidney failures, or advanced cancer, hospitalized after an ED visit, fully according to the screening tool score in an APCU, due to uncontrolled symptoms.
OUTCOME MEASURE DESCRIPTION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the survival time (day, months, years) from APCU admission to death for any cause (overall survival).</description>

METHODS: Eligible patients with a known diagnosis of chronic heart, lung, liver, and kidney failures, or advanced cancer, hospitalized after an ED visit, fully according to the screening tool score, in an APCU.
OUTCOME MEASURE DESCRIPTION:
