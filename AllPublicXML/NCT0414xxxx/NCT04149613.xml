    <textblock>
      This study investigates the predictive and prognostic values of inflammatory markers and
      microRNA in stage IV colorectal cancer. The expression of inflammatory markers and microRNA
      in plasma will be correlated with tumor location, with dietary patterns and with survival
      during treatment.

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is responsible for 10% of the world-wide cancer incidence and
      mortality. Recent data have shown that tumors arising from different regions of the colon
      differ in their molecular characteristics which causes translate into a differential clinical
      outcome.Several studies described the role of microRNA expression in the initiation and
      progression of CRC and its response to different therapeutic strategies. Other studies have
      shown that systemic inflammation is a key determinant role of clinico-pathological outcomes
      in patients with CRC. We therefore aim to evaluate the expression of selected microRNA and
      inflammatory markers in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer and assess their correlation
      with tumor location, dietary patterns, survival rates, response to systemic chemotherapy and
      other clinic-pathological parameters. We believe that identifying a predictive and prognostic
      panel made up of circulating microRNA and inflammatory markers may perhaps explain the
      difference in outcome between right and left colon and perhaps impact the clinical practice
      in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.

        Primary physicians will identify patients who are treatment naïve, stage IV colorectal
        cancer patients, and exclude the patients, who have a history of an inflammatory bowel
        disease, or an active systemic autoimmune disease, and who have a chronic / recent use of
        corticosteroids or on immunosuppressant drugs therapy. Recruitment will be done for
        patients admitted to the chemotherapy infusion unit at the Naef K. Basile Cancer
        Institution at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.
