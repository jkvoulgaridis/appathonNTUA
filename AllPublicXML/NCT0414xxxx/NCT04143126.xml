      This project will conduct a confirmatory efficacy trial of two novel psychosocial
      interventions, Cognitive Enhancement Therapy and Enriched Supportive Therapy, for the
      treatment of persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

      This project will conduct a confirmatory efficacy trial to examine the efficacy of Cognitive
      Enhancement Therapy (CET) and Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) for the treatment of
      schizophrenia patients with significant and persistent negative symptoms. A total of 90
      stabilized schizophrenia outpatients with moderate-to-severe persistent negative symptoms
      will be randomized to 18 months of CET or EST. Comprehensive data on persistent negative
      symptoms, social and non-social cognition, and functional outcome will be collected prior to
      treatment and at frequent 6-month intervals to (1) confirm the efficacy of CET and EST for
      improving persistent negative symptoms; (2) confirm the impact of cognitive target engagement
      on reduced negative symptoms; and (3) examine the short-term durability of CET and EST
      effects on negative symptoms and functioning.

    <intervention_model_description>This proposed study consists of an 18-month randomized-controlled trial in which 90 outpatients with schizophrenia with moderate-to-severe persistent negative symptoms will be randomized to Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) or Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) and treated for 18 months. Comprehensive measures of cognition, negative symptoms, and functional outcome will be collected prior to treatment, every 6-months thereafter (6 and 12 months), at treatment completion (18 months), and 3-month post-treatment follow-up (21 months) to provide a rigorous confirmatory test of the efficacy of CET and EST for patients with persistent negative symptoms and the cognitive mechanisms of negative symptom improvement in the disorder.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Negative symptoms will be assessed using the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS). The CAINS is a structured interview measure of expressive and motivational negative symptoms consisting of 13 items based on a standardized interview with anchor points for each rating. This measure was developed to address the limitations of previous negative symptom measures and designed for use in clinical trials of negative symptom therapeutics. This outcome has two endpoints that will be evaluated in this trial, persistent negative symptoms related to expression (Expression subscale) and persistent negative symptoms related to motivation/pleasure (Motivation/Pleasure subscale). Items are rated on a 0 to 4 scale, with higher scores indicating greater negative symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior to treatment, 6 months, 12, months, 18 months, and 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>A composite index of functional outcomes will be derived from measures of social adjustment commonly used in schizophrenia research. These are clinical interview-based measures of functioning, with some self-report measures, covering vocational, social, family, and other functional outcome domains. Measures will include the Social Adjustment Scale-II, Major Role Adjustment Inventory, the Global Assessment of Functioning, and other field standards of functional outcome in schizophrenia. Because these measures do not share a common Unit of Measure and because of the large number of functional outcome measures used, a composite index will be formed to assess changes in functioning to reduce Type I error from multiple inference testing.</description>

    <description>This research treatment aims to help with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization. Participants begin with cognitive training using computer software programs. They also participate in a small social-cognitive group to learn about their condition and how to act wisely in social situations by developing the abilities needed to understand another person's perspective, evaluate social contexts, and be foresightful.

    <description>This research treatment uses individual supportive therapy to help patients learn about schizophrenia, manage their emotions and stress, improve their social skills, and cope with everyday problems. Participants will learn about the impact of stress on their lives, and how to identify their own early cues of distress and apply effective coping strategies.
