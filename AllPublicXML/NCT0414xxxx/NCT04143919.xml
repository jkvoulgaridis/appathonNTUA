    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, multicenter, real-world, single-visit, low risk, phase IV interventional
      study to efficiently identify new cases of heart failure (HF) Stage C in subjects who are at
      risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in high-volume ambulatory primary care settings in 3
      countries in Central America. Subjects with 2 or more CV risk factors will be identified and
      will undergo an NYHA score assessment. If the NYHA score is ≥ II, the serum NT-proBNP
      concentration will be determined on-site on the same day. If the serum NT proBNP
      concentration is ≥ 125 pg/mL, the subject will be referred to a country specific central
      echocardiography laboratory for a transthoracic echocardiogram to measure the left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and relevant structural heart disease.

    <intervention_model_description>A recent Cochrane analysis reported a high burden of HF in Latin America (Ciapponi et al 2016), reporting an incidence of HF of 199 cases per 100 000 person-years. A cross-sectional study of 633 individuals aged ≥ 45 years, randomly selected and registered in a primary care program in Brazil (Jorge et al 2016) reported 36.6% of patients with Stage A HF, 42.7% with Stage B, and and 9.3% with symptomatic HF (Stage C). In real world settings primary care physician may attend to up to 40 patients per day, which rose to as many as 70 patients per day during high season demand, meaning in some circunstances physicians may only have up to 12 minutes per patient so patients with HF may go unnoticed. The aim of this study is to assess the practicality of an algorithm to identify new cases of HF Stage C in subjects who are at risk of CV disease in real world high-volume ambulatory primary care settings in Central America.</intervention_model_description>
