      The primary objective of Part 1 of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      S-648414 after administration of a single oral dose of S-648414 in healthy adult study
      participants.

      The primary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-648414 after
      administration of multiple oral doses of S-648414 in healthy adult study participants.

      The primary objectives of Part 3 are evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-648414 after
      administration of multiple oral doses of S-648414 in healthy adult study participants, and to
      evaluate the effect of S-648414 on the PK of dolutegravir and the effect of dolutegravir on
      the PK of S-648414 in healthy adult study participants.
