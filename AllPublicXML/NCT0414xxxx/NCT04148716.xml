  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No studies have investigated the expression of miRNAs in Dig-ScS tissues. In the absence of
      specific treatment for this frequent impairment in this connectivity, the team proposes to
      study miRNA profiles in the esophagus and duodenum to identify new therapeutic targets. The
      team is studying the involvement of pro-fibrotic &quot;key&quot; miRNAs called &quot;FibromiRs&quot;, including 3
      miRNAs from the DNM3os locus (miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p and miR-214 - characterized by the
      host laboratory) associated with monitoring the response to TGF-β in fibroblasts and their
      potential interaction with pharmacological treatments such as nintedanib and/or PPARγ
      agonists. The approach is part of a pilot study that can lead to a larger project after
      validation of the hypotheses.

      It also seems interesting to make a precise anatomopathological description with a gradation
      of the digestive fibrotic damage in view of the paucity of medical literature in this field
