  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in improving the
      gastrointestinal symptoms and autism symptoms in patients diagnosed as autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) comorbid with gastrointestinal symptoms.

    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to reconstruct the intestinal micro-ecology of children with ASD by
      the interventional treatment of FMT. At the same time, combined with metagenomics and 16S
      rRNA sequencing techniques, the trial aims to study the efficacy of intestinal micro-ecology
      for the treatment of autism symptoms and the improvement of gastrointestinal problems and
      autism symptoms in autistic patients, and to explore potential new techniques for treating
      children with ASD.

    <description>The (DQ/IQ) is evaluated by specialists in an intelligence test designed for children. Three versions of the intelligence test are the Gesell Developmental Schedules, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), which are selected according to each participant's age. Changes in the Developmental Quotient/Intelligence Quotient Scale (DQ/IQ) before and after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADOS is a structured play session conducted by clinicians, which includes a series of social communication and play &quot;presses&quot; to diagnose ASD. For younger children, social interest, joint attention, communication, symbolic play, and repetitive behaviors are assessed. Changes in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) before and after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS measures the severity of social interaction impairments in ASD populations, sensitive between 3 to 18 years of age.It provides an impression of observed social impairments, assessing domains of communication, social interactions, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and interests. Changes in the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) before and after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I assesses how much the patient's condition has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), and is recommended for all clinical trials involving participants with ASD.Improvement was defined as a score of 3 (minimally improved) or lower. Changes in the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale before and after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long Term Safety Assessed Through Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>[16, 20, 24 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>Long Term Safety refers to treatment-related as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 after the 12-week study. Evaluation of safety telephone follow-up after 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Head Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Head MRI is used to detect the structure of the brain. Changes in the head MRI results of the subject before and after treatment.</description>
