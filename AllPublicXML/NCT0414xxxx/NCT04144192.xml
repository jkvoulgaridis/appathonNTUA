    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the comparative single-dose pharmacokinetics
      (bioequivalence) of lidocaine patch 1.8% (investigational product) versus Lidoderm®
      (lidocaine patch 5%,reference product).

    <description>Subjects received all study treatments: a bolus IV injection of 0.7 mg/kg lidocaine IV in the morning of study Day 1, and then lidocaine patch treatment on Day 8 and Day 15. The sequence in which they received patch treatment was determined by random assignment. For subjects in Arm 1, 3 lidocaine 1.8% patches were applied on Day 8 and 3 Lidoderm® 5% patches were applied on Day 15.</description>
