      Assessment of surgical correction of patello-femoral instability by EOS 3D kinematics

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patella instability induces repetitive patella dislocation, which impairs day-to-day life.
      Surgery is commonly used to stabilise the patella during knee flexion. However proofs of
      efficacy of surgery on patello-femoral kinematics have not yet been found. Analysis of the
      patello-femoral kinematics is crucial to understand, assess et correct the patella
      instability. The investigators have developed, validated and published a 3D analysis method
      from biplanar X-rays (EOS 3D imaging). Our aim in this study is to assess the correction of
      the patello-femoral kinematics after surgery using the EOS 3D imaging method.

    <description>Efficacy of corrective surgery on patello-femoral instability will be assessed by measuring the patella lateral tilt (Ry) with the knee bending at 0, 20 and 45 degrees, before and after surgery. This measurement will be done using the EOS 3D Imaging technique.</description>
