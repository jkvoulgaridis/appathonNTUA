      This will be an open-label, prospective survey study of patients who previously underwent
      cataract surgery with the Alcon PanOptix or PanOptix Toric intraocular lens in both eyes,
      comparing to an existing historical dataset of patient reported outcomes with bilateral
      ReSTOR 3.0 implants.

        The Investigators will collect patient-reported outcomes data on 60 new patients where both
        eyes receive either a PanOptix or PanOptix Toric lens, depending on the correction needed
        for each eye to eliminate astigmatism and achieve the target refraction. Both eyes will be
        targeted for emmetropia. Patients will be screened based on their candidacy for a
        multifocal implant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients implanted with the PanOptix or Panoptix Toric lenses bilaterally within 6
             months of the survey administration. Patients may have the toric version of this lens
             in neither eye, one eye, or both eyes.

          -  Patients with otherwise healthy eyes, not exhibiting any significant ocular morbidity
             that would be expected to influence outcome measures.

          -  Patients whose spherical equivalent outcome is within 0.5D of target and whose
             magnitude of manifest postoperative cylinder is less than or equal to 0.75 diopters.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with visually significant co-morbidities (corneal, retina, optic nerve
             disease) that could affect their satisfaction with surgery.

          -  Patients with surgical complications either during or after surgery (capsule tears,
             iris trauma, decentered intraocular lens, cystoid macular edema, etc.)

          -  Patients with greater than grade 1 posterior capsule opacity.

          -  Patient sin the historical reference set who underwent Astigmatic Keratotomy or Limbal
             Relaxing Incision during cataract surgery. -
