  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to asses whether physyical therapy (e.g. electrotherapy in the form of low,
      medium or high frequency currents, massage and kinetotherapy) for treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis can induce or aggravate certain cardiac diseases during or immediately after
      therapy. The physyical treatment described is not a new method, is currently used and
      recommended in all guidelines for non-pharmacological and non-surgical therapy of knee
      osteoarthritis. What is not clear is whether application of electrotherapy in the knee area
      can alter the preexisting cardiac condition.

      An analytical and transversal study was carried out between March 2013 and August 2017. The
      study included a total of 46 patients previously diagnosed with degenerative knee OA. All the
      patients included in the study were recruited during inpatient visit in the Clinical
      Rehabilitation Hospital in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

      Each patient was clinically evaluated and was furthermore prescribed a PT program (ET,
      massage and kinesiotherapy). They were monitored by 24 hour-Holter ECG in 2 separate days, at
      the beginning of treatment, before applying the PT methods (day 1), and after completing a
      10-day PT program (day 2).

      PT modalities prescribed for each patient after clinical evaluation included different types
      of ET, all currently used and included in the national and international treatment
      guidelines, as in low frequency currents (galvanic or TENS), medium frequency currents
      (interferential) and high frequency currents (short wave diathermy), all combined with an
      individualized exercise program and massage therapy. The program was performed on a daily
      basis, for 10 days.

      The aim of the PT program was to decrease pain and increase range of motion in the affected
      joints and did not lead to increases in cardiac frequencies. No hydrotherapy was applied,
      given that that the Holter ECG was not waterproof. No technical incidents were reported
      during the study. No alternate positioning of the patient wearing a Holter ECG for ET
      procedures was necessary, as the region of interest was the knee. No change in current drug
      therapy was allowed for the whole duration of the study.
