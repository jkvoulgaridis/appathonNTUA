  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to investigate the effects of
      chewing gum on interdialytic weight gain, thirst, dry mouth and intradialytic symptoms in
      hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of xerostomia varies high in patients with chronic hemodialysis (HD), and the
      decreased saliva flow rate due to various mechanisms is the main factor in its development.
      The significant decrease in saliva flow due to the atrophy and fibrosis of the salivary
      glands in HD patients is further affected by the restriction in fluid intake. The use of
      drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, aspirin,
      benzodiazepines, opioids and proton pump inhibitors also leads to hyposalivation and
      xerostomia. Thirst is common in chronic HD patients due to both volumetric and osmometric
      causes but the primary mechanism is osmometric. The osmolarity of the extracellular fluid
      increases with the dietary salt and the hypothalamus is stimulated by the shrinkage of the
      osmoreceptor cells, leading to the desire to ingest liquids. Volumetric thirst develops
      secondary to water and salt loss and the resultant stimulation of cardiac baroreceptors, with
      the cardiac return volume decreasing gradually towards the end of the HD session. Increased
      interdialytic weight in HD patients causes increased risk of death due to cerebrovascular
      events and cardiovascular diseases and leads to an increase in morbidity and mortality
      together with a deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Interdialytic weight gain
      (IWG) causes incompliance with fluid control as a result of the secondary excessive
      consumption of liquid and food and is an important condition.

    <description>Interdialytic weight gain was defined as the difference between the predialytic weight and weight at the end of the previous dialysis session</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st, 6th, 12th week (3 hemodialysis sessions are done every week)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed three times at the end of the dialysis session with Visual Analogue. Thirst intensity measured on a Visual Analog Scale with scores ranging from 0 - 10. Thirst increases as the score increases. The high point describes bad outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st, 6th, 12th week (3 hemodialysis sessions are done every week)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed three times at the end of the dialysis session with Visual Analogue Scale. Visual Analogue Scale ranging from 0 (no dry mouth) to 10 (worst dry mouth). Dry mouth increases the score increases. The high point describes bad outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Dry Mouth at Three Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st and 12th week (3 hemodialysis sessions are done every week)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed two times at the end of the dialysis session with sample of saliva. Saliva flow rate/minute will be measured. Saliva flow rate/minute is presented with &quot;ml&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Intradialytic Symptoms at Three Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st and 12th week (3 hemodialysis sessions are done every week)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed with &quot;Dialysis Symptom Index&quot;. Using this scoring system, the minimum possible total severity score was 0 if none of the 30 symptoms was present and the maximum potential. Score was 150 if all of the 30 symptoms were reported and rated as &quot;very much bothersome&quot;. The minimum value is &quot;0&quot; and the maximum value is &quot;150&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Anxiety at Three Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st and 12th week (3 hemodialysis sessions are done every week)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. This scale, which has a two-factor structure is comprised of 14 items. Seven of these items assess the anxiety status and the remaining seven assess depression. Each item is scored on a four-point scale. Total score ranges between 0 and 21 for anxiety and depression. Scores between 0 and 7 indicate normal emotional status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Fluid Control at Three Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the 1st and 12th week (3 hemodialysis sessions are done every week)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed with &quot;Fluid Control Scale in Hemodialysis Patients&quot;. the scale had 24 items and three subdimensions,namely, knowledge, behavior, and attitude. The lowest score obtained from the scale was 24 and the highest score was 72, and the higher the score, the greater the compliance of the patients with fluid control.</description>
