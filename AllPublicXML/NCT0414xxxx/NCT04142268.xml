    <textblock>
      The investigator measured the arterial stiffness using cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI)
      test in patient with preeclampsia and normal pregnant women to evaluate the longitudinal
      change of CAVI and their predictors.

      This study was a case control study and included 37 women with preeclampsia (PE group) and 36
      normotensive women (control group) who gave birth to child at Seoul National University
      Bundang Hospital.

      Cario-ankle vasuclar index (CAVI) was measured at one day, six months and one year after
      delivery in both group.

      The investigator also checked the body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, serum
      creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) simultaneously with
      CAVI.

      The relationship between the presence of preelampsia and longitudinal changes of CAVI, blood
      pressure and metabolic indices were evaluated using generalized estimating equation (GEE)
      method.
