      To evaluate the feasibility and safety of the Millipede Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring
      System (Millipede System) in patients with functional mitral regurgitation
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The Millipede Feasibility Study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm study to assess the
      safety and feasibility of the Millipede Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System in patients
      with functional mitral regurgitation. The study will include subjects with functional mitral
      regurgitation classified as moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) that are symptomatic (NYHA
      Class II-IV) despite guideline directed medical therapy in whom the local hearth team
      determines that surgery is not an option for mitral valve repair. Clinical follow-up will be
      required in hospital, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually through 5
      years post-procedure. Subjects who have any part of the Millipede Transcatheter Annuloplasty
      Ring System introduced into the body but who do not end up with an implant will be followed
      through 30 days.

    <description>The Millipede Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System is a repair device used for treating mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The system consists of several components: a transcatheter annuloplasty ring (implant) which remains in the body and a delivery system and intracardiac echocardiography catheter (imaging device) used to deliver the implant to the mitral valve.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older

          -  Subject (or legal guardian) understands the trial requirements and the treatment
             procedures and provides written informed consent before any trial-specific tests or
             procedures are performed

          -  Subject has moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) functional mitral regurgitation

          -  Subject is symptomatic (NYHA Class II-IV) despite guideline directed medical therapy,
             including CRT if indicated

          -  The local site heart team concurs that surgery will not be offered as a treatment
             option

          -  Subject is a candidate for annuloplasty based on the criteria below as assessed by the
             investigative site:

        aneurysm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has severe calcification of the mitral annulus or leaflets, mitral annular
             diameter &gt;43 mm in any dimension or other anatomic features which make the patient
             unsuitable for annuloplasty with the Millipede System in the judgment of the treating
             physician

          -  Transfemoral venous and transseptal access determined not to be feasible
