  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety of combination immune therapy in HIV-infected participants whose HIV is
      controlled with ART, by determining the incidence and severity of adverse events.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study to examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination
      of 4 immunotherapies for treatment of HIV in participants with controlled HIV viremia and
      stable CD4 counts on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      The study will be conducted in two separate phases using two distinct to groups of
      participants where each group will have 10 individuals enrolled.

      Treatment will consist of N-803, VRC07-523LS, PGT121, and haNK, with N-803 given for 3 cycles
      of 9 weeks/cycle. N-803 will be given every 3 weeks (3 doses/cycle), bNAbs will be given
      every 9 weeks, and haNK cells administered on the same day as each infusion of N-803. Total
      study duration will be 27 weeks.

      Group 1 will receive only N-803 and the bNAbs; they will not receive the haNK™ cells. When 2
      participants are enrolled and on active treatment for one month in Group 1, the Safety
      Monitoring Committee will review all data and if there are no safety concerns raised in the
      data recorded from administration of the interventions to those participants, Group 1 will
      continue. When Group 1 is complete, the SMC will again review all data before Group 2 can
      proceed with enrollment. The protocol for Group 2 will be identical to the one followed by
      Group 1, except that they will receive haNK™ cells at 2 × 109 cells/dose IV on the same day
      as each dose of N-803.

      Optional tissue biopsies (lymph node and colonoscopy to collect gut-associated lymphoid
      tissue (GALT)) will occur at baseline and again 9 weeks after the last infusion of bNAbs. We
      aim to perform biopsies on least 8 out of 10 participants in each group.

    <time_frame>27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of serious adverse events (SAEs) graded 3 (severe pain; interferes with oral intake), 4 (life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention needed), and 5 (death) experienced in the haNK cell group compared to the group receiving no haNK cells. Lower number of SAEs indicated greater treatment safety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of HIV Reservoir in PBMCs</measure>
    <time_frame>27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HIV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be quantified using next gen sequencing. Percent reduction in HIV RNA reservoirs in these cells will be compared between groups. Greater percent reduction in viral reservoirs in haNK cell group indicates greater efficacy of haNK cell therapy compared to no haNK cell therapy.</description>
