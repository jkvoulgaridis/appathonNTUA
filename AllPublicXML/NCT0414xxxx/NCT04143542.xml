      This study aims to the comparison of Quadratus Lumborum Block 2 and Transversus Abdominis
      Plan Block for Postoperative Analgesia in Abdominal Surgery.

      In abdominal surgeries, USG guided body blocks are performed for postoperative analgesia. For
      this purpose, Transversus Abdominis Plan Block (TAPB) and Quadratus Lumborum Block 2 (QLB 2)
      are frequently used blocks.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate for postoperative analgesia of preoperative trunk
      blocks, intraoperative hemodynamic changes with the unblocked control group, Modified Aldrete
      Recovery Score (MADS) 9 in the recovery unit, Numerical pain scale (NRS) in the service
      department, It is aimed to examine and compare the time it reaches on the 1st, 2nd and 24th
      hours after this period. Patient satisfaction is also evaluated in the ward.

    <description>There was no intervention. All patients will receive pre-oxygenation with O2 100% for 3 min. Anesthesia will be induced by using fentanyl 1μg/kg, propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg will be used for muscle relaxation. Anesthesia will be maintained by controlled ventilation with oxygen and air (50:50) with the target of EtCO2≈ 35-40 mmHg, isoflurane 1:1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). Anesthesia will be discontinued and tracheal extubation will be done once the patient fulfills the extubation criteria.Tramadol 100 mg i.v. Before 15 min end of surgery. The patient control analgesia device will administer all patients.</description>
