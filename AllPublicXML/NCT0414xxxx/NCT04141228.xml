      utilization and costs, and all-cause, major bleeding-, clinically relevant bleeding-, any
      bleeding-, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related hospital readmissions among hospitalized
      VTE patients treated with apixaban or warfarin, with or without low molecular weight heparin

        The study population will include patients with a hospital or ED discharge International
        Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or ICD-10 code
        indicating a primary diagnosis of VTE identified from the Premier Hospital database between
        01-Aug-2014 and 31-May-2016. Patients who received apixaban or warfarin with or without
        LMWH during any time of the hospitalization (from admission to discharge) will be
        identified. Patients receiving both apixaban and warfarin, or any other direct oral
        anticoagulant (DOAC), including rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban, during the index
        hospitalizations will be excluded from the study population. Patients will be required to
        have no evidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) during the index
        hospitalizations or the baseline periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a primary diagnosis of VTE identified by ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes from the
             Premier Hospital database between 01-Aug-2014 and 31-May-2016

          -  Age 18 years or older as of index hospitalization with VTE diagnosis

          -  Patients will be required to have received apixaban or warfarin with or without LMWH
             (index drugs) during the index hospitalizations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received both apixaban and warfarin during the index hospitalization. This exclusion
             criterion will allow to cleanly group patients into the apixaban and warfarin usage
             cohorts.

          -  Received any other Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) including rivaroxaban,
             dabigatran, and edoxaban during the index hospitalization

          -  Have any primary or secondary diagnosis code for Atrial fibrillation/Atrial flutter
             (AF/AFL), or pregnancy, or records of inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) usage during
             the index hospitalizations or the baseline periods.

          -  Patients transferred from other facilities

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply
