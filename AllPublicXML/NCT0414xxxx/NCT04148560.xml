  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this small study is to test the validity of the Remote Food Photography
      Method and an updated SmartIntake app in a sample of adolescents. The investigators will test
      the validity (accuracy) of the method/app at estimating energy intake in free-living
      conditions over approximately three days compared to doubly labeled water. This is a small
      study that has low statistical power, but will provide important data nonetheless and inform
      future research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Energy intake (EI) is an important predictor of weight gain (1) and accurate methods to
      measure children's and adolescent's EI are needed. Self-report methods (e.g., 24-hour recall
      and food records) have their strengths and are frequently used to measure children's EI.
      Nonetheless, they also have significant limitations, including participant and caregiver
      burden and lack of near real-time data.

      Our group developed the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) to measure the EI of adults in
      near real-time and the validity data in adults are exceptional; the RFPM underestimates EI in
      laboratory settings by less than 6% and in free-living conditions by less than 7% compared to
      weighed foods and by less than 4% compared to doubly labeled water (DLW) over 6 days. At the
      same time, participant burden is drastically reduced compared to self-report methods, as
      participants are only required to capture images of their food selection and plate waste with
      a smartphone app and send these images to the laboratory for analysis. This validation study
      aims to assess the accuracy of the RFPM and SmartIntake app in a sample of adolescents in
      free-living conditions.

    <description>Energy intake is measured by the RFPM and DLW in kcal per day over 3 days. We will use the mean of the 3 days in the analyses. Two one-sided paired t-tests (α = 0.05 for each) will be performed in this pilot with equivalence bounds at 2% increments between 8% and 34% to determine equivalence in kcal estimates between RFPM and DLW.</description>

    <description>Participants who enroll will be trained in using the RFPM/SmartIntake app and a food record and will complete the Food Intake Assessment Preference Survey. They will also use both methods to estimate intake during a simulated lab-based meal (they will not eat during this simulated meal). They will be dosed with DLW at this visit and will use the RFPM for the subsequent 1-2 days to get accustomed to using the method, with the following three days comprising the data collection period.</description>
