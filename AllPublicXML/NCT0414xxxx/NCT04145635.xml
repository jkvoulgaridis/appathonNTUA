      The Aortix CRS Pilot Study: An Evaluation of the Safety and Performance of the Aortix System
      for Intra-Aortic Mechanical Circulatory Support in Patients with Cardiorenal Syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the
      safety and performance of the Aortix System in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated
      heart failure (ADHF) and worsening renal function refractory to medical management with
      persistent congestion. The Aortix system consists of the Aortix Delivery System, Introducer
      Set, the Aortix Pump, the Aortix Control System, and the Aortix Retrieval System.
