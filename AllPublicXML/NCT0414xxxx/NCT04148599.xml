  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare between intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine and
      intravenous infusion of lidocaine in reduction of proinflammatory cytokines as IL-6 and
      TNF-α, some stress reactions (serum insulin and serum lactate),and postoperative analgesic
      requirements in patients undergoing surgery for pelviabdominal cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients who undergo surgery face many sources of stress. Surgery causes major
      cytokine and neuroendocrinal changes like increased levels of catecholamine and steroid
      hormones and other metabolic consequences .This stress response is considered a defense
      mechanism important for developing resistance to noxious insults.

      The cytokine cascade caused by surgical stimulation is complex with various effects on the
      injured host. Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines from the site of injury
      causes many systemic changes such as metabolic derangements and hemodynamic instability. Some
      released cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6(IL-6) can cause
      long lasting hyperalgesia. These proinflammatory cytokines change pain signal transmission
      through cytokine induced release of some neuroactive substances like nitric oxide, oxygen
      free radicals and excitatory amino acids. On the other hand anti-inflammatory cytokines are
      also released during inflammation to counteract these effects and keep balance.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that has sedative,
      analgesic, anesthetic-sparing properties with no respiratory depression. Its
      anti-inflammatory effects are being studied.

      Intravenous lidocaine can be used in management of chronic pain. Lidocaine has
      anti-inflammatory properties and is capable of reducing postoperative analgesic requirements
      and the length of hospitalization.

      The effect of both drugs on proinflammatory cytokines and stress response will be assessed

    <description>assessment of postoperative pain using the visual analogue scale score. the scale is a straight horizontal line (100 mm). The ends are defined as the extreme limits of pain orientated from the left (no pain) to the right (worst pain).The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state.
The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.higher VAS score means worse pain</description>
