      This study will test will how eating on a particular daily schedule may effect energy, weight
      gain or loss, and body temperature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there have been a large number of studies in humans on the effects of food intake at
      night, very few studies directly address the hypothesis that inappropriately phased eating or
      snacking (i.e., at night) in humans disrupts metabolism and respiratory quotient (RQ)
      patterns and there are no studies that we are aware of that directly measure circadian clock
      phase relative to timing of food intake while evaluating metabolism. This may be critical,
      because it is well established that the timing of food intake can also modulate circadian
      clock phase.

      Hypothesis: Food consumption in the subjective night (e.g., 20:00 - 02:00) will result in a
      different circadian metabolic profile measured by RQ) than food consumed in the subjective
      day.

      Aim 1: To determine if there are daily rhythms of switching between lipid and carbohydrate
      metabolism in humans that are altered by the timing of food intake. Aim 2: To determine if
      timing of food intake results in &quot;internal desynchronization&quot; between the metabolic rhythms
      (RQ) and the rhythm in core body temperature (a marker of central circadian phase).

      Aim 3: To determine if body composition has measurable impact on the circadian regulation of
      metabolism.

      In this study we will test human subjects in a specially designed whole-room indirect
      calorimeter where energy expenditure and RQ will be monitored by indirect calorimetry
      continuously over 56 hours. Circadian phase and amplitude will be assessed by continuously
      recording the core body temperature rhythm using the Vital Sense Integrated Physiological
      Monitoring System in which subjects swallow a telemetry capsule that transmits core body
      temperature to a data acquisition module. In consultation with a nutritionist at Vanderbilt,
      we will use a cross-over design in which daily diets have the same caloric and nutritional
      value but in which the subjects consume the calories that would normally be breakfast as
      snacks consumed in the late-evening.
