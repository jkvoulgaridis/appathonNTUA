  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe muscle loss in patients with cancer has been associated with increased physical
      disability, extended hospitalization, infectious and noninfectious complications, increased
      risk of severe toxicity during cancer treatment, poor quality of life and shortened survival.
      Adequate protein is key to sustain muscle mass and overall health. However, current
      nutritional recommendations are not specific or evidence-based. The aim of this project is to
      determine the protein needs of patients with colorectal cancer. Protein needs will be
      determined using a novel, non-invasive approach. Our results will inform nutritional
      recommendations and guidelines with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for people with
      cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients age 45-80 years;

          -  Patients attending the new patient clinic at the Cross Cancer Institute with a
             diagnosis of colorectal cancer (stages II to III) who are scheduled to receive
             standard first-line chemotherapy (post-surgical) within 1 month;

          -  Able to complete baseline visits within 20 days of starting first-line chemotherapy;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status â‰¤2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Premenopausal women due to impact on protein requirements;

          -  Systemic cancer treatment in the 4 weeks before first baseline visit;

          -  Renal impairment based on a creatinine clearance for estimated glomerular filtration
             rate (eGFR) of &lt;60 mL/min or abnormal glucose metabolism based on a fasting glucose
             level &gt;6mmol/L ;

          -  Comorbidities or medications that would interfere with the participants ability to
             follow the study protocol or the quality of the data(e.g. diabetes, class III
             obesity);

          -  Unable/unwilling to provide urine, breath and blood samples (e.g. oxygen tank,
             catheter, etc.);

          -  Unable to eat the meals provided (i.e. receiving parenteral or enteral nutrition,
             severe allergies);
