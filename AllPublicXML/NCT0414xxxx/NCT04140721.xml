  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a relatively common condition affecting mostly
      otherwise healthy young women. These patients have high heart rate and disabling symptoms
      during standing. Quality of life may be poor. The sympathetic nerves in the autonomic nervous
      system help to maintain normal blood pressures and heart rates during activities of daily
      life.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the importance of sympathetic activation as a cause
      of orthostatic symptoms. The investigators will assess the effects of a blood pressure
      medication (Moxonidine) on the symptoms during standing. Moxonidine lowers sympathetic
      activity. The investigators believe patients with high resting sympathetic activity might
      benefit from Moxonidine. It might reduce high heart rate and improve symptoms during
      standing. This study should help clinicians and the growing population of patients with POTS
      gain a better understanding of this disorder and find more personalized treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with POTS experience symptoms and an increase in heart rate≥30 beats/min with
      standing in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. As a result of considerable functional
      impairment, individuals with POTS are often unable to attend school or work. There is
      agreement that POTS is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple overlapping pathophysiologies
      proposed to underlie the clinical phenotype of patients. It would be important to define the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in an individual patient to design optimal therapy.
      Our overarching hypothesis is that there is a subset of POTS patients (psPOTS) with a central
      sympathetic activation as the primary pathophysiology. We have characterized these patients
      by an increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, a reflection of central
      sympathetic outflow) even at rest. In this project, we will focus on the role of primary
      sympathetic activation in the pathogenesis of POTS. Direct neural recordings of sympathetic
      activity, central sympathetic inhibition and extensive autonomic phenotyping will enable us
      to identify and correct the primary pathophysiology to optimally benefit psPOTS patients.
      This is a mechanistic study, designed to assess the effects of 4 weeks of central
      sympatholysis with moxonidine on orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms (Specific Aim 1),
      hypovolemia (Specific Aim 2) and central and peripheral baroreflex properties (Specific Aim
      3) in a randomized, crossover design with POTS patients having elevated resting sympathetic
      nerve activity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Orthostatic Symptom Burden [delta (delta VOSS)]</measure>
    <time_frame>after 30 min supine to after 15 min of 60 degrees upright tilt (delta VOSS), 2-3 hours after a dose of the treatment assigned for the previous 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>VOSS is a validated questionnaire that consists of 9 items: mental clouding, blurred vision, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, lightheadedness, and nausea. Each item is scored on a 0 to 10 scale (with 0 reflecting absence of symptoms), and the change of the total scores (range: 0-90) from supine to upright postures (delta VOSS) will be used as a measure of orthostatic symptom burden. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in orthostatic symptom burden [delta (delta VOSS)] following 4 weeks of placebo vs. moxonidine treatment.</description>
