    <textblock>
      The STRENGTH project is a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a 6 months
      multimodal intervention consisted of adapted Tango dancing together with music therapy,
      engagement in social activities, cognitive intervention and psycho-education on functional,
      biological, cognitive outcomes and psycho-social aspects in 300 subjects with mild cognitive
      impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline represents a pathological condition for elderly with negative consequences
      on social functioning and independent living. To reduce the incidence of cognitive deficits
      in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), treatments that prevent or delay dementia are needed. The
      main objective of STRENGTH Project, is the assessment of the effects of a comprehensive
      intervention in 300 subjects with MCI, finalized to improve functional, biochemical,
      cognitive outcomes and psycho-social aspects. The study uses a multidisciplinary approach,
      has a 3-year duration, and includes 3 follow-up phases. Participants will be assigned to: a)
      Experimental group, which will undergo a multimodal intervention for improving cognitive
      outcomes, functional status and mobility. Treatment will include sessions of Adapted tango,
      music therapy, engagement in social activities, comprehensive cognitive intervention and
      psycho-education for 6 months; or b) Control group, which will receive psycho-education and
      advice on healthy life-style for 6 months. Cognitive and psycho-social outcomes, functional,
      cardiovascular status, life-style characteristics, biochemical determination, will be
      evaluated at baseline and longitudinally. Our hypothesis is based on expectation that the
      proposed could improve cognitive, functional outcomes and quality of life, with a positive
      impact on prevention of onset of dementia and cognitive decline in MCI subjects.

    <description>Italian version of the Corsi test. This is a neuropsychological instrument, for the assessment of the spatial learning and memory processes. It consists of 9 blocks randomly arranged on a board. The investigator points to a series of blocks at a rate of one block per second, and then the subjects have to point at the same blocks in the same order. The longest sequence correctly reproduced represents the measure of spatial span. An increase of at least 1 point will indicate the success of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). An overall Global CDR® Score may be calculated through the use of an CDR® Scoring Algorithm. This score is useful for characterizing and tracking a patient's level of impairment/dementia: 0 = Normal; 0.5 = Very Mild Dementia; 1 = Mild Dementia; 2 = Moderate Dementia; 3 = Severe Dementia.</description>

    <description>Geriatric depression scale (GDS-15 items). The score ranges from 0 to 15 and a score of zero to four is considered to be within the normal range, five to nine indicates mild depression, and a score of 10 or more indicates moderate to severe depression.</description>
