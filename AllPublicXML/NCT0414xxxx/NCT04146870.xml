    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study were :(1) to comprehensively and systematically evaluate
      the nutritional status of patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. (2) to
      explore the effect of nutritional factors on the prognosis of patients treated by
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      This study is devised to investigate nutritional status in patients who have undergone
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow
      University. Evaluation time points include the day before receiving conditioning regimen,
      post-transplantation 180 days, the nutritional status of patients were systematically
      evaluated from the aspects of food intake, physical activity level, body composition, blood
      biochemistry, etc. Also, the effect of nutritional factors on prognosis of hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantaion patients will be evaluated.
