  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-centered, randomized controlled study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Ohana
      IVF Sperm Preparation Kit vs. a standard IVF sperm preparation kit.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This blinded, randomized, standard-controlled, paired study will be performed in
      approximately 83 healthy couples (pairs of male and female subjects), who are appropriate
      candidates for IVF in six fertility centers located in the United States (US).

      The study will capture the selection of the best embryo for transfer and follow-up on
      pregnancy outcomes that result from the transfer of the selected embryo following the IVF
      procedure, and the results of safety assessments.
