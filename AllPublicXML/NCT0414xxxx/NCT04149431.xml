      This multicenter prospective double blinded placebo-controlled randomized study is designed
      to to evaluate clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety of medical product Derinat®,
      solution for external and local use 0.25% in acute infections of respiratory system in
      children

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized phase III-IV clinical trial in parallel
      groups to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Derinat versus Placebo in patients with acute
      upper respiratory tract infection.

      The study will include only patients with mild to moderate acute upper respiratory tract
      infection, without complications. According to the recommendations of the FDA (Guidance for
      Industry Influenza: Developing Drugs for Treatment and/or Prophylaxis) this category of
      patients is the best suited for placebo-controlled studies, because the expected serious
      risks without treatment are negligible. For studies evaluating the therapy of patients with
      mild to moderate acute respiratory upper respiratory tract infection without complications, a
      placebo-controlled trial design is preferred, as opposed to designs with no less efficacy
      (non-inferiority).

      This study provides for the inclusion of both outpatient patients and patients admitted to
      the hospital for epidemiological indications (i.e. patients with acute respiratory infection
      of the upper respiratory tract of mild and moderate severity without complications that pose
      an epidemic risk.

      Assessment of criteria of severity of acute respiratory infection of the upper respiratory
      tract will be carried out by Investigator based on standards of diagnosis and treatment of
      infectious diseases in children at the stages of medical care, depending on the forms of
      severity of the disease.

      The study is planned sequentially in 5 age groups. The study begins with the older age group
      and as the results on the safety of the drug are obtained, in the course of the study, it is
      possible to move to younger age groups
