      This study evaluates endurance of trunk muscles, balance and pulmonary functions in dancers.
      The participants will be evaluated trunk muscles endurance, pulmonary functions and balance
      which evaluated by computerized force plate system.

    <textblock>
      Dance is a form of exercise associated with movements that require balance, flexibility,
      endurance and skill. In addition to maintaining balance, the endurance of the trunk
      stabilizer muscles has an important role in sport-specific activities, coordination and
      athletic performance. Studies which conducted on dancers are mainly focused on abdominal
      muscle strength / endurance, lower extremity strength and physical performance. In the
      literature, it was reported that 40-84% of professional dancers and 26-51% of professional
      dancers had musculoskeletal injuries, particularly lower extremity problems. It is very
      important to regain balance after returning to the dance after foot and ankle injuries.
      Considering the function of the trunk as a bridge between the lower and upper extremities, it
      is known that trunk muscles play a fundamental role in regaining balance. However, in the
      literature, there is no study showing the effects of trunk stabilizer muscles (abdominal,
      dorsal extensor, lateral flexor and diaphragm), trunk flexibility and dance-specific
      properties on balance in dancers. As a result of this study, it is aimed to show the effect
      of dance on balance and related parameters and to reveal the factors affecting the balance.

    <description>Limits of stability test evaluates dynamic balance of participants. Computerized balance system measured limits of stability for forward, backward, right and left side movements. It calculates the maximum distance a person can lean without losing balance. The unit of measure is centimeters. The higher value is indicated the better balance</description>
