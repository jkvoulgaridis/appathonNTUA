  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a low-fat or standard
      American diet (high in fat) in helping people with ulcerative colitis improve their symptoms
      and the signs of inflammation in blood tests and in bowel biopsies.
