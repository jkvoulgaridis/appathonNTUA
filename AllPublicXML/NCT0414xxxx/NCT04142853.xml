  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a cross-sectional observational study, followed by a pilot intervention.
      The aim of the study is to examine the underlying causes of walking-related performance
      fatigability, together with other related and influencing factors, to make up a clinical
      profile of patients with MS showing walking-related performance fatigability. In the second
      part of the study a pilot intervention will be executed to see if the investigators can
      improve the clinical status of the MS patients with walking-related performance fatigability.

    <description>This is a short questionnaire to cognitive and motor fatigue in people with MS. The FSMC is an assessment of MS-related cognitive and motor fatigue. A Likert-type 5-point scale (ranging from 'does not apply at all' to 'applies completely') produces a score between 1 and 5 for each scored question. Thus minimum value is 20 (no fatigue at all) and maximum value is 100 (severest grade of fatigue). Two subscales (mental and physical fatigue) can be made. Items included in the subscale mental are 1-4-7-8-11-13-15-17-18-20 and items included in the subscale physical are 2-3-5-6-9-10-12-14-16-19.</description>

    <description>short questionnaire to map out walking difficulties in daily living. The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a self-assessment scale which measures the impact of MS on walking. It consists of 12 questions concerning the limitations to walking due to MS during the past 2 weeks. Each item can be answered with 5 options, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 extreme limitation.
A total score can be generated and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale by subtracting the minimum score possible (12) from the patient's score, dividing by the maximum score possible minus the minimum possible (60-12 or 48), and multiplying the result by 100. Walking improvement on the MSWS-12 is indicated by negative change scores.</description>

    <description>This is a short self-report questionnaire used to assess the day-to-day life in the past two weeks. This questionnaire has a physical and psychological scale. The MSIS-29 is a 29-item self-report measure with 20 items associated with a physical scale and 9 items with a psychological scale. Items ask about the impact of MS on day-to-day life in the past two weeks. All items have 5 response options: 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5&quot;extremely&quot;. Each of the two scales are scored by summing the responses across items, then converting to a 0-100 scale where 100 indicates greater impact of disease on daily function (worse health).
The physical impact score is computed by summing items number 1-20 inclusive. This score can then be transformed to a score on a scale of 0 -100</description>
