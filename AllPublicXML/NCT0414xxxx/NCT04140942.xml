  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to conduct a feasibility effectiveness RCT of Virtual Interview Training (VIT) by
      comparing employment and recidivism outcomes of offenders (25 years and older) receiving
      vocational services as usual (SAU) plus VIT (SAU+VIT) with the outcomes of offenders
      receiving only services as usual (SAU-only).

      The plan calls for participants to include offenders who are at moderate to high risk for
      reoffending (with an emphasis on violent-crime reoffending) who are currently enrolled in a
      Vocational Village Prison Setting with the Michigan Department of Corrections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 600,000 ex-offenders re-enter the community from prison each year and 50% of them
      recidivate within 12 months of release. Employment significantly reduces the risk of
      recidivism for ex-offenders, and as such, is a critical target for intervention. However,
      evidence-based employment services are rarely delivered in prisons. Moreover, employment
      services that are available do not include evidence-based job interview training. Virtual
      Reality Job Interview Training (VR-JIT) is an evidence-based tool that was developed and
      evaluated with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. However, VR-JIT has a
      feature to practice discussing a prior conviction during a job interview that has not yet
      been evaluated. Given that an ex-offender's job interview outcome may depend on discussing
      their prior conviction, we are partnering with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC)
      to evaluate if delivering VR-JIT within their Vocational Village program can improve
      employment and reduce recidivism among offenders after their release from prison. Thus, there
      are two goals for this pilot study. We will evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of whether
      VR-JIT added to Vocational Village services-as-usual improves outcomes (interview skills,
      employment, recidivism) for offenders after their release from prison (at a 6-month follow-up
      visit). These preliminary data will support a proposal to a federal agency for a
      fully-powered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-JIT with prison
      settings.

    <measure>Employment as measured in Outcome Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow up after villagers are released; will occur through study completion, approximately 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Employment rate will be measured by participant self-report using a questionnaire. The questionnaire will include information about their job status (unemployed, employed); if they completed any job interviews (yes/no) and how many interviews they completed, if they received a job offer (yes/no), and information about jobs they may have had since their release date (employer name, job type, average hours worked, hourly wage, start date, end date). It will also include questions about their housing status (staying at a friend's, having own apartment, having own house/condo, homeless, or other); and if they thought the virtual interview training helped them prepare for an interview. The employment status will be validated with administrative data collected by MDOC.</description>

    <measure>Mock Interview Scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments occur pre-intervention and post-intervention and data will be assessed throughout study completion, approximately 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Videos of mock interviews taken pre-intervention and post-intervention will be rated using a developed scale by the UM study team. Performance will be rated using a 1-5 likert scale with 1 being &quot;Poor&quot;, 3 being &quot;Average&quot; and 5 being &quot;Excellent&quot;</description>

    <measure>Recidivism as measured in outcome questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow up after villagers are released; will occur through study completion, approximately 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Recidivism status will be collected via follow up survey. Questions include if they've been re-arrested (yes/no) and if they were convicted of a crime (yes/no). The recidivism self-report data will be validated by administrative data collected from MDOC.</description>
