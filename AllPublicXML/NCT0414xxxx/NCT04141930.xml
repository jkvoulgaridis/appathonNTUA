      This study will evaluate a home-based approach to influenza infection control, using
      prepositioned home-based influenza self-test kits, telemedicine services, and rapid delivery
      of Xofluza (Baloxavir marboxil) for administration within 48 hours of symptom onset.

      Households represent an important location for transmission of influenza. Rapid delivery of
      Xofluza may reduce household exposures to influenza among susceptible individuals.This study
      is a pilot study of a home-based approach to influenza infection control, utilizing self-test
      kits and rapid home delivery of an antiviral. Households with at least 3 individuals residing
      there at least 4 days a week, including at least 2 household members that are eligible to
      take antiviral, will be monitored throughout the influenza season for the onset of a cough.
      This study will be conducted in households in the Seattle, WA area for one influenza season,
      beginning November 1, 2019 and ending May 1, 2020. Household will self-monitor for onset of
      symptoms throughout the influenza season. When symptoms develop, the participant will
      self-test for influenza infection using a prepositioned home-testing kit. If negative, the
      ill participant will provide one self-collected nasal swab specimen. If positive, the ill
      participant will connect with a healthcare provider via the tele-health app on their
      smartphone to confirm the influenza diagnosis. Next, if eligible to receive Xofluza, the
      influenza-positive individual will receive a rapid home delivery of Xofluza within 6 hours of
      the positive test result. All influenza-positive participants will provide a self-collected
      nasal swab specimen at Study Day 0, Study Day 2-3, and Study Day 5-7. For all illness
      episodes, the ill individual will complete a questionnaire regarding symptom duration and
      severity, as well as behavioral changes due to illness.
