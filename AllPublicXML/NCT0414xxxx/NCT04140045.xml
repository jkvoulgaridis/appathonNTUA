  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in prolonged endurance events. Risk factors for
      exercise-associated AKI include: the exercise itself, heat, hypohydration, muscle breakdown
      and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Prior research from our laboratory
      showed the hypohydration during high-intensity running increased a biomarker of AKI (urine
      osmolality-corrected kidney injury molecule 1). Therefore, the current study will now
      investigate the effect of manipulating hydration status during cycling on biomarkers of AKI.
