  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DF1001-001 is a study of a new molecule that targets natural killer (NK) cells and T-cell
      activation signals to specific receptors on cancer cells. The study will occur in two phases.
      The first phase will be a dose escalation phase, enrolling patients with various types of
      solid tumors that express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The second phase
      will include a dose expansion using the best dose selected from the first phase of the study.
      Multiple cohorts will be opened with eligible patients having either selected solid tumors,
      or solid tumors expressing high levels of HER2. A combination therapy cohort of DF1001 and
      pembrolizumab will also be opened for enrollment.
