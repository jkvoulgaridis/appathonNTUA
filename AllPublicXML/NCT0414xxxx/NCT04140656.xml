  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging in all living things is defined as a normal physiological process that causes a
      decrease in realistic body function. According to the World Health Organization; It is
      classified as 65 years old and older and 85 years old and older (1). Characteristics of
      aging; decrease in reserve capacity of organ systems, decrease in homeostatic control,
      decrease in adaptability to environmental factors, decrease in stress response capacity (3).
      Stability is defined as postural stimulation against changes in the center of gravity during
      rest and activity. Postural answers that provide this harmony; vestibular, proprioceptive and
      visual data in the central nervous system. In older people, static balance can be maintained
      for a longer period of time, while dynamic balance may deteriorate more quickly.
      Aging-affected muscle strength, joint mobility, proprioceptive, vestibular and visual loss
      also make postural control difficult to achieve. Although the physiological mechanism
      underlying the risk of loss of equilibrium and falls is multifaceted, it is mostly caused by
      somatosensory sensitivity and decreased neuromuscular capacity (3-5). It has been determined
      that one third of the elderly individuals living in the society have fallen at least once a
      year and these rates have been stated to increase to 60% in nursing homes. Falls cause
      long-term disability, stay in nursing homes, in the absence of a serious injury as a result
      of falling, there is a fear of falling, which causes a limitation in activities of daily
      living. Due to the physiology of aging, it is stated that peripheral sensation decreases in
      older ages (12). Mold showed that bilateral somatosensorial disorder was present in
      approximately 26% of individuals aged 65-74, 36% of those aged 75-84, and 54% of those aged
      85 years (13). In the literature, it was reported that plantar sensory loss in the elderly
      affects balance, mobility and gait and is a risk factor for falls (14). Different senses can
      be sensed by sensing receptors during the exercise program to increase sensory perception.
      Aerobic and strengthening exercise, feedback, virtual reality have been used in the studies
      on balance and falling seen in the elderly in recent years. However, a program aimed at
      increasing plantar sensation and it has not been found in the literature. In this study,
      physiotherapy programs aimed at increasing plantar sensation in the elderly will be compared.

      The study is planned to be conducted between the years of 2019-January-2020 for elderly
      people over 70 years old who live in Küçük Çamlıca Fahrettin Kerim Gökay Nursing Home. The
      study was planned as a randomized controlled clinical trial; By simple randomization method,
      cases will be divided into two groups. There are 47 elderly people over 70 years old in the
      nursing home to be studied. The sample size was planned to be 16 for each group.Group 1
      (n:16), group 2 (n:17). 40 minutes / 3 days per week / 8 weeks long program will be applied
      to both groups. Four weeks after the first measurement, the second measurement was performed.
      Thus, pilot study was made. After the second measurement, rehabilitation program was started
      in both groups.After the 8-week program is finished, the third measurements will be made.
      After the third measurements, the fourth measurement will be done 4 weeks later for late
      results.The measurements are as follows.

      Primary results: electronic pedobarography device for static and dynamic base pressure
      changes. Biodex balance test for measuring fall risk and static stability. For secondary
      results; 30 second Chair stand test, Berg balance scale, Semmes weinstein monofilament test.
