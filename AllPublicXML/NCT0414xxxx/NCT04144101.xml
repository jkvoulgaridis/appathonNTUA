      This was a single medical center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, which
      conducted for eight weeks. In this study, 40 patients of RA were randomly assigned to two
      different treatment groups (etoricoxib and aceclofenac), and 20 patients were enrolled for
      each group. In addition to baseline data collection, objective assessment tools were used to
      evaluate for efficacy and safety. The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology
      20% improvement criteria (ACR20) , secondary endpoints were the ACR 50,70, disease activity
      score 28 (DAS 28), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria, the number
      of tender and swollen joints, physician's global assessment, patient's global assessment,
      pain scores, the short form health survey (SF-36) health Questionnaire and etc. In addition,
      all adverse reactions were recorded and all the results were analyzed in the intention to
      treat (ITT) manner.
