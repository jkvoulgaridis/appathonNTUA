  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias is a frequent malformation. The definition of hypospadias is a ventral tissues
      hypoplasia, with an abnormal position of the urethral meatus, a chordee of the penis and an
      open foreskin. It can be associate with other genital malformation; in that case it can be
      classified in the wider field of the disorder of sex development (DSD). There is a lot of
      surgical technics for those malformations.

      In the pediatric surgical department, in Lyon, three technics are the most used because of
      their reliability and their good outcomes in short and mid term.

      This is essential for investigator to have a long term evaluation, with a physical exam and
      paraclinical exams, after the puberty, to assess the outcomes after the changes especially at
      the puberty.

Stages of genital [G] and pubic hair [Ph] development in the male. G-1, Ph-1: pre-pubertal; G-2: the testis and scrotum enlarge, and the skin of the scrotum shows some reddening and change in the texture. Sparse growth of pigmented hair usually slightly curly, mainly at the base of the penis (Ph-2); G-3: Testis and scrotum enlarge further, the penis grows mainly in length but also in breadth. The hair is darker, coarser and curlier and spreads over the junction of the pubes (Ph-3); G-4: Scrotum, testis, and penis grow further with development of the glans, and further darkening of the scrotal skin. The hair spreads covering the pubes; G-5: adult stage with spreading of the hair to the medial surface of the thighs (Ph-5).</description>
