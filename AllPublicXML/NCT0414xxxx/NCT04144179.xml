    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the safety profile of the different quadrivalent recombinant influenza
           vaccine (RIV) formulations.

        -  To describe the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and seroneutralization (SN) antibody
           responses against hemagglutinin (HA) (H1, H3, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) antigens
           present in the control vaccine in all groups at all timepoints.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe antigenic coverage in each group by assessing the HAI and SN antibody
           responses against a panel of H3 antigens (not present in any of the vaccine
           formulations).

        -  To describe HAI and SN antibody responses in each group against each of the H3 antigens.

        -  To compare the HAI and SN antibody responses for the groups with different H3 antigens
           to the control group.
