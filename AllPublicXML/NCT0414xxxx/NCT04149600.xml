  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the molecular genetic causes of the variability in development of
      calcific aortic valve disease in bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valves and their associated
      aortic dilation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of expression signatures of aortic valve development and calcification in the macroscopically normal and abnormal portions of aortic valves excised during aortic valve replacement.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will take a portion of the aortic valve and/or aortic tissue that is routinely excised for aortic valve or aortic replacement for expression analyses and generation of fibroblast cell lines. In collaboration with the Department of Pathology, we have established methods to take sufficient &quot;normal&quot; and abnormal tissue while allowing formal routine pathological evaluation.
All tissue samples for expression analysis will be transported in iced RNALater and later frozen in a -80Â°C research freezer, prior to next generation sequencing. We may use tissue samples to develop cell lines for indefinite use.</description>
