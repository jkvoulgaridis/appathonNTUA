    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gilteritinib and to see how
      well it works in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in treating patients with
      FLT3-mutation positive acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that has
      come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Gilteritinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib may work
      better compared to azacitidine and venetoclax alone in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of azacitidine,
      venetoclax and gilteritinib in patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (Phase I) II. To determine the
      complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CR/CRi) rate of the
      regimen in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory fms-like tyrosine kinase 3
      (FLT3)-mutated AML or high-risk MDS. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess other efficacy endpoints (CR rate, minimal residual disease negativity by flow
      cytometry, relapse-free survival, overall survival).

      II. To assess proportion of patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT).

      III. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of baseline genomic alterations on response and survival of the
      combination regimen.

      II. To determine the impact of baseline FLT3 allelic ratio on response and survival.

      III. To evaluate clonal evolution from diagnosis to relapse using single-cell sequencing.

      OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of gilteritinib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on
      days 1-7, venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-21 of
      subsequent cycles, and gilteritinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment of azacytidine and
      venetoclax repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cycles of gilteritinib repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.

             had a hysterectomy or are postmenopausal without menses for 12 months. In addition,
             men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of
             childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control
             throughout the study period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study
