      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-comparative, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of APX001 for the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis caused by C.
      auris in patients aged 18 years and over with limited antifungal treatment options. The Study
      Drug Treatment Period will be up to a maximum of 42 days (inclusive of the loading dose
      [Study Day 1]). There will be a Follow up Period of 4 weeks (+4 days) after EOST. The total
      duration of participation in the study is up to approximately 10.5 weeks (inclusive of the
      Screening Period [168 hours prior to Baseline]).
