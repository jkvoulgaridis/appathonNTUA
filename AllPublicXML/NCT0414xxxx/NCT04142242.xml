      The primary objective of the study is:

      To demonstrate non-inferiority of immune responses following a single dose of MenACYW
      conjugate vaccine in the current study (MEQ00066) compared to the immune responses following
      a primary dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered ≥ 3 years earlier to participants
      who were ≥ 56 years of age in Study MET49 (NCT02842866), in terms of seroresponse rates 30
      days after vaccination (Group 2).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate non-inferiority of immune responses following a single dose of MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine in the current study (MEQ00066) compared to the immune responses
           following a primary dose of Menomune administered ≥ 3 years earlier to participants who
           were ≥ 56 years of age in Study MET49, in terms of seroresponse rates 30 days after
           vaccination (Group 1).

        -  To describe seroresponse rates with respect to serogroups A, C, W, and Y 6 (window, 5-7)
           days post-vaccination in a subset consisting of a planned total of 120 participants (60
           participants from Group 1 [Group 1a]; 60 participants from Group 2 [Group 2a]) who
           receive a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine after having received either Menomune
           or MenACYW conjugate vaccine ≥ 3 years previously.

      Study duration per participant in Group 1 and Group 2 will be approximately 30 days
      including: 1 day of screening and vaccination, a phone call and a safety-follow up/end of
      study visit at Day 8 and Day 30 after vaccine administration, respectively.

      Study duration per participant in Group 3 and 4 will be approximately 2 years and 30 days
      including: 1 day of screening, 1 day of vaccination 2 years later, a phone call and a
      safety-follow up/end of study visit at Day 8 and Day 30 after vaccine administration,
      respectively.

      Study duration per participant in Group 5 and 6 will be 1 day.

      Safety assessment includes solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited
      adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse event of special interest
      (AESI)s throughout the study &quot;active phase&quot; (i.e., period of time from revaccination with
      MenACYW conjugate vaccine to the end of the short-term [i.e., ~30 days] follow-up after the
      vaccination).

             female must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile.

          -  Participation in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment / study vaccination or planned

        Note: &quot;Active phase&quot; refers to the period of time from revaccination with MenACYW conjugate
        vaccine to the end of the short-term (i.e., ~30 days) follow-up after the vaccination.
        Accordingly, following the blood draw at Visit 1, participants in Group 3 and Group 4 will
        have a 2-year inactive phase prior to Visit 2. Prior to Visit 2, participants in Group 3
        and Group 4 will have inclusion and exclusion criteria reassessed and will continue with or
        be excluded from further participation in the trial as appropriate.

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the study vaccination or
             planned receipt of any vaccine during the active phase of the present study except for
             influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before or after study

          -  Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion
             (excluding participants in Group 5 and Group 6), contraindicating intramuscular (IM)

          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction.

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with study conduct or completion.

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4 F). A prospective
             participant should not be included in the study or receive study vaccination until the
             condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first
             blood draw.

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member
