  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In psychotic disorders, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are difficult to treat
      with antipsychotics, which are mostly effective for positive symptoms. However, it is
      important that negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are treated as well, as they both
      play a large part in the acute episode and long-term course of schizophrenia outcome.
      Previous studies have used D-serine as add-on treatment in patients with psy-chotic disorders
      and high-risk patients, with positive results. So far, no study has investigated the effects
      in a sample of recent-onset psychosis patients.

      Therefore, this study will include 30 patients (18-50 years old) with recent-onset psychosis.
      In addition to their regular treatment, patients will receive either D-serine (2 g/d) or
      placebo for 6 weeks. D-serine is an amino-acid naturally occurring in the brain which is
      prescription-free available as nutritional supplement.

      The primary outcome measure is total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS). Secondary measure-ments include PANSS subscales, neurocognitive tests, (f)MRI, and
      EEG
