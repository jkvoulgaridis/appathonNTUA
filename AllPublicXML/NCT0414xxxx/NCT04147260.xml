        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects according to the assessment of the Investigator,
             based on a complete medical history, physical examination (including dermatological
             skin type assessment), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate), 12-lead ECG, and
             clinical laboratory tests

          -  18 to 55 years old

          -  BMI 18 to 35 kg/m (incl.)

          -  Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III:

               -  I Always burns easily, never tans

               -  II Always burns easily, tans minimally

               -  III Burns moderately, tans gradually

          -  No ultraviolet exposure of the test areas 4 weeks prior to baseline photo testing

          -  Normal skin response during preliminary photo testing.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)1 must be ready and able to use highly
             effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate
             of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of contraception
             methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or ECG)
             deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by the Investigator.

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance.

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders or any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as
             clinically relevant by the Investigator.

          -  Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed within 10
             weeks prior to randomisation or planned within 2 months after screening.

          -  Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years
             prior to screening, except appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or
             in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix.

          -  Active skin disorders on the back where photosensitivity testing will be performed.

          -  Subjects who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug
             considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.

             complete the trial as scheduled (e.g. chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any other
             condition that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject an unreliable trial
             participant).

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial, or less than 30
             days (or 5 half-lives (whichever longer)) since ending another investigational drug
             trial.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial.

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients).

          -  History of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of
             antibacterials.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to sunlight or artificial source of intense light,
             especially UV light.

          -  Chronic or acute infections which are of relevance in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Positive result for HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C (Hep C) at screening.

          -  History of TB or positive finding in IGRA.

          -  Unwillingness/inability to refrain from intake of alcoholic beverages from 48 hours
             prior to the trial medication administration and until Day 7 post trial medication
             administration.

          -  Positive drug screening.

          -  Blood donation of more than 500 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial.

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within 4 days prior to
             administration of trial medication or contact sport during the entire trial and
             unwilling to avoid vigorous exercise for 7 days post dosing.

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site.

          -  Unwillingness to adhere to the rules of UV-light protection

          -  Received a live vaccination within 12 weeks prior to randomisation (visit 2), or any
             plan to receive a live vaccination during the conduct of this trial.

          -  Subjects with known prolongation of the QT interval, risk factors for QT prolongation
             or torsade de pointes.
