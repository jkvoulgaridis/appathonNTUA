  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a type of non-invasive
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on patients diagnosed with systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) who are experiencing depression.

      Targeting depression in patients with SLE may provide benefit to these patients, as there is
      a clear relationship between chronic pain and depression. The investigators propose that a
      tACS stimulation montage that was previously used in depression could be beneficial to
      patients with SLE, resulting in reduced depression symptoms, thus resulting in reduced
      chronic pain and cognitive difficulties.

      At the initial session, consent will be obtained and eligibility will be determined.

      Eligible participants will undergo a structural MRI as part of the screening process, then be
      randomized and have 5 consecutive daily, 40 minute stimulation sessions.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: sham stimulation,
      individualized alpha-tACS (usually 8-12 Hz), or individualized theta-tACS (individualized
      alpha frequency minus 4 Hz). Participation will include 1 to 11 visits.

      Neurophysiological measures will be taken before and after the stimulation sessions on the
      first and fifth days of the intervention, as well as the 2-week follow-up and 4-week
      follow-up visits. Psychiatric clinical assessments will be performed at baseline (Day 1 of
      stimulation), Day 5 of stimulation, and at both follow-up visits using the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Inventory of
      Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), and the Comparative Pain Scale Chart. All
      participants will also complete 2 blood draws and cheek swabs to assess for the presence of
      Bartonella spp. bacteria.

      Participants will also be asked to complete self-report surveys via REDCap at a 3-month time
      point measured from completion of the intervention.
