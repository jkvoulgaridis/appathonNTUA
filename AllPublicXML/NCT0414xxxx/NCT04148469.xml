    <textblock>
      The purpose of this estudy was to dertermine if the application of Transcutaneous Nerve
      Stimiulation (TENS) current have an hypoalgesic effect on pattientes suffering from
      miofascial neck pain, compared with a only dry needling treatment. Psicological varaibles
      were also mesured in order to determine how they change after each treatment.

    <textblock>
      All patients suffered from mechanical neck pain and were randomized into three groups of
      treatment. A doible blinded control was carryed out. The main outcome messures were Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS). The scondary outcome messures were Pressure Pain hreshold (PPT) and
      Active Range of Movement (ROM). Also psicologicla messures were taken, like Neck Dissability
      Index, Level of stress and ansiety, Fear Pain and Pain Avoidance Strategies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be reassed in four days.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a subjective evaluation. There are previous studies that demonstrate its reliability and its sensitivity, wich give validity to VAS messures. The messure is made using a two sides 10 centimeters scale. The patient´s face shows an increasing slope that allows the patient to mark his pain level. That mark has his equivalent number on the scale, so 0 is no pain and 10 is maximum pain. A differece of 2 points on the scale means the minimum clinically significant change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Active Cervical Range of Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient will be reassed in four days.</time_frame>
    <description>To messure the cervical range of movement, a CROM will be used. The CROM is a special goniometer that allows therapists to messure cervical movements. It conists on trhee pairs of inclinometers that allow reserchers to messure range of flexion-extension, lateral flexion and rotation. The CROM has a porved reliability, providing a inter-meter reliability from 0,7 to 0,9 and an intra-meter reliability from 0,8 to 0,87. The patient will be seated on a cheir, and he´ll perform cervical movements actively, just untill he starts to feel his pain. Each movement will be messure three times, and the average will be taken.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be reassed in four days.</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) is the minimun pressure needed to araise pain. To messure PPT, an digital algometer will be used. An algometer consists on a 1 square centimeter rubber piece inserted on a pressure gauge. Previous studies have shown the reliability of this method (ICC=0,91) and also inter meter (ICC from 0,82 to 0,97) and intra meter (ICC=0,78). The minimun detectable change on the cervical area goes from 0,44 Kg/cm2 to 1,11 Kg/cm2. We will apply the algometer over trapezius trigger point number 2, and the patient will tell the therapist when he start to feel hgis pain. We´ll do the messure 3 times and the average will be taken.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dry needling</intervention_name>
    <description>Dry needlin is a manual therapy technique used for miofascuial pain syndrom treatment. The patient will be supine, in a confortable position. The therapist localizes the trapezius trigger point number 2 and then performes the needling until 2 REL are obtenined. The patient will remain supine during 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a current used for pain treatment. The needle will be used as the negative pole and a adhesive patch 2 centimeters lateral will be the positive pole. The frecuency selected will have 2 Hz with pulses of 120 microseconds. The currente will be applied for 15 minutes.</description>
