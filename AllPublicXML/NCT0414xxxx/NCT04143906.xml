    <textblock>
      Development of an active second-line treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients
      previously pre-treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative
      settings. For each randomisation arm, 100 patients will be included. The trial was performed
      as a 2-stage phase II study according to the optimal design by Simon with overall response
      rate as the primary objective.

      Study Design:

      Arm A: Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 d1,8; Carboplatin AUC=6 d1 q 3 weeks; Arm B: Gemcitabine 1000
      mg/m2 d1,8; Carboplatin AUC=6 d1 q 3 weeks;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer;

          2. All patients were required to give written informed consent;

         10. Males;

         11. Second malignancy (except for cervix carcinoma in situ or skin carcinoma - no
