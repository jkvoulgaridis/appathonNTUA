  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn new things about how parents and others who
      care for babies think about sharing books with their baby and how they might respond to
      guidance from their doctors. The study involves participants filling out a survey with
      questions about a newborn baby and thoughts about the baby's development. The study should
      not take more than an hour and fifteen minutes during the delivery hospital stay and another
      20 minutes at the baby's one month well child visit by phone or emailed survey link.
      Participants may also be interviewed and asked some questions about these topics. The
      conversation will be audio recorded, and should last no more than 30 minutes. The survey
      should take no more than 15 minutes to complete. The participant and their child will be
      randomized, like flipping a coin, to either receive the study intervention book, Cluck and
      Moo, along with standard or care or solely standard of care at your time of hospital
      discharge. The greatest risks to this study would be feeling uncomfortable about answering
      some of the questions and potential risk of loss of confidentiality.

    <description>Newborns randomized to the usual care group will receive standard education about safe sleep practices, measuring temperatures and newborn feeding needs. This information will be accompanied by printed instructions that will be added to the family's discharge instructions. This reflects current practice in the Duke Hospital Newborn Nursery.</description>

    <description>In addition to usual care, families randomized to the intervention group will receive an early literacy intervention, delivered by a trained research assistant. To ensure intervention and delivery fidelity, the PI will meet with research assistants at bi-weekly intervals to review procedures and perform structured observations of intervention delivery.</description>

    <description>Similar to the standard Reach out and Read model, parents will be given a high-contrast board book, Cluck and Moo, and education about the importance of and how to engage with newborns in early shared reading behaviors. This will include instructive information for families about using books to stimulate newborns through pictures and spoken words.</description>
