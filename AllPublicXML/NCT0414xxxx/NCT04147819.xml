  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to learn about the safety of drug BAY2701439 and how well the
      drug works in patients with advanced cancer that has the protein HER2 (Human Epidermal growth
      factor Receptor 2) and cannot be cured by currently available treatment options. The study
      will include patients with HER2 expressing breast, gastric (stomach) or gastroesophageal
      (stomach and esophagus) cancer, as well as other cancers that have HER2. Researchers want to
      find the best dose of BAY2701439 for patients and look at the way the body absorbs,
      distributes and excretes the drug.

      The study drug is a type of therapy called a 'targeted alpha therapy' which uses an antibody
      to deliver a radioactive particle to cancer cells. BAY2701439 contains thorium-227 which
      emits radiation (a lot of energy that moves from one place to another with damaging effects).
      The thorium-227 in the drug is attached to an 'antibody' (large protein) that specifically
      binds to HER2 on the cancer cells and will emit its radiation in the form of alpha particles.
      The alpha particles are expected to damage the tumor cells and cause them to die, but spare
      surrounding tissue as alpha particles travel only very short distances in the body. This is
      the first study in humans for drug BAY2701439. Patients participating in this study will
      receive the drug by injection every 6 weeks a maximum 6 times. Observation after treatment
      last up to 3 years.
