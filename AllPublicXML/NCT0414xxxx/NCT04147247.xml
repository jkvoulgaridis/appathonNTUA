  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/optimal
      biological dose (OBD) of BI 905681 given as an intravenous infusion and to determine the
      recommended dose and dosing schedule for further trials in the development of BI 905681. The
      MTD will be defined based on the frequency of patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) during the MTD/DLT evaluation period, which is defined as the first cycle of
      treatment. Separate MTDs will be determined for Schedule A and Schedule B.

      The secondary objective of the trial is to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BI
      905681.
