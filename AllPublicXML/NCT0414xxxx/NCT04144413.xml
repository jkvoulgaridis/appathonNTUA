    <measure>Efficacy Secondary Outcome Measures in Entire study: SANDE symptoms score at each visit in Entire study</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months (Periods 1 + 2)</time_frame>
    <description>SANDE is Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye. The self-administered Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire must be completed by the patient him/herself.
SANDE questionnaire will be used to score both severity and frequency of dry eye symptoms. This 2-item frequency- and severity-based visual analogue scales (0-100mm ranging respectively from&quot; rarely&quot; to &quot;all the time&quot;, and from &quot;very mild&quot; to &quot;very severe&quot;) is short and quick, and provides reliable measure for Dry Eye Disease symptoms assessment. Symptoms will be evaluated for both eyes together.
A negative change from baseline (Period 1) or from Month 12 (Period 2) will indicate an improvement in dry eye disease symptoms.</description>

    <description>TBUT is Tear Breakup Time. Tear break-up time (TBUT) will be measured by determining the time to tear break-up. The examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting the time it takes to form lacunae (clear spaces in the tear film) from the time that the eye is opened after the last blink.
A higher value means longer time to tear break-up which is better. A positive change from baseline (Period 1) or from Month 12 (Period 2) will indicate improvement.</description>

          5. DED patients with severe keratitis defined as the following:

               -  CFS score of 3, 4 or 5 on the modified Oxford scale in at least one eye at
                  Baseline Visits, AND

               -  Schirmer test without anaesthesia scored &lt;10 mm/5min in the same eye at Baseline
                  Visit, AND

               -  At least two moderate to very severe symptoms of dry eye disease with a score ≥2

                  burning/stinging, foreign body sensation, eye dryness, eye pain and blurred/poor
                  vision at Baseline Visit.

          6. Patient must be willing and able to undergo and return for scheduled study-related
             examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             interpretation of study results or judged by the investigator to be incompatible with
             the study (e.g., diabetes with glycemia out of range, thyroid malfunction,
             uncontrolled autoimmune disease, current systemic infections, ocular infection…).

          8. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications

         11. Anticipated change during course of the study in the dose of systemic medications that
             could affect a dry eye condition [mainly, estrogen-progesterone or other estrogen
             derivatives (only allowed for post-menopausal women), pilocarpine, isotretinoine,
             tetracycline, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics, antimuscarinics,
             beta-blocking agents, phenothiazines, omega-3, systemic corticosteroids]. These
             treatments are allowed during the study provided they remain stable throughout the
             course of the study.

         12. Use of topical ciclosporin in the past 3 months prior to Baseline visit.

         13. Any change in systemic immunosuppressant drugs within 30 days before the Baseline
             Visit or anticipated change during the course of the study.

         14. Pregnancy or lactation at the Baseline Visit.

         15. Women of childbearing potential not using a medically acceptable, highly effective
             method of birth control (such as hormonal implants, injectable or oral contraceptives
             together with condoms, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomised
             partner) from the Baseline Visit throughout the conduct of the study treatment periods
             and up to 2 weeks after the study end. Post-menopausal women (two years without
             menstruation) do not need to use any method of birth control.

         16. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational substance within the past 30
             days prior to Baseline Visit.

         17. Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present study.
