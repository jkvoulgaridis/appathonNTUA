    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the optimal method to recognize, risk stratify, and provide
      follow-up care for individuals at risk of hereditary cancer. The study team will conduct a
      Hybrid Type II comparative effectiveness-implementation trial, with a mixed methods component
      and process/formative evaluations for stakeholder engagement. The study team will evaluate
      three methods for identifying and risk-stratifying individuals at risk of hereditary cancer
      and providing post-risk stratification longitudinal care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes a randomized, Hybrid Type II comparative effectiveness-implementation
      trial, with a mixed methods component and process/formative evaluations for stakeholder
      engagement. The study team will evaluate three methods for identifying and risk-stratifying
      individuals at risk of hereditary cancer and providing post-risk stratification longitudinal
      care.

      Hypothesis: The study hypothesis is that Comparator 3 will identify more people at high risk
      of hereditary cancers and result in more screening behaviors, greater resource use, increased
      distress, higher perceived risk of cancer and higher satisfaction.

      Long term objective: At study end, the study will show: 1) each comparator's strengths and
      weaknesses, 2) patient preferences, clinical outcomes, and compliance with each step from
      history collection to screening test completion, 3) the resources needed for each strategy,
      and 4) the contextual factors that impact their sustainability, dissemination and
      implementation. Study findings have high potential for generalizability because: 1) The
      multidisciplinary stakeholder team will help to minimize barriers to dissemination and
      implementation of the investigator's findings in other research settings; 2) Study results
      are independent of study setting; 3) The tested methods of family history assessment can
      occur remotely via paper or electronic interfaces; 4) The care coordination method has
      successful precedent in other disciplines and can be delivered remotely; 5) A process and
      formative evaluation with a diverse stakeholder team will inform sustainability,
      dissemination, and implementation, and result in an implementation guide; 6) The results will
      be relevant for both family history-based and direct-genetic testing strategies for
      population screening for hereditary cancer; 7) The results will inform population screening
      for any disease with hereditary risk.

    <description>Participants will have their cancer risk assessed via usual care. Usual Care is defined as provider capture of family history during a clinical encounter and its entry into the electronic health record (EHR). Participants will take the a patient reported outcomes (PRO) survey once to assess participants experience, perspectives and thoughts on cancer, cancer risk, and cancer risk assessments.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Comparator 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will have their cancer risk assessed using a short, standardized web-based questionnaire that will populate validated cancer risk models (such as Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool/Gail model 2, PREMM and/or MMRpro) which will take 5-10 minutes to complete. Following the cancer risk assessment, participants will be asked to take a PRO survey. PRO surveys will also be administered at the time of the cancer risk assessment and then 6 and 12 months following.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Comparator 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will have their cancer risk assessed using a more detailed, full version of the family history survey than the one comparator 2 participants take. This version is a full pedigree assessment, which entails family health history for all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree relatives. Time needed for completion is 15-25 minutes, depending on family size and cancer risk. Participants will also be asked to take the PRO survey following the full cancer risk assessment and also at 6 and 12 months.</description>
