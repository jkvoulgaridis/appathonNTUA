  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of stretching on range of motion is believed to rely upon an increased tolerance
      to stretch. This suggests, that pain modulation has significance in regards to the effect of
      stretching.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that there may be differences in the way men and women perceive a painful stimulus,
      this suggests that there may be potential gender differences in the tolerance to stretch
      following stretching.
