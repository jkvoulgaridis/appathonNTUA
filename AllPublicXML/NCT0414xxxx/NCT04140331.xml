  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short term morbidity after elective cardiac surgery remains significant. Standard predictive
      models, considering simple patient demographics and clinical parameters, show limited
      efficiency in individual operative risk assessment. There is growing evidence about daily
      physical activity as a relevant indicator of preoperative &quot;frailty&quot;. Although cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing remains a gold standard, we are looking for more simple tools in order to
      identify patients with poor physical condition. Accelerometry may be an objective and
      reproductible method to measure physical activity at patient's home.

      The aim of this study is to compare accelerometer-assessed preoperative physical activity
      between two groups of patients with different postoperative length of stay following elective
      cardiac surgery. In the future, accelerometry could be used to identify patients that may
      benefit from prehabilitation programs including exercise therapy before elective cardiac
      surgery.
