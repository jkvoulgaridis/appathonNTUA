    <textblock>
      The changes and limitations that occur in the aging process effect people's adaptation toold
      age. The quality of life of elderly individuals who have problems in adaptation to aging is
      negatively affected. This study aimed to assess the effect of effects of Progressive Muscle
      Relaxation on the adaptation levels and quality of life of the elderly living in nursing
      homes.

    <textblock>
      Today, changes and developments in technology and lifestyles have lengthened average life
      span and increased the elderly population. The physical and cognitive changes, health
      problems, new roles such asbeing retired or widowed and economic losses come one after
      anotherfor the elderly, and this turns the old age into a period full of difficul-ties. The
      difficulties experienced in this period introduce problems re-lated to the adaptation of the
      elderly to old age. The union of the problems arising due to old age decreases the
      self-respect and life satisfaction of the elderly individual, and consequently, the quality
      of life can be negatively affected.

      Adaptation is defined as the harmony built by an individual between his own needs and the
      expectations of the people around.It is important for people to adapt to ever-changing life
      events sothat they can lead happy lives.The first condition of a healthy and problem-free old
      age is to accept and adapt to old age.Therefore, the purposes of nursing care cover ensuring
      an individual's adaptation toold age and its changes, which is the last development phase of
      life.

      Nurses can positively change people's adaptation to old age by applying simple andeconomic
      non-pharmacological methods that are easy to apply. The non-pharmacological methods used in
      this study for older people'sw included progressive muscle relaxation exercise. It is stated
      in the literature that progressive relaxation exercise increases the quality of life and
      satisfaction of elderly individuals. However, there was no study thatassessed the effect of
      progressive muscle relaxation exercise on adaptation to old age.

      Objective: Evaluate the effects of progressive muscle relaxation on the adaptation levels
      older people's and quality of life of the elderly living in nursing homes.

      Methodology: This is randomized clinical test. The sample was made up of 45 older people
      living in nursing homes (24 in control group and 21 in the experimental group). The
      progressive muscle relaxation technique combined with music was employed. In order to collect
      the data, we adopted the interview with form filling technique, using the introductory
      information form, Assessment Scale of Adaptation Difficulty for the Elderly (ASADE) and
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)&quot;. Blood pressure and heart rate of experimental group were
      measured before and after the progressive muscle relaxation intervention.

    <description>The health-related quality of life of elderly individuals was evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). he lowest and highest scores that can be obtained from each sub-dimension of the scale are 0 and 100, respectively. 0 indicates the best health status while 100 indicates the worst health status.</description>

    <description>The difficulties in adaptation to old age of elderly individuals were evaluated using the Assessment Scale of Adaptation Difficulty for the Elderly (ASADE). The scores obtained from the items of the scale (24 ıtems) are collected and divided by the number of questions to obtain the total score of the scale. The level of adaptation to old age decreases as the score obtained from the scale by an individual increases. ASADE total score min. 0- max. 3.</description>

Each PMR exercise combined with music was conducted under the guidance of the researcher. Before and after each session of the Progressive Muscle Relaxation They will be measured heart rate and blood pressure.</description>

    <description>The CD on relaxation exercises developed by the Turkish Psy-chological Associationwas used.In the second of CD 30-min section; relaxation exercises are explained to the accompaniment ofrunning water sounds and verbal instructions. Progressive relaxation technique includes stretching and relaxing the bigmuscle groups (hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen,hip, feet andfingers) in the human body on purpose. When steps ofProgressive Relaxation Exercises are analyzed, it is observed thatlearning how to take correct and deep breaths is the most impor-tant step towards learning relaxation. In addition, taking correct breaths is used as a part of the exercise among all relaxation exercises.Steps of Progressive Relaxation Exercise:- breathing exercises- lower extremity exercises- upper extremity exercises- exercise of respiratory muscles. Elderly individuals will receive PMR exercise twice a week under the guidance of an investigator for eight weeks.</description>
