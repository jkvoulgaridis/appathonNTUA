  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 2 arm study in
      approximately 40 subjects aged 4 to 50 years, inclusive, who are allergic to cow's milk. The
      primary objective is to assess whether dupilumab as an adjunct to milk oral immunotherapy
      (OIT) compared to placebo improves the safety of milk OIT and rates of desensitization,
      defined as an increase in the proportion of subjects who pass a double-blind
      placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) to at least 2040 mg cumulative milk protein at
      week 18.

             anaphylactic shock as defined as 3 or more episodes of anaphylaxis within the past

             symptoms of dysphagia (e.g., difficulty swallowing, food &quot;getting stuck&quot;), or
             recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms of undiagnosed etiology

          -  History of cardiovascular disease, including uncontrolled or inadequately controlled
             hypertension

          -  History of a mast cell disorder

          -  Established diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disorder

          -  Severe asthma or mild or moderate asthma if uncontrolled or difficult to control

          -  Current participation or within the last 4 months in any other interventional study
