  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the transcriptomic signal of the
      endometrium before, during, and after the window of receptivity.

    <textblock>
      Phase 1 will aim to define a normal endometrial transcriptomic signature in healthy controls
      without infertility. Phase 2 will elucidate endometrial transcriptomic expression in patients
      with diagnoses of infertility unrelated to endometrial factor. Findings from this phase will
      be compared to the results of phase 1.

        Phase 1:

        Healthy volunteers without a history of infertility will be recruited for the first phase
        to undergo an endometrial biopsy on a randomized cycle day surrounding the window of
        implantation

        Phase 2:

        Healthy volunteers with a history of infertility but without concern for endometrial
        dysfunction will be recruited for the second phase to undergo an endometrial biopsy during
        a preparatory IVF cycle.
