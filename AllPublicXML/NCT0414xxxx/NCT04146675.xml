  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are frequent and often serious events in the elderly. The consequences of falls are
      often severe: traumatic (fractures, hematomas, ..) and psychological. Falls are among the top
      ten causes of death in this population and, for people older than 70, falls are the leading
      cause of accidental death.

      The Damart company has developed a fabric containing ceramic fibers. Clothes containing such
      fibers have been found to improve balance.

      This study aims to measure the effect of a t-shirt with a ceramic membrane (&quot;ceramic&quot;
      t-shirt) on the balance and walking compared to the effect of a &quot;placebo&quot; t-shirt (same
      weight, appearance and texture).

      The hypothesis is that wearing the ceramic tee-shirt significantly improves balance and
      walking, suggesting that it can also reduce falls - the main consequence of the balance and
      walking disorder.

    <description>Variation of the Tinetti score between the group T-shirt placebo (Δ Tinetti T-shirt placebo vs Tinetti clothing patients) and the ceramic tee-shirt group (Δ Tinetti ceramic t-shirt vs Tinetti clothing patients).
Scoring of the Tinetti Assessment Tool is done on a three point ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2.
A score of 0 represents the most impairment, while a score of 2 represents independence. The individual scores are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait assessment score, and overall balance assessment score, ad a combined gait and balance score.</description>
