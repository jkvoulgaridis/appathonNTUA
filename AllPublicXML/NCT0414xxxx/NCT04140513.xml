  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well digital PET scan works in predicting outcomes in patients with
      oropharyngeal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes
      (locally advanced). The development of digital detectors for PET is a technological
      improvement in medical imaging that could potentially impact many areas of clinical oncology,
      including staging, radiation planning accuracy, and the assessment of treatment response.
      Digital technology may improve PET imaging performance by providing better timing, energy and
      spatial resolution, higher count rate capabilities and linearity, increased contrast, and
      reduced noise. Utilizing digital PET scan, may work better in predicting outcomes and
      treatment response in patients with oropharyngeal cancer compared to conventional PET.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the utility of early (i.e. during treatment) digital positron emission
      tomography (dPET) as a diagnostic tool to predict local control 6 months after definitive
      chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.
      during treatment) and CR on PET after definitive chemoradiation.

      II. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.
      during) treatment and 2 year local control after definitive chemoradiation.

      III. To assess the ability of dynamic dPET compared to conventional PET or
      conventional-equivalent dPET reconstruction to identify tumor volumes with greater
      sensitivity at the time of before (dPET1), during (dPET2, dPET3) and after (dPET4, dPET5)
      chemoradiation.

      IV. To generate preliminary data for future methodology or clinical trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 via injection and undergo dPET over 20 minutes after
      standard of care computed tomography (CT) imaging (week -2), after receiving 20-26 Gy and
      40-46 Gy of radiation (weeks 3 and 5), and 3 months after completion of treatment. Patients
      with concern for residual disease may receive an additional dPET 6 months after treatment.

Here we will examine specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values for each promising parameter to allow for preliminary data to be generated to anticipate which parameters may warrant future study.</description>
