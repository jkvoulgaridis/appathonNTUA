      • Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a highly effective and safe method for
      spinal cord and cervical root decompression. Vocal cord paralysis secondary to recurrent
      laryngeal nerve injury is a common complication after ACDF. The incidence reported as high as
      22%. The standard technique for vocal cord evaluation and the most commonly used tool is
      direct laryngoscopy. Laryngoscopy causes patients annoyance and could potentially contribute
      to poor patient compliance. Ultrasonography is a non-invasive technique that is used as an
      alternative tool.

      1. Design: A prospective cohort study.

        2. Sample size: Assuming that the target population is 240 and positive predictive value of
           transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography is 89.4%. So, the sample size is 91 cases using
           OPEN Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health (OPENEPI) with confidence
           interval 95% and power of test is 80%.

      All patients underwent transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography examination by both anterior
      and lateral approach of the Vocal Cords (VCs) before the surgery, immediately after
      extubation, 2 h, 12h, 24 and 48hour postoperatively by an anesthesiologist with an experience
      of at least three years in ultrasonography scan.
