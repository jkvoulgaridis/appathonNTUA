  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a national epidemic that disproportionately burdens low income and
      ethnic minority populations. By preschool, nearly one-third of low income children are
      already overweight or obese, setting the stage for adverse health outcomes over their life
      course. Evidence is mounting that individual-focused, single-component interventions fail to
      produce long-term population-level changes in obesity-related outcomes. Evidence increasingly
      supports creating entire environments (e.g., schools) in which the healthy choice is the
      default option.

      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a multilevel (organization, teacher, parent, child) intervention to support
      healthy eating and physical activity in preschools. The study is being conducted in
      partnership with Child Care Resource Center (CCRC), a non-profit organization dedicated to
      ensuring that all children receive high quality preschool experiences. The investigators will
      randomly assign 60 preschool sites (stratified by size), located in underserved areas of Los
      Angeles, to the intervention or a usual practice control conditions.

      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on child BMI z-scores
      (primary outcome) and parent-reported child nutrition and physical activity (secondary
      outcomes). The investigators will systematically examine the implementation process to
      understand factors that may facilitate or hinder intervention uptake and success. The
      findings from this work will be critical for informing future dissemination efforts.

    <textblock>
      This study involves a 2-group design with stratified cluster randomization at the level of
      the preschool. The investigators will recruit 60 preschools from LA County's most vulnerable
      communities, stratified by size (large, small). The investigators will randomly select pairs
      of schools from each stratum and randomly assign one member of each pair to the intervention
      or control conditions. Given the 10-month instructional year (Sept. 1-June 30), preschools
      will be recruited in three cohorts over three instructional years (~20 schools per cohort).
      To control for time trends in outcomes, the randomization protocol will be implemented
      independently within each cohort. Baseline data collection, conducted in the first six weeks
      of the school year, will include surveys (site directors, teachers, parents), anthropometric
      measures (children), preschool policy reviews and direct observation in preschools including
      child-level eating behavior and physical activity.

      The multilevel intervention will be initiated immediately following baseline data collection
      and will consist of 1) establishment of organizational policies to support healthy nutrition
      and physical activity, 2) integration of nutrition and physical activity content into
      curricula 3) supports for teachers and staff to model healthy behavior, and 4) engagement of
      parents as partners in implementing healthy policies in preschool and at home. Implementation
      measures will be collected throughout the project period. Follow-up data collection, in the
      last four-six weeks of the school year, will mirror baseline data collection.

      Study Hypotheses:

        1. Children at intervention schools will gain less weight relative to height gains compared
           to children at control schools, resulting in lower mean BMI z-scores at follow-up
           (effectiveness). Outcomes will be assessed in the overall sample and among the subset of
           children who are overweight or obese at baseline.

        2. Intervention preschools will have greater implementation of healthy nutrition and
           physical activity policies and practices at follow-up compared to control preschools.

      The primary effectiveness outcome will be child age-and sex-adjusted BMI z-score. The
      investigators will obtain baseline data on 1,630 children, 815 per condition, 60 preschool
      site directors and approximately 135 teachers. Estimating 80% child retention at follow-up,
      the investigators anticipate having follow-up data on 1,304 children, 652 per study arm. Data
      will also be collected from the parents of participating children at baseline and follow-up.
