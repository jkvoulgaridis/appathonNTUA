  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The Y balance test is a dynamic test that requires strength, flexibility, and
      proprioception. It is a measure of dynamic balance that provides a significant challenge to
      athletes and physically active individuals. The test can be used to assess physical
      performance, but can also be used to screen deficits in dynamic postural control due to
      musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. chronic ankle instability), to identify athletes at greater
      risk for lower extremity injury, as well as during the rehabilitation of orthopedic injuries
      in healthy active adults

      Objective: To know the effect of 4 sessions of treatment by interferential therapy (IFT)
      15-20 minutes, and SWD 15 min on the balance and dynamic postural component using Y balance
      test

      Methods: Subjects will be randomized into IFT and laser group (n=20 each). After the first
      session, the balance component will be measured pre-post-intervention.

      Outcome assessment: Y Balance tests score.

      Objective: To know the effect of 4 sessions of treatment by interferential therapy, and SWD
      on the balance and dynamic postural component using Y balance test

      Methods:

      Study design: Random sampling through lottery methods Blinding: Participants were not aware
      of the group they were in Allocation concealment: Not done Inclusion criteria: Physical
      assessment of the knee joint participants complains of pain, osteoarthritis, Patellofemoral
      knee pain syndrome, pain due to altered biomechanics of knee joints (structural and
      functional) Exclusion criteria: History of previous surgeries, participants on steroids,
      Vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, open wounds, recurrent ACL repair, Affliction due to
      metastasis or post-cancer patients

      Treatment specifications:

      Duration of intervention: Treatment will continue for 4 sessions/week, with each session
      lasting 15-20 minutes.

      Intervention:

      Experimental group-1: Interferential therapy will be given to the patients with knee pain for
      4 sessions for 15-20 minutes and the examination of the balance will be done with Y balance
      tests Pre-Post. 4 electrodes methods placed diagonally to each other creating a beat
      frequency at the center. Intensity to the percieved tolerable limits. The 'medium frequency'
      currents (medium frequency in electromedical terms is usually considered to be 1KHz-100KHz).
      These medium frequency currents, passed through the tissues simultaneously, where they are
      set up so that their paths cross &amp; they literally interfere with each other. This interaction
      gives rise to an interference current (or beat frequency) which has the characteristics of
      low-frequency stimulation

      Experimental group-2: SWD will be given to the patients with knee pain for 4 sessions for
      10-15 minutes with Continuous Mode and intensity: comfortable warmth, timing 15 mins and
      examination of the balance will be done with Y balance tests Pre-Post.

    <description>Interferential therapy(IFT) utilises two of these medium frequency currents, passed through the tissues simultaneously, where they are set up so that their paths cross &amp; they literally interfere with each other - hence another term that has been used in the past but appears to be out of favour at the moment - Interference Current Therapy. This interaction gives rise to an interference current (or beat frequency) which has the characteristics of low-frequency stimulation.</description>
