  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the use of metformin in the treatment of Fragile
      X syndrome (FXS) patients. Metformin is an FDA approved compound with an established safety
      profile and minimal side effects that specifically targets and normalizes multiple aspects of
      the pathophysiology in FXS. This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-arm
      parallel group design study of the drug metformin and placebo in FXS subjects with a primary
      outcome measure of safety/tolerability and secondary outcome measures on cognition,
      attention, anxiety, sleep, and physiologic and biochemical biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group design study
      of treatment with metformin on the primary outcome of safety/tolerance with secondary outcome
      measurements of the effects on cognition (encompassing social and repetitive behavior),
      attention, anxiety, and physiological and biochemical biomarkers of patients with FXS. FXS
      represents a well-defined population of ASD in which to test a specific targeted treatment
      looking at a well-defined set of cognitive and bioassay measures.

      Trial length is designed to have a chance at seeing if the medication can improve cognitive
      outcome measures. The study duration includes the screening period and a 24-week single-blind
      drug/placebo phase.

          -  Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality
