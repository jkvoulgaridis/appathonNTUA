  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clarithromycin-containing triple therapy is still the primary therapy approved by the Korean
      government. However, studies of antibiotic resistance has shown that regional resistance
      pattern to antibiotics such as clarithromycin is increasing. Recent studies show that
      examining genotype resistance is effective in eradication. Currently dual priming
      oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction (DPO-PCR) is used to measure clarithromycin
      resistance. There has been no study of comparing the duration of eradication regimens
      according to DPO-PCR results. The aim of this study is to compare the eradication rate of 7-
      day triple therapy with 14-day triple therapy in clarithromycin susceptible strains from
      DPO-PCR. The investigators also aimed to compare the eradication rates of 7-day bismuth
      quadruple therapy with 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy from clarithromycin resistant strains
      from DPO-PCR.

      This is a multi-center study perform at three tertiary university hospitals. Patients with H.
      pylori infection will be treated according to their DPO-PCR results. Patients who are
      susceptible to clarithromycin will be randomized to receive either triple therapy for 7-days
      or 14-days. Patients who are resistant to clarithromycin will be randomized to receive either
      bismuth quadruple therpay for 7-days or 14-days. The eradication rates of each regimens and
      the adverse events of each regimen will be investigated.
