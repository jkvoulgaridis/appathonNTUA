      Continuation Protocol for ZEN003694 in Patients Experiencing Clinical Benefit While Enrolled
      in a ZEN003694 Protocol
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-randomized, single-arm continuation protocol study using
      ZEN003694. Patients who have completed participation in their original (&quot;parent&quot;) ZEN003694
      protocol and have clinical benefit as determined by the investigator may continue to receive
      treatment with ZEN003694 in the continuation protocol. The patient must have been enrolled in
      a Zenith Epigenetics sponsored ZEN003694 therapeutic study to be eligible for participation
      in this continuation protocol.

             the continuation protocol

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          4. Acceptable ZEN003694 tolerability, in the judgment of the investigator

          5. Initiation of dosing in this continuation trial to occur within two weeks (14 days) of
             completing dosing in the parent trial, unless more time is approved by the sponsor in
             writing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent participation in another clinical investigational treatment trial

             malignancy under study

          3. Discontinued ZEN003694 or withdrew consent to participate in original Zenith
             Epigenetics-sponsored ZEN003694 study

          4. Any other reason that in the opinion of the Investigator would prevent the patient
             from completing participation or following the study schedule
