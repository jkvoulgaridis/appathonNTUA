  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, single-center, open label, randomized, complete cross-over trial
      comparing safety and efficacy of Fiasp® versus NovoRapid® when used in the Medtronic MiniMed
      640G system in pediatric subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

      This study is designed to compare Fiasp® to NovoRapid® in children with T1DM wearing MiniMed
      640G system equipped with SmartGuardTM technology and accompanied with EnliteTM Sensor and
      GuardianTM 2 Link transmitter in terms of glycemic control with a focus on post-prandial
      ½-hour and 1-hour plasma glucose levels. The investigator's hypothesis is that post prandial
      glucoses will be lower and time in range will be greater during the Fiasp® treatment period.

      Half, randomized subjects will have a 4 weeks screening period using NovoRapid® and then 4
      weeks treatment period with Fiasp® whereas the rest of the participants will start the trial
      period with 4 weeks using Fiasp® followed by 4 weeks in NovoRapid®.
