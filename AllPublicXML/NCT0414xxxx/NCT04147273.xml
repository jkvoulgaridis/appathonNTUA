  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-monitoring of blood glucose using capillary glucose testing has a number of shortcomings
      compared to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We aimed to compare these two methods and
      used blood glucose measurements in venous blood as a reference. Despite considerable
      inter-individual variability of postprandial glycemic responses, CGM evaluated postprandial
      glycemic excursions which had comparable results compared to standard blood glucose
      measurements under real-life conditions.

      Self-monitoring of blood glucose using capillary glucose testing (C) has a number of
      shortcomings compared to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We aimed to compare these two
      methods and used blood glucose measurements in venous blood (IV) as a reference. Postprandial
      blood glucose levels were measured after 50 g oral glucose load and after the consumption of
      a portion of different foods containing 50 g of carbohydrates. We also evaluated the
      associations between postprandial glucose responses and the clinical characteristics of the
      participants at the beginning of the study. Incremental area under the curve (AUCi) of
      postprandial blood glucose was calculated for 1 h (AUCi 0-60) and 2 h (AUCi 0-120). Despite
      considerable inter-individual variability of postprandial glycemic responses, CGM evaluated
      postprandial glycemic excursions which had comparable results compared to standard blood
      glucose measurements under real-life conditions.

    <description>Two products were studied: white bread (Butter Toast®, Golden Toast, Wittenberg, Germany) and whole grain bread (1688 Mehrkorn®, Harry-Brot, Schenefeld, Germany). One portion (containing 50 g digestible carbohydrates) was eaten immediately before the beginning of the test in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 10 h. Before testing, participants ate as usual on the previous day without a standard meal and refrained from consuming alcohol and exercising for 72 h. A 200-ml glucose drink (Accu-Chek Dextrose O.G.-T. Saft®, Roche Diabetes Care, Mannheim, Germany), containing also 50 g of carbohydrates, was used as the reference product.</description>

    <description>One day prior to the study beginning, participants were equipped with a CGM system (FreeStyle Libre®, Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA). This CGM system provides glucose recordings every 15 min over a period of 14 days. The glucose data were downloaded manually by a scan with a handheld device.
On the second day of the study, participants consumed portions of these three test products containing 50 g of available carbohydrate on 3 separate days without a washout period. The products were tested in random order at the same time of the morning after a 10 h overnight fast. Venous blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 min postprandial by inserting an intravenous cannula into a forearm vein. Capillary blood samples were obtained through finger pricking. Blood glucose levels in these samples were measured with a high quality SMBG system (ContourXT/Contour next, Ascensia Diabetes Care, Leverkusen, Deutschland, Germany).</description>
