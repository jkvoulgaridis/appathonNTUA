  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital anomalies are a major public health problem. They affect 2-3% of births, around
      20,000 new cases per year in France, of which 15% are cared for in Ile de France. These
      congenital anomalies are a major cause of morbidity, infant mortality and disability. They
      are also a major cause of death during the infant period (22% of deaths during the first year
      of life: source CépiDC Inserm 2010). The detection, accurate diagnosis and accurate
      prognosis, particularly functional, of these congenital anomalies are still difficult in the
      current monitoring of pregnancy, which is based primarily on ultrasound. The use and
      development of modern imaging techniques is now essential to enable doctors to better see and
      better examine the fetus. Alongside ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a
      technique that has undergone significant development in recent years. MRI must allow the
      effective anatomical and functional evaluation of the main fetal organs and could in
      particular be interesting in several situations in which it has not yet been sufficiently
      evaluated and is not yet performed in clinical routine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inclusion will take place at the earliest after the completion of the standard
      morphological ultrasound of the 2nd trimester (carried out at 20-24WG) and at the latest at
      36WG, within the framework of one of the 4 clinical subgroups of patients envisaged.

      The standardized anatomic and functional MRI examination will in all cases last less than 45
      minutes and will be based on sequences already used in clinical practice.

      Clinical, biological, and ultrasound data will be collected prospectively and used for the
      usual management of the patient. For the purposes of the study, these data will be
      secondarily anonymized and analyzed in connection with the MRI data and the perinatal outcome
      to meet the specific objectives.

      The lost-to-follow-up bias will be limited by the simplicity of the proposed perinatal
      surveillance, which does not differ from the surveillance usually recommended for these
      pregnancies
