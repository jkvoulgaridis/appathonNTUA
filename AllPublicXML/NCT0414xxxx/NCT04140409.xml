  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centric prospective interventional study in which patients with a symptomatic
      GEP-NET will receive octreotide LAR every 2, 3 or 4 weeks. The basal dose and the dose
      adaptation will be left at the discretion of the investigator depending on the rate of
      symptom control. Dose increase up to doses of 60 mg octreotide every 4 weeks, or increase of
      frequency up to 30 mg every 2 weeks can be done to obtain control of carcinoid symptoms,
      defined by at least a 50% decrease of the mean number of bowel movements per day and the
      total number of flushes over 7 days AND a maximum frequency of less than 4 bowel movements a
      day. If only one symptom is present, analysis will be done for that symptom only: refer to
      table in statistical analysis The concentration of serum octreotide level will be realized
      with LCMS/MS following the method of Capron &amp; Wallemacq. Each blood sample should be taken 4
      times per year just before the next injection of Octreotide LAR.

    <description>The primary endpoint is defined as follows:
Treatment success: Symptom control is achieved within 2 years of treatment with octreotide LAR. Symptom control is defined as at least a 50% decrease of the mean number of bowel movements per day and the total number of flushes over 7 days AND a maximum frequency of less than 4 bowel movements a day.
Treatment failure: No symptom control is achieved within 2 years of treatment with octreotide LAR.
The response rate will be calculated as the number of patients with treatment success divided by the total number of included patients that received at least one injection of octreotide LAR.</description>
