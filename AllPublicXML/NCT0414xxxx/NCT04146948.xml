  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study attempts to investigate the differences and relationships of
      respiratory parameters, muscle activity, and dyspnea during ADL between patients with COPD
      and age-matched healthy participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing device</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The machine analyze the breath of participants including oxygen consumption and minute ventilation volume. Oxygen consumption is reported in mL/min and minute ventilation volume is reported in L/min.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surface electromyography device</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The surface EMG is performed to assess the maximum voluntary contraction and muscle activity of upper limb muscles and accessory inspiratory muscles during performing simulated ADL tasks. The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) is used as the reference level of muscle activity to normalize the EMG data of performing simulated ADL tasks. The muscle activity is reported in percentage.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-reported questionnaire to measure the impact of COPD on participants' health status. The rating scores is a 7-point scale (0=no limitation, 6=totally limited).Higher scores mean the more severe impact of COPD on participants' daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Borg Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-reported scale to measure how much participants perceive dyspnea. The range from 0 which means no difficulty to breathe to 10 which means with maximal difficulty to breathe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Medical Research Council</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a five-point scale to assess the severity of breathlessness.</description>
