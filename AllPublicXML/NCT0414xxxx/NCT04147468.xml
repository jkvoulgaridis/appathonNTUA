  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) has shown to be effective to improve arm function in children with
      cerebral palsy (CP). Recently, functional strength training (FST) starts to show to improve
      arm function in patients with stroke but has not been extensively explored in children with
      CP. This pilot study is to examine the effect of FST and VR on improving arm function in
      children with CP as well as the neuroplasticity changes in the brain related to the level of
      improvement.

      Ten children with spastic CP will be recruited to participate in this pilot study. Children
      will be randomized to receive either VR of FST for 60 minutes per session x 3 sessions per
      week x 6 weeks at their home. All children will be evaluated prior to and immediately after
      the intervention at their home for clinical tests and at CABI for the MRI measures. Brain
      imaging data and clinical outcome measures including reaching kinematics, standardized fine
      motor assessment tool (Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2nd edition), and daily use of
      affected hand (using Revised Pediatric Motor Activity Log) will be evaluated. A physical
      therapist who is blinded to the status will conduct the assessment.

      The investigators anticipate children in both groups will improve their arm function after
      intervention; however, children in the VR group will have a better improvement as compared
      with children in the FST group.

    <description>Brain images of primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), the premotor cortex (PMC), and the supplementary motor area (SMA). During MRI measures, fMRI will be used to investigate cortical activation during a rest condition and 3 task conditions: 1) visually-guided wrist movement, 2) passively-guided wrist movement, and 3) imagined wrist movement. The same visual display will be shown to the participants in all conditions.</description>

    <measure>Reaching kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-intervention to the end of intervention, an average of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reaching kinematics will be assessed while the child is interacting with Super Pop VRTM, wherein virtual bubbles are projected onto the TV in randomly dispersed locations, using the Kinect system. Three testing bubbles will be tested in the location where children need to reach about arm length overhead at 180, 135, and 90 degrees of shoulder abduction. Children's reaching kinematics will also be assessed while playing the real-life functional activity by inserting an envelope into a mailbox slip located in neutral, outward 45, and inward 45 using the Kinect system. Position data from the Kinect will be converted into 3-dimensional coordinate data and kinematic variables (movement time, trajectory straightness, speed, smoothness) will be computed.</description>

    <measure>Fine motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-intervention to the end of intervention, an average of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The fine motor domain of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, 2nd edition (PDMS-2) will be used. Two subsets of the Fine Motor Domain will be used to evaluate the children: grasping and visual-motor integration. Each item is rated as 0, 1, and 2 (0: child cannot attempt the item; 1: child's performance shows resemblance but not fully met the criteria; 2: child performs the item according to the criteria specified for mastery). Raw score will later be compared to the norm values and converted to percentile of the norm values.</description>

    <description>Daily use of affected hand will be evaluated using Revised Pediatric Motor Activity Log (R-PMAL), which is filled out by primary caregivers about how often and how well their children use the affected arm in daily activities.</description>

    <description>Muscle strength of shoulder flexion, extension, abductor, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation, elbow flexion and extension, and wrist flexion and extension will be measured using hand-held dynamometer prior to and after intervention.</description>

    <description>Spasticity of shoulder flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation, elbow flexion and extension, and wrist flexion and extension will also be measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale. It contains a scale of 0 to 4 with 0 as no spasticity to 4 as rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

The research team will loan the system to the family. The child will be asked to move their arms to 'pop' as many virtual objects as possible with the focus on outwards, upwards, and across midline.</description>
