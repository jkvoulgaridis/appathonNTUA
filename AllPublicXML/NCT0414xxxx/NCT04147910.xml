  <brief_summary>

      Subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within approximately
      4 weeks prior to dose administration. Subjects will be confined to the Clinical Research Unit
      (CRU) for their entire participation in this study. Eight subjects will be enrolled to allow
      6 subjects to complete the study. Each subject will report to the CRU and be confined from
      Day -1 (the day before dosing) through at least Day 8 (168 hours postdose). A single dose of
      study drug will be administered on Day 1 (0 hour). On Day 8, subjects can be asked to remain
      as a resident within the CRU for an additional period to allow for ongoing 24-hour urine,
      fecal, and blood sample collections. These collections can continue up to a maximum of 336
      hours postdose (Day 15). Subjects can be discharged prior to Day 15 if the following
      individual subject discharge criteria have been satisfied: ≥ 90% of the 14C dose recovered in
      combined urine and feces, and ≤ 1% of the total radioactive dose is recovered in combined
      excreta (urine and feces) in 3 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a fecal sample is
      provided.

             investigating KW-6356, and have previously received the investigational product.

         21. Subjects with exposure to significant diagnostic or therapeutic radiation (eg, serial
             X-ray, computed tomography scan, barium meal) or current employment in a job requiring
             radiation exposure monitoring within 12 months prior to Check-in.

         22. Subjects who have participated in a radiolabeled drug study where exposures are known
             to the Investigator within the previous 4 months prior to admission to the clinic for
             this study or participated in a radiolabeled drug study where exposures are not known
