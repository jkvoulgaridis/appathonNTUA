  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot study intended to inform the hypothesis that regular walking in
      an exoskeleton within the home and community might offer health benefit, neurological
      recovery, and/or mobility benefit to the user. This exploratory pilot study is also intended
      to assess the level of compliance (i.e., exoskeleton use) among study participants by
      characterizing extent the device is used beyond the minimum required.

      Study 3 Outline Study 3 enrollment will be limited to 1 or 2 subjects at each site. Each
      subject will take home an exoskeleton for the 8-week duration of the treatment period. The
      subjects will be selected from the pool of poorly-ambulatory subjects previously enrolled in
      Studies 1 and/or 2, and as such will have prior experience walking in the exoskeleton. Note
      that study 3 will emply the exoskeleton as per existing FDA approval (510(k) number K171334);
      specifically, &quot;to enable individuals with spinal cord injury at levels T3 to L5 to perform
      ambulatory functions [in the home and community] with supervision of a specially trained
      companion in accordance with the user assessment and training certification program.&quot; Use of
      the exoskeleton in the home and community (i.e., outside a clinical setting) is referred to
      as &quot;personal use.&quot; So that this study complies with FDA approval for personal use, subjects
      selected for enrollment in Study 3, along with each subject's designated support person, will
      be trained and certified for personal use in accordance with the manufacturer's FDA-approved
      personal use training program.

             negative every four weeks during the course of the study protocol.

          -  Any disease, concomitant injury, or condition that interferes with the performance or

          -  Insufficient availability to complete study.
