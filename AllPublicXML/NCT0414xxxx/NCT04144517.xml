  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the response rate to ALKS 4230 in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with HNSCC who have previously received
      anti-PD-(L)1 therapy but who have not achieved a CR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytopathologically confirmed diagnosis of
             non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region that is locally
             advanced and/or recurrent and no longer amenable to local surgical or radiation
             therapy and/or with evidence of distant metastatic disease

          -  Patients must have had anti-PD-(L)1 therapy as the most recent systemic therapy with
             either stable disease or partial response on prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, or
             progressive disease on prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy

          -  Patients must have disease that is measurable by RECIST v1.1

          -  Patients must be willing to provide tumor tissue biopsy

          -  Patients must demonstrate adequate organ function

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within
             72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication

          -  Patients must agree to follow contraceptive requirements defined in the protocol

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy
             (inhaled or topical steroids and steroid replacement at physiologic doses are
             allowable)

          -  Patient has prior Grade â‰¥3 immune-related toxicities requiring systemic
             immunosuppressant treatment that were attributable or possibly attributable to PD-1
             immune checkpoint blockade

          -  Patient has active tuberculosis or known active infection with hepatitis B or
             hepatitis C

          -  Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders or a social situation that
