  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many sub-Saharan African countries, the scale-up of lifelong antiretroviral treatment
      (ART) to all pregnant and breastfeeding women under Option B+ has the potential to radically
      improve maternal health and reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission. However, loss to HIV
      care after delivery has emerged as an important threat to the hoped-for impact of Option B+.
      Evidence suggests that one important contributor to postpartum loss to HIV care is perinatal
      depression (PND). In non-pregnant HIV-infected populations, depression has been linked to
      poor ART adherence, reduced engagement in care, and ultimately worse HIV clinical outcomes.
      Thus, interventions that integrate PND treatment with targeted support for HIV care retention
      are critical to the success of Option B+.

      The Friendship Bench is an evidence-based depression counseling intervention delivered by
      trained, supervised lay health workers. It is proven to reduce depression in the general
      population in low-resource settings, but has not been adapted to address PND, or enhanced to
      support engagement in HIV care. The Friendship Bench offers an ideal framework for
      integrating retention support into a proven depression treatment model. Our long-term goal is
      to adapt, test, and scale up resource-appropriate interventions to reduce PND and improve
      engagement in HIV care. The objective of this proposal is to lay the groundwork for an
      effectiveness trial by adapting the Friendship Bench intervention to address PND and support
      engagement in care among perinatal HIV-infected women and assessing the feasibility,
      acceptability, and fidelity of the adapted intervention in Lilongwe, Malawi. In-depth
      perspectives on PND and its role in engagement in care will be gathered from HIV-infected
      women with PND, healthcare providers, clinic directors, and Ministry of Health officials
      using qualitative interviews and focus groups. This formative research will be used to
      develop an intervention protocol adapted to the unique needs of HIV-infected women during the
      perinatal period (Adapted Friendship Bench) and further enhanced to support engagement in HIV
      care (Enhanced Friendship Bench). The Adapted and Enhanced Friendship Bench interventions
      will be compared to enhanced standard care in a 3-arm pilot study. Feasibility,
      acceptability, and fidelity will be assessed at 6 months postpartum, along with the
      interventions' preliminary effectiveness across several mental health and engagement in HIV
      care measures.

    <description>The investigator will assess a combined outcome at 6 months of whether a woman attended an HIV visit within the last 30 days, was virally suppressed (HIV RNA &lt;1000 copies), and had â‰¥50% improvement in the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) score from baseline. The SRQ-20 was developed by the World Health Organization and has scores ranging from 0 to 20 and higher scores indicating a greater level of depression. Scores greater than or equal to 8 are typically considered indicative of a common mental disorder (CMD).

    <description>In the AFB intervention, the existing Friendship Bench intervention protocol will be adapted to address the unique needs of HIV-infected women. This will include integrating problem solving therapy- based ART adherence support into existing counseling sessions and providing opportunities for participants to address HIV-specific concerns, such as stigma, disclosure, mother-to-child HIV transmission or other issues women identify during counseling sessions. AFB will include 4 individual prenatal counseling session and 2 group postnatal counseling sessions. No specific retention support will be provided, but participants may identify barriers to engagement in HIV care to address during their pre- or postnatal counseling sessions.</description>

    <description>EFB will include all elements of AFB, but will additionally integrate retention strategies to support engagement in care for HIV-infected women with PND. To provide additional social support for participants, one support session will be added to the AFB at which participants will be invited to bring a person of her choice who can be a support to her in managing both her HIV and/or depression. To assist women with receiving their medication during late pregnancy and postpartum, a trained psychosocial counselor will also conduct up to six home visits in the EFB arm. At each home visit, counselors will be able to deliver a participants' medications and conduct a counseling session.</description>

    <description>Standard care for mental health in public facilities in Malawi includes options for basic supportive counseling by the primary provider or nurse, medication management by the primary provider, referral to the clinic psychiatric nurse or mental health clinic, or in more severe cases referral to the psychiatric units at tertiary care hospitals. For this study, standard care will be enhanced by a trained study research assistant who will provide mental health evaluation; brief supportive counseling; information, education, and support on common mental disorders; and (if indicated) facilitation of referral to the clinic's psychiatric nurse or mental health clinic. The study research assistant will have up to 3 follow-up contacts with the participant to assess whether she has followed up on recommended referrals or treatment plans and to assess whether any further outreach is indicated.</description>
