    <textblock>
      Extended day surgery or 23 h surgery is a surgical model where patients arrive to the
      hospital from home at the day of surgery, are operated and recover in a 23 h surgery unit.
      23H surgery units are usually situated near postoperative recovery unit. THe 23 H surgicical
      model was implemented in Kuopio University Hospital 2015 and between May 2017-May 2018
      patients were recruited in the present prospective follow up cohort study. Patients were
      informed and they gave their informed consent. The patients were contacted two weeks after
      the study and details of their recovery were asked.

      the study and details of their recovery were asked. Satisfaction to the care in 23 h unit and
      surgical process, were asked. Amount of readmissions, reoperations, contacts to health care
      professionals and adverse events are recorded.
