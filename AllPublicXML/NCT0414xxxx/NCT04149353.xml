  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To assess the utility of combined, simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), collectively called PET-MR, in assessing response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical treatment decisions for operable breast cancers.

      Participants: Adult patients with operable breast cancer that are being treated at UNC with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by potentially curative surgical resection.

      Procedures (methods): Patients who are being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
      by surgical resection and for whom pre- and post-treatment MR imaging is part of planned
      treatment will undergo additional pre-treatment and post-treatment PET/MR. The response to
      treatment will be assessed at post-treatment by evaluating change in tumor size from MRI,
      change in response to dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (18F-FDG) avidity from PET. Patients will then undergo surgery. Their pathology will be
      reviewed for treatment effect as assessed by residual cancer burden (RCB) score. Patients
      will be followed and assessed for recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose that the changes indicated by PET/MR imaging from pre-treatment to
      post-treatment time points will accurately predict the patient's response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, providing useful prognostic and surgical-planning information. The study will
      enroll patients with operable breast cancer being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      followed by potentially curative surgical resection. The standard of care for these patients
      would not normally include PET imaging but may include MR imaging. Patients in the study will
      receive combined PET/MR imaging prior to treatment and following treatment. Then, patients
      will receive curative intent surgery and be followed in the usual fashion and assessed for
      local and/or distant recurrent disease. The pathology report will be reviewed for therapy
      treatment effect as assessed by Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score. Quantitative measures
      from PET and MRI will be computed: the change in PET tumor-mean standardized uptake value
      (SUV) and tumor size as assessed by MRI, from pre- to post-treatment. The image-based
      quantitative measures will be correlated with the pathology outcomes to evaluate
      predictability of the image measures for RCB score. Patients will be followed with the intent
      of further correlating image measures with clinical outcomes.

    <time_frame>Time Frame: Changes in image measures will be assessed from baseline scans, prior to therapy, to post-treatment scans, taken six months after baseline. Pathology data will be obtained post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint is the determination of the potential for PET activity estimates to predict RCB score in comparison with that of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Treatment response will be determined on final pathological evaluation of the resected specimens by way of the RCB score.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes in image measures will be assessed from baseline scans, prior to therapy, to post-treatment scans, taken six months after baseline. Pathology data will be obtained post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative image measures from PET and MR will be compiled and an optimal linear regression will be derived between the image metrics and the outcome measure from pathology, the RCB score. Prediction performance of the regression relation will be assessed using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach.</description>

        <description>Primary endpoint is the determination of the potential for PET activity estimates to predict RCB score in comparison with that of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Treatment response will be determined on final pathological evaluation of the resected specimens by way of the RCB score.</description>

        <title>Performance of Metrics Combining Multiple Features From PET and MR in Prediction of Response to Therapy</title>
        <description>Quantitative image measures from PET and MR will be compiled and an optimal linear regression will be derived between the image metrics and the outcome measure from pathology, the RCB score. Prediction performance of the regression relation will be assessed using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach.</description>

PET/MR: Patient will be scheduled for a pre-treatment PET/MR and proceed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy per the direction of the medical oncologist. Within four weeks after completion of chemotherapy the patient will undergo a post-treatment PET/MR, and proceed for curative intent surgery if they are still surgical candidates.</description>
