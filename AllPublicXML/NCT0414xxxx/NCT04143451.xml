      To compare the safety and clinical efficacy (death, overall hospitalization, hospitalization
      for influenza or pneumonia) of ID QIV delivered via an intradermal device with imiquimod
      cream pretreatment with conventional intramuscular (IM) standard dose QIV and IM high-dose
      TIV

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective; double-blind randomized controlled study performed in the HKWC.
      Recruited subjects include subjects ≥50 years and adult subjects ≥18 years with chronic
      illness. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated (3:3:2) into one of the three groups in
      the first year. Group IQ: topical 5% 250mg imiquimod ointment followed by intradermal QIV,
      Group IM: topical aqueous-cream followed by IM QIV and Group HD: topical aqueous-cream
      followed by intramuscular high-dose TIV. Hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization
      antibody titres will be assayed. We plan to recruit 4000 subjects, 1500 subjects in each of
      the IQ and IM group (500 subjects in each subgroup with 3 subgroups) and 1000 subjects for
      the HD group (500 subjects in each subgroup with 2 subgroups).

      In the following year, the IQ and IM groups will be further randomized equally into three
      subgroups: IQ1, IQ2 and IQ3; IM1, IM2 and IM3; and two subgroups for HD group: HD1 and HD2.
      Subjects randomized to IQ1, IM1 will receive the QIV with the same topical treatment,
      delivery mode and vaccine as the first year and HD1 will receive the TIV with the same
      topical treatment, delivery mode and vaccine as the first year. Subgroup IQ2 and IM2 will be
      vaccinated as follow: IQ2 will receive topical aqueous-cream followed by IM QIV, IM2 will
      receive topical imiquimod ointment followed by ID QIV. Subgroup IQ3, IM3, HD2 will receive
      normal saline as the vaccine for that year, but delivered by the same mode and topical
      treatment. In the third year, subgroups IQ1, IQ2, IM1, IM2 and HD1 will receive the same
      topical treatment, delivery mode and vaccine as the second year. Subgroup IQ3, IM3 and HD2
      will receive the same topical treatment, delivery mode and vaccine as the first year.
