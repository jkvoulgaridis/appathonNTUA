  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project sought to develop a culturally- and individually-tailored,
      plain-language Spanish/English mobile phone intervention for Latinas with prior gestational
      diabetes (GDM). The intervention is based on earlier in-person to online modification of the
      CDC-funded Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), for women with prior GDM led by co-investigator
      Dr. Ellen Seely of Brigham and Women's Hospital.

    <description>For the pilot, all participants received a mobile app that contained 6 interactive audio/written modules in Spanish and English on the following topics: healthy eating; physical activity; portion control; eating healthy while eating out; eating out in Chinese, Italian, Mexican restaurants; and eating out in fast food restaurants. As noted above, the mobile app was customizable to include personalized activity reminders/notifications, and tailored action plans, along with videos for easy at-home exercises and user-friendly, easy-to-follow recipes.</description>
