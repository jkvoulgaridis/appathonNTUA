  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of the study is that enzalutamide induces a significant proliferative
      arrest in HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer falling into the PAM50 HER2-E subtype. Currently,
      enzalutamide clinical development is ongoing in different prostate cancer indications but the
      breast cancer development program has been discontinued. As the role of the AR in HR-positive
      breast cancer and the predictive value of previously identified biomarker are still unclear,
      further research is needed to effectively utilize enzalutamide in this disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A strong rationale accumulated over the years suggests that within HR+/HER2-negative breast
      cancer, tumors falling into the PAM50 HER2-enriched subtype have androgen receptor
      (AR)-dependency. To test this hypothesis directly in patients' tumors, we propose an
      exploratory, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort, multicenter, prospective, phase II study
      which evaluates the effect of enzalutamide on proliferation after 2 weeks (14-21 days) of
      treatment in patients with endocrine-resistant, locally advanced or metastatic
      HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer. After 2 weeks (14-21 days) of treatment, patients will
      continue enzalutamide. Exemestane will be allowed to be added to enzalutamide per
      investigator discretion and will be administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent for all study procedures according to local regulatory
             requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.

             anti-cancer therapy.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Pre/peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women are allowed; menopausal status is
             relevant for the requirement of goserelin, triptorelin or leuprolide to be used
             concomitantly with enzalutamide. Post-menopausal status is defined either by:

               -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy or

               -  Age ≥60 or

               -  Age &lt; 60 and amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months (in the absence of chemotherapy,
                  tamoxifen, toremifen, or ovarian suppression) and FSH and estradiol in the
                  post-menopausal range per local standards.

               -  If a patient is taking tamoxifen or toremifene and is aged &lt; 60, then FSH and
                  plasma estradiol levels should be in post-menopausal range per local values.

               -  For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, measurement of FSH and/or estradiol
                  are needed to ensure menopausal status.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer not amenable to curative intent.

          -  Histologically confirmed HR-positive/HER2-negative disease based on the most recent
             biopsy before signing the informed consent.

               -  HER2 negativity is defined as either of the following by local laboratory
                  assessment: IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC2+/in situ hybridisation (ISH/FISH) negative as
                  per American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)-College of American Pathologists
                  Guideline (CAP) guideline(73).

               -  ER and/or PR positivity are defined as &gt;1% of cells expressing HR via IHC
                  analysis as per ASCO-CAP guideline (74)

          -  Patients must have a site of disease amenable to safely perform a biopsy, as per
             Investigator's assessment, and be a candidate for tumor biopsy according to the
             treating institution's guidelines.

          -  Possibility of performing a biopsy prior to the start of treatment and its repetition
             after 2 weeks (14-21 days) on the same location. It will be provided formalin-fixed
             paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor block. The tumor tissue should be of good quality based
             on total and viable tumor content and must be evaluated centrally for PAM50 analysis
             prior to enrollment. Patients whose tumor tissue is not evaluable for central testing
             are not eligible. It is recommended to send the biopsy directly to the central lab
             after confirming the existence of a tumor, so as not to delay the inclusion, without
             the need to carry out IHC studies in the same.

               -  Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue or
                  excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous,
                  or mucosal lesions or biopsies from bone metastases.

               -  Fine needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion and lavage

             receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for early stage breast cancer or disease
             progression of locally advanced/metastatic BC under ongoing endocrine therapy. There
             is no limit of previous received hormonal agents.
