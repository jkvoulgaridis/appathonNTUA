        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Male participant must be 16 to 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Participants who are diagnosed with classic Fabry disease based on phenotype, presence
             or absence of characteristic Fabry disease symptoms including neuropathic pain,
             clustered angiokeratoma and/or cornea verticillata, leucocyte α-GAL A enzyme activity
             (3% or less compared to control), and genotype (optional).

          -  Participants who are currently receiving agalsidase alfa for a minimum of 6 months at
             an average dose of 0.2 mg/kg every other week (ie, every 2 weeks) at baseline.

          -  Participants who are naïve to agalsidase beta.

          -  Participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 at
             screening and baseline.

          -  Proteinuria level as measured by 2 separate, morning, clean-catch urine samples taken
             a few days apart demonstrating an averaged urine protein-creatinine ratio of &lt;0.5 (ie,
             &lt;500 mg protein per 1 g creatinine) between the 2 samples. For participants on
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers
             (ARBs), the criterion is to be met both prior and after a temporary interruption of
             ACEIs/ARBs for 4 weeks.

          -  Participants with plasma lyso-GL3 levels &gt;20 ng/mL on 2 consecutive samples taken at
             least 4 weeks apart.

          -  Participant's medical records (including eGFR values) available and accessible during
             the study period.

          -  Participant and/or participant's legal representative has given signed informed
             consent as described in the protocol which includes compliance with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol. For
             potential participants age 16 to 18 years, a parent or legal representative is
             required to sign the ICF, and the potential participant is also required to sign an
             informed assent form.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants with severe renal impairment (end-stage renal disease, dialysis, or renal
             transplantation) and/or nephropathies (including diabetic).

             to the most recent eGFR value approximately 12 months prior to screening.

          -  Participants with advanced cardiac failure (Stage D).

          -  Participants with bleeding disorder, prior history of unexplained bleeding episodes,
             or receiving mandatory anticoagulants or antiplatelets for any indication not allowing
             interruption of therapy for renal biopsy.

          -  Participants with history of anaphylaxis to Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT).

          -  Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or drug or other

          -  Participants treated for more than 5 years with agalsidase alfa at an average dose of
             0.2 mg/kg every other week (ie, every 2 weeks) prior to randomization.

          -  Exposure to migalastat or any investigational study intervention, except agalsidase
             alfa, for Fabry disease in the last 5 years prior to study participation. Patients who
             previously participated in any agalsidase alfa clinical study will be eligible if they
             meet other criteria.

          -  Exposure to any investigational drugs in the last 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever
             is longer, prior to screening visit or concomitant enrollment in any other clinical
             study involving an investigational study treatment.

             prisoners or subjects who are legally institutionalized.

             risk of noncompliance to study procedures.

          -  Participants are dependent on the Sponsor or Investigator or deemed vulnerable for any
             reason (in conjunction with Section 1.61 of the International Council for
             Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH-GCP] Ordinance E6).

          -  Participants who are employees of the clinical study center or other individuals
             directly involved in the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such
             individuals.

          -  Any specific situation during study implementation/course that may raise ethics
             consideration

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
