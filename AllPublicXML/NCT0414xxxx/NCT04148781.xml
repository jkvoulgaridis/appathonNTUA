  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optic Neuritis (ON) is a condition that occurs in approximately 50% of individuals with
      relapse remitting MS, and is the presenting event in 15-20% of patients who go on to develop
      MS. These ON events present with a decline in vision over several days with painful eye
      movements. The purpose of this study is to collect pilot data on the effect of Fampridine-SR
      on the recovery of visual function after demyelinating optic neuritis.Our team evaluated a
      person with ON who had incomplete recovery which was quite bothersome to her. After a
      one-month treatment course Fampridine SR,her visual functioning improved. Based on this case,
      we present a unique opportunity to evaluate the potential benefit of Fampridine-SR as a
      potential treatment for persons who do not fully recover from acute ON.

      Optic Neuritis (ON) is a condition that occurs in approximately 50% of individuals with
      relapse remitting MS, and is the presenting event in 15-20% of patients who go on to develop
      MS. ON usually presents with a decline in vision over several days to weeks with painful eye
      movements.

      Fampridine-SR is currently a Health Canada approved medication to treat walking impairment in
      persons with MS. Some small studies in the past have shown that Fampridine-SR may also have
      positive effects on visual functioning in those experiencing ON.

      This study will aim to assess the effect of taking Fampridine-SR for 8 weeks in 20 MS
      patients with unresolved optic neuritis on measures of visual functioning, and to determine
      the best measures to use in a future large scale study. The results of this study will also
      be used to estimate how many participants we will need in the future large scale study.

    <measure>Change in Visual Evoked Potentials</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) measure the occipital cortical response to visual stimuli and are used to detect visual abnormalities. VEPs will be measured at multiple time points to assess any changes in VEPs over the duration of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in visual acuity will be assessed using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts and standard protocol as it the gold standard for ophthalmology clinical trials using visual acuity as an outcome. Visual acuity will be measured at multiple time points to assess any changes over the duration of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Contrast Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity or low contrast visual acuity (LCVA) has been found to be a sensitive measure of visual function in demyelinating lesions when focusing on recovery, even in patients with high contrast visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity will be measured at multiple time points to assess any changes over the duration of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Colour Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Colour vision is frequently affected in optic neuritis and unlikely to fully recover We will use Ishihara colour plates, a common test to assess colour vision. Colour vision will be measured at multiple time points to assess any changes over the duration of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Fields</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of central visual function are important in the evaluation of optic neuritis, because most cases of optic neuritis affect central vision and therefore decrease quality of life. Visual fields will be measured at multiple time points to assess any changes over the duration of the study.</description>

    <measure>Optical Coherence Tomography</measure>

    <description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now a ubiquitous technology in the world of MS research, and is an excellent means of imaging the layers of the retina.</description>

    <description>The 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement (NOS-10) has been developed to capture patient-reported outcomes related to visual dysfunction in patients with visual disorders. Total scores will be collected (range 1 to 52). Scores on the NOS-10 will be measured at multiple time points to assess any changes over the duration of the study.</description>
