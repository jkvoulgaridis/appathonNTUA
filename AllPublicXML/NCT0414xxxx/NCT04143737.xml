  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the extremely high incidence of diabetes in Arab women and the current lack of
      interventions, all non-diabetic women can be considered &quot;at risk&quot; and warrant secondary
      prevention. Creating an effective community-based primary and secondary diabetes prevention
      program has the potential for nationwide reduction of health disparities for Arab women.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention in
      reducing risky health behaviors and thus reducing modifiable risk factors associated with
      diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, through dietary modification, adherence to healthy
      low-caloric, low-fat diet and engaging in physical activity.

      Given the extremely high incidence of diabetes in Arab women and the current lack of
      interventions, all non-diabetic women can be considered &quot;at risk&quot; and warrant secondary
      prevention.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention in
      reducing risky health behaviors and thus reducing modifiable risk factors associated with
      diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, through dietary modification, adherence to healthy
      low-caloric, low-fat diet and engaging in physical activity.

      Methods: The invistigators will conduct a quasi-experimental, pre-post intervention study
      between to investigate the effectiveness of community based intervention to change lifestyle
      habits and consequently reduce the modifiable risk factors for developing diabetes at all
      levels of prevention. All members of two targeted Arab women's community centers in
      East-Jerusalem will be invited to participate in the study. Potential participants will be
      interviewed for eligibility (over age 25, able to commit to the intervention timetable, and
      precluding pregnancy or serious mental and physical illness).

      Participants who will be included in the control group will not receive any intervention. The
      intervention group will be located in one community center in Zur-Baher neighborhood, and the
      control group will be located in one community center in the old city of Jerusalem.

      Data will be collected from both groups. Intervention: The Community-Based Lifestyle
      Intervention (CBLI) was developed based on the gold standard Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP) and adapting all intervention components to the specific culture, language, gender, and
      religious sensitivities of Palestinian female society. The intervention consisted of 20
      weekly sessions and will be taught by professional facilitators (nutritionists, exercise
      trainers, health coaches, and psychotherapists). The DPP's lifestyle curriculum includes
      sessions on nutrition, physical activity, stress management skills, and self-monitoring and
      was culturally adapted, translated into Arabic, and gender tailored.

    <measure>Adherence to Mediterranean diet</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after intervention initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to Mediterranean Diet- Eating behaviors will be assessed through self-reported questionnaire adapted from the Attica study. The questions include an assessment of daily average consumption of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and low-fat dairy products. The questionnaire includes also food items assessing the consumption of western diet including sweets, sweet drinks and salty snacks. These questions were adapted from the following study: &quot;A Western dietary pattern is associated with higher blood pressure in Iranian adolescents.&quot; European Journal of Nutrition 2017 Feb:56(1)399-408.</description>

    <measure>Change in body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after intervention initiation</time_frame>
    <description>BMI will be calculated by measuring weight and height for each participant. weight will be measured in kilograms. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated using the formula of weight in kg divided by height in m2 (kg/m2).</description>

    <measure>Change in Leadership self-efficacy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after intervention initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Leadership self-efficacy will be assessed through self report questionnaire. This questionnaire was adapted from a scale used in previous study by the Brookdale Institute in Israel, with similar objectives of empowering and promoting female lay health leaders in the community to advance women's health. The questionnaire consists of 9 items. Participants were asked to rate their level of confidence that they can perform the tasks defined by the leadership component objectives. Respondents select from a 4-point scale varying from 1 = a little confident to 4 = very confident. The sub-scales will be summed and average score will be calculated. higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
