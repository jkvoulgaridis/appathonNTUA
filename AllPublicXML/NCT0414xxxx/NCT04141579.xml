  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a large number of patients who had a heart attack, multiple narrowings of the coronary
      arteries are identified. It is common practice to treat the narrowing that is the cause of
      the heart attack with a stent. It is not yet clearly known if the other narrowings in the
      other coronary arteries have to be treated immediately with a stent as well.

      &quot;Bad&quot; cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) can speed up the formation of these coronary artery
      narrowings, and can thus make the risk of a second heart attack bigger.

      The investigators want to investigate if treating patients with the new cholesterol-lowering
      drug Evolocumab on top of the normal cholesterol lowering therapy (statins) ameliorates blood
      flow through coronary artery narrowings. Better blood flow through these narrowings could
      prevent the need for stenting or surgery in the future.

      Rationale:

      In a large number of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) multivessel
      disease (MVD) is identified. Optimal treatment approach for bystander lesions in non-infarct
      related arteries (non-IRA's) has not been well established. Multiple RCT's favor preventive
      percutaneous intervention (PCI) over medical treatment, however medical treatment wasn't
      optimal in these studies. Revascularization of lesions in the non-IRA can be guided by
      fractional flow reserve (FFR). The investigators want to investigate if optimizing LDL-C
      lowering therapy after an ACS has an effect on functional impairment of a non-IRA lesion and
      could thus prevent mechanical intervention (PCI or CABG).

      Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of maximal LDL-C reduction by Evolocumab on top of optimal background
      lipid-lowering therapy (ESC guidelines) on FFR of non-IRA lesions, in patients presenting
      with MVD-ACS.

      Secondly to correlate baseline lipid core burden with changes in FFR and to investigate the
      relation between LDL-C reduction and change in pro-inflammatory monocyte phenotypes.

      Study design: This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical
      trial.

      Study population:

      Patients presenting with MVD-ACS and eligible LDL-C levels will be included in this study.
      Patients must be 18 years or older. The investigators aim to include at least 150 patients to
      achieve adequate power for this study.

      Intervention: The patients will be randomized 1:1 to (A), one group will receive 140mg
      Evolocumab every two weeks (Q2W) for 12 weeks, using personal injectors; (B) the other group
      will receive placebo. All participants will receive high intensity statin therapy (HIST) as
      background therapy (Atorvastatin 40mg or equivalent).

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The primary study parameter is the change in FFR from baseline to follow-up in non-IRA
      lesions. The secondary invasive imaging endpoint is the correlation between baseline
      Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) derived lipid core burden (MaxLCBI4mm) and change in FFR of
      the non-IRA.

      The investigators will assess the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) as an
      exploratory endpoint.

      Main endpoint for the immunological parameters is the comparison of monocyte phenotype
      between the groups at t=14 weeks post-ACS.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      After inclusion, all patients have to undergo staged FFR + NIRS, meaning they will undergo
      invasive strategy for a second time, and if needed additional stenting of significant
      lesions, with the associated periprocedural risks (e.g. death, stroke, myocardial infarction
      (MI), vascular complications), however these risks are quite small (&lt;2% major complications)
      .

    <time_frame>FFR will be assessed at baseline (0 weeks) and at the last follow-up visit (14 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Fractional flow reserve (FFR): FFR is the ratio between coronary pressure distal from a stenotic lesion and aortic pressure proximal to that lesion during maximal hyperaemia. Flow is linearly related to blood pressure when coronary resistance is minimal. Thus FFR is a surrogate measure for the proportion of flow across a stenosis.</description>

    <time_frame>NIRS will be performed at baseline (0 weeks) and at last follow-up visit (14 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>NIRS is an imaging method used to detect lipid-rich plaques in a coronary artery. The fraction of yellow pixels obtained from the chemogram, an image map derived from the NIRS measurements, is multiplied by 1000 to compute the Lipid Core Burden Index (LCBI).</description>

    <measure>The correlation between LDL-C reduction and reduction of pro-inflammatory monocyte phenotypes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood for monocyte phenotyping will be drawn directly after revascularization at baseline (0 weeks). Measurements will be repeated at 4 weeks and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Monocyte phenotype will be determined using a Flow Cytometry Panel Design (FACS) panel and cytokine production capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 24h incubation with lipopolysaccharide/Pam3Cys(LPS/Pam3Cys) and cholesterol crystals (IL-1b). At 4 and 14 weeks measurements will be repeated (in the morning after overnight fast) with additional magnetic activated cell separation (MACS) isolation of monocytes for RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP)-sequencing.</description>

    <time_frame>This measurement will be performed at baseline (0 weeks) and at last follow-up visit (14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The apparent IMR is calculated by multiplying the distal coronary pressure by the mean transit time of a 3 ml bolus of saline at room temperature during coronary hyperemia induced by intravenous adenosine. This will be an exploratory endpoint.</description>

    <description>Evolocumab (also known as Repatha, formerly referred to as AMG 145) is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) that specifically binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) preventing its interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The inhibition of PCSK9 by evolocumab leads to increased LDLR expression and subsequent decreased circulating concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).</description>
