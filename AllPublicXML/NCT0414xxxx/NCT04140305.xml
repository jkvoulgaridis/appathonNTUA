  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, longitudinal, single-arm, open-label study to describe the change from
      baseline in cognitive processing speed, measured by the SDMT, in subjects with RMS treated
      with ozanimod HCl 1 mg at 3 years.

      All subjects will receive orally administered ozanimod HCl 1 mg. The primary efficacy
      endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a clinically meaningful increase in raw score of
      ≥ 4 points or 10% from baseline (improved). The treatment period is 36 months. For subjects
      who discontinue the study, there will be a 30-day (± 15 days) and a 90-day (± 10 days) Safety
      Follow-up Visit. There is no planned protocol extension following the end of the study. If
      commercial drug is not available at the end of the study, subjects may be started on another
      medication as determined by their individual treating physician. Approximately 250 subjects
      with RMS will be recruited for this study. Subjects with RMS will be enrolled in this study
      if they have received ≤1 DMT, have an EDSS ≤ 3.5, and have been diagnosed with RMS within 5
      years of study entry. The Investigator will be responsible for the overall conduct of the
      study at the site, confirmation of subject eligibility, routine study subject clinical
      management including for MS relapses, and management of AEs.

             requirements.

          3. Subject is male or female 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive) at the time of signing of

          4. Subject has a diagnosis of MS according to the 2010 or 2017 Revised McDonald criteria.

          5. Subjects has ≤ 5 years since time of RMS diagnosis.

          6. Subject has ≤ 1 approved RMS DMT at time of study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Following are some criteria that would exclude the subject from participation. Additional
        exclusion criteria apply.

        Exclusions Related to General Health

          1. Subject has any clinically relevant hepatic, neurological, pulmonary,
             ophthalmological, endocrine, psychiatric, or other major systemic disease making
             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study difficult or that would
             put the subject at risk by participating in the study. Subjects with mild or moderate
             asthma, and subjects with other mild pulmonary disease (eg, chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease [COPD]) may be included in the study.

          2. Subject has a presence of other neurologic disorders to explain the progressive
             neurologic disability (as defined in the key inclusion criteria) or that might affect
             cognition.

          3. Subject has a visual or other sensorimotor impairment likely to confound test
             performance.

          4. Subject has a presence of &gt; 10 GdE lesions on the Baseline brain MRI scan.

          5. Subject has a history of developmental disorder (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
             disorder [ADHD], learning disability).
