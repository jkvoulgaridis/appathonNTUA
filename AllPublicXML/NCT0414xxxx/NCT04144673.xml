  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the ability of Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol™ in
      providing immune support in healthy adult males and females participating in intense aerobic
      exercise. Sixty eligible participants are planned to be randomized into either the
      investigational product or treatments arms and will consume the study product for 60 days
      (check-in visit on day 28). Questionnaires will be completed and blood and saliva samples
      will be collected to measure the endpoints.

    <description>The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS) is a questionnaire used to evaluate the negative impact of acute URTIs. The WURSS-24 contains 24 items scored on a Likert-type severity scale. It contains the same items as the WURSS-21 along with headache, body ache, and fever to capture influenza-like illness symptoms. The items are scored on a 0 (do not have this symptom) to 7 (severe) scale.</description>
