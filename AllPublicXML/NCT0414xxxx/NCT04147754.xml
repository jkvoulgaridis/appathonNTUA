  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary thoracic surgery is often responsible for severe postoperative pain, which is
      associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, postoperative
      thoracic pain has a strong impact on patient rehabilitation and is associated with an
      increase in hospital stay.

      Various analgesic techniques allow effective management of pain in the context of thoracic
      surgery. Regional anesthesia, particularly, allows a powerful analgesia, and limits the use
      of opioids and their side effects. Among regional anesthesia techniques, thoracic epidural
      analgesia has become the gold standard for post-thoracotomy analgesia. However, it induces a
      sympathetic block that promotes in particular per and postoperative hypotension and acute
      urinary retentions. Thus, new regional anesthesia techniques have been developed and assessed
      in thoracic surgery in order to avoid side effects related to epidural analgesia,
      particularly paravertebral block and erector spinae block, but also intrathecal analgesia.
      Paravertebral block has shown analgesic efficacy after thoracic surgery, and its interest in
      reducing the risk of hypotension, acute urinary retention, pruritus and postoperative nausea
      and vomiting compared with the epidural analgesia. Erector spinae block, recently described
      and evaluated in this context of thoracic surgery, seems to have the same interests and to be
      easier to achieve than the paravertebral block, but has been little studied. Finally,
      intrathecal morphine is frequently used because of an easy and rapid realization, and because
      it allows an adequate analgesia and the reduction of the duration of stay in intensive care
      compared to the epidural one. However, despite its frequent use, very few studies have
      compared intrathecal anesthesia with the epidural and other peri-spinal blocks.

      These three types of analgesia, epidural analgesia, intrathecal morphine, and erector spinae
      block are regional anesthesia methods regularly used for pulmonary surgery in the department
      of the investigators. All of these techniques have shown their analgesic efficacy, but each
      seems to have particular respective interests, in terms of achievement, management, or
      perioperative rehabilitation. The objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of each of its techniques to treat postoperative pain and improve the
      rehabilitation of these patients.
