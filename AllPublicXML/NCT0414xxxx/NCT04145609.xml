      Strategies to stop AKI-AKD-CKD continuum - Policy is one of the collaborative projects,
      Strategies to stop AKI-AKD-CKD continuum, Epidemiology, Immunology, Repair, Artificial
      intelligence, and Policy (EIRAP). It is aimed to study effective interventional strategies
      that lower the incidence of CKD among patients with AKD. The intensified AKD care to reduce
      CKD (ISACC trial) is a prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled trial is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of multidisciplinary team care (MDT) model and acute kidney disease
      (AKD) clinic visits

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney disease (AKD), defined as the ongoing renal function impairment between 7 days
      and 90 days following AKI, has been proposed as a window of intervention to prevent the
      occurrence of CKD. However, the effective therapeutic strategies of AKD care remain to be
      developed. We intend to conduct a prospective, randomized, open-label, behavioral
      interventional trial to validate the efficacy of multidisciplinary team (MDT) care model
      which aims to improve AKD care and to reduce de novo CKD incidence.

    <description>Experimental: Multidisciplinary team (MDT) care + Acute kidney disease (AKD) clinic Participants randomized to this arm will receive multidisciplinary team (MDT) care by a specialized medical team which is composed of nephrologist, pharmacist and dietitian. Besides intensified care, participants of this arm receive evaluation of biochemical and physiological renal function more frequently. In order to provide seamless care of this group, post-discharge acute kidney disease (AKD) clinic will also be arranged for them. Clinic visits consist of evaluation of renal function, reconciliation of medication and steering necessity of renal replacement therapy.</description>

Nephrologist consultation and nephrology outpatient clinic follow-up will be allowed. However, this group of patient will not have access to MDT care and AKD clinic.</description>
