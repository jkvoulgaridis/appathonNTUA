  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate patellar tendon tissue (transmission electron microscopy of
      structure and protein analyses) coupled with magnetic resonance imaging (1.5T and 7T) from
      persons with i) chronic patellar tendinopathy (CT), ii) the earliest possible signs and
      symptoms of patellar tendinopathy (ET), and iii) symptom free controls (CTRL)(matched for age
      and physical activity/sports participation).

      The investigators hypothesize that 7T MRI will be able to detect more subtle changes in early
      tendinopathy as compared to 3T MRI, thereby taking advantage of the increased spatial
      resolution that can be obtained in MRI with higher field strength. Further the investigator
      hypothesise that alterations in the tissue will be more pronounced in the CT group compared
      to ET and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tendon tissue plays an essential role in transmitting contractile forces to bone to produce
      movement and is therefore uniquely designed to withstand considerable loads (up to ~8 times
      body weight) during human locomotion. Yet, repetitive use often results in overuse injuries
      such as tendinopathies, which is a common clinical condition characterized by pain during
      activity, localized tenderness upon palpation, swelling of the tendon and impaired
      performance. Tendinopathy is a sizeable problem in both elite and recreational athletes. In
      fact, the incidence of tendon injuries has been estimated to be as high as 30-50% of all
      sports injuries, and 50% of elite endurance runners, and 6% of sedentary people will at some
      point experience a tendon injury. Moreover, the symptoms and reduction in performance may be
      quite protracted and last for years. To date the ability to detect the early onset of the
      disease, and thus to prevent it from becoming chronic and debilitating, remains an enigma and
      the investigators wish to bridge this gap in knowledge by studying patellar tendon tissue
      samples coupled with magnetic resonance imaging (3T and 7T)
