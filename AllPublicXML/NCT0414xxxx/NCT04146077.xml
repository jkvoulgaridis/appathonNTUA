  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An active surveillance protocol for patients diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer will be held.
      We plan to use PSA (prostate-specific antigen) testing, DRE (digital rectal examination),
      TRUS (transrectal ultrasound), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and follow-up biopsies to
      monitor patients and detect cancer progression in time.
