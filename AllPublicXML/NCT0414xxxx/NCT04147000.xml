  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers with a prescription of oral sertraline who have been scheduled to bariatric
      surgery in either Norrköping/Sweden or Lindesberg/Sweden will be asked to participate in a
      observational study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the absorption and the effect and
      side effects of sertraline in volunteers 8 weeks before and 1, 6 and 12 months after
      bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetic changes of sertraline after bariatric surgery are studied by assessing
      the exposition for sertraline in individuals with long term treatment by measuring the area
      under the curve (AUC0-τ) 8 weeks before and one, six and twelve months after bariatric
      surgery in 30 participants.

      The effect of variation of sertraline concentration is studied by a psychiatric assessment of
      depressive symptoms and symptoms of anxiety disorder. The aim ist to study if there is a
      relation between changes in pharmacokinetics and effect of sertraline after bariatric
      surgery.

      For the assessment of side effects a self-reporting scale is used. These participants are
      recruited consequentially with the aim to get equal numbers of patients with both most usual
      types of surgery in Sweden (laparoscopic RYGB and gastric sleeve).
