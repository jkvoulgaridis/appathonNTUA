  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between immune inflammation-related protein complexes in blood and
      recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer with completed standard treatment for young ladies
      will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 patients younger than 35 with breast cancer will be followed up. Peripheral venous blood
      was collected every 3 to 6 months. Change regularity of breast cancer-specific immune
      inflammation-related protein complexes in blood at different follow-up time points will be
      studied. The relationship between disease specific protein complexes and pathological state
      of patients will be analyzed.
