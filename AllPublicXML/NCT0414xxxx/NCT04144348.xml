    <textblock>
      This clinical study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of 2 dose levels of mRNA-1653,
      a combined human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine, in healthy
      adults (18-49 years of age) and 3 dose levels in children (12-36 months of age) with
      serologic evidence of prior exposure. The safety profile of the adult cohort will permit
      enrollment of the pediatric cohort.
