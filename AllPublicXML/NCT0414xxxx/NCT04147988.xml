  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim at offering to about 80 patients a diagnostic assessment for Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and at testing the feasibility of this protocol to detect and
      diagnose ASD in adults without intellectual disability.

    <textblock>
      About 80 adults asked for an ASD diagnosis a Donald-T unit, now closed.The investigators will
      offer to these patients a diagnostic assessment, with questionnaires, ADOS-II, Vineland
      Adaptative Behavior Scale and psychiatric examination. Patients who will show negative scores
      at the detecting questionnaires will not be further assessed, except for 10 out of them, who
      will be drawn by lot. Then the investigators will be able to discuss the feasibility of such
      a procedure with these tools, as well as to describe the clinical profile of adult people
      asking for ans ASD diagnosis.

    <description>The Vineland Adaptative Behavior Scale (VABS-2) is designed to measure adaptive behavior of individuals from birth to age 90. The Vineland-II contains 5 domains each with 2-3 subdomains. The main domains are: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills, and Maladaptive Behavior (optional).</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is an instrument for detecting anxiety and depressive disorders. It has 14 listed items from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), allowing thus obtaining two scores (maximum score of each score = 21).</description>

    <measure>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is used to evaluate the intensity of fear and avoidance related to confrontation with social situations.
The intensity of anxiety is rated separately from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and the frequency of avoidance: 0 (never = 0%) to 3 (usual = 67 to 100%).
We can use several different scores depending on the dimensions we are interested in (performance vs social interaction or anxiety vs. avoidance).
The overall score is also widely used, it ranges from 0 to 144. The French norms are as follows: • 56-65: indicates a moderate social phobia;
66-80: indicates a marked social phobia;
81-95: indicates a severe social phobia; •&gt; 95: indicates a very severe social phobia.</description>

    <measure>Yale-Brown Scale(Y-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rating scale is designed to rate the severity and type of symptoms in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
The scale includes 10 items that measure 5 dimensions: duration, discomfort in daily life, anxiety, resistance, degree of control.
Each item is rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptom). The scale makes it possible to distinguish an obsession score: addition of the 5 items (0 ≤ score ≤ 20) and a compulsion score: addition of the 5 items (0 ≤ score ≤ 20).
According to the total score obtained (0 ≤ score ≤ 40), we will distinguish: • 10-18: light OCD causing distress but not necessarily dysfunction; the help of a third person is not claimed;
18-25: distress and disability;
≥ 30: severe disability requiring outside help.</description>
