  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is still a major global health issue. The preschool age (2-5 years) has
      been identified as a critical period to intervene, Mobile technology (mHealth) has been
      successful for weight loss and behavior changes in adults. This proposed randomized
      controlled trial aims to assess the effectiveness of an 6-month intervention program, the
      Mobile-based intervention to stop obesity in preschoolers (MINISTOP) 2.0 mobile phone app
      integrated in primary child health care for parents of children aged 2.5 years. The MINISTOP
      2.0 app is built on the previous MINISTOP 1.0 app. Three hundred children will be recruited
      at their routine visit at 2.5 years of age and after baseline measures randomized to the
      intervention or control group. In addition, the investigators will assess acceptability,
      feasibility and adoption of the app by parents and primary child health care nurses.
