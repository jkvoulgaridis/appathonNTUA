      This is a multicentre, randomized, controlled versus placebo, double-blinded, 4 parallel
      arms, dose-ranging main study, to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability and
      acceptability of repeated doses of ADV7103, after 7 days of treatment, in patients with
      cystinuria, and an efficacy and safety exploratory study in the youngest children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will target enrolling at least 15 subjects in each of the following age groups: 6
      months - 5 years (B13CS part only); 6-11 years; 12-17 years and adult &gt;18. Subjects will be
      in the study for up to 7 weeks.

      After screening and enrollment (up to 35 days), Eligible patients will be treated will
      alkalinising treatment (SoC) at the well-adapted dose and regimen for 7 days. An in-patient
      visit is planned at the end of this period. The baseline evaluations, including urine pH and
      specific gravity, will be done during this inpatient visit, from Day -1 t0 to t24h. After
      this visit, patients are randomized in a balanced manner (1:1:1:1) to one of the 4 possible
      treatment arms, ADV7103 at low dose, medium dose or high dose, or ADV7103 placebo. For
      patients in B13CS part, a period of titration is planned before the 7 days treatment with
      ADV7103. No use of placebo in B13CS.

      Controls of urine pH will be done at patient home with a pocket glass electrode pH-meter on
      fresh urines, at least twice a day: before the administration of ADV7103, in the morning at
      t0 and in the evening at t12h (12hrs after last ADV7103 intake and before the next dose).

      Subjects will have the opportunity to subsequently enter a long-term, open label extension.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the comparison between the probability of having an urinary PH ≥ 7.0 based on all urinations during Day 7 in an ADV7103 dose versus the probability in the placebo group. All urinations on Day 7 with an evaluable pH measure will be included in the analysis. The study will be declared positive if the chance of having pH value ≥ 7.0 at each urination on D7 is superior with at least one ADV7103 treatment group than with placebo.</description>
