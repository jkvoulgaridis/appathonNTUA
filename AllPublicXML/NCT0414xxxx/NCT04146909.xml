      This purpose of this study is to investigate whether lactation improves insulin sensitivity
      and increases lipolysis in women.

    <textblock>
      There are two aims that this research will address.

      In Aim 1, the research question is &quot;Does lactation improve insulin sensitivity and increase
      lipolysis in women?&quot; In this Aim, researchers will assess whether lactation amongst women
      with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will improve whole body insulin
      sensitivity as well as increase whole body lipid turnover by using
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps combined with [6,6-2H]-glucose and [2H5]-glycerol
      infusions. These stable, non-radiating isotopes have been used extensively and safely to
      study the mechanisms of insulin resistance amongst non-pregnant as well as pregnant humans;
      however, these techniques have not previously been applied to the study of insulin
      sensitivity during lactation. Therefore, the goals will be two-fold: 1) to determine whether
      lactation induces similar changes in insulin sensitivity in humans as in mice and 2) to pilot
      the feasibility of performing larger, more detailed metabolic studies in this population of
      women post-partum.

      The second aim (Aim 2) will use a retrospective chart review of women with a history of GDM
      who had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 6-8 weeks post-partum as part of standard of
      care.

      The focus of this protocol registration will be Aim 1.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole body insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Determined by the amount of 20% dextrose given during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study, necessary to keep blood glucose levels at the target range (90-100 mg/dL). Higher rates of infused dextrose indicates greater sensitivity to infused insulin during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Women with gestational diabetes are expected to be insulin resistant.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endogenous glucose production</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Determined with [6,6-2H] Glucose tracer given during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study. Lower values of endogenous glucose production indicates greater hepatic insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Whole body lipid turnover rates</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Determined with [2H5] Glycerol tracer given during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study. Tracer levels in the plasma determinates how the body uses fat in the blood during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study.</description>

    <measure>Plasma NEFA</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of non-esterified fatty acids levels in the plasma at fasting and during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study. NEFA levels in the plasma are higher in individuals less sensitive to the effects of insulin.</description>

    <measure>Triglycerides</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of triglycerides levels in the plasma at fasting and during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study. Triglycerides levels in the plasma are higher in individuals less sensitive to the effects of insulin and with type 2 diabetes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp</intervention_name>
    <description>After an overnight fast and an equilibration period lasting 2 hours, the 2-step euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study will be performed. A primed-continuous infusion of regular insulin will be given at 8 mU/(m2 × min) during the first 2 hours, and increased to 40 mU/(m2 × min) for the subsequent 2 hours. Plasma glucose levels will be measured every 5 min, and a variable glucose infusion will be initiated to maintain levels at ∼90 mg/dl. Plasma samples will be drawn at baseline and throughout the infusion period for measurement of isotope enrichment, insulin, NEFA, glycerol turnover, and additional hormones which may be altered with lactation. Approximately 160 mL of blood will be drawn at this visit.</description>
