  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section is the most commonly used anaesthetic choice in
      caesarean deliveries. This is usually associated with maternal hypotension and other adverse
      side effects. Prophylactic intravenous administration of ondansetron immediately and 5
      minutes preoperatively have shown to provide a protective effect against hypotension while
      other studies have shown little effect on the incidence of blood pressure drop in healthy
      parturients.

      The investigators will study the effect of different doses and timing of intravenous
      ondansetron in full term obstetric patients undergoing elective lower segment caesarean
      section under spinal anaesthesia on the incidence and severity of hypotension and other
      adverse side effects in healthy parturients having the standard intrathecal plain bupivacaine
      and fentanyl.

      This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study will include 150 American
      Society of Anaesthesiologist physical status grade I (ASA I) pregnant women scheduled for
      elective caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia.

      Patients will be randomly allocated into three groups (n = 50) to receive intravenous
      ondansetron 4mg in 10 mL normal saline (group O4), 6 mg in 10 mL normal saline(group O6), or
      placebo of 10 mL normal saline (group C), all 15-20 minutes before spinal anaesthesia.

      Hemodynamic variables and other adverse effects will be assessed at 16 time points
      intraoperatively. Those variables include blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,
      nausea, vomiting, electrocardiographic changes, skin flushing, discomfort or pruritus,
      perioperative vasopressor requirements and patients' satisfaction.

      Participants will be randomly allocated preoperatively as per randomizer.org software and
      will be blinded from other anaesthetists performing the spinal block and following patients
      intraoperatively.

    <measure>Usage of Ondansetron prophylactically to prevent a significant decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure after the induction of spinal anaesthesia.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline values of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), and Mean Blood Pressure (MBP) were recorded. Ondansetron was given 15 minutes before induction of spinal anesthesia. After initiation of spinal anesthesia, the SBP, DBP, and MBP were recorded regularly until the end of the cesarean section by a blinded anaesthesiologist.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevention of intraoperative nausea and vomiting.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were assessed for nausea, and vomiting throughout the whole intraoperative period by asking and observing the patients for any signs and/or symptoms of nausea, and we recorded any incident of intraoperative vomiting using the following scale:
0) no any complaint.
mild degree of nausea.
moderate degree of nausea and vomit.
frequently vomit.
severely (continuously vomit.</description>
