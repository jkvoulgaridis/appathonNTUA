      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of acupuncture press needle in mild to
      moderate obstructive sleep apnea patients.

      Obstructive sleep apnea(OSA) is characterized by multiple episodes of upper airway collapse
      during sleep and considered as a major health issue worldwide due to comorbidity with
      obesity, hypertension, diabetes and more advanced cardiovascular diseases. The noisy sounds
      of snoring caused by OSA bother bed partner sleepless and lead to long-term health problems.
      Most patients do not tolerate nasal continuous positive airway pressure device, which is the
      gold standard treatment of OSA. Press needle is one kind of acupuncture which possesses more
      safety and convenient, few complications and prolonged period of treatment time compared to
      conventional acupuncture. To date, there is no study to evaluate the effects of press needle
      in treating OSA. The investigators hypothesize that press needle is effective with high
      acceptability among OSA patients.

    <intervention_model_description>40 eligible participants diagnosed as mild to moderate OSA will be enrolled and randomly allocated to group A and group B. Press needle will be applied to acupoints at Jin's 3-tongue point ( EX-HN21 and the two extra channel points, 0.8 individual cun lateral to both sides of EX-HN21) and EX-HN25 in group A and at EX-CA1, EX-CA5 and EX-CA6 in group B. Each subject will start first course and receive the treatment 2 times a week for 4 weeks (8 times in total). Then, it takes 2-week washout period and make group A and group B crossover. Second course begins after 2-week washout period with the same treatment times as the first course. The primary outcomes include the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), snore time, snore index assessed by polysomnography, snore sound assessed by SnoreLab (snore recording and analysis application), and secondary outcome includes snore outcome survey questionnaire (SOS).</intervention_model_description>
