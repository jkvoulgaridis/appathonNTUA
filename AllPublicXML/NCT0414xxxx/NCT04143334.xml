  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide a profile of blindness/visual impairment, avoidable blindness and
      cataract surgery service in Chaonan, mainland China. We also evaluate the diagnostic accuracy
      of Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) comparison with conventional survey.

      This proposal describes a population-based study aimed at determining the prevalence of
      visual impairment, blindness and major causes in adults age 50 years old and above in Chaonan
      County of Guangdong province, where one of the Project Vision Charity Eye center was founded
      in 2009.

      In the proposed study, we will examine 3700 Chaonan County residents aged 50 years and older,
      selected via a clustered, randomized sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS).
      The cluster will be at the village level, 50 subjects aged 50 years and older will be
      examined in each cluster includes Visual acuity, torch light, and fundus review, the major
      cause of blindness or visual impairment will be determined. We also randomly recruited 60%
      clusters,total 2250 participants, from RAAB survey to conduct a detailed conventional eye
      examination.

      This study will provide a profile of blindness/visual impairment, avoidable blindness and
      cataract surgery service in Chaonan. we will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Rapid
      Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) comparison with conventional survey. . It will
      provide important public health issues for the purposes of establishing a sustainable and
      suitable model to eliminate the cataract blindness in China.

    <description>All the recruited participants underwent ophthalmic examination according to the RAAB protocol and then 60% of them were re-examined with instruments in a mobile eye clinic set up in a village center on the same day. Examination in the mobile clinic included standardized visual acuity (VA) tests using logarithm of the minimum angle resolution charts, refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and dilated fundal examination with a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope.</description>

        Among the 3700 people, 169 (4.6%) could not be reached, 20 (0.5%) were unable to
        communicate, and 27 (0.7%) refused. Consequently, 3484 persons (response rate 94.2%) with a
        mean (±SD) age of 64.4±9.8 years were examined. These included 1397 men (40.1%) with an
        average age of 65.3 ±9.6 years and 2087 women (59.9%) with an average age of 63.8±9.8
        years.

        Of the 2145 subjects (95.3%，2145/2250), 327 (15.2%) refused, and 2 (0.1%) were unable to
        cooperate for examination. Consequently, 1816 subjects (1816/2145, 84.7%) with a mean (±SD)
        age of 64.4±9.6 years received the conventional ophthalmic examination in the mobile eye
        clinic (figure 1). These included 686 men (37.8%) with an average age of 65.5±9.4 years and
        1130 women (62.2%) with an average age of 63.8±9.6 years.
