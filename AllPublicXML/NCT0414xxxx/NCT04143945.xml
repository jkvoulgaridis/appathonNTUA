    <textblock>
      This study in healthy men and women looks at the injection site experience of the DV3396 pen
      to that of the PDS290 pens when both pens are used to deliver 0.25 mg semaglutide
      subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin). Participants will receive 2 single doses of
      semaglutide 0.25 mg on 1 day. The 2 injections will be given at least 30 minutes apart, one
      in each side of the stomach. Participants will be in the clinic research center for 1 day. A
      follow-up phone call will take place between 4 and 5 weeks after the injections were given.
