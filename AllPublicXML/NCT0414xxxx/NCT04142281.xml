  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to apply measurement error techniques on consumer devices to
      assess rate of energy storage [ES] and energy expenditure [EE], then estimate EI using the
      intake-balance technique.

      The goal of this study is to develop calibration models that will be able to be translated to
      other consumer devices with only minor modifications given common hardware (e.g. triaxial
      accelerometry), resulting in overall improved ability to assess energy balance and EI at a
      population level and positive health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four stages in the proposed project: 1) We will validate EE and ES (hereafter,
      Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES) from a consumer physical activity monitor (Fitbit Alta HR™) and body
      composition analyzer (Fitbit Aria™) with gold-standard measures of DLW for EE and DXA for ES
      during a 14-day baseline period; 2) We will estimate EI using the intake-balance method
      during the 14-day baseline period; 3) We will calibrate daily Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES from
      consumer devices using a Bayesian semi-parametric measurement error modeling approach to
      estimate energy balance; 4) We will reassess our validation and calibration models of
      consumer devices during a 14-day post-study assessment period to evaluate changes associated
      with growth and development with gold-standard measures of DLW for EE and DXA for ES.

      Aims of the proposed study are to:

      Specific Aim 1. Validate and calibrate consumer devices to estimate energy balance using
      gold-standard methods and a Bayesian semi-parametric approach. Hypothesis 1: We will be able
      to jointly model measurement error for both EE and ES to create a calibration model that
      reduces bias and improves accuracy of consumer devices of EE and ES.

      Specific Aim 2. Estimate energy intake using the intake-balance technique using consumer
      monitors. Hypothesis 2:We will use calibrated EE and ES from consumer monitors to estimate EI
      using the intake-balance technique, with values being superior to self-reported EI.

    <description>Energy intake will be assessed subjectively via interviewer-administered dietary recalls. Three dietary recalls will occur on randomly selected non-consecutive days over each one-week treatment condition (including at least one weekend day) to minimize preparation that could bias recall by the participants. All interviews will be conducted over the telephone, will ask about all foods consumed over the previous 24 hours using a multi-pass approach, and energy intake will be calculated using the Nutrient Data System for Research software (NDSR Version 2014).</description>
