    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of GIA in
      sharing genetic test results with family members.

      To determine the utility of GIA in sharing information. To determine the impact of GIA on
      downstream cascade testing rates.

      Chatbots, also known as conversation agents, are programs designed to have interactive
      conversations with humans. While traditionally used in sectors such as online gaming and
      customer service, chatbots have made their way into a number of industries including
      healthcare and have shown promise in areas such as managing anxiety/depression, weight loss,
      and medication adherence. GIA (Genetic Information Assistant) is a chatbot specifically
      designed as a tool for patients to use for disseminating genetic results, education, and
      genetic counseling resources to their family members after they themselves receive a positive
      result.

      Patients receive a secure GIA link from their provider and then are able to send their
      relatives the link to GIA through texting, email, and/or Facebook messenger. Once a relative
      clicks on the provided link, GIA's platform is structured as a decision tree, allowing family
      members to construct a personalized conversation about their family member's test results.
      This can be done either on a smartphone or computer. GIA provides basic genetics education
      and risk assessment and connects family members with local genetic counseling resources to
      continue this conversation and/or go forward with genetic testing. At the end of the
      conversation, the family member has the option of having a transcript sent to them via email
      for their reference. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the application of GIA
      for cascade testing in newly identified high risk breast and gynecologic mutation carriers.
