      The objective is to achieve 90% overall, positive and negative clinical concordance between
      results of the T-SPOT.TB assay, using cells isolated via density gradient centrifugation and
      positive selection using the T-Cell Select kit, between 0-55 hours following venepuncture

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, clinical concordance between results of the T-SPOT.TB assay, using cells
      stored for 0-8 hours post venepuncture and isolated via density gradient separation and
      positive selection with magnetic bead isolation using the T-Cell SelectTM Kit will be
      assessed. Concordance between results of the T-SPOT.TB assay at 0-8 hours post venepuncture
      and using cells isolated with density gradient centrifugation and results obtained from cells
      isolated using the T-Cell Select Kit, following storage between 0-55 hours post venepuncture,
      will be assessed.

        This evaluation will collect blood samples from subjects suspected of having TB infection
        and, samples from a low risk control population with no (or minimal) TB risk factors. All
        subjects presenting at participating clinics will be eligible for enrolment into the study
        provided they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined in section 4. Based on
        previous experience and the medical profile of the patient attending each of clinics at the
        four study sites, it is expected that the sites will individually, and collectively, yield
        a range of positive and negative assay results required to assess the impact of the T-Cell
        Select kit on positive and negative agreements of the T-SPOT.TB test.
