    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, proof-of-concept Phase 2
      study to test efficacy and safety of AV-101 (L-4-chlorokynurenine) in Parkinson's Disease
      subjects with levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The trial will be conducted in two treatment
      periods, in which each treatment period will consist of 14 days. The two treatment periods
      will be separated by a 1-week washout period. During the first treatment period, subjects
      meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either 1440 mg AV-101
      or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. AV-101 or placebo will be administered BID for 14 days (every 12
      hours). After the washout period, all subjects will be crossed over to receive the alternate
      treatment during the second treatment period (14-day period).

      On the last day of each treatment period (Visit 4 [Day 14] and Visit 7 [Day35]), subjects
      will be assessed in clinic while in the practically &quot;off&quot; state and will receive the morning
      dose of the study drug at the clinic. This will be followed, within 25-30 minutes, by oral
      administration of a dose of levodopa that is 150% of the subject's normal dose. Assessments
      of dyskinesia and PD motor symptoms will be performed before and after levodopa/carbidopa
      administration.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female adults, 30 to 80 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Diagnosis of idiopathic PD meeting the United Kingdom Parkinson's disease Society
             Brain Bank criteria.

          3. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia present greater than 25% of the day as per MDS-UPDRS.

          4. Dyskinesia of at least moderate severity as per MDS-UPDRS

          5. Subjects currently receiving anti-parkinsonian medications that contain levodopa and
             carbidopa are eligible provided they have been on a stable dose of these medications
             for at least 1 month prior to randomization.

          6. Subjects currently receiving antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors, provided the dose has been stable for at least 1 month prior to
