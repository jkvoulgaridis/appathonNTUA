  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the leading chronic inflammatory rheumatism, with a
      prevalence of about 0.4% of the population.

      First-line therapy with synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (including
      methotrexate) is insufficiently effective in 40% of cases. These patients are then treated
      with biotherapies. The use of these bio-drugs increases each year, becoming a public health
      issue and a considerable economic burden. Besides, their growth is just beginning, as they
      are among the major purveyors of pharmacy innovations.

      There are about ten bio-drugs currently on the market for rheumatoid arthritis with an
      average annual treatment cost of 8 to 12 K € per patient. This cost is 20 times higher than
      that of synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. However, among patients treated
      with biotherapies, clinical practice shows that about one-third will not respond to the
      selected drug. In the case of non-response, practitioners currently have no choice but to
      perform an empirical rotation between the different treatments, because no tool capable of
      predicting the response or non-response to these molecules is currently available.

      The study is a prospective, phase III, controlled, multicenter, and randomized, single-blind
      (patient) clinical trial.

        -  Intervention arm: Prescription of biotherapy (rituximab, adalimumab, abatacept) using
           SinnoTest® software

        -  Control arm: Prescription of biotherapy without the SinnoTest® software which
           corresponds to current practice (all biotherapies).

      In addition, a sub study will be carried out within this trial to analyse the proteomic
      profile of the patients included and their modification throughout the study.

      To study the clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact after 6 months of the use of the SinnoTest®
      predictive tool in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to a first anti-TNF
      biologic agent compared to usual care.

    <description>This outcome will be calculated as the average differential cost per patient between both study arms (mean costs of the Sinnotest® Arm - mean costs of the Control Arm) divided by the diference in effectiveness between both study arms measured in the number of years of life weighted by the quality of life (QALY: quality-adjusted life year) generated by each of the strategies (mean QALY of the Sinnotest® Arm - mean QALY of the Control Arm).
QALY will be measured using the EuroQol-5D. Cost will be considered from a Societal perspective, including both direct and indirect costs The ratio will be expressed in cost (2019 Euros) per QALY earned, which represents the additional cost that will have to be spent to earn a healthy year of life</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years old and under 70 years old,

          -  Patients with RA, defined according to the ACR / EULAR 2010 or ACR 1987 criteria,

          -  Patients failing a first anti-TNF, defined as:

          -  Ineffectiveness (which is defined as a DAS28-ESR ≥3.2 and an inadequate response to
             iTNF according to the usual rheumatologist, which generally includes one or more of
             the following conditions: persistent swollen and tender joints, persistence of disease
             activity according to the overall evaluation of the patient, high levels of acute
             phase reactants and/or dependence of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             or corticosteroids); or

          -  Toxicity(defined as the appearance of any adverse event that the patient's
             rheumatologist relates to the medication and requires discontinuation),

          -  Effective contraception for patients of childbearing potential (oral contraceptive,
             intrauterine device, implant, spermicide, surgical sterilization or abstinence),

          -  Patients able to read and understand the modalities of the protocol,

          -  Patients who have dated and signed the informed consent form of the trial,

          -  Stability of treatments (no change) between the selection visit and the inclusion
             visit (M0).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a contraindication to any bDMARD or methotrexate,

          -  Patients included in another therapeutic evaluation study during this trial,

          -  Surgical intervention programmed during the trial,

          -  Patients with difficulties in understanding the Spanish language,

          -  Patients cannot be followed up 6 months,

          -  Psychosocial instability incompatible with regular monitoring (homelessness, addictive
             behaviour, antecedent of psychiatric pathology or any other comorbidity that would
             make it impossible for free and informed consent or limit adherence to the protocol),

          -  Breastfeeding and/or pregnancy. Although there are bDMARD that can be used in
             pregnancy, since SinnoTest can recommend one that discourages this condition, it is
             decided to exclude the inclusion of pregnant women.
