      This is a non-treatment, blood collection study to evaluate biomarker panels for the
      diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

      Study participants will be recruited by physician referral or from a list of clinical
      patients being evaluated for a potential pancreatic abnormality or for potential treatment of
      pancreatic cancer. Additionally, a surveillance cohort will be recruited among individuals
      who are being monitored for recurrence following surgical or medical treatment for pancreatic
      cancer.

      Peripheral blood specimens will be collected from all participants at time of enrollment.
      Additional specimens may be collected from surveillance cohort participants no more
      frequently than once every 3 months as clinically indicated.

      The specimens will be sent to a clinical lab for sTRA biomarker and CA19-9 analysis.
      Participants will be followed for 36 months to track clinical outcomes. The performance of
      the investigation biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, or surveillance of pancreatic
      cancer will be compared to the performance of CA19-9.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Diagnosis/Prognosis Cohort

          -  Patients being evaluated for possible pancreatic abnormality, via additional
             radiological test (endoscopic ultrasound, abdominal CT scan), blood test (CA19-9), or
             other diagnostic procedure.

          -  Patients being evaluated for medical or surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer or
             pancreatitis on the basis of previous clinical and radiological findings.

        Surveillance Cohort

          -  Patients being monitored or who will be monitored for potential recurrence of
             pancreatic cancer following surgical or medical treatment of pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the participant is unsuitable for the study.

          -  The participant does not speak English.

          -  The participant is a prisoner.

          -  The participant is known to be pregnant.
