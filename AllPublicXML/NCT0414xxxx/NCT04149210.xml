      This study aims :

        -  To assess the efficacy of fluorometholone 0.1% one drop twice daily for four weeks in
           reducing the incidence of post-operative trachomatous trichiasis (TT) when given as
           adjunctive therapy with TT surgery in the programmatic setting

        -  To assess whether such treatment is sufficiently safe for wide-scale implementation in
           TT programs.

        -  To estimate the costs of adding fluorometholone 0.1% treatment to TT surgery per case of
           postoperative TT averted, and to characterize the value of such treatment under a range
           of plausible health economic circumstances

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are pursuing an agenda to evaluate a new potentially cost-effective
      approach to improving trichiasis surgery outcomes: perioperative topical anti-inflammatory
      therapy. Inflammation—whether induced by the trachoma disease process or surgery itself—most
      likely contributes to progressive cicatrization leading to failure of lid rotation surgery in
      a clinically important proportion of TT cases. The investigators hypothesize that adjunctive
      topical fluorometholone therapy following trichiasis surgery will reduce the risk of
      recurrent trichiasis and will be acceptably safe. The rationale for the efficacy aspect of
      this hypothesis is that interruption of inflammation postoperatively would reduce
      postoperative scarring/contracture driven by ongoing disease-driven inflammation and/or
      surgically-induced inflammation thus reducing the incidence of TT recurrence (post-operative
      TT) and other inflammation-related outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 15 years or more, corresponding to the age of patients treated in the Fred Hollows
             Foundation/Federal Ministry of Health Program at field sites without general
             anesthesia.

          2. One or both eyes with upper lid trachomatous trichiasis—with one or more eyelashes
             touching the eye or evidence of epilation, in association with tarsal conjunctival
             scarring—with a plan to undergo TT surgery on at least one upper eyelid.

          3. Collection of all baseline data prior to randomization

          4. Signed, informed consent (and assent, when applicable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindication(s) to the use of the test articles, including a known allergy or
             sensitivity to the study medication (fluorometholone) or its components, and
             contraindication(s) to use of azithromycin

          2. IOP≥22 mmHg and/or currently taking more than two ocular anti-hypertensive medications
             in the study eye (prior IOP-lowering surgery is acceptable; combinations of two
             IOP-lowering agents such as Dorzamol are considered two medications)

          3. A known severe / serious ocular pathology or medical condition which may preclude
             study completion or increase the risk of harm in the study (e.g., suspicion of
             non-trachomatous active ocular infection or suspicion of glaucoma of a degree to which
             where an intraocular pressure spike would be vision-threatening).

          4. Any condition known to be present at baseline for which it is anticipated ocular or
             systemic corticosteroid therapy will be required.

          5. Any significant illness or condition (e.g., hypertension with systolic blood
             pressure≥170 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure≥110 mmHg) that could, in the study
             team's opinion, be expected to interfere with the study parameters or study conduct;
             or put the subject at significant risk.

          6. Previous upper lid TT surgery on all eyes with upper lid TT. (If one eye has
             previously undergone upper lid TT surgery but another eye with upper lid TT has not,
             the patient may be enrolled, and only the latter eye will be counted for the primary
             analyses).
