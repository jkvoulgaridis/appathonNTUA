  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have identified new neurobiological biomarker (i.e. functional connectivity of
      the parietal cortex) of motor learning among healthy people. This enables to refine our
      current model of motor learning wherein specific cortical processes are key factors for motor
      acquisition. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that new technical approaches such as
      repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can efficiently influence this key factor. However, up
      to now, no rTMS studies have target this new biomarker. Therefore, the effect of rTMS are
      unknown. Hence, the investigators want to develop a new rTMS setup able to induce specific
      brain processes in healthy individuals that are likely to benefit. This has the potential to
      obtain critical information in order to improve treatment of motor re-learning in patients
      with neurological diseases.

      Participants will participate in 1 session of neuronavigated (TMS Navigator, Localite,
      Schloss Birlinghoven, D-53757, Sankt Augustin, Germany ) iTBS (patterned form of rTMS)
      coupled with motor learning. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: real
      iTBS over parietal cortex and sham iTBS over the parietal cortex.

      One day before (Day1) and after the motor learning (Day 2), participants will undergo
      high-density 128-channel resting state electroencephalography (EEG) and motor evoked
      potential (MEP) in order to characterize the effects of rTMS on our markers of plasticity.
      Performance on the task will be measure immediately after learning (Day 2) and again 24h
      later (Day 3) in order to test for retention and offline consolidation (time and errors). The
      task will consist in realizing a computerized mirror-drawing task, in which right-left
      movements of the mouse were reversed on the screen.

    <description>Volunteers will be submitted to non-invasive parietal stimulation before a mirror drawing task.
A transcranial magnetic stimulator (MagPro X100, Medtronic Functional Diagnostics, Skovlunde, Denmark) will deliver interrmittent bursts of bipolar magnetic pulses exerting an excitation on the underlying brain tissue (iTBS). The stimulation coil will be placed over the parietal cortex. Stimulation consisted of a burst of three pulses administered at 50Hz, repeated at a frequency of 5Hz, delivered in 2 s trains followed by an 8 s interval for a total of 600 pulses12. Stimulation intensity was set at 70% of RMT.
Each session will consist of two spaced neuronavigated iTBS applications, separated by 15 minutes.</description>
