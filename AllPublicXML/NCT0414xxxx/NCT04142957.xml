  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a widespread condition which causes a poorer
      health status, reduced exercise, and lung function impairment. COPD exacerbations are a
      sustained worsening of symptoms beyond day-to-day variation and are responsible for one in
      eight hospital emergency admissions. Although extensive users of healthcare, people with COPD
      are primarily responsible for their condition 99% of the time and self-management has been
      highlighted as a crucial component for COPD care. To enable greater awareness of changing
      symptoms, a self-management app (COPD Pal) will be created by Bond Digital Health Ltd (BDH)
      to enable people with COPD to input information pertinent to their condition. The aim of COPD
      Pal, which is akin to a paper diary, is to empower patients to take more control of their
      disease and allow them to provide healthcare professionals with accurate, personalised data
      during clinic consultations.

      This project aims to assess the usability and acceptability of COPD Pal using qualitative
      methodology (phase 1). It is proposed that 13-15 people with COPD will be invited to attend a
      focus group and be given COPD Pal (V1) with which to interact. Semi-structured questions will
      then be asked to facilitate conversation regarding their initial experiences of using COPD
      Pal. Focus groups will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and a Thematic Analysis conducted.
      Thematic themes will be provided to BDH, the creators of COPD Pal, with which to develop the
      app further (V2). Thematic themes will be provided to participants to confirm accuracy and
      ensure methodological rigour. A final report will be provided to both research participants
      and to BDH.

      Findings from this research will inform the second phase feasibility study of V2 of COPD Pal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a global problem, with 210 million sufferers
      and 3 million deaths annually. It is predicted to become the third most common cause of death
      worldwide by 2030. There are 1.2 million people with known COPD in the UK, but this is likely
      to be an underestimate. People with COPD have daily symptoms, a poorer health status, reduced
      exercise capacity, and impairment in lung function. A sustained worsening of symptoms above
      day-to-day variation, in response to infection or pollution, is termed an acute exacerbation.
      Exacerbations of COPD are the second most common cause of emergency admission to hospital in
      the UK, being responsible for one in eight (130,000) of the total, as well as 1 million bed
      days and an annual National Health Service (NHS) expenditure of over £500M in 2015.

      Despite people with the condition being extensive users of the NHS, approximately only 1% of
      their time is spent with healthcare professionals. The rest of the time, people with COPD are
      encouraged to self-manage their condition; where, such behaviours include regular exercise,
      taking prescribed medication, being aware of symptoms, and attending healthcare appointments.
      Supporting self-management behaviours has been highlighted as crucial for the care of people
      with COPD. Despite the positive relationship between self-management and health outcomes,
      these behaviours are seldom conducted and adherence to medication is historically low.

      To enable greater awareness of the change of his symptoms (i.e. better self-management), Ian
      Bond - who lives with COPD - created a simple diary which allowed him to identify when he was
      likely to have an exacerbation and thus take preventative action. Creating Bond Digital
      Health Ltd. (BDH; Cardiff, UK; https://bondhealth.co.uk/) he transformed this paper tool into
      a basic electronic diary. This quickly evolved into the development of an easy-to-use smart
      phone app. 'COPD Pal' aims to allow people with COPD to track and manage their condition. It
      enables patients to log symptoms (e.g. COPD assessment Test), wellness (e.g. quality of life
      such as EQ-5D), and medications, to help them become more engaged in their own care.

      Showing their digital health data to a healthcare professional, during the consultation (by
      the patient), can guide communication, and empower the patient to lead their clinic
      appointment, and to become more positively involved in their own care. It should also help
      any healthcare professional in looking at trends and changes (or consistencies) from baseline
      health status which are unique for that patient. It is akin to a patient bringing a paper
      diary to show their healthcare professional the day-to-day variation in their chronic
      disease.

      By improving self-management, illness understanding, and confidence in people with COPD, the
      app allows greater locus of control and hopefully will lead to reduced GP contacts, number
      and length of hospitalisations, and present real and immediate cost-savings to the NHS.

      Welsh Government have funded (Efficiency through Technology Programme (ETTP), Social Research
      Number: 51/2017) a collaborative project between BDH and Hywel Dda University Health Board
      (HDUHB). BDH and their specialist software engineers are developing the prototype, working
      app. HDUHB have been funded (£16,000) to conduct a quantitative clinical trial and patient
      focus groups in the later design phases of the app to investigate suitability and usability,
      and test early feasibility in a real-world setting. It is hoped that such a study could also
      help improve these aspects for future versions of COPD Pal.

      This project describes the Clinical Phase 1, focus groups and aims to answer the research
      question: 'how do people with COPD experience the usability and acceptability of the COPD Pal
      app?'

    <description>The investigators will invite 13-15 participants to attend the focus groups, of which it is expected that 10-12 to attend. Participants will be asked to bring a smart phone. An Informed Consent Form will be signed by the participant and a delegated researcher before the focus groups begin.
The current generation of COPD Pal will be downloaded onto the participants' own smart phones (see Appendix 1 for current screenshots of app), participants will then be explained the purpose of the app, and asked to interact with it for 15-60 minutes, as required.
A semi-structured focus group will then be conducted with the participants to facilitate conversation and discussion regarding COPD Pal. Once introductions have been completed, questions will be asked relating to the usability and acceptability of COPD Pal (see the Interview Schedule, Appendix 2). The focus group will last 30-60 minutes, as required.</description>
