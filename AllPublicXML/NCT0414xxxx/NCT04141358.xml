  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemodialysis is a renal replacement therapy that can be introduced to patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to help them maintain a good healthy life. The patient's blood
      is pumped through a dialysis machine to remove excess fluid, salt and waste, then it is
      pumped back into the patient's circulation system. In order to carry out haemodialysis,
      vascular access (VA) is required to connect the patient to the dialysis machine. Patients
      have only three options of vascular access: arteriovenous fistula (AVF), an anastomosis
      between a native vein and an artery; arteriovenous graft (AVG), a connection between a
      synthetic tube and native blood vessels; and (3) central line, a cuffed catheter placed in a
      large neck vein. Arteriovenous fistulas are the preferred method for VA because of their
      longevity and causing the least number of complications. Although there are a number of
      factors that may increase the probability of AVF failure rate such as age and gender of the
      patient, poor native vessel structure, medications and the level of surgical experience,
      30-40% of new AVFs fail to mature for unknown reasons. For an AVF to become functionally
      mature postoperative, remodelling and dilation of the native artery and vein are essential to
      accommodate significantly increased blood flow. However, pre-existing diseases in patients
      with ESRD such as arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction may impair AVF and preclude
      dialysis. It has been asserted that the lack of AVF success is attributable to insufficient
      arterial dilation because of poor arterial wall elasticity.

      The study aims to investigate the role of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in
      predicting AVF outcome using novel non-invasive ultrasound applications: 2D shear wave
      elastography and 2D strain speckle tracking will be employed to assess arterial stiffness,
      while an intraoperative flow-mediated dilation (FMD) technique will be used to evaluate
      endothelial dysfunction.

      This is an observational prospective pilot study of patients with end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD), who will be referred for AVF procedure.

      Duration: 21 Months The research team will collect data from the patients after they have
      signed the informed consent form. Data collection will take place before, during and after
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) surgery.

      At 0 week, the patient will be interviewed to obtain clinical information. Also, blood
      pressure and body mass index will be checked and recorded. Next, pre-operative AVF assessment
      ultrasound measurements will be performed to assess flow, pulsatility and vessel diameter.
      Advanced ultrasound applications(2D strain speckle tracking and 2D Shear wave elastography)
      will be applied to assess arterial stiffness as additional measurement tools. These are
      quantitative measures of vessel stiffness. It takes less than five minutes to obtain these
      measurements from the imaged vessel.

      During AVF surgery, the endothelial function will be assessed intraoperatively by testing the
      ability of the endothelium to dilate, flow mediation dilation (FMD). Leftover vessel
      specimens will be collected for histopathological analysis purpose.

      At 6 week, post-AVF ultrasound assessment will be conducted to assess the maturation of AVF
      by measuring ultrasound parameters of blood flow, pulsatility and vessel diameter. Arterial
      stiffness parameters will be measured as well. Blood pressure and BMI will be assessed and
      recorded.

      Study data will be entered into a study database which will consist of a password encrypted
      stored on a password-protected computer in the vascular lab at Hammersmith Hospital. Only the
      study researchers will know the study database password.

      Data analysis will be performed after the enrolment of 20, 40 and 75 patients.
