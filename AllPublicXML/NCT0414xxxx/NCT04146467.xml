      This is a prospective, multi-center, multi-phase, evaluator-blinded study of subjects
      undergoing a procedure to improve the appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental
      region. All study subjects will be treated with the Apyx Plasma/RF Device.

      Phase I (n=20) of this study will be conducted primarily to provide safety data, however,
      effectiveness data will also be collected at the above stated timepoints through 6 months
      post-procedure.

      Phase II (n=32) of this study is the expansion of the study to a pivotal study.

    <description>The Apyx Plasma/RF Handpiece is a sterile, single use electrosurgical (monopolar) device intended to be used in conjunction with compatible generators for the percutaneous delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma for cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. Radiofrequency energy is delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize the electrode. When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated for soft tissue cutting, coagulation or ablation. The Apyx Plasma/RF Handpiece has a non-extendable electrode to generate helium plasma.</description>
