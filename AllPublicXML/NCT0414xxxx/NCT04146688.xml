  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musical interventions improve the emotional state of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      while having a positive impact on the caregiver's well-being. However, the factors that could
      be responsible for this positive effect remain unknown. Among these, the sensory-motor
      synchronization (SMS) of movements to the musical rhythm, frequently observed during musical
      activities and possible up to the advanced stages of AD, could modulate the emotional state.
      Several recent studies have shown that rhythmic training (or SMS) influences the organism at
      the motor, cognitive and social levels while activating the cerebral reward circuit. This
      action that generates pleasure also facilitates non-verbal emotional expression. However, the
      conditions that modulate SMS and their relationship to nonverbal communication, emotional,
      behavioral and cognitive state have not yet been studied in healthy or pathological elderly.

    <description>The SSM is measured with an innovative tool (Music Balance Board) developed at the University of Ghent (Belgium) and specially designed to record the movements of the elderly in a natural and comfortable position This chair is equipped with a tablet and sensors that record the movements of the hand and body during the SSM to a musical sequence. The analysis will focus on the difference between the participant's striking and the beat of the music measured using this chair.</description>
