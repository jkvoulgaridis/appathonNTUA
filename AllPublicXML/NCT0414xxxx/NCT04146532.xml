  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the drug aspirin has effects on emotional
      reactivity, emotional memory, and risk-taking behaviors.

      The goal of this study is to determine if aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) alters emotional
      reactions to emotion evoking pictures as well as memory for them. Using a double-blind
      parallel arm study, participants will receive either placebo or a pain-relieving dose of
      aspirin (500mg). One hour later they will complete 30 minutes of tasks. This will include
      ratings of emotional pictures and memory for them. The paradigm is similar to previous
      experiments done in this lab using other cyclooxygenase inhibitors: ibuprofen and
      acetaminophen (Durso, Luttrell, &amp; Way, 2015; Psychological Science,
      https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797615570366). Risk taking on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task will
      also be assessed. Participants will be healthy young adult males at Ohio State University.
