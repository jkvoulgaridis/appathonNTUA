  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the differences between patient's and their physicians'
      perception of quality of life and the effect of disease severity and co-morbidities. Patients
      and physicians will complete two sets of questionnaires at an initial clinic visit and again
      six months later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is a progressive and debilitating disease characterized by
      progressive scarring of the lung parenchyma of unknown cause. In the US approximately 100,000
      individuals have been diagnosed with this disease and the only cure available is lung
      transplantation. There have been two drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of IPF which
      have demonstrated the ability to slow disease progression but have no impact on quality of
      life.

      Symptoms of IPF include shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue which all contribute to a
      decreased quality of life. Additionally, these symptoms and the need for supplemental oxygen
      use causes significant psychological and social impairment. Multiple questionnaires have been
      used to measure patient reported quality of life in both clinical and research settings. The
      King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD) Questionnaire is a disease-specific patient
      reported outcome measure and has been validated across several different patient groups and
      countries. Additionally, the EuroQol group has developed the EuroQol five dimensional 5-Level
      (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire which is a non-disease specific assessment of health-related quality
      of life and has not yet been widely used in a population of patients with IPF.

      Significant disparity between patient and physician perception of quality of life has been
      demonstrated across different disease processes. While there are many contributing factors to
      overall wellbeing the general assumption is that with more advanced disease quality of life
      predictably decreases. The investigators plan to test this hypothesis to better understand
      the complex relationship between chronic disease and quality of life in patients with IPF.

        All participants in this study will hold a diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
        as detailed above. As IPF occurs only in adults all subjects must be 18 years of age or
        older. Both men and women will be recruited for the study. Subjects of all ethnicities and
        racial minorities will be recruited. Physicians who are seeing these patients for regular
        clinical visits during the study will also be included.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a multidisciplinary diagnosis of IPF according to the 2018
             ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Clinical Practice Guidelines.

          -  All ranges of disease severity based on pulmonary function testing: forced vital
             capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity (DLCO).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any impairment or co-morbid disease that results in an inability to read or understand
             a questionnaire or provide informed consent. The study team member will make this
             determination according to their best clinical judgement.

          -  The questionnaires will be administered in English language only and thus this study
             will be conducted in patients who are able to read, write, and speak English language.
