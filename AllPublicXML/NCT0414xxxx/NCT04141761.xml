  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to further the understanding of environmental factors that underlie the
      development of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the post-onset disease trajectory. Dysbiosis,
      defined as alterations in intestinal microbiota composition and function, has been
      hypothesized to increase the risk of developing T1D in those with genetic susceptibility.
      Dysbiosis may result from modern dietary habits, such as broad consumption of the highly
      processed Western Diet, or by widespread use of antibiotics. Here, the investigators propose
      to examine the impact of dysbiosis on the endogenous innate inflammatory state that
      potentiates T1D progression. The investigators hypothesize that probiotic-induced alterations
      in the intestinal microbiota may favorably alter the post-onset disease state.

    <description>Investigators will examine the effect of multistrain probiotic supplementation on the endogenous innate inflammatory state in youth newly diagnosed with T1D, as measured by plasma-induced transcription analysis. The investigators hypothesize that the participants receiving the probiotic will have less inflammation (as measured by transcriptional analysis) than the participants in the placebo group.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years (duration of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the effect of multistrain probiotic supplementation on changes to the plasma-induced transcriptional assay to assess for probiotic-specific immune effects. Plasma-induced transcriptional analyses will be compared before and after treatment with probiotic/placebo. The investigators hypothesize that the participants receiving the probiotic will see reduced inflammation (as measured by transcriptional analysis) while those that received the placebo will see no change or increased inflammation.</description>

    <description>Gut leakiness will be measured by examining the levels of microbial antigens in the plasma before and after treatment and correlating these antigen levels with the changes in the composition of the gut bacteria. It is hypothesized that changes in antigen levels and gut bacteria will only be seen in the participants receiving the probiotic. It is further hypothesized that those with the greatest reduction in antigens will have the most significant changes in gut bacteria composition.</description>
