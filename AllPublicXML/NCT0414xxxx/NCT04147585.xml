  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how an Intermittent Calorie Reduced Diet (IRCD) that
      mimics fasting effects inflammation in patients with mild to moderate Crohn's disease (CD).
      The diet may allow users to receive the benefits of fasting while also being able to enjoy
      food (the ingredients of which are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). Research on dietary interventions and CD are very limited. Diets that
      mimick fasting have been studied with support of the National Institute of Health and
      published in leading journals. This research investigates whether markers of inflammation
      decrease and/or quality of life increases after five-day periods of the IRCD, and may provide
      rationale for its use to treat CD.
