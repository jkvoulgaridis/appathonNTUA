    <textblock>
      The Supporting Habit Formation to Attenuate Prefrailty in Elders (SHAPE) Pilot Study is a
      randomized control study. The main objective of this pilot study is to determine the
      feasibility of using Habit Formation (HF) treatment to increase Physical Activity (PA)
      (reduction in daily in hours of sedentary time), and dietary among prefrail African
      Americans. We hypothesize: (1)The SHAPE study will demonstrate good feasibility with a high
      recruitment rate and successful administration all of the measures among the target
      population; (2) Treatment group participants will demonstrate greater increases in primary
      outcomes (physical activity level and dietary quality) and secondary outcomes (quality of
      life, depressive symptoms, prefrailty reduction, lower extremity strength and balance,
      physical activity level, waist circumference, and weight at intervention completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty signifies a decline in physical, cognitive and/or psychosocial reserve that reduces
      an older adult's ability to respond to or recover from stressors (e.g., acute illness) and
      contributes to early morbidity and mortality. Nearly half of all older adults are prefrail,
      and prefrailty status increases the risk of becoming frail. Frailty is more prevalent among
      African Americans and occurs earlier in life when compared to European Americans. Older
      African Americans in the US, face significant challenges in adhering to frailty reduction
      treatment such as increasing physical activity (PA) and adopt a healthy diet. Those
      challenges include poverty, accelerated aging, higher levels of activities of daily living
      disability, and less access to safe opportunities for PA or healthy food. The situation is
      even worse for urban-dwelling older African Americans, who often reside in neighborhoods
      replete with physical and social stressors (e.g., derelict infrastructure or crime) that
      intersect with the vulnerabilities of aging, to further complicate their efforts to engage in
      frailty protective behaviors. Despite this, frailty interventions overwhelmingly exclude
      African Americans, thereby limiting generalizability to this high-risk group.

      Therefore, the rationale of this study is to test the feasibility of a novel habit formation
      (HF) intervention to facilitate frailty protective behaviors in prefrail African Americans
      ages 55 and older in a randomized control trial study. The HF intervention targets two main
      health behaviors: decrease sedentary time (ST) and improve dietary quality. The intervention
      consists of 12 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. In each session, an occupational therapist
      will deliver educational content, and use HF techniques and behavioral skills to facilitate
      frailty protective behaviors. Forty-eight prefrail African American adults will be randomized
      to the treatment or control group. The baseline evaluation will be conducted before
      randomization and the follow-up evaluation after the last treatment session. For the
      treatment group participants, we will further evaluation occupational activity
      performance/satisfaction and habit formation strength within treatment sessions.

      The main goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of HF intervention among prefrail
      African American adults. The main hypothesis is: the SHAPE study will demonstrate good
      feasibility with (1) high recruitment rate (recruit 48 participants over 6 months), (2)
      treatment group participants will show preliminary efficacy in primary outcomes such as
      reducing sedentary time (measured by the ActivPal device) and increasing dietary quality
      score (measured by Healthy Eating Index [HEI]) at intervention completion compared to
      controls. The secondary hypothesis is: treatment group participants will demonstrate
      preliminary efficacy in secondary outcomes such as increased quality of life (measured by the
      Cardiovascular Health Study frailty criteria), reduced depressive symptoms (Geriatric
      Depression Short form), prefrailty reduction (The Fried's Frailty Criteria Index), increased
      lower extremity strength and balance (Short Physical Performance Battery), increased physical
      activity level (The Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors), reduced waist
      circumference and weight at intervention completion compare to controls.

    <description>The COPM is self-perception of occupational performance in the areas of self-care, productivity and leisure. The COPM is administered using a semi-structured interview in which the client identifies significant issues in daily activities which are causing difficulty. The importance of each activity, as perceived by the client, is first rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). In the next step the client selects the five most important activities, which are then rated on a 10-point scale for performance, ranging from 1 (not at all able) to 10 (able to perform extremely well), and for satisfaction, ranging from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied). Increased performance/satisfaction score from follow-up to baseline represents improved performance/satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The modified self-reported habit index (SRHI) is a 4-item assessment assesses habit strength, frequency, relevance to self-identity, and automaticity. Items are self-rated with a seven-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree). Total score ranges from 4 to 28, where higher scores indicate stronger the habit is. During 9 treatment sessions (the 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 treatment sessions), 2-4 habits regarding physical activity and diet will be assessed individually with the modified SRHI. Post-test of each habit will be assessed again after 2 weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants in the treatment group will be asked to meet with an occupational therapist in their home weekly over 12 weeks. Each session takes an hour. In the first session, the occupational therapist will introduce the program. In session 2, the therapist will discuss pain and pain management with the participant. In session 3-12, the therapist will help the participant to develop physical activity and healthy eating habits. In each session the participant will pick two healthy behaviors to turn them into a habit. The therapist will give the participant a workbook and teach the participant to track his/her progress. The focus of session 3-5 will be physical activity, and session 6-11 will be healthy eating. In the last session (session 12), the therapist will wrap up the program and help the participant to develop a maintenance plan.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive newsletters focused on general healthy aging topics over 12 weeks. With the exception of two, 1-page handouts covering PA and dietary recommendations, the weekly content will not overlap with the treatment content. Within 4 days of mailing the newsletter, a trained research assistant (RA) will call the participant, verify receipt of the newsletter, and ask them if they have any questions about the materials. The phone call will last ~15 minutes. Control condition participants receive no further intervention.</description>
