  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) impacts 1 in 10 pregnancies; hyperglycemia and
      hypertriglyceridemia are common features of the condition. Women are recommended to do at
      least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week during pregnancy and the
      postpartum period. Exercise both during and out of pregnancy has been shown to be an
      effective non-pharmacologic tool to reduce glucose and lipid profiles. The goals and purpose
      of this pilot study is to 1) determine the influence of exercise and the timing of exercise
      surrounding a meal on glucose and lipid metabolism in pregnant women with GDM and 2)
      determine the feasibility of low-resistance and aerobic activity and measuring exercise
      metrics during pregnancy. The overarching objective of this study is to determine the effects
      of low-resistance and aerobic exercise on glucose and lipids following a meal in pregnant
      women with GDM.

      metrics during pregnancy. The overarching objective of this study is to determine the effects
      of low-resistance and aerobic exercise on glucose and lipids following a meal in pregnant
      women with GDM. Women will perform either low-resistance or aerobic exercise. Blood will be
      taken before and 2 hours after a fixed meal. For safety, women will have supervised exercise
      and oxygen consumption will be measured throughout the activity.
