  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the potential for patiromer-facilitated use of higher doses of
      mineralocorticoid antagonists in addition to standard care (compared to standard care alone)
      to improve congestion, well-being and mortality in people who have worsening congestion due
      to heart failure and hyperkalaemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with worsening congestive heart failure may benefit from treatment with higher doses
      of MRA if they are administered patiromer to treat or prevent hyperkalaemia.

      Potential participants with worsening heart failure will be identified by their care teams
      and asked to participate in a research registry. If eligible, registry participants will be
      asked to take part in the RELIEHF randomised trial.

      The randomised trial will investigate whether patiromer allows patients with worsening heart
      failure to be titrated to higher doses of MRA (predominantly spironolactone). Participants
      assigned to patiromer may be titrated to 200mg/day spironolactone or the highest licensed
      dose of eplerenone (50mg/day). Participants who are not assigned to patiromer should have
      titration to guideline-recommended doses of MRA attempted.

      The registry and trial will take place in about 100 secondary care sites across the UK. At
      the end of the trial, participants will be followed through their electronic medical records
      via record linkage for up to 10 years

        D. For Randomisation

          1. Serum potassium &gt;5.0mmol/L

               -  Patients with a serum potassium &gt;5.0mmol/L may be randomised immediately unless
                  they have severe hyperkalaemia requiring, in the investigators opinion,
                  intravenous treatment or a potassium binding agent.

               -  Severe hyperkalaemia should be managed according to the UK Renal Association
                  guidelines of 2014
                  (https://renal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hyperkalaemia-guideline-1.pdf).
                  Participants may be reconsidered for the trial once such interventions are no
                  longer considered necessary.

               -  Patients with a serum potassium ≤5.0mmol/L should be initiated on spironolactone
                  or have the dose increased up to 100mg/day and randomised only if serum potassium
                  exceeds 5.0mmol/L. Those intolerant of or unwilling to take spironolactone should
                  be offered eplerenone titrated to a maximum dose of 50mg/day.

               -  A run-in period of up to 35 days is permitted (the run-in period will usually
                  occur during hospitalisation or a course of day-care or intense management).

          2. After ingestion of a test-dose of patiromer,

               1. the patient is willing to continue in the trial

               2. the investigator considers the patient can follow instructions on preparing
                  patiromer

                       agents such as loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor
                       blockers, beta-blockers and sacubitril-valsartan may be adjusted to allow
                       eGFR to increase)

                    2. Systolic BP &lt;90mmHg

                    3. Uncorrected valve disease as the main cause of heart failure in the
