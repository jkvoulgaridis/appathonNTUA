  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial will test whether the combination of DaraRd (daratumumab + lenalidomide +
      dexamethasone) as induction therapy, followed by DRVd (daratumumab + lenalidomide +
      bortezomib + dexamethasone) consolidation therapy, if needed, will result in more patients
      achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, relative to the standard of care.
      Consolidation therapy will be administered only to those patients with MRD-positive status
      after induction therapy.

      This is a study based on adaptive design for decision making of treatment options. Duration
      of therapy (daratumumab cycles) will depend on individual approach, response, evidence of
      disease progression and tolerance.
