  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most devastating nontraumatic cerebral vascular
      diseases. Its exacerbation is often related to a mass effect because of hematoma formation
      and edema in the perihematoma, which plays a key role in disease deterioration. Perihematoma
      edema is an important contributor to brain injuries secondary to ICH and one of the risk
      factors that leads to disease deterioration and high mortality. Brain edema following ICH was
      believed to be induced by the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and ischemia and hypoxia
      of the perihematoma.

      Normobaric oxygen (NBO) therapy is a treatment that delivers high-flow oxygen at normobaric
      pressure through a facemask to supplement the oxygen supply,which maintain the oxygen
      concentration of typically 40-100% ,can increase the arterial oxygen content, and alleviate
      tissue hypoxia. NBO therapy has been shown to provide neuroprotection against ischemic stroke
      in an experimental study and a clinical trial. To the best of our knowledge, the potential of
      NBO therapy for neuroprotection against human hemorrhagic stroke has not been investigated.

      There are two studies about NBO interventions in the rat model of intracerebral
      hemorrhage.The one showed NBO did not worsen hemorrhage severity or brain edema. There were
      no significant differences in hemorrhagic blood volumes or brain water content. NBO did not
      affect any of the neurological outcome tests in the primary or secondary studies. Another one
      showed NBO groups improved NSSs,decreased contents of brain water, HIF-1α and VEGF, and fewer
      apoptotic cells in the perihematoma at 72 h after ICH compared with the ICH control group.
      These results suggest that NBO therapy with oxygen delivered at 90% conferred best
      neuroprotection to ICH rats, potentially through amelioration of brain edema by suppressing
      HIF-1α and VEGF expression in the perihematoma.

      But there is no clinical study on the safety and efficacy of NBO in patients with
      intracerebral hemorrhage.NBO has the advantages of simple operation, non-invasiveness and
      early application, which makes it have great application prospects in the treatment of ICH.
