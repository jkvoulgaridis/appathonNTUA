    <textblock>
      This study combined the insomnia syndrome with PSG, fMRI, neuroactive substance detection,
      and infrared heat map, observing the electrophysiological changes of insomnia patients with
      different syndromes,localizing brain function excitation zone and changes in neuroactive
      substances,and the response of the visceral function to the infrared Image，which reveal the
      biological material basis of insomnia syndrome, and analyze it's correlation with infrared
      Image, providing a scientific, objective and visual technical method for TCM diagnosis and
      treatment of insomnia.

    <textblock>
      Insomnia belongs to the category of &quot;Bu Mei&quot; in Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM). Long-term
      insomnia can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, senile dementia,
      anxiety, and depression. Therefore, the insomnia sparked a heated discussion in medical
      research.

      It has a good effect in treating insomnia with TCM,but there are problems such as strong
      subjectivity of syndrome differentiation and large difference in efficacy between doctors.

      The previous study found that the infrared Image reflects the visceral function of insomnia
      patients to a certain extent.Modern studies have shown that insomnia is closely related to
      the dysfunction of functional coordination between the brain's sleep and the arousal center,
      and neuroactive substances played an important role on it.&quot;Syndrome&quot; is the key of clinical
      diagnosis and treatment of TCM. Investigators believe that the central nervous system
      imbalance of different syndrome of insomnia has a certain correlation with the infrared
      Image.
