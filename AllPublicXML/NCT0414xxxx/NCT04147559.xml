    <textblock>
      Sponsor is conducting this post market clinical study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of its PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic Femoral Stem. This type of study is required
      by regulatory authorities for all devices that have been approved in Europe (EU) to evaluate
      the medium and long-term clinical evidence. This study has been designed in accordance with
      MEDDEV2.12/2 (European Medical Device Vigilance System) rev2 and ISO (International
      Organization of Standardization) 14155:2011 guidelines.

    <measure>Component Survivorship</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to estimate component survivorship of the PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic Femoral Stem using Kaplan Meier method out to 10 years follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the cumulative revision rate at specified intervals out to 10 years follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of hips that were revised or replaced at each of the intervals for Year 1, Year 3, Year 5, Year 7 and Year 10 evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete characterization (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) of functional scores out to 10 years as assessed by HOOS.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be reporting the final Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) which ranges from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating worst hip symptoms and 100 indicating no hip symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete characterization (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) of functional scores out to 10 years as assessed by EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L data will be summarized over 5 domains, namely, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 5 levels: no problems, slight problem, moderate problem, severe problem, inability to perform the activity. With no problems being the best outcome and inability to perform the activity being worst outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine proportion of subjects being satisfied and level of their satisfaction as assessed by the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS).</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be reporting forgotten joint score measures for the assessment of joint-specific patient reported outcomes. The questions focus on the patients' awareness of the implanted joint in everyday life or any unintended perception of a joint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine proportion of subjects being satisfied and level of their satisfaction as assessed by the Satisfaction Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction Survey consists of questions asked about how satisfied the patient is with the new implant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the presence of zones of radiolucencies surrounding the implanted femoral stem</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Radiolucencies are described around 7 zones and will be reporting the number of hips with radiolucencies present at a given zone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize adverse events and adverse device effects</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events will be summarized as the total number of Adverse Events (AE), Adverse Device Effects (ADE) by grade, severity, and relationship to the device and surgery. Number of patients experiencing such AEs and ADEs will also be provided.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Has previously undergone or currently has determined to undergo primary THA with the
        specified combination of components: PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic Stem combined with other
        Wright Medical Technologies (WMT) or MPO THA components including acetabular shells,
        acetabular liners and femoral heads.

        2. Has previously undergone or currently has been determined to undergo a primary THA for
        any of the following:

          -  non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis, avascular
             necrosis, ankylosis, protrusio acetabuli, and painful hip dysplasia;

          1. Implanted with non-MPO or non-WMT components (femoral heads, acetabular shells,
             acetabular liners)

          2. Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of implantation

          3. Has or had an overt infection at the time of implantation

             absorption apparent on roentgenogram at the time of implantation

          6. Has or had inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or
             inadequate abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint
             which would make the procedure unjustifiable

          7. Has or had neuropathic joints

          8. Has or had hepatitis or HIV infection

          9. Has or had a neurological or musculoskeletal disease that may adversely affect gait or
             weight-bearing

         10. Has had a revision procedure(s) where other treatments or devices have failed; and
             treatment of fractures that are unmanageable using other techniques

         11. Currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the endpoints
             of this protocol

         12. Unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document

         13. Has documented substance abuse issue

         14. Has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability or
             willingness to participate in the study

         15. Currently incarcerated or has impending incarceration

         16. Has a medical condition, as judged by the investigator, that would interfere with the
