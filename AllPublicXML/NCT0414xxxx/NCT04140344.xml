  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-blind, randomized, controlled study is to assess the efficacy of
      &quot;informative text messages&quot; vs &quot;traditional handouts&quot; provided to lumbar spine surgery
      patients post-operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 448 adult patients (18 years or older) undergoing spinal fusion surgery at Duke
      University Hospital, will be recruited from the Duke Department of Neurosurgery and the Duke
      Department of Orthopedics. Participants will be consented and will complete standard of care
      outcomes questionnaires (Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Index and Euro-Quol 5D)
      at the pre-operative clinic visit for baseline comparison. Participants will be randomized,
      through REDCap, with equal probability to either: A) the control group, with standard
      post-surgery handouts, or B) the experimental group, which will receive text messages for a
      period of 2 weeks after surgery (daily for the first week, and every other day for the second
      week). Text messages were designed to be standardized and automated, with an embedded link to
      a video regarding at-home, post-surgery-care instructions. Patients will be directed not to
      respond to the text messages, but to call for any questions or concerns. The primary outcome
      will be a reduction in 30-days post-surgery readmission rates. The secondary outcomes will be
      a reduction in 30-days post-surgery ED visits rates, back and leg pain scores, and anxiety
      levels. These outcomes will be assessed via a phone interview at 30-days (up to max of 37
      days) post-discharge for both groups.

    <intervention_model_description>Following baseline assessments, subjects will be randomized with equal probability to one of two arms: 1). The experimental arm, which will receive automated standardized text messages at predetermined intervals, occurring daily the first week post-operatively and gradually tapering over the second week; 2). The control arm - where subjects will not receive any scheduled contact (outside of standard of care phone interactions). All subjects will receive a phone call 30 days (up to 37 days) post-discharge in order to complete the study questionnaires.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be told they will receive appropriate information about their spine surgery (including instructions on proper wound care, mobility, and signs and symptoms of infection) in general, either through phone calls, text messages and/or handouts, without specifying the difference between the control and the intervention group.</masking_description>

    <description>The intervention group will receive automated text messages every day for the first week, and every other day for the second week post-operatively. The text messages will follow a series of pre-defined standardized scripts (Appendix 3) with embedded hyperlinks to a video from the providers with further advice. The patient is directed not to respond to the text messages, but to call for any questions or concerns. The text message group will receive a 30-day post-operative phone call to evaluate: number of ED visits, hospital readmissions, and to re-administer the questionnaires completed at baseline visit. Other data to be collected may include the following: number of phone calls to provider, MyChart messages to provider, pain medications, and new problems like pain and infection.</description>
