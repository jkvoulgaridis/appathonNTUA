  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of newly diagnosed participants with
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 (naive participants) with virologic response at Week
      48-defined as HIV-1 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50 copies/milliliter (mL) (Food And
      Drug Administration snapshot) - after the implementation of the Test &amp; Treat model of care
      and in a historical cohort.
