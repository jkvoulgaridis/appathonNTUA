  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, the research team of KU Leuven and UGent started a pilot project supported by Kom op
      Tegen Kanker, called CONTACT-1. This multicentre before-after study aims at developing,
      implementing and evaluating a care pathway for patients treated with oral anticancer drugs
      (OACD) in four oncology centres in Flanders (AZ Groeninge Kortrijk, AZ Imelda Bonheiden, AZ
      Maria Middelares Gent, AZ Turnhout).

      Preliminary results from CONTACT-1 have shown that re-organisation of care processes, and
      better interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, are highly needed, and that working
      towards a care pathway is an appropriate method to achieve this. However, the development and
      implementation of the care pathway in each hospital was difficult and needed intensive
      coaching by the research team. Moreover, we have currently no insight in the impact of the
      care pathway on defined outcomes, neither on the sustainability of the implemented care
      pathway.

      In CONTACT-2, we will expand the development and implementation of a care pathway to 10
      additional oncology centres in Flanders. In contrast to CONTACT-1, the CONTACT-2 oncology
      centres will take the lead in the development, implementation and evaluation of the care
      pathway, supported by the research team en by the CONTACT-Toolkit. This toolkit was developed
      based on the experiences from CONTACT-1 and international guidelines on the implementation of
      care pathways/complex interventions.

      Similar to CONTACT-1, we hypothesise that the implementation of a care pathway will improve
      the level of self-management and the quality of patient-centred care, and will increase
      adherence, patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life. Next, we hypothesise that
      the care pathway will improve counselling practice, interdisciplinary collaboration,
      self-efficacy and self-confidence of healthcare professionals (HCP). The impact of a care
      pathway on the above outcomes in patients as well as in HCPs will be investigated by means of
      various assessments, that have been selected by the research team based on their experiences
      from CONTACT-1. Moreover, we hypothesize that the development and implementation process will
      be more efficient in the CONTACT-2 oncology centres, who will need less intensive support of
      the research team, due to the CONTACT-Toolkit. A process evaluation will be conducted to test
      this last hypothesis.

      Further in-depth analysis of the impact of the care pathway, combined with a thorough process
      evaluation, should eventually lead to insight in the crucial factors for sustainable
      implementation of a care pathway, as well as to definite conclusions on its impact for
      patients and HCPs.

      Throughout CONTACT-2, the CONTACT-toolkit will be further elaborated, optimised and digitised
      based on the experiences of the research team and feedback from the CONTACT-2 oncology
      centres. The toolkit will enable a nation-wide and sustainable implementation of similar care
      pathways for patients treated with OACD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective interventional multicentre before-after study with a total
      duration of 36 months and will be coordinated by a consortium of researchers from UGent and
      KU Leuven supported by Kom op Tegen Kanker. The intervention is the self-directed development
      and implementation of a care pathway in ten hospitals in Flanders.

      The general lead throughout the study will be the 7-phase model for the development of a care
      pathway, which is translated to the specific context of OACD in the CONTACT-Toolkit. This
      methodology aims to offer a systematic approach for the support of an interdisciplinary team
      in the development of new care pathways or in the improvement of existing ones.

      The CONTACT-Toolkit will serve as a roadmap that will guide the participating hospitals
      through the various phases and will therefore enable the self-directed development and
      implementation of the care pathway. Besides an overall guidance through the different phases
      of the 7-phase model, the toolkit contains additional tools including: presentations to
      structure internal meetings, tools and methods to map current practice, tools to measure key
      performance indicators, tools to support the development of a care pathway and tools to
      support counselling of patients treated with OACD (e.g. guide for telephone follow-up, guide
      for counselling at the start of the treatment).

      In phase 1 and 2, a project structure is set up in each participating hospital by appointing
      a local coordinator and project team for the development of the care pathway. In phase 3, a
      detailed mapping of the current care process, which serves as before-study, will take place.
      Current practice will be evaluated from four different perspectives: own organisation and
      team, patients, external partners and independent observer. Assessments are performed by
      means of validated questionnaires and observations of daily practice by the research team. In
      phase 4, the care pathway will be developed by the project team, with respect to the results
      obtained from the mapping of current practice. During this phase, the research team will also
      provide training (i.e. e-learning, live training sessions) to all participating HCPs, to
      expand their medical knowledge on OACD and to improve counselling skills. The actual
      implementation of the care pathway is foreseen in phase 5. In phase 6, an evaluation of the
      care will be performed from the same four perspectives as in phase 3. This evaluation will
      include validated questionnaires, an interview with the coordinator, a focus group with the
      project team and participating HCPs and a second round of observations using a checklist and
      time task matrix of the care pathway document. In phase 7, the research team will take the
      necessary steps to guarantee the continuous follow-up of the care pathway without their
      further support.

      To assess the impact of the care pathway on the level of the patient and the HCP, data
      obtained from the assessments in phase 3 (i.e. before-group) and 6 (i.e. after-group) will be
      compared. Furthermore, a process evaluation will be performed.

    <description>A care pathway is a complex intervention for the mutual decision-making and organisation of care processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period. Care pathways can be used to optimise care processes when problems arise on communication, coordination, standardisation and monitoring of care for a specific group of patients. A care pathway for patients treated with OACD, should therefore consist of all relevant sustainable interventions that cover the continuum of the medicines' pathway with the aim to support self-management (e.g. consultations with doctors, contact moments with nurses, telephone follow-up, ...). The role of each stakeholder in the different interventions should be well-described including communication strategies between HCPs from primary and secondary care.</description>
