  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to establish more information about hyperbaric oxygen therapy
      for this group of patients, and give us more information of how to initiate the best possible
      main study. Can we find any indications that support the use of this therapy for patients
      suffering from chronic disability after cerebral infarction? Can we improve physical and
      cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot project including 6 patients for one session of 20 treatments of hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy. The objective is to establish knowledge of HBO for this group of patients in
      a Norwegian context, so that we can prepare for the main study afterwards, including about
      60-70 patients. We need to know how to optimize the administrative and technical systems for
      the larger study. We want to collect feedback from the patients undergoing the pilot study.
      We want more information about the treatment table, if 20 treatments are enough, if 2,4 bar
      pressure is adequate. The treatment table is based on existing research, and is considered
      safe.

      The patients are to be treated at table 14/90, at 2,4 Absolute atmospheres, and daly 90
      minutes of oxygen inhalation (medical oxygen).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved physical and cognitive function in activities of daily living.</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The project's physiotherapist and ergo therapist from Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) are responsible for examining physical function and the participant's ability to acquire and use knowledge, as well as function in everyday living activities (ADL). Three measurements are made before starting treatment (establishing a baseline), where the third measurement is done on the same day as treatment starts to eliminate changes in test results as a result of learning the tests. Measurements are also made immediately after the end of treatment, as well as follow-up measurements after 6 and 12 months. Descriptions below.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>This test is very widely used to provide a quick and validated test of strength, balance and coordination. The test has a roof effect, so it is not suitable for capturing very small and subtle self-perceived disturbances in function. The test is very sensitive to change in the target group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>There is a recognized and validated connection between general function and health and grip strength, as well as between grip strength and life span. Grip strength changes as other function changes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>A major problem after stroke and in many brain disorders is fatigue. Fatigue leads to reduced foxing and thus loss of function. The test is believed to be able to detect changes that are relevant to everyday life function and social participation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>COPM is designed to help people identify and prioritize activity problems, as well as evaluate activity performance and satisfaction with activity execution. In an interview, the person is asked to describe activities they consider important but find it difficult to perform. Among the aforementioned challenges, the person is asked to prioritize a maximum of five activities he / she wants to be able to perform better after the end of treatment. Then, the person is asked to score the current performance and satisfaction with the current performance of priority activities. The score scale is from 1-10 where 10 indicates very good workmanship or high satisfaction. After the interview, partial scores for execution (COPM-U) and satisfaction (COPM-T) are calculated. A change score of 3 points is considered a clinically important change. COPM has shown good measurement properties, among other things for participants with stroke and the elderly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>ARAT is a tool designed to assess motor function in the arm after stroke. The tasks in the test reflect daily activities and the patient's ability to perform them. The test contains 19 sub-tasks in which different grips (five-finger grips, cylinder grips, tweezers grips), as well as gross motor skills are specifically assessed. In each of the 19 tasks, a score is given from 0-3, where high scores indicate good arm function. The total score (0-57) is the sum of the sub-scores. The test has shown promising measurement properties. For participants in the chronic and subacute phase after stroke, a change of 5.7 points (10%) is considered clinically important. Norwegian guidelines will be used in the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>0+6+12 months after end of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>NHPT is a simple test of fine motor skills that is recommended, among other things, for participants with stroke. Scoring is based on the time the patient spends in placing and removing nine small pieces in nine holes. Total time (maximum 50 seconds) and total number of pins are indicated. The test has shown satisfactory reliability and validity.</description>
