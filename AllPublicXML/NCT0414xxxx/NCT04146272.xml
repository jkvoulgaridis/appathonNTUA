  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of the study is to show that the performance of the new feedback cancellatio
      system is better than the feedback system used in the currently marketed hearing aids. Speech
      understanding should not be negatively affected by the new system, ad there should be no
      consequential artifacts or unwanted noises caused by the new system.

    <textblock>
      The amplification of sounds with a hearing aid is the most common treatment for hearing loss.
      Benefits of amplification and accessories used with it outweigh any risks in mild to profound
      hearing-impaired subjects. Hearing aids provide a benefit for people with only a mild
      sensorineural hearing loss. However, often people are counselled to wait to purchase hearing
      aids until their hearing loss becomes more significant. The benefits are obtainable for both
      unilateral and bilateral fittings and are both short term and durable on long term.

      Acoustic feedback is a critical problem to all hearing aids. The acoustic coupling between
      the hearing aid receiver and the microphone occurs when an endless loop is formed so that the
      microphone is re-amplifying sound from its own receiver. The higher the amplification of the
      system, the more unstable it becomes and the more likely an acoustic feedback will occur.
      When this happens the hearing aid user and those around them hear a loud whistling noise. A
      common method used to combat this problem is feedback cancellation, more specifically
      adaptive feedback cancellation. The goal of feedback cancellation is to quickly identify
      feedback path changes and make adjustments to preserve the stability of the system while
      maintaining a high sound quality and still providing a high stable gain compared to the gain
      achieved without an active feedback reduction.

      For this study, the Sponsor will carry out testing with participants who have hearing loss to
      validate the performance of the new feedback cancelling algorithm. Studies have investigated
      the advantages and disadvantages of different feedback cancellation techniques. However, it
      is accepted by professionals that having a feedback system is better than not using feedback
      cancellation. The Sponsor has used an adaptive feedback cancellation algorithm since 2010.
      For the current study the new adaptive algorithm will be compared to the current algorithm
      implemented in the hearing aids that are certified by the European Conformity and sold on the
      market. The aim is to determine if less feedback is experienced using the new system in
      comparison to the old system.

    <measure>Live Feedback Test</measure>
    <time_frame>The test will take no more than 1 hour and will occur after 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>In the lab, subjects will have the hearing aid place in their ear. They will rate on a visual analogue scale how annoying feedback is, if it occurs. The scale has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10. A lower score is a better answer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech Understanding</measure>
    <time_frame>The test will take no more than 1 hour and will occur after 10 +/- 5 days and after 20 +/- 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will indicate which word that they heard on a touch screen that will give 5 choices all ryhming with the actual word. The test is scored by the percentage of words that they answer correctly. 0 percent is the lowest score possible and 100 percent is the highest. A higher pecentage correct is a better score.</description>

    <measure>Quality Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will not take more than 30 minutes to complete and will be completed after 10 +/- 5 days and after 20 +/- 5 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will complete a questionnaire that asks them to rate the quality of different aspects of the hearing aid including sound quality, own voice quality, and the quality when in a noisy environment. The scale is from 1 to 5 with 1 being the minimum and 5 being the maximum. A higher score indicates better quality.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of Hearing Aids</measure>
    <time_frame>Reports will not take more than 15 minutes and will be gathered at every appointment.</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of the hearing aids will be scores by the number of adverse event reports from subjects about unexpected noises or malfunctions of the hearing aids. The minimum score is Zero and the maximum is not defined but is likely not more than 20. A lower number indicated a higher score.</description>
