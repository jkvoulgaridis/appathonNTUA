    <textblock>
      Subjects with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) will undergo fractional carbon dioxide (CO2)
      laser treatment to the vulvar area. Subjects will be evaluated for changes in symptoms,
      clinical signs, and architectural changes associated with VLS at designated follow-ups to
      1-year post treatment series.

      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-group assignment, interventional clinical
      trial. Female subjects with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) supported by histologic findings on
      biopsy and/or clinical signs on physical examination and recalcitrant to mid- to high-potency
      steroid therapy, will undergo up to 5 monthly treatments to the vulva with a fractional CO2
      laser.

      Each subject will self-report symptoms of VLS. Investigators will assess clinical signs and
      architectural changes associated with VLS. Baseline measurements will be compared to
      follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the final treatment.

      Up to 10 subjects will have a biopsy taken at the baseline visit, at the 6-week follow-up and
      at the 6-month follow-up to evaluate histological markers compared to pre-treatment biopsy
      findings.

    <description>Change from baseline in severity of clinical symptoms of VLS (itch, pain unrelated to intercourse, superficial dyspareunia, skin tearing or external bleeding with intercourse) using a 5-point scale for each of the 4 parameters assessed (0=Absent/never to 4=All the time) and impact on quality of life and decrease in sexual function - desire to have sexual intercourse, using a 5-point scale for the 2 items (0=No impact to 4=Strongly affected). A total score for all 6 parameters ranges from 0 to 24. A higher score than baseline indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Measurement of mean pain/discomfort score with treatment. Pain is scored from 0-10 (0=No pain; 10=worst possible pain) on a 10-centimeter visual analog scale. A higher score indicates greater pain/discomfort.</description>
