    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the discomfort associated with eyelid retraction during intravitreal
      injections. Participants had eyelid retraction with one of three methods: eyelid speculum,
      unimanual eyelid retraction method or with a cotton tipped applicator eyelid retraction
      technique. All participants were given a pain survey immediately after the injection to
      evaluate their discomfort level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comfort is an important factor in compliance and satisfaction during medical care With the
      millions of intravitreal injections done each year, even small improvements in participants'
      experiences could lead to significant benefit. During the process eye injections, the method
      of eyelid retraction has been shown to be one of the most significant sources of discomfort.

      Many ophthalmologists use an eyelid speculum to retract the eyelids, but potentially more
      comfortable methods exist. The purpose of our study was to test the comfort eyelid retraction
      with an eyelid speculum to that of the unimanual eyelid retraction method and a cotton tipped
      applicator eyelid retraction technique.

    <description>Within one minute of the injection, the participant was given a standard 100mm long visual analog scale (VAS) and asked to rate their pain from 0mm (no pain) to 100mm (the worst pain) regarding the process of the intravitreal injection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Pain in Treatment Naive Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) of pain was compared between participant that had prior intravitreal injections and those that were treatment naive. Within one minute of the injection, the participant was given a standard 100mm long visual analog scale (VAS) and asked to rate their pain from 0mm (no pain) to 100mm (the worst pain) regarding the process of the intravitreal injection.</description>

    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) of pain was compared to participants with different hemoglobin A1c level. Within one minute of the injection, the participant was given a standard 100mm long visual analog scale (VAS) and asked to rate their pain from 0mm (no pain) to 100mm (the worst pain) regarding the process of the intravitreal injection.</description>
