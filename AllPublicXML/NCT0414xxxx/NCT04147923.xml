  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be investigating the effect for Floradapt Mature Immune Defense on nutrient
      uptake and digestive health in a healthy elderly population. Approximately 120 healthy older
      adults will be enrolled into the study and will consume either the probiotic or placebo
      supplement for 84 days and complete questionnaires as well as provide blood samples for
      nutrient uptake analysis (for 50 participants), immunological markers, and general markers of
      health. Saliva samples will be provided for analysis of sIgA and cortisol.

    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>Five symptom clusters depicted as Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhoea and Constipation will be assessed from the combination of the 15 items in the questionnaire (Abdominal pains, Heartburn, Acid regurgitation, Sucking sensations in the epigastrium, Nausea and vomiting, Borborygmus, Abdominal distension, Eructation, Increased flatus, Decreased passage of stools, Increased passage of stools, Loose stools, Hard Stools, Urgent need for defecation, Feeling of incomplete evacuation). All the domains will be scored on a 4-point scale where 0 represented no symptoms and 3 represented severe symptoms. A lower score represents less symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Bowel Habit Diary consisted of a 7 items questionnaire for evaluating each bowel movement. Bristol Stool Scale is a seven-stool description and image scale within the Daily Bowel Habit Diary to assess stool shape and consistency (type 1 is separate hard lumps, where type 7 is watery stools with no solid pieces). Stool consistency is a bowel function indicator due to its correlation with colonic transit time.</description>
