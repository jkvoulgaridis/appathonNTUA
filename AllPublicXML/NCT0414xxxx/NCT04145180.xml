  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People receiving a head and neck cancer treatment often do not find an adequate therapeutic
      response for the side effects derived from this treatment. The objective of this study is to
      assess the effectiveness of a physical recovery program based on manual therapy over these
      problems.

      Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of this type of programs on patients who have
      had cancer in other locations with clinically relevant results. There is a shortage of
      proposals for this subgroup of patients that require special attention. This project intends
      to carry out an experimental randomized controlled study with 84 patients treated of head and
      neck cancer who will be assigned randomly to the study groups: a) manual therapy program or,
      b) control group. The assessment refers to a baseline form (at the beginning of the study),
      at 6 weeks and at 6 months of patient follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Manual therapy program consists of 3 sessions a week during 6 weeks, with a total of 18
      appointments. Measurements are done before starting, after the last intervention and 6 months
      after finishing the treatment.
