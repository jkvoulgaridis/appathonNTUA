    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Cabozantinib in combination with Nivolumab
      and Ipilimumab and see what affects that this combination treatment has on those with
      recurrent carcinosarcomas.

      Primary Objectives:

      • To estimate the proportion of patients with recurrent carcinosarcoma, who survive
      progression-free for at least 6 months, treated with cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab in
      the second-line and beyond setting (per iRECIST).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate time to progression (Time Frame: From the date the patient received the
           first study treatment dose until the date of first documented progression, assessed up
           to 2 years). Progression Free Survival (PFS) according to iRECIST.

        -  To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab
           in this cohort of patients. Toxicity according to CTCAE v4.03

        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients with carcinosarcoma treated with
           cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To determine expression of biomarkers, which will include PD-L1 and MET expression by
           IHC, MSI status by NGS, and other relevant potential biomarkers.

        -  To determine whether these marker expression levels alone or in combination are
           associated with response, PFS, and/or overall survival.

               9. Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 1 mg/mg (≤ 113.2 mg/mmol).

          8. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and must have

             partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier
             methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel)

             the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been
             amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential
             if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body
             weight, ovarian suppression or other reasons.

          7. The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test ≥
             1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.

             reference for Fridericia formula].

             Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional
             ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the
             initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used
             to determine eligibility.

         11. Inability to swallow tablets.

         16. Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the
             protocol should be excluded.

         17. Presence of a known active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract
             infection, HIV or viral hepatitis.
