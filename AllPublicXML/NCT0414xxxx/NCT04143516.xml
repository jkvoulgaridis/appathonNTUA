  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see whether collecting and analyzing needle biopsy samples from colon cancer
      liver metastases (CLM) after a thermal ablation procedure will be able to identify cancer
      cells that are still alive. The results of these biopsies could help determine the next
      treatment for your cancer, but the biopsies could cause side effects.

    <description>The standard of care thermal ablation procedure, post-ablation biopsies and pre- and post-ablation PET scans. If the PET scan is positive (shows areas of cancer in the treated metastases), study participants will undergo additional needle biopsies of the positive areas on the scan. If the biopsies show areas of cancer cells that are still alive, the participants will be immediately retreated with a second ablation procedure.</description>

    <description>Standard ablation with the intent to create a radius of ablation at least 10 mm larger than the largest lesion diameter in order to achieve a minimum of 5 mm ablation margin around the tumor. Any radiographically-identified and biopsy-confirmed residual tumor will be treated on site with immediate ablation. This repeat ablation is not standard of care but will be performed as described for the initial ablation (in the same procedure session) and follow up will be resumed.</description>

    <description>Eligible patients will undergo PET/CT -guided thermal ablation. All patients will undergo PET/CT again, within approximately 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) of thermal ablation to evaluate for CN in the target tumor(s) or any sign of residual tissue enhancement, representing viable residual tumor and incomplete treatment.</description>
