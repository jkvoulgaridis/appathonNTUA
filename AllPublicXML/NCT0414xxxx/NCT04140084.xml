  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to adapt two decision aids (DAs) (pediatric and adult) developed in the
      United States to the Quebec context to develop context-adapted tools and training program
      that will facilitate the process of shared decision-making while taking a decision to use
      head computed tomography (CT scan) with patients suffering from a mild traumatic brain
      injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is among the most common neurological
      conditions with an estimated annual incidence rate of 450 to 650/100,000 in Canada. Head
      computed tomography (CT) scans are used as the reference standard test to rule out
      life-threatening complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, but present potential
      exposition risks for the patient. Despite the use of clinical decision rules (Canadian Head
      CT Rule; Pediatric Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm (PECARN)), head CTs remain overused. Two
      decision aids (pediatric and adult) developed in the United States (U.S.) may help reduce the
      use of CTs for mTBI.

      The goal of this study is to address the challenges of adapting two existing decision aids to
      local contexts. Stakeholders, including patients, or parents of patients, will be involved in
      adapting and validating the two existing decision aids to a local context and to create a
      training program about shared decision-making (SDM) in trauma care.

      Objectives:

        1. Translate two decision aids for head CTs (pediatric and adult) developed in the United
           States and adapt them to the Quebec context;

        2. Create training for Emergency Medicine professionals on adopting decision aids with mTBI
           patients;

        3. Measure the appropriate use of CTs in two hospitals(CHU de Sainte-Justine, Hotel-Dieu de
           Levis) before implementing the tools.

      Methods:

      Phase 1 will be the translation and adaptation of two decision aids to support
      decision-making about performing a head CT for adult and pediatric mTBI using an iterative
      user-centered approach. (Translation of the decision aids on the use of CT scans for mTBI
      (pediatric and adult) produced in the United States; simple ethnographic observation of the
      interactions of emergency health professionals and mTBI patients to understand the needs of
      patients, family members and health professionals in deciding to conduct a head CT for mTBI
      patients for the redesign of the tools; rapid prototyping of our different decision aids
      using interviews and real-life clinical encounters.)

      Phase 2 will be the development of a training session for healthcare professionals.

      Phase 3 will be a retrospective analysis of medical records to evaluate the use of head CT
      for mTBI patients in two hospitals (pediatric and adult).

      Expected results:

      This study will adapt two decision aids to the context of trauma care in Quebec and create a
      training program about shared decision-making and decision aids in the context of the care of
      mTBI patients. The final content and user interface of the decision aid/training session will
      be influenced by the multiple comments received from the participants in this study. This
      novel online and in -person training program will be instrumental in implementing our novel
      decision aid in practice. The results generated from the implementation of the intervention
      will help other centers in Quebec, Canada and abroad use the educational program and decision
      aid. The results of this research project will contribute to the enhancement of many research
      fields such as the involvement of end- users in the development process of decision aids.
      This research project will offer new learning opportunities for graduate students to study
      how collaboration among multiple stakeholders can improve patient outcomes and how to develop
      patient- centered tools that respond to their needs and those of the clinicians that care for
      them. Finally, this project will advance our understanding of the use of shared
      decision-making and decision aids in the field of trauma care.

Then, the study will include clinicians (at least 20) from two healthcare settings (CHU Sainte-Justine, and the CISSS-CA (Hotel-Dieu de Levis). After a presentation of the two tools during the Emergency Physicians' departmental meetings, the written comments about the prototype version will be collected. A revision of the prototypes is scheduled at the end of this step.</description>

    <description>This step includes the development of a training session on how to perform SDM with patients facing the decision to undergo head CTs for mTBI and about how to use our newly developed decision aids in this clinical setting. The content of the training session will be adapted to the needs, goals, strengths and limitations observed during the focus groups (departmental meetings) exploring health professionals' barriers to using a decision aid about head CTs in mTBI. The expertise of SAVIE (www.savie.ca) in producing online and interactive elearning programs will be mobilized in order to produce a training program that will integrate the content the investigators will have identified as the main skills, knowledge and competencies needing development among our health professionals to stimulate the use of SDM and our decision aids. SAVIE will produce a virtual elearning program adaptable to all media (PC, mobile device, tablet) and different health professionals.</description>

    <description>This step will retrospectively analyze the medical records of traumatic brain injury adult patients (adult, 350, Hotel-Dieu de Levis) and pediatric patients (406, CHU de Sainte-Justine and Hotel-Dieu de Levis)) randomly selected throughout the year preceding this study in each of the two centers to determine the rate of head CT ordering, the head CT result and the appropriateness of having ordered the head CT based on the CCHR and PECARN criteria. One reviewer will judge the appropriateness of having done a CT scan according to the CCHR and PECARN criteria based on a structured extraction form that will previously be approved by the study's steering committee. To ensure validity, 10% of the analysis will be reviewed by an expert. The reviewer will look at prehospital data collection, triage information, physician's notes, nursing notes and head CT requisition form information to determine if any of the clinical decision rule criteria are present.</description>

    <description>Study coordinators will identify potentially eligible parent/patient dyads and adult patients based on a chief complaint related to head trauma recorded at the time of ED registration and communication with treating clinicians in realtime. After using the decision aid with their health professional, a cognitive interview session will then be organized with the dyads of participants (parents/patients and clinicians) to address any usability issues. These interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for content analysis and future reference. This process will allow to identify any conceptual barriers and unanticipated user needs.
