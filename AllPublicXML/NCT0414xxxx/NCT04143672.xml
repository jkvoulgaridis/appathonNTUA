  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the potential association between pain sensitivity
      questionnaire score, the severity of postoperative pain, and postoperative analgesic
      requirement in patients with open colorectal cancer surgery. This information may be used to
      guide the optimal postoperative pain management, and ultimately improve patient's quality of
      life.

      We plan to investigate the predictive ability of the PSQ as well as experimental parameters
      of pain sensitivity using electronic algometer and other known risk factors for postoperative
      pain in 100 patients scheduled for open colorectal cancer surgery.

      The following items are investigated before surgery; Age, sex, level of education, type of
      surgery, past surgical history, presence of chronic pain, the expected maximal pain score
      (VAS) after surgery, Pain catastrophizing scale, anxiety scale (HADS-A), Pain sensitivity
      questionnaire, and pain threshold measured by electronic algometer.

      The total opioid consumption is investigated for 24 and 48 hours after surgery. In addition,
      the severity of postoperative pain is measured by the 11-point VAS at 24 and 48 hours after
      surgery. Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control is also investigated at 48
      hours after surgery using the 7-point patient's satisfaction scale.

    <description>Evaluation of pain threshold using an algometer is conducted one day before surgery.
The pressure of the plunger of algometer is applied vertically to the patient's right thenar muscle belly at a speed of 10 N/sec by the tester. Then the tester removes the algometer when the patients start to feel pain and record the pressure recorded on the algometer.</description>
