    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study. Forty subjects will be
      enrolled and will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment groups, with 20 subjects in each
      treatment group(sex will be used as a stratifying factor) as follows:

        -  Treatment Group A (reference): A single oral dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg

        -  Treatment Group B (test): A single oral dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg plus a single oral dose
           of cyclosporine 600 mg

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is a man or non-pregnant, non-lactating woman, ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at
             the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF).

          2. Female subjects must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1 (females of child-bearing
                  potential [FCBP] only).

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as 2 years after the last period and follicle-stimulating
                  hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 IU/L).

               -  Received surgical sterilization (eg, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, hysterectomy) at least 6 months before Screening with medical
                  records.

          3. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to practice a highly effective
             method of contraception throughout the study until completion of the follow-up phone
             call. Highly effective methods of contraception are those that alone or in combination
             result in a failure rate of a Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly. Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are the
             following:

               -  Combined hormonal (oestrogen and progestogen containing) contraception, which may
                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
                  which may be oral, injectable, implantable

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

               -  Vasectomized partner

               -  Sexual abstinence Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation
                  methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational
                  amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and
                  male condom should not be used together.

          4. Subject has a body weight of at least 110 pounds (50 kg); body mass index (BMI) within
             the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive (Screening and Day -1).

          5. Subject is in good health, as determined by no clinically significant findings from
             medical or surgical history, 12-lead ECG, physical examination, clinical laboratory
             tests, and vital signs.

          6. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          7. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject with a seated blood pressure outside 90 to 140 mmHg systolic or 50 to 90 mmHg
             diastolic at Screening or Day -1.

          2. Subject with a seated pulse rate outside 55 to 90 beats per minute (bpm) at Screening
             or Day -1.

          3. Subject has a presence or history of any abnormality or illness that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination
             of the IP (or would limit the subject's ability to participate in and complete this
             clinical study.

          4. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

             days prior to the first dose of IP. Herbal supplements including St. John's wort must
             be discontinued at least 28 days prior to the first dose of IP.

         12. Subject has consumed pomelo-variety citrus fruits or juice (including pomelo,
             grapefruit, Seville oranges) within 7 days prior to the first dose of IP.

         13. Subject has used any systemic prescription medication (excluding hormonal
             contraceptives) within 28 days or 5 times the elimination half-life, whichever is
             longer, prior to the first dose of IP.

         14. Subject has ingested alcohol within 7 days prior to the first dose of IP.

         15. Subject fails or is unwilling to abstain from strenuous physical activities for at
             least 24 hours prior to the first dose of IP.

         16. Subject has poor peripheral venous access.

         17. Subject has donated greater than 400 mL of blood within 60 days prior to Day 1.

         18. Subject has history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to sphingosine
             1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators or cyclosporine.

         19. Subject with history of any medical condition or medical history that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or jeopardize the safety
             or welfare of the subject.
