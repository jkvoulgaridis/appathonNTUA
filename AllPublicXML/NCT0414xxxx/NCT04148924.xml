  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In palliative care, anxiety and depression in advanced cancer are under evaluated, under
      diagnosed and therefore under treated. 5 to 30% of patients present anxious and depressive
      disorders.

      Physical symptoms are easy to assess. But in palliative care it is important to take care of
      moral suffering.

      However, evaluation and management of patient's anxiety and depressive symptoms are difficult
      for physicians and caregivers.

      The investigators would like to specifically compare the patient's evaluation of anxious and
      depressive symptomatology in palliative care with the evaluation by the physician, the nurse
      and the caregiver.

      Then the investigators will try to collect the caregivers's difficulties in the management of
      anxious and depressive symptoms.

    <description>The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) will be used for assess anxiety and depression intensity. The ESAS is a self-reported outcome tool assessing the intensity of nine symptoms (pain, tiredness, nausea, depressive mood, anxiety, drowsiness, lack of appetite, wellbeing, and breathlessness). Intensity is rated using 10-point Likert-scales from &quot;no-symptom&quot; (scored 0) to &quot;worst possible symptom&quot; (scored 10)
The difference of evaluation for anxiety and depressive symptoms is considere significant when there are two points and more between ESAS patient's and ESAS caregivers'.</description>
