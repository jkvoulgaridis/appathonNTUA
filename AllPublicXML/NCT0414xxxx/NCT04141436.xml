      Objective: To specify whether the interventions based on Hypnofertility would lead to
      increased fertility preparedness and pregnancy outcomes, decreased cortisol levels of women
      undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment.

      Design: Randomized, controlled, prospective study. Setting: University Hospital Fertility
      Center in Izmir. Patients: Sixty-one women with unexplained infertility undergoing IVF
      treatment.

      Interventions: Interventions based on Hypnofertility including affirmations, visualization,
      dreaming and relaxation from the first day of treatment to the day of pregnancy test.

      Main Outcome Measures: Fertility preparedness and cortisol levels (primary outcomes),
      pregnancy rate (secondary outcome).

    <description>Fertility Preparedness Scale for Women Receiving Fertility Support (FPS) The 5-point Likert scale was developed by Fata and Aluş Tokat (Fata and Aluş Tokat, 2019). This scale items consist only of positive words. The scale consists of 3 sub-dimensions: &quot;Hope and Awareness&quot;,&quot; Positive Feelings and Thoughts &quot;,&quot;Prepared Body and Brain&quot;. Since the items consisted only of positive expressions, the score was calculated as they were. The scores of the items were 5 (strongly agree), 4 (agree), 3 (neutral), 2 (disagree) and 1 (strongly disagree), respectively. The minimum and maximum scores are 23 and 115, respectively. The median of the scale score is 56 points, which can be considered the cut value. If the scale score is below 56, it can be considered that the woman is not prepared for fertility. If the score is 56 and higher, it indicates greater fertility preparedness.</description>

    <description>The saliva samples were collected in sterile urine containers provided by the researcher and stored in the refrigerator at a temperature between +4 and +8 degrees for a maximum of two (2) months. On average, they were sent to the laboratory every 15 days by means of carrying bags containing ice molds. Saliva was studied by LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) method by the expert staff of the laboratory.
Cortisol level (nmol/L) measurement was obtained for both intervention and control group in all face-to-face sessions. Because cortisol level have diurnal rythm and highest level is shown in the morning, samples were of all women in the morning once they came to clinic. Samples were to be collected with no eating, drinking, gum chewing or smoking in the 30 minutes prior to collection.</description>
