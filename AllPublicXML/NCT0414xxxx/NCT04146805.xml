      A Phase 1a, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single-Center, Single and Multiple Ascending
      Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of
      BLD-0409 in Healthy Volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of BLD-0409 in
      healthy volunteers (HV) to facilitate the dose/dosing regimen selection for future clinical
      studies with BLD-0409 in various chronic liver diseases.

      The study consists of two parts:

      Part 1: SAD in HV with up to 6 cohorts (including a food effect cohort). For SAD cohorts and
      planned dosing schedule.

      Part 2: MAD over 14 days with up to 6 cohorts. For MAD cohorts and planned dosing schedule.

         24. Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason.

        Lifestyle Considerations Meals and Dietary Restrictions

          1. Subjects will fast from all food and drink except water for â¥ 10 hours before morning
             study drug administration on Day 1.

          2. Except during the periods of fasting, standard meals and snacks will be provided at
             the discretion of the Investigator while subjects are confined in the study site.

          3. For food effect Cohort 1e:

               1. On Day 8, subjects will be provided a standard high calorie breakfast from 30
                  minutes before dose administration (and to be consumed entirely within that 30
                  minutes). The meal is to follow United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
                  guidance regarding caloric content and composition. The test meal should derive
                  approximately 150, 250 and 500 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat,
                  respectively. An example test meal would be two eggs fried in butter, two strips
                  of bacon, and two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes
                  and eight ounces of whole milk. Substitutions in this test meal can be made as
                  long as the meal provided a similar amount of calories from protein, carbohydrate
                  and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity. Vegetarians may be enrolled
                  provided that there is a consultation with a dietician regarding comparable
                  calories, volume and viscosity.

               2. Water restrictions may be needed. No water is allowed 1 hour before and after
                  dosing, after which time, water is allowed ad libitum.

          4. Subjects will refrain from consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit
             juice, from 48 hours before the start of study drug until after the final PK sample is
             obtained.

          5. Subjects will refrain from diets that could alter metabolism (i.e., high protein, Slim
             FastÂ®, NutrisystemÂ®, etc.) within 7 days prior to dosing on Day 1.

        Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco

          1. During each dosing session, subjects will abstain from ingesting caffeine- or
             xanthine-containing products (e.g., coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for 48
             hours before the start of dosing until after collection of the final pharmacokinetic
             (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic sample.

          2. During each dosing session, subjects will abstain from alcohol for 48 hours before the
             start of dosing until EOS visit.

          3. Active smokers and users of nicotine-containing products will be excluded from the
             study.

        Other Restrictions Subjects will avoid strenuous physical activity (e.g. weightlifting,
        running, bicycling) from 24 hours prior to Day 1 until discharge from the study site and
        for 24 hours prior to the EOS visit.
