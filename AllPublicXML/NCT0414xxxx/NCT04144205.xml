  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mixed venous oxygen saturation is known to reflect oxygen delivery and, thus, is frequently
      monitored in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Factors that affect mixed venous oxygen
      saturation include hemoglobin level, arterial oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen partial
      pressure. Among them, arterial oxygen partial pressure is known to have minimal effect on
      oxygen delivery compared to hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation. However, some argues
      that in certain clinical setting, such as anemia which is very common in cardiac surgery
      patients, the contribution of plasma (arterial oxygen partial pressure in this case) to
      oxygen delivery becomes more significant. Therefore, we planned to perform a pilot clinical
      trial to observe the change of oxygen delivery, which would be reflected in mixed venous
      oxygen saturation and cerebral regional oxygen saturation, according to hemoglobin level.

    <description>After the stabilization of cardiopulmonary bypass, in the first half of patients, fraction of inspired oxygen would be set at 0.5 and maintained for 5 minutes (T0), then it would be changed to 1.0 and maintained for 5 minutes (T1). Again, fraction of inspired oxygen would be resumed to be 0.5 and maintained for 5 minutes (T2).
In the other half of patients, the direction of change in fraction of inspired oxygen will be reversed as follows. It will be set at 1.0 and maintained for 5 minutes (T0), then changed to 0.5 and maintained for 5 minutes (T1), and finally to 1.0 and maintained for 5 minutes (T2).</description>
