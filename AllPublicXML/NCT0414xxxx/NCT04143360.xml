  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the problems of traditional closed thoracic drainage in clinical work, this
      study aims to further improve and improve the new closed thoracic drainage system by changing
      the material of drainage tube, increasing the regulating valve of external fixator and
      increasing the gas flow monitoring kit for special patients, so as to expand its clinical
      application scope and formulate its operation. Standardize. At the same time, through a
      randomized controlled study, the simplicity, effectiveness and safety of the new minimally
      invasive thoracic closed drainage system developed by the research group were deeply studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional closed thoracic drainage method has complex operation and high technical
      requirements. It has obvious pain during and after operation. Operational complications such
      as tissue organs, intercostal vessels and nerve injury may occur during the operation.
      Accidents may also occur after catheterization, including leakage around thoracic drainage
      tube, thoracic drainage tube prolapse, subcutaneous emphysema and accumulation. Liquid; To
      solve these problems, we have invented &quot;minimally invasive thoracic closed drainage system&quot;
      through a number of patent designs, including: thoracic closed drainage tube implantation
      expansion forceps, double-chamber thoracic drainage device with side balloon, guide wire,
      puncture needle, various types of dilators, chest tube fixation devices, etc. The system has
      the characteristics of minimally invasive puncture and implantation of drainage tube, safe,
      fast operation, no need of suture and fixation, good position of drainage tube after
      implantation, less pain for patients, and closing incision in the medial part of patients,
      avoiding leakage and subcutaneous emphysema and hydrops.
