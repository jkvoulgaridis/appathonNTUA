      This is an open-label Phase I basket trial designed to determine the phase 2 recommended dose
      of ulixertinib in combination hydroxychloroquine. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be
      determined by using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with a minimum of 3 evaluable
      subjects accrued to dose level one and two. Should dose level one be deemed intolerable,
      enrollment will proceed at dose level 0. The RP2D will be affirmed according to the rules of
      the 3+3 dose-escalation scheme
