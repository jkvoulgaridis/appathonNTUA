      underwent cataract surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical records of patients who were underwent cataract surgery between January 2014 and
      October 2017 were investigated retrospectively and patients 65 years and older were
      recruited. Two groups were made according to age: group1 composed of patients age range
      between 65 and 85 years and group 2 composed of patients 85 years and older. Gender, presence
      of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), drug use were noted.

      The results of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) converted to LogMar, intraocular pressure
      (IOP) before and 3 months after operation, biomicroscopic and fundus examinations were
      investigated.

      Additional ocular diseases such as glaucoma, age related macular degeneration (AMD),
      pseudoexfoliation syndrome, retinopathies and maculopathies related to systemic diseases were
      noted. Pupil dilation properties were also noted as poor, mid or full pupil dilation.

      Cataract surgery techniques such as phacoemulsification, extra- and intracapsular lens
      extractions, peroperative complications, intracameral drug use were investigated.

      these aforementioned outcomes evaluated and compared between groups.

    <description>Cataract surgery was performed by using phacoemulsification technique, routinely. But other techniques for instance extra or intracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE, ICCE) techniques were performed when needed. Phacoemulsification technique was performed by 2 experienced surgeon (G.A. and E.C.) under topical anesthesia, thorough limbal incision. Foldable single piece hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) was inserted in the bag. In the presence of complications related to anterior or posterior capsules, 3 pieces IOL was preferred. When ECCE technique was chosen, single piece polymethyl methacrylate IOL was inserted.</description>
