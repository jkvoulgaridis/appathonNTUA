  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study of the psychological impact of breast cancer risk communication in Cancer Genetics
      based on the personalized estimation of the BOADICEA V5/PLUS model (&quot;Breast and Ovarian
      Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm-version 5 or PLUS&quot;).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new BC gene testing and risk estimation using BOADICEA V5/PLUS model imply an increased
      complexity of communication during the cancer genetic consultation. It will be proposed to
      women referred to genetic counselling in the participating Cancer Genetic Clinics .

      New qualitative (moderate risks, secondary results) and quantitative results (variation in
      the degree of cancer risk identified for the counselee and family members) and thus a
      personalized breast cancer risk may be obtained. How this complexity affects counselees'
      psychological reactions is not known.

      It is primarily aimed at comparing psychosocial needs and distress in healthy women
      (unaffected with BC) at high risk of breast or ovarian cancer undergoing genetic testing
      based on an enriched gene panel (index case gene panel plus PRS) at Curie Institute in France
      and at the University Hospital in Cologne, Germany.

    <description>Breast or ovarian cancer risk perception (the impact of communicating a personalized breast cancer risk using the BOADICEAV5/PLUS model) using a PAHC questionnaire. Questionnaire items are responded on a 4-level scale from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much).

    <description>Counselee's perceived lifetime risks of developing (a first or second) BC will be measured at T2 in words (Not concerned, Don't know, Low risk, Low to moderate risk, Moderate risk, High risk, Very high risk, Major Risk) and in figures (Not concerned, Don't know, 0-10%; between 11-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80% and over 80%).</description>

    <description>Counselees' choice of cancer risk management will be assessed using a study-specific self-administered questionnaire based on the literature [Julian-Reynier, 2010] asking about women's intention or choice to undergo regular mammography, regular breast ultrasound, MRI or preventive mastectomy on a 6-option response scale (Yes, certainly; Yes, probably; I don't know; No, probably not; No, certainly not; Not concerned).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using a study-specific self-administered questionnaire based on the literature [de Geus, 2015] asking about women's whether they informed about genetic testing among her husband/partner, children, mother, father, sister(s), brother(s), friend(s) or other family member(s) using a 4, 5 or 5-option response scale depending on the person (Yes, I informed him/her/them; No, but I plan to do it; No (no partner); No; Yes all of them; Yes, some of them; No (children too young); No (no children/brother/sister); No (mother/father deceased).</description>
