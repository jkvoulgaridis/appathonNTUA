  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the long-term exercise, you can maintain your health and strengthen your physical
      strength. It can also improve your body's balance and help maintain your body's coordination
      so that you can reduce the chance of falls.

      Therefore, in the face of aging, stroke rehabilitation or balance of power caused by balance
      of power decline, sports injuries or falls related issues, this study will focus on &quot;balance
      ability&quot; to explore a range of impacts and relationships.

      Considering the standardization comparison in the study, this study will collect data on the
      balance of young people under different external stimuli, and hope to understand the balance
      control ability by objectively collecting the physiological signals of the Center of Pressure
      (COP).

      The change, and the use of the Berg scale as a benchmark for the assessment of balance
      ability, and then return to the issue of balance ability training.

      Therefore, this study divides the experiment into two major stages. The first stage will
      focus on healthy young people, and explore how external stimuli affect balance, and then
      assist balance ability training to find the most appropriate adjustment of body posture
      control.

      The second phase explores the appropriate exercise training for stroke patients, such as the
      use of Modular Interactive Tiles System (MITS) training, to track the effectiveness of
      external stimulus impact balance training.

    <description>Subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group after completing the Berg scale test before the experiment. In the experimental group, external stimulation (MITS) was added, and the training time was 65 minutes.

    <description>The modular robotic brick system was developed by Danish scholar Prof. Henrik Hautop Lund in collaboration with the University of Siena in Italy to develop a new tool. The system uses the design principles of different levels of daily life activities, combined with the way of cognitive games, Lego toys can combine different game concepts, with a set of individual or multi-person activity programs with hands or feet, provide a set Modular floor tiles for stroke patients and the elderly.</description>
