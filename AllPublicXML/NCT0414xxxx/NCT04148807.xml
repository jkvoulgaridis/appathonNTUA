    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of a gait-retraining program for older adults with
      knee osteoarthritis. The study will enroll 40 participants, with 20 receiving a gait
      retraining intervention and 20 receiving a graded walking program without gait retraining.

    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition affecting ~12% of older adults in the United
      States and is a leading cause of disability. Knee pain is a common clinical manifestation
      that leads individuals with OA to seek medical care. Current rehabilitation approaches (e.g.,
      bracing, taping, foot orthoses, strengthening, etc.) aim to reduce knee joint loading, a
      well-accepted risk factor for knee OA and pain, but are not always effective. Altering gait
      mechanics to reduce knee loading has also been suggested. Gait retraining studies for
      individuals with knee OA have focused on increasing trunk lean and toe out angle to reduce
      the knee adduction moment (a surrogate measure of joint loading). However, these strategies
      create an abnormal gait pattern and may not be the best long-term solutions due to the
      potential injury to other joints which may limit their overall effectiveness and
      applicability to clinical practice. Impact loading, another mechanical factor related to knee
      OA, has been reduced using gait retraining strategies in runners with knee pain. It is
      unknown if gait retraining strategies to decrease impact loading can reduce symptoms of knee
      OA. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a gait retraining
      program focusing on decreasing impact loading in individuals with knee OA.

      At baseline, following 8 intervention sessions, and at 1-month follow-up, participants will
      complete questionnaires, undergo three-dimensional gait analysis, and assessment of pressure
      pain threshold.

      Note: For participants enrolled during COVID-19 outbreak, only questionnaires will be
      collected at follow-up assessments.

    <description>During retraining sessions participants will walk on a treadmill at self-selected comfortable walking speed wearing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the medial aspect of the distal tibia. The (vertical) peak positive acceleration (PPA) of the tibia is a measure of tibial shock. Subjects will be provided real-time audio feedback to reduce PPA by 20% of their average peak PPA. During retraining sessions, a faded feedback approach will be used. Feedback will be provided continuously during the first four sessions and will be faded over the last 4 sessions. Walking time will increase over the 8 sessions.</description>
