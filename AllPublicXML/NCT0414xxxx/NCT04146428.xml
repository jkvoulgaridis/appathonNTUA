  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research teams in Boston University, UCLA, and Weill Cornell will recruit 90 participants in
      3 years (10 participants per site per year) and evaluate JASPER, play-based intervention,
      using the BOSCC and ELSA-T. Participants will be randomized to receive JASPER facilitated
      either by a clinician or the caregiver. After 10 weeks, the participants will be evaluated
      using the CGI to determine if they are &quot;responders&quot; or &quot;non-responders&quot;. Nonresponders will
      be given a mix of clinician and caregiver-facilitated JASPER and responders will remain the
      course for the following 10 weeks. Coding of the BOSCC and ELSA-T will be the outcome
      measures and change will be evaluated throughout the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: 90 children with confirmed diagnoses of ASD (based on ADOS and clinical
      judgement) between 18 months and 5 years of age will be randomized into clinician-mediated
      vs. parent-mediated JASPER intervention at Weill Cornell (n=30; PI Dr. Kim), BU (n=30, PI Dr.
      Tager-Flusberg), and UCLA (n=30, PIs Drs. Lord &amp; Kasari). Minimally verbal children eligible
      for the ADOS Toddler Module or Module 1 (pre or minimally verbal) or those who have emerging
      phrases who may receive Module 2 (phrase speech) will be enrolled. The sample will be limited
      to children with nonverbal mental ages greater than or equal to 12 months.

      Pre-Intervention Behavioral Testing: We will administer the ADOS and Mullen Scales of Early
      Learning (MSEL), ESCS, SPA, and CCX. Parents will complete the interview version of the
      Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales -3rd edition. In addition, the investigators will
      administer ELSA-T (following the same procedures that we developed in the first phase of this
      project described above) as well as the BOSCC with clinicians and caregivers (independent,
      standardized administration by caregivers). A subset of children (n=20) will be invited
      within a week of the first assessment for another ELSA/BOSCC sessions for test-retest
      reliability.

      Responder vs. non-responder criteria: Children who show improvements in core ASD symptoms
      based on the treating therapists' CGI-Improvement ratings will be considered as &quot;responders.&quot;
      Children who show stability or worsening on the CGI-I will be considered as &quot;non-responders.&quot;
      Children will be stratified based on age and language levels across sites, and randomized
      into 10-week clinician- vs. caregiver- mediated JASPER interventions initially by the
      statistician at BU who will not be directly involved in the data collection. Non-responders
      will be then offered to receive a combined clinician-AND caregiver-mediated JASPER
      interventions for additional 10 weeks. &quot;Responders&quot; will continue with the same intervention
      for the additional 10 weeks.

      At T2 (after first 10 weeks) and T3 (after 20 weeks, end of study), the investigators will
      again administer ELSA-T, BOSCC, as well as CGI, ESCS, SPA, and CCX.

      Coding ELSA: Naïve coders will be trained to use ELAN to mark the beginning and end of each
      child speech vocalization/utterance and each examiner/parent utterance, which are coded on
      separate tiers. Coders will be blind about which kind of intervention the child received and
      when the ELSA recording was collected pre- or post-intervention. ELAN provides as output
      frequency of child utterances and frequency of adult utterances (corrected per unit time).
      The investigators have developed an algorithm that takes ELAN exported files containing the
      start and end time of each utterance from each speaker to derive a measure of conversation
      turn-taking (number of consecutive utterances produced by same speaker).

      Note that these two measures are not independent, but clinical trials could define either one
      as a primary outcome measure depending on whether the targeted outcome focuses on the child's
      communicative abilities or social engagement. ELSA-T recordings will be collected at three
      sites, but all ELSA coding will be completed at BU.

      Coding BOSCC: PI Dr. Kim's research team has trained, blind coders who will score the BOSCC
      without previous knowledge of the child and the time points of interactions. Different coders
      will be assigned for the clinician vs. caregiver BOSCC videos and for the parent behavioral
      coding. BOSCC videos will be collected at three sites, but all BOSCC coding will be done at
      Weill Cornell.

      The same research activities will be conducted at UCLA, Boston University, and Weill Cornell.

    <description>Dr. Tager-Flusberg's team created the ELSA, for collecting natural language samples (NLSs) from minimally to low verbal school-aged children and adolescents with ASD and developed a novel approach for deriving quantitative measures of linguistic communication (frequency of child utterances and number of conversational turns), in real-time from the language samples that could be useful for a range of clinical intervention trials. In this study, ELSA will be used on toddlers in this study, which has already been piloted.</description>

    <description>In this semi-structured interaction, the child and tester sit facing each other at a table with a set of toys in view but out of reach of the child which are introduced one by one (Mundy, Sigman, Ungerer, &amp; Sherman, 1986; Seibert, Hogan, &amp; Mundy, 1982).

    <time_frame>Entry (1st month of the study), T2 (10 weeks after entry), T3 (20 weeks after entry)</time_frame>
    <description>SPA-R is designed to obtain the child's highest levels of spontaneous play acts. The child is presented with 5 different play sets by the experimenter; the entire play interaction last about 15-20 minutes. The child's play behaviors are videotaped and later coded. The variables of interest include the frequency of child initiated functional and symbolic play acts and also the count of different novel types of acts. This measure has shown excellent reliability and validity across a range of studies (Kasari et al., 2006; Sigman &amp; Ruskin, 1999; Sigman &amp; Ungerer, 1984).</description>

    <time_frame>Entry (1st month of the study), T2 (10 weeks after entry), T3 (20 weeks after entry)</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-minute interaction between parent and child. These sessions will be carried out with a standard set of toys and videotaped.
Parents will be asked to engage their child in play as usual. Coders blind to child treatment assignment and time point will code the videotapes according to Adamson et al, 2004 coding procedures, the same as used in our previous studies (Harris, Kasari, &amp; Sigman, 1996; Kasari et al, 2006; Kasari, et al, 2008). Joint engagement change will be recorded and measured throughout the study.</description>
