  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose trial with two parts in patients with type 1
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Part 1 consists of four cohorts with multiple ascending doses of
      insulin Tregopil and comprises a sentinel dosing design. Part 2 consists of a randomised,
      2-treatment, crossover design with mixed meal tests (MMTs) of different compositions followed
      by parallel design titrated treatment period. Both parts include dosing during an in-house
      period and during a subsequent outpatient period.

    <description>Insulin Tregopil is recombinant human insulin modified by a single amphiphilic oligomer covalently linked via an amide bond to lysine at position 29 of the B-chain. This alters the physicochemical characteristics of the molecule, leading to enhanced stability and resistance to intestinal degradation following oral administration.</description>
