  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many surgical site infections are caused by bacteria that is transferred from a patient's
      nose to their open surgical wound. Some small studies have shown that putting povidone-iodine
      in a patient's nose reduces this risk. This study aims to evaluate the real-world
      effectiveness of nasal povidone-iodine (PROFEND®) in a group of 50 patients at the University
      of Iowa.

      Aim 1. Evaluate the real-world effectiveness of intranasal povidone-iodine (PROFEND®) in
      reducing Staphylococcus aureus colonization and surgical site infections (SSIs).

      Aim 1a. Evaluate patients after surgery to determine S. aureus colonization and to survey
      patients on tolerability of intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization. The intranasal
      povidone-iodine swab will be administered to the patient's nares around one hour prior to the
      first surgical incision. It will then be re-applied around 12 hours later, for a total of two
      applications within a 24 hour period.

      During the same visit at 24 hours after surgery, patients will also be administered a
      questionnaire to determine the tolerability of intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization.
      Questions will be asked about adverse events (e.g., itching, irritation) and how intranasal
      povidone-iodine felt (very pleasant, pleasant, neutral, unpleasant, very unpleasant).

      Based on the data obtained from this aim, we will summarize the patient acceptance of
      intranasal povidone-iodine.

      Aim 1b. Compare the rates of SSI among orthopaedic trauma surgery patients who received
      intranasal povidone-iodine to similar patients who received orthopedic trauma surgery before
      intranasal povidone-iodine implementation.

    <description>Intranasal povidone-iodine (PDI PROFEND) will be applied to the patients' noses before orthopedic trauma surgery and after surgery. This intranasal povidone-iodine was developed under the Tentative Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products 21 CFR Parts 333 and 369 (Docket # 75N-183H), Federal Register Volume 59, Number 116, Friday, June 17, 1994, Proposed Rules. However, the product need not be controlled like a pharmaceutical drug. The product may be stored and controlled similarly to an iodine or alcohol skin preparation product.</description>
