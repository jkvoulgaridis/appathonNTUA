  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the
      gastrointestinal tract, and the incidence rate in China has increased year by year in recent
      years.Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are not sensitive to radiotherapy and traditional
      infusion chemotherapy. Currently, they are generally treated with surgery, but they are prone
      to recurrence and metastasis.For nodules with a particle size between 2 and 5 cm, there may
      be both benign and malignant, and there is still a lack of fast and accurate methods for
      distinguishing benign and malignant.Many benign nodules were removed (in the pathological
      examination of postoperative resected tissue). In addition, if it is found to be late, there
      is a possibility of invading surrounding tissues and metastasis, so that it is impossible to
      cure. Therefore, early diagnosis and early surgery and benign and malignant differentiation
      of small nodules are the key to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors.At present, second-generation gene sequencing (NGS) and liquid biopsy are
      rarely reported in the field of GIST. A few domestic and foreign studies have found that it
      can detect rare mutation types, and may find secondary gene mutations early, which has
      potential applicability, but Overall, the clinical guidance of these NGS-based studies
      focuses on prognosis and drug resistance , as well as some studies based on low-throughput
      platforms. Therefore, early diagnosis and benign and malignant discrimination based on
      high-throughput sequencing and liquid biopsy have significant clinical significance for the
      diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

    <description>At this stage, a small panel targeted high-throughput sequencing process for gastrointestinal stromal tumors was established, and the association of tumor-associated mutation profiles in different patients with clinical stage was initially explored. It is planned to collect about 100 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumors after surgery (freezing tissue or FFPE sections), DNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing of small panels, and analysis of the relationship between the mutation spectrum of each sample and the corresponding patient clinical data (staging).</description>

    <description>In this stage, we plan to establish a small panel of peripheral blood cfDNA targeting high-throughput sequencing process, and verify the consistency of peripheral blood cfDNA and tissue gDNA in gene detection of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. About 50 patients were planned to be enrolled. Peripheral blood was collected once for each patient and the blood volume was 10mL. Meanwhile, the tumor tissue samples were collected within 5mm in diameter, depending on the size of the lesion . DNA extraction and small panel sequencing were performed for the two types of samples of the patients respectively, and the DNA sequencing results of the two types of samples were compared, and the clinical data of the corresponding patients were referenced to evaluate the consistency of the results of peripheral blood cfDNA and tissue gDNA for the gene detection of gastrointestinal stromal tumor.</description>

    <description>Peripheral blood of about 150 patients was collected once and the blood volume was 10mL . Meanwhile, the tumor tissue samples were collected within 5mm in diameter, depending on the size of the lesion. Patients focus on the early stage of stromal tumors or those whose size under gastroenteroscopy is between 2 and 5 cm. DNA extraction and small panel sequencing were conducted for each patient sample. Based on the indicator results of the previous mutation spectrum for each stage of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, the clinical stage classification of patients and the benign and malignant nodules were determined by the mutation spectrum, and compared with the real clinical data of patients.</description>
