  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial distress is common in patients with an oncologic diagnosis, with anxiety being
      present in almost 20-30% of the patients.[1, 2, 10] Mindfulness exercises have shown to
      reduce this distress.[4, 5]

      Recently, the implementation of a 60-second mindfulness-based intervention has shown to have
      momentary effects on pain, anxiety, depression and anger in orthopaedic upper extremity
      patients.[9] However, its lasting effect after the single intervention was not evaluated.
      Nonetheless, because the intervention is not time consuming and is easy to implement it may
      benefit orthopaedic oncology patients in their pre-operative coping.

      The implementation of a 60-second mindfulness-based intervention has shown to have momentary
      effects on pain, anxiety, depression and anger in orthopaedic upper extremity participants.
      In this research study, the investigators are studying a 60-second interactive personalized
      acceptance-based mindfulness exercise

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a preoperative 60-second interactive
      personalized acceptance-based mindfulness exercise (intervention) versus a brief educational
      pamphlet (control) on anxiety in patients undergoing curative surgery for a musculoskeletal
      malignancy.
