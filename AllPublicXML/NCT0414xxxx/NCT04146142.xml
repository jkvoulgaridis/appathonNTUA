  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsy is indicated in patients with suspected prostate cancer and has been
      traditionally performed through the rectum using antibiotic prophylaxis. Increasing
      antibiotic resistance of intestinal bacteria is causing a growing number of patients to get
      post-biopsy infections. Sepsis rate after transrectal biopsies is approximately 4-10%.

      To reduce the risk of post-biopsy infections, transperineal approach in general anesthesia
      and antibiotic prophylaxis has been used. The investigators at Oslo University Hospital Aker
      developed MRI -TURS elastic image fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy technique in
      local anesthesia and Bactrim prophylaxis as outpatient procedure. The investigators found
      0.4% post-biopsy infection rate. Afterwards a pilot study using the same biopsy technique
      however without antibiotic prophylaxis was realized in 90 patients. None of these subjects
      experienced infection.

      The investigators wish to perform a prospective randomized trial of antibiotic prophylaxis
      versus none before transperineal MRI-TRUS fusion guided prostate biopsy in local anesthesia
      in outpatient clinic.

      Background: Unnecessary use of antibiotics promotes antibiotic resistance. Efforts for
      antibiotic use reduction without increase the risk of serious infection complications are
      therefore needed.

      Purpose: The aim of this trial is to compare the rates of infectious complication after
      transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with and without antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Materials and methods: A total of 450 patients will be included in this trial. A 1:1
      randomization to receive or not receive antibiotics prophylaxis will be performed using
      randomization system WebCRF-3 system. MRI-TRUS fusion prostate biopsy will be done with
      transperineal prostate approach in local anesthesia in outpatient clinic. In patients with
      normal MRI,12-core systematic prostate biopsies with 3D biopsy registration will be done
      according to the EAU guidelines. In patients with positive MRI, 2-4 targeted biopsies from
      the suspicious MRI areas will be realized and systematic prostate biopsies will also be done.
      All prostate biopsies will be performed using Koelis MRI-TRUS image fusion and organ based
      tracking system. Post-biopsy infection and any adverse events will be systematically
      prospectively registered in all patients. Pain during the local anesthesia application and
      during the biopsy procedure will be registered using Visual Analog Score, 10 points scale
      questionnaire.
