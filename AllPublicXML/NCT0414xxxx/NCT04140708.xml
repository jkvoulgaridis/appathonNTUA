  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to measure the change in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease
      (PD) before, during and after a 12 week exercise program.The focus of this study is the
      glymphatic system. The glymphatic system is a recentlydiscovered novel waste clearance
      pathway, in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD).The glymphatic system acts as a
      waste-clearance system in the brain of vertebrate animals.The glymphatic system has been
      proposed in which new clearance pathways involving communication between paravascular spaces,
      interstitial fluid, and ultimately meningeal and dural lymphatic vessels exists, and we have
      provided evidence that this system may be dysfunctional in patients with Parkinson's disease
      with cognitive disorders. Early research suggest glymphatic function increases following
      exercise, this response is believed to clear beta-amyloid in the brain and may mediate the
      neurobehavioral response to exercise in PD.

      This study will use cognitive exams, neurological exams as well as specialized imaging to
      record data points and evaluate the glymphatic function after exercise.

    <measure>Trail Making Test A&amp;B (TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TMT measures executive functioning and error detection. Measured with time to complete trails. Higher time to complete means more difficulty with executive functioning.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Letter Fluency (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FAS measures how many words a patient can list in a minute beginning with a certain letter (F, A, or S), relating to verbal learning and executive function. The lowest score is 0 words, and the more words listed in a minute beginning with each letter, the better executive functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Simon Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Simon task is another well-validated measure of inhibitory action control which has also been studied extensively in PD. This is a conflict task which measures the effect of interfering impulses on the ability to select a goal response. Scores are measured in % accuracy from 0-100, and reaction times from 0 ms and upward. The higher the accuracy and lower the reaction time, the better the inhibitory action control and executive functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Estimate of Seconds (BEST)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BEST measures chrognosis and how well a patient can measure time. It is measured by comparing a difference of estimated time by the patient and mean estimated time by a control group (precalculated), dividing by the standard deviation of that control group, and using the z-score associated with that calculation to determine if the patient observes time sped up or slowed down. A lower/more negative z-score indicates that the patient observes time as going faster, while a higher/more positive z-score indicates that the patient observes time as going slower.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Recorded Outcomes Measurement Information System-Sleep disturbance (PROMIS-Sleep)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS measures anxious and depressive feelings in patients. There are 2 parts, Anxiety, where the lowest score would be a 0 and the highest is 21, and the higher a score is, the more anxious behaviors there are. The second part is a depressive behavior scale, which the lowest score is 0, and the highest is 21, and the higher the score, the more depressive behaviors there are.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a clinical interview that measures memory, orientation, judgement, and lifestyle behaviors of the patient. The answers on the interview questions are decided by the clinician to correlate to a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being the lowest score and high cognition and consciousness, with 3 being the highest score associated with severe mental decline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop interference task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The stroop interference task measures Measures completion time and number of errors, both corrected and not corrected, and total errors. The low and high scores are patient dependent upon performance, and the higher the scores, the more errors have been made and the worse executive functioning. The amount of time taken on the Stroop task also correlates to having worse executive functioning with a higher completion time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurametrix</measure>
    <time_frame>continuous between baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neurametrix measures typing cadences such as the time spent on one key and the time spent in between key on the keyboard that correspond to cognitive and motor functions. The cadences are using averages for the time spent on one key or between keys, with a higher mean there is less control in movement and less cognitive functioning.</description>
