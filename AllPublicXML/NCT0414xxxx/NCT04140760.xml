      1. To evaluate the components and processes needed for a full-scale clinical study:
           recruitment, randomisation, attrition, probiotic use, stool sample collection,
           microbiome sequencing and behavioural/cognitive measures and determine the feasibility
           and patient acceptability of these processes to inform a full-scale study in line with
           NIHR pilot study guidance.

        2. To collect pilot data to determine sample size and power, reliability and sensitivity of
           selected measures, to maximise the findings and minimise patient burden.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is a pilot study with 70 participants, 35 in the probiotic and 35 in
      the placebo arm of the study. The study will investigate the process of conducting
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled research about probiotic use in Parkinson's
      Disease patients. The primary aim of the study is to test elements of the study design for a
      full-scale clinical study: recruitment, randomisation, probiotic use, stool sample collection
      and DNA sequencing and behavioural/cognitive measures. The secondary aim is to collect pilot
      data to determine the sample size, Power and appropriateness of measures needed for a
      full-scale study that maximises findings and minimises patient burden.

      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects motor functions and a
      range of non-motor abilities. There is no cure and a definitive cause is not yet known. It
      has a prevalence of 0.3% in the general population and 1-3% in the population over the age of
      65. Globally, it is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and due to the lack of
      early diagnosis and effective therapy, represents a large burden for society and healthcare
      provision. The underlying pathology of PD is associated with accumulation of abnormal clumps
      of alpha-synuclein protein termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the central nervous system
      (CNS) that impede the normal function of brain cells. Evidence from animal studies indicates
      that the production of alpha-synuclein begins in the gut, and gastro-intestinal problems are
      a common feature of PD.

      The gut contains millions of micro-organisms termed the microbiome. Over the past decade
      research findings have identified a complex bidirectional interaction between the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS), the Gut-Brain axis. It is
      now known that the Gut-Brain axis is adversely affected by PD. Recently, probiotics have been
      proposed as a potential intervention for systemic and neurological conditions by improving
      microbiome composition.

      Data obtained from this pilot study will be used to identify challenges in conducting
      research using probiotics in patients with Parkinson's Disease and provide a rationale for
      conducting a full-scale study including information that may reduce or eliminate problems
      that limit the successful delivery of a full-scale trial. The investigators will make no
      claims here about any purported clinical effects of the chosen probiotic.

    <measure>Patient Adherence to Study questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Thirteen weeks from study start</time_frame>
    <description>The patient experience questionnaire (Adherence To Study) provides data about patients' experience of taking part in the study to inform a full-scale trial. These data will enable evaluation of the patient experience of taking part in the study, the experience of providing two stool samples and taking a daily capful of the placebo or probiotic liquid. This scale is developed by the researcher's. The measure is a 5-point Likert scale that includes responses: Not at all, 2 = Not really, 3 = Somewhat, 4 = Quite a lot, 5 = Very much - in the first part of the questionnaire. A sample question is: Are you happy with the consent process for taking part in the research? Total score ranges from 6-30 - low score indicates dissatisfaction with the study method and information provided. Other questions in the scale require simple 'yes' and 'no' responses. For example, 'Were you comfortable providing a stool sample for the study?'</description>

    <measure>Patient Exit Study Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks from study start date (only relevant for patients who withdrew).</time_frame>
    <description>The patient exit study scale is designed to evaluate why patients did not or were unable to complete the study. The scale was devised by the researchers and comprised a 5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 7-35 with lower scores indicating dissatisfaction with particular elements of of study design, recruitment, and/or data collection. These data will inform the full-scale study</description>

    <description>The user manual specifies that the questionnaire is particularly appropriate for use in clinical trials to assess treatments and interventions intended to benefit people with Parkinson's disease. Scale is 5-point Likert scale from 'Never' through to 'Always' with scores ranging from 0-4. Total score range = 0 - 156 (Lower score = better quality of life, higher score = poorer quality of life.</description>

    <description>The PDSS is a visual analogue scale addressing 15 commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance. Response options range from 0 = 'awful' to 10 = 'excellent' or 0 = 'always' to 10 = 'never.' Total score range from 0-150. Low scores indicate poor sleep or sleep related problems and high scores indicate good sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure to be completed at week 1 of entry into study; second evaluation completed at week 13 after entry to study.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure includes questions relating to 15 common gastrointestinal symptoms and requires patients to rate the severity of their symptoms over the past week or 2 weeks. It was developed from reviews of gastrointestinal symptoms and clinical experience, to evaluate common symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders. Responses range from 1 = 'No discomfort at all' to 7 = 'Very severe discomfort.' Total score range is 15-105, where 15 indicates minimal discomfort and higher rating scores indicate significant or severe discomfort.</description>
