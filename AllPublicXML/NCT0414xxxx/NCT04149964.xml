      This study will evaluate if the use of acetaminophen round the clock (scheduled doses) will
      lead to less opiate use in the first week post-operative (after surgery) in sinus/septum
      surgery patients. Participants will be randomized like a flip of a coin to either the
      standard of care pain treatment of acetaminophen 325 mg as needed for pain plus opiates
      (acetaminophen/hydrocodone) as needed for breakthrough pain; OR to the study arm of
      acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours plus opiates (Oxycodone)as needed for breakthrough pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain control in the postoperative period following septum and/or sinus surgery is
      controversial, as there is no consensus statement regarding current guidelines to direct
      clinical practice. Recent legislation limits opioid prescription length to 5 days only, which
      brings into question whether legislation will affect prescribing practices of physicians and
      whether or not giving patients an alternative to opiates will be a more efficacious route.

      Current prescribing practices for septum and sinus surgery of the Otolaryngology private
      practice group includes as-needed acetaminophen 325 mg and as-needed
      acetaminophen/hydrocodone 7.5 mg/325 mg. If it can be demonstrated that use of 650 mg
      acetaminophen in scheduled doses of every 6 hours can decrease postoperative opiate use in
      the first week without significantly increase in patient pain, this may be deployed as an
      effective strategy of pain control as the use of opiates has come under scrutiny and attempts
      are being made to decrease or limit the use of these medications in the medical setting.

      This study would look to demonstrate that scheduled doses of acetaminophen as opposed to
      reactionary as-needed acetaminophen can control post-operative pain to the point where
      narcotics would not be necessary.
