  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability. A major unresolved
      problem in MRI-based stroke assessment is to relate image features to brain function in a way
      that can properly guide stratification for treatment and rehabilitation. This requires
      extracting meaningful and reproducible models of brain function from stroke images, a
      daunting task severely hindered by the great variability of lesion frequency and pattern.
      Large datasets are imperative to uncover possible lesion-function relationships.

      In this project the investigators will create a large database of acute strokes MRIs. The
      investigators will retrospectively archive an estimated 3,000 MRIs of patients with acute
      stroke, acquired at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, 2009-2019. This dataset will include 1.5 and
      3 Tesla scans, diverse protocols and sequences (e.g., diffusion and perfusion weighted images
      (DWI/b0, PWI), T1, T2, FLAIR, susceptibility weighted images), with typical clinical low
      voxel resolution (4-7 mm3). Lesions will be initially delineated on DWI/b0, the most
      informative MRI sequence for acute stroke. After anonymization and defacing, two trained
      evaluators will perform the manual lesion segmentation. Two expert neuroradiologists will
      create consensual structured radiological reports with information about stroke type and
      location according to different criteria (e.g., 34 brain structures and 11 vascular
      territories). The investigators will also archive structured information from discharge
      (demographics, laboratory, and neurological evaluation of patients, including NIH stroke
      scale and modified Rankin scale, mRS), as well as the 90-days follow-up mRS.
