  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of umbralisib and ublituximab (U2) as salvage
      therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have progressed either on a
      BTK inhibitor (BTKi) or BCL-2 inhibitor. The study will evaluate this combination in two
      parallel cohorts and subjects will be assigned based on which class of novel agent-containing
      regimen was used prior. Cohort A will consist of patients who progress after BTKi containing
      regimens and Cohort B will consist of patients who progress after a BCL-2 containing regimen.
      Subjects who progress on a regimen containing both a BTKi and a BCL-2 inhibitor, will be
      enrolled in cohort B. Each cohort will be evaluated independently of each other.

      This is a single-center, two cohort Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of
      umbralisib and ublituximab in patients with progressive CLL. Cohort A will consist of
      patients who who have progressed after receiving either a BTK inhibitor (BTKi) or BCL-2
      inhibitor.

             criteria.

          -  Patient must have progressed on a BTK or BCL-2 containing regimen as the prior line of
             therapy. Patients who were treated with a regimen containing both classes of novel
             agents will be allowed to enroll and will be enrolled into Cohort B. Patients who
             receive a temporizing non-experimental treatment such as an anti-CD20 monoclonal
             antibody, corticosteroid including high dose methylprednisolone after progression on a
             BTK or BCL-2 inhibitor will be considered for enrollment after discussion with the
             study sponsor.

             will be defined as discontinuing prior BTKi or BCL-2 therapy for any reason without
             evidence of progression. Patients who were re-challenged after discontinuation for
             therapeutic reasons will be allowed if the toxicity did not recur or was managed
             without indication for discontinuation. Patients who progress on BTKi or BCL-2 therapy
