      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of NYX-2925 in subjects with neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy.

      The study will be 15-18 weeks in duration, including a 1-4 week screening period (dependent
      upon duration of analgesic medication washout period), followed by a 14 week double-blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled treatment period. Subjects eligible for the study will receive
      either NYX-2925 or placebo during the treatment period. All subjects will receive placebo at
      some point during the treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. An Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent and privacy language
             (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)) authorization must be
             obtained from the subject prior to performing any study-related procedures.

          2. Consent to being included in a research subject database.

          3. ≥18 and ≤75 years of age.

          4. Type 2 Diabetes.

          5. Score of ≥5 and ≤9 on the 11-point NRS for average neuropathic pain intensity over the
             past 24 hours at Visit 1.

          6. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤11% (measured at Visit 1).

          7. Stable use of diabetic medications beginning 1 month prior to Visit 1.

          8. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, of symmetrical nature and in lower extremities, for ≥4
             years.

          9. Pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, of symmetrical nature and in lower
             extremities, for ≥2 years.

         10. Score of ≥3 on the Physical Assessment Total Score of the Michigan Neuropathy
             Screening Instrument.

          2. Pain that cannot be clearly differentiated from, or could interfere with, the
             assessment of peripheral diabetic neuropathy.

          3. Neurologic disorders unrelated to diabetic neuropathy that could interfere with
             reporting of pain due to diabetic neuropathy.

          4. History of hypoglycemia that disturbed consciousness, or ketoacidosis requiring
             hospitalization within the past 3 months.

          5. History of severe renal impairment.

          6. Known history of significant cardiovascular condition

          7. Pulse rate &lt;45 bpm or &gt;90 bpm.

          8. History of Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple
             sclerosis, or a history of seizures, epilepsy, or stroke.

          9. Ongoing clinically significant infectious disease.

         10. Concomitant use of protocol specified prohibited medications.

         11. History of a substance use disorder.

         12. Positive urine drug screen or positive breathalyzer test for alcohol

         13. Sensitivity or allergy to, or concomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ligands

         14. Use of NMDAR-binding drugs within 30 days prior to dosing or during the study.
