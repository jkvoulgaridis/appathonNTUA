  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different studies for cardiac ganglionated plexus（GP） ablation to treat vagal vascular
      syncope, sinus node dysfunction, and functional atrioventricular block have been published.
      Investigators have developed a more specific approach of cardiac, called cardioneuroablation
      . This treatment is based on a high-frequency stimulation (HFS) and/or anatomical landmarks
      to identify GPs in left atrium，which being targeted by radiofrequency catheter ablation. The
      feasibility of GPs ablation/cardioneuroablation has already been tested in our center in
      former studies in humans,with a favorable outcome for the patients involved. The results of
      the former studies have been submitted for publication. However, there are no prospective
      randomized studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atrial ganglionated plexus ablation
      for SSS before permanent pacemaker implantation.

      The purpose of this study of GAPS in humans is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      cardioneuroablation in patients of sick sinus syndrome before they receive a permanent
      pacemaker.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter,prospective, open, interventional study. All patients will undergo
      permanent pacemaker implantation. The study will involve eight different steps, from the
      screening procedure through study completion: screening, enrollment, pharmacological testing,
      randomization of group allocation, preprocedural assessment, procedure, follow-up, study
      completion. The dedicated study members (cardiac electrophysiologists, statisticians) and the
      PI are responsible for recording all data from the trial on the case report forms (CRFs) and
      completing the study database. The participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to
      either GPs ablation followed by permanent pacemaker implantation or pacemaker alone.
      Randomization will be conducted centrally by an independent statistics department(Oxford
      Medical Center of National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China) and stratified
      by center and age(&lt;50 or &gt;=50 years); A dedicated independent physician will be responsible
      for the safety monitoring. The PI will permit inspection of the trial files and the database
      by national or international official controlling scientific authorities, if required. The PI
      will review and monitor completed CRFs and the database at regular intervals throughout the
      trial.

    <description>The cardioneuroablation will be performed under conscious sedation. After 3-dimensional endocardial surface of the LA and pulmonary veins have been constructed by Ensite system, the GP sites can be located in LA；High frequecy stimulation（HFS）will be used to conform if there is a positive vagal response at each GP site. The upper limits of power and temperature will be set to 30-40 W and 43-60°C, respectively. And if no vagal response been induced during ablation, radiofrequency will be delivered for 30 seconds and stopped in this site. The end point of the ablation procedure will be that no vagal response could be induced by repeat HFS.
After ablation of GPs, the participants will receive permanent pacemaker implantation(see arm of control group).</description>

    <description>The control group only treated with permanent pacemaker without cardioneuroablation.The participants will receive permanent pacemaker implantation, the pacemaker placement will be done in accordance with standards at each center. All implanted pacemakers are provided two manufacturers (St. Jude Medical or Medtronics), His bundle pacing will be recommended in patients with a LVEF between 35%-45%. After placement of permanent pacemaker, the participants will be followed-up at 1 week, 3,6,12 months. After the permanent pacemaker implantation, the rate response function should be turned off and low pacing rate should be set at 60bpm uniformly in all the eligible participants.</description>
