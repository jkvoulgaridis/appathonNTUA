  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researcher want to learn more about the effectiveness of drug
      VITRAKVI (generic name: larotrectinib) and how well the drug is tolerated during routine use
      in patients with TRK fusion cancer which is locally advanced or spread from the place where
      it started to other places in the body. TRK fusion cancer is a term used to describe a
      variety of common and rare cancers that are caused by a change to the NTRK (Neurotrophic
      Tyrosine Kinase) gene called a fusion. During this fusion, an NTRK gene joins together, or
      fuses, with a different gene. This joining results in the activation of certain proteins (TRK
      fusion proteins), which can cause cancer cells to multiply and form a tumor. VITRAKVI is an
      approved drug that blocks the action of the NTRK gene fusion. This study will enroll adult
      and paediatric patients suffering from a solid tumor with NTRK gene fusion for whom the
      decision to treat their disease with VITRAKVI has been made by their treating physicians.
      During the study, patients' medical information such as treatment information with VITRAKVI,
      other medication or treatments, changes in disease status and other health signs and symptoms
      will be collected within the normal medical care by the treating doctor. Participants will be
      observed over a period from 24 to 60 months.
