  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the first cancer in women and 60% of new cases occurring in women 50 to 74
      years old. With about 50,000 new cases, it is the second cancer the most serious cancers. In
      the therapeutic strategy, hormone therapy takes pride of place by allowing a significant
      reduction in the recurrence rate.

      For the hormonotherapy be effective, patient compliance should be optimal during treatment.
      Different factors or barriers may lead to a lack of adherence, such as the occurrence of
      adverse effects, treatment fatigue, a difficult relationship with the health care team,
      beliefs about success or the need for treatment.

      In order to facilitate the compliance of hormonoherapy treatment by patients, it is important
      to include different health professionals such as pharmacists.

      Hormonotherapy adherence to breast cancer patients could be improved by :

        -  the use of electronic pill dispensers since the first prescription to visualize the
           level of compliance of each patient and study with her the various factors that can
           limit it.

        -  motivational, semi-directed and scheduled drug interviews at regular intervals
           throughout the study over a period of 18 months to visualize the compliance rate (ratio
           of the number of tablets taken by the patient on the number of tablets to be taken
           theoretically over the period), to evaluate the presence or absence of iatrogenesis
           specific to hormone therapy and to ensure adequate medical follow-up.
