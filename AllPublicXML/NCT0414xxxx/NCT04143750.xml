  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the mass balance and biotransformation after single-dose
      of [14C]Vicagrel orally in Chinese healthy male volunteers, revealing the overall
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of vicagrel in humans, and providing a reference for the
      rational administration.
