  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to find out which of 2 ways works best to get rural
      participants interested in joining a research study about children who weigh more than is
      considered healthy. One method researchers will use is the traditional method of reaching out
      to potential participants. The traditional method includes using flyers, posters, and
      booklets. The other method will be to target people who might be especially interested in the
      study. The second method uses medical records to find potential participants who are most
      likely to qualify for the study. This study is also being done to what works to help keep
      participants in a study like this.

      Another goal of the study is to find out what methods work well to help get and keep
      children's and caregiver's weight in the healthy range. Researchers also want to see what
      works well to help children with a high Body Mass Index be more physically active and to eat
      healthier foods. The test methods researchers will use for this part of the study are (1)
      newsletters only and (2) newsletters plus online meetings. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of the 2 groups (newsletter or newsletter plus meetings.)

      The newsletter-only group will receive monthly newsletters about children's health; this
      group will receive these letters for 6 months. The 'newsletter plus meeting group' will also
      receive the same monthly newsletter for 6 months. The latter group will also have online
      meetings with other children and adults as well as a group leader. Those in the 'newsletter
      plus meeting group' will also individually meet with a dietician.

      This study will involve children and one of their caregivers (parent/guardian). The child and
      caregiver must live in a rural area. The child must be 6 to 11 years old. The child must be
      considered to have an unhealthy weight (high Body Mass Index). Both the child and caregiver
      must speak English. Up to 224 children will enter into this study. Participants will be
      consented through 4 different sites that are part of the IDeA States Pediatric Network.

      Children and caregivers will have their height and weight measured. The study team will use
      these measurements to see if the child has a high BMI (Body Mass Index). Only children who
      have an unhealthy weight (high BMI) will be part of the study. The guardian will need to
      report what the child eats for about 6 days. The child will need to wear an activity monitor
      for about 1 week on 2 different occasions. Participants will be asked to answer survey
      questions and provide information (race, ethnic group, and similar information) about their
      families.

      Information from this study will be used to help design future, larger, research studies.

      Conduct a multisite feasibility trial for the iAmHealthy intervention with two randomized
      controlled recruitment options (consecutive recruitment and traditional recruitment). We will
      examine retention, dose, and blinding that will inform the development of a larger,
      treatment-outcome fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the iAmHealthy
      behavioral intervention in the ISPCTN.

      The study team will perform the iAmHealthy trial will be performed in four ISPCTN
      site-awardee states. Specifically, the study team will perform the iAmHealthy trial in one
      clinic per state.

      Randomization of recruitment options occurs at the clinic level. Each clinic, in a randomly
      ordered sequence, will implement two methods of recruitment. Recruitment of Participants, for
      more detail on the two methods of recruitment.

      Randomization of participants into intervention arms will occur at the individual level.

      Newsletter-only Intervention Arm

      Child/caregiver pairs in the newsletter-only intervention arm will receive:

        -  usual care at their clinic for all issues, including overweight and obesity;

        -  a monthly newsletter that focuses on general child health. The child/caregiver pairs
           will receive six newsletters (one per month) during the six month intervention period.

      iAmHealthy Behavioral Intervention Arm

      Child/caregiver pairs in the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention arm will receive:

        -  usual care at their clinic for all issues, including overweight and obesity;

        -  a monthly newsletter that focuses on general child health. The child/caregiver pairs
           will receive six newsletters (one per month) during the six month intervention period
           (same newsletter provided to the newsletter-only intervention participants);

        -  weekly group sessions for the first three months, followed by monthly group sessions
           during the next three months, for a total of 15 group sessions. The trial's iAmHealthy
           behavioral intervention psychologist or social worker (one team per clinic) will deliver
           these group sessions via an electronic tablet that the trial sponsor will supply;

        -  11 hours of individual &quot;homework&quot; sessions with the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention
           dietician.

      The iAmHealthy behavioral intervention psychologists/social worker will individualize group
      sessions and the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention dietician will adapt individual sessions
      by focusing on local cultural, religious, and ethnic factors relevant to the recommended
      changes in eating and activity habits. The iAmHealthy behavioral intervention includes 26
      contact hours (15 hours of group sessions and 11 hours of individual sessions).

      This feasibility trial will provide information toward the implementation of a fully powered,
      multisite, randomized behavior intervention trial that will compare the effectiveness of the
      iAmHealthy behavioral intervention to a newsletter-only intervention for the treatment of
      obesity among rural and underserved children and their primary caregivers.

He or she, or the designated backup, will take the height and weight measurements at baseline and six months. In case the ISPCTN site-awardee coordinator is accidentally unblinded, the backup assessor will take over all assessments for that participant.
At each measurement time point, the blinded assessor will enter data into the electronic data capture system only for that time point—the system will blind them to data from any/all other data-collection time points. The blinded site coordinator will perform the 24-hour food recalls at recruitment and six months.</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Child is rural. The child lives in a rural area, as defined by the United States
             Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (greater than
             or equal to 4). We will calculate this using the 2010 Zip Code, RUCA Code crosswalk.

          2. Child is ages 6-11 years at the time of consent. At the time of consent, a child must
             be 6 to 11 years of age. A narrow age range is necessary to decrease developmental
             variability. Clinics may enroll a child no earlier than her or his sixth birthday (6
             years, 0 months, 0 days), and may enroll a child up to her or his 12th birthday (11
             years, 11 months, 30 days).

          3. Child BMI percentile is ≥85th. We will use the 85th percentile as a minimal cutoff for
             participation, as this is the minimal criteria for the definition of overweight. There
             is no upper limit on BMI percentile for inclusion.

          4. Child and primary caregiver speak English. For the initial feasibility pilot, we will
             ask that both the child and primary caregiver speak English. For the larger trial that
             will follow, we will accommodate Spanish-speaking participants.

          5. For the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention arm, the child and primary caregiver are
             available when the behavioral intervention team offers the intervention for the
             participating clinic. The child and primary caregiver must be available for most of
             the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention sessions when the behavioral intervention
             psychologist/social worker offers the group sessions at the participants' clinic. The
             behavioral team will conduct these sessions via video conference and families will
             attend via tablets.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Child has a physical limitation or injury that substantially limits physical mobility
             or has a planned medical treatment during the course of the trial that will
             substantially limit physical mobility. Because this trial recommends physical
             activity, we will exclude children who cannot comply with this health behavior.

          2. Child has a known medical issue that could affect protocol compliance (e.g., cancer).
             If a child has a significant medical issue known to the clinic that could affect
             protocol compliance, we will exclude this child, as the protocol involves an intense
             intervention commitment.

          3. Child and/or primary caregiver has a developmental delay or cognitive impairment that
             could affect protocol compliance. We will exclude primary caregivers and/or children
             with a known developmental delay, as this could negatively affect participation and
             measurement completion.

          4. Child is enrolled in a weight-loss trial. If a child is enrolled in a weight-loss
             trial, we will exclude the child to avoid cross-pollination of trial interventions.

          5. Child has a sibling who has already enrolled in the trial. If multiple children from
             the same family attempt to enroll, the statistical team will randomly select one child
             for enrollment. We will always allow siblings to attend the intervention, but we will
             not officially enroll them.
