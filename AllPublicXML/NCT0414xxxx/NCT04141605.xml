  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect real-world clinical performance data to
      assess the clinical outcomes of patients receiving heart transplants using donor hearts
      transported via the SherpaPak CTS System. These results will be compared to outcomes of
      retrospective patients whose hearts were transported with the previous standard method.

    <textblock>
      This study is a registry study collecting data both retrospectively from patients already
      transplanted and prospectively from consecutively enrolled patients for heart
      transplantation. The study is a chart review study.

      Ongoing eligible recipients will undergo heart transplantation according to standard
      practices at each participating institution.

      This study will be conducted at an estimated 25 institutions globally and will have about 500
      patients. Subjects will be followed from transplant through one-year post-transplantation
      (i.e., 24 hours post-transplant, discharge, 30-days, and 1-year).

      GUARDIAN provides critical and contemporary data on patient outcomes, with additional insight
      into risk factors and patient-related indices. Both donor and recipient information along
      with procedural details (including transportation) will be collected to provide information
      for major discrete endpoints such as death, primary graft dysfunction, right ventricular
      dysfunction, CPB weaning and Inotrope use.

      Information about re-hospitalizations and re-transplantations is vital to address the
      integrated endpoint of days alive out of hospital, which is particularly relevant for this
      patient population. In addition, the number of in-hospital days and ICU time is closely
      tracked as the major resource utilized, after the initial transplant.

    <description>The Paragonix SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System (&quot;SherpaPak CTS&quot;) is an ultraportable hypothermic preservation and transport system intended for use with donor hearts. The device is a legally marketed, FDA cleared medical device in the United States and CE Marked medical device in the European Union.
The SherpaPak CTS consists of multiple components: 1) outer transport shipper which contains within various non-ice based temperature controlled packaging elements, 2) an inner and outer hard shell assembly which provides a rigid barrier enclosure in which the heart is immersed and suspended in a cold storage solution cleared for use in storing and transporting donor hearts, 3) a data logger that monitors and displays the temperature of the cold storage solution in which the heart is stored during transport, and 4) four size heart connectors designed to accommodate various size aortic stem diameters by which donor hearts are attached.</description>
