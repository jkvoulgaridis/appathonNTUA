  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients with sepsis undergo several physiological alterations that can alter
      the distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. Some patients with sepsis may realize
      enhanced cardiac output leading to increases in glomerular filtration that result in
      increasing drug clearance. This clinical state is referred as Augmented Renal Clearance
      (ARC). Importantly, many beta-lactam antibiotics can be adversely affected by ARC, and some
      of these agents required increasing dosage to compensate for enhanced clearance.
      Imipenem-relebactam is a new broad spectrum antibiotic. This study is designed to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of both components, imipenem and relebactam, in critically ill patients with
      ARC.

      This is a single center, open-label study to determine imipenem-relebactam pharmacokinetics
      in critically ill patients with Augmented Renal Clearance (ARC). Twelve patients with
      suspected ARC will be enrolled to ensure complete pharmacokinetic data in at least eight
      patients with confirmed ARC. Confirmation of ARC will be established by eight hour urine
      creatine determination. Each participant will receive a single dose of imipenem-relebactam
      (500mg/250mg) followed by six blood samples over a 6 hour interval to determine
      concentrations. Non-compartmental and population pharmacokinetic analyses will be determined
      to assess the effects of ARC on imipenem and relebactam pharmacokinetic parameters.

             one of the following criteria within the past 72 hours:

               1. Documented fever (oral, rectal, tympanic, or core temperature &gt; 38.5° C)
