  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of providing information about
      radiotherapy using virtual reality and to see whether it would improve the productivity of
      medical staff, improve patient experience and satisfaction, and reduce patient's anxiety
      prior to radiotherapy.

      All patients enrolled in this study will receive the same routine explanation all
      radiotherapy patients receive currently. However, prior to the routine explanation,
      additional detailed information regarding radiotherapy (from simulation to treatment) will be
      given in two different ways.

      VR arm: The patients who are allocated to the VR arm will receive information about
      radiotherapy via virtual reality.

      Printed document arm: The patients who are allocated to the Printed document arm will receive
      information about radiotherapy via printed document.

      Patients will answer the questionnaire related to the anxiety scale related to radiotherapy
      and measure the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse rate, and the respiratory rate.
      Also, patients will answer the questions about radiotherapy to assess the understanding of
      radiotherapy and questionnaire on hospital satisfaction.
