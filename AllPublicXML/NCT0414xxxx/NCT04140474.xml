  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study protocol is to evaluate the feasibility of biopsies using the new
      system called Archimedes® in 12 patients with solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) suspicious of
      malignancy not accessible through current bronchoscopy techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the improvement of screening techniques, the detection of peripheral and isolated
      lesions is an increasingly frequent situation. However these SPN cause difficulties in
      obtaining a sample. Indeed, current endoscopic techniques remain insufficient in terms of
      performance. Moreover, computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle biopsy despite a very
      good sensitivity has many limitations related to the size of the lesions, the accessibility
      and important complications. The Archimedes® system is an improved version of LungPoint® and
      combines 3D reconstruction of chest images with intraoperative radioscopy. It uses a catheter
      to access through the bronchial wall the pulmonary parenchyma and navigate to the SPN. All
      included patients will receive anesthesia consultation, biological assessment and chest CT
      scan in thin sections. A surgical treatment will always be planned after presentation of the
      file in a meeting of multidisciplinary consultation of thoracic oncology. The Archimedes®
      procedure will be performed during a bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Immediate
      monitoring consisted in a chest x-ray 1hour after the procedure. Patients' participation in
      the study will stop once they benefit from their thoracic surgery

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 to 75 years with a suspicious nodule of malignancy (primary lung
             tumor or metastasis of another solid tumor whose largest diameter is greater than or
             equal to 8 mm):
