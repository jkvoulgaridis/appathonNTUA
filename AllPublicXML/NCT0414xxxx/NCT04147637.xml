  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glucose monitoring systems have revolutionized diabetes care and enabled people with
      diabetes to achieve better diabetes control with reduced risk of hypoglycaemia. Continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time glucose monitoring and alarms when glucose
      approaches extreme readings (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia) or when the change in glucose
      is rapid. All available CGM systems, except Dexcom G6, require daily calibrations with
      capillary glucose readings in order to attain accuracy of glucose readings. Decom G6 system
      is not widely accessible and only available in certain countries. Flash glucose monitoring
      systems (Flash) provide glucose readings when users actively scan their sensors. FreeStyle
      Libre (FSL) is the only Flash glucose monitoring system currently available in market. FSL is
      factory calibrated and sensors are ready to use after placement and initiation. The two main
      differences between Flash and CGM are user interaction and the alarm facility. While CGM
      provide real-time glucose readings, Flash is user-dependent for actively scanning and
      understanding the readings. Moreover, CGM systems provide alarms for low or high glucose and
      for rapid glucose changes, while Flash does not routinely provide alarms. This is
      particularly relevant when patients have impaired or lost hypoglycaemia awareness. CGM
      systems are costlier compared to Flash, which has contributed to the wider adoption of FSL.

      Several Bluetooth adjuncts have been introduced to market for FSL. These devices attach to
      Libre sensor and connect to the user's mobile phone via Bluetooth. This enables continuous
      and real-time feed of glucose readings from the sensor to patient's mobile phone, which
      enables a wide range of customizable alarms for high and low glucose levels and for rapid
      glucose changes. This setup also enables calibration of Libre sensor with capillary glucose
      which, anecdotally, has been reported to improve sensor accuracy. None of these adjuncts have
      been validated clinically. FSL with Bluetooth adjunct such as MiaoMiao remain cheaper than
      current CGM options and could be more accessible in some countries than CGM. However, without
      robust evidence to support effectiveness and safety of such setup it is not possible to
      recommend this.

      The Objective of this study is to determine whether FSL with Bluetooth Adjunct is superior to
      FSL alone in accuracy and reduction of hypoglycaemia burden.

      Study design:

      Open-label, crossover, single center, randomized controlled trial of FreeStyle Libre with
      MiaoMiao Bluetooth transmitter adjunct with calibrations (FSL-M) compared to FreeStyle Libre
      alone (FSL-A) in people with T1DM.

      Protocol summary:

      Following informed written consent, subjects will be randomized to either FSL-M group using
      FSL with Miaomio and Tomato App premium version, or FSL-A with Libre Link app (stage 1).
      Subjects will spend 8 weeks in the assigned group followed by 2 weeks washout then subjects
      will switch over to the other group for further 8 weeks (stage 2).

      While in FSL-M, subjects will be asked to calibrate FSL with daily capillary glucose values
      using Contour Plus, or on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 13 of sensor life. Alarms for low glucose
      (&lt;3.9mmol/L, &lt;70mg/dL) and high glucose (&gt;13.9mmol/L, 250mg/dL) will be set in Tomato App.

      7-point capillary glucose profiles will be carried out by subjects in both groups on days
      2/3, 5/6, 9/10, 13/14 of each sensor life to enable paired comparison with sensor values.

      Subjects will have routine labs at randomization, end of stage 1, and end of stage 2. All
      subjects will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: GOLD, Problem Areas in
      Diabetes (PAID) and Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) at randomization, at end of stage1 and
      end of stage 2. The group randomized to FSL-M at stage 1 will have qualitative interview at
      randomization, end of stage 1 and end of stage 2.

      All adverse events will be collected including, but not limited to, all hypoglycaemia,
      diabetic ketoacidosis, hospital admissions for any reason, and device related skin reaction
      for the duration of the study in all subjects in both groups.

      Data analysis will be carried out on glucose data retrieved from Libre view web-platform and
      Tomato App downloads in addition to Contour Plus meter downloads.
