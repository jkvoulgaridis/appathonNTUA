      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the safety profile of each of the 3 dosages of vYF and of YF-VAX® within the
           28 days post-vaccination and up to the 6 months (Day 180) post-vaccination visit

        -  To describe the antibody responses elicited by each of the 3 dosages of vYF and by
           YF-VAX on Day 0 pre-vaccination and then on Day 10, Day 14, Day 28 and 6 months (Day
           180) post-vaccination overall and by baseline flavivirus serostatus

        -  To quantify the detectable yellow fever (YF) vaccinal viremia in each vaccine groups
           (vYF and YF-VAX) in a subset of subjects on Day 0 visit, Day 1 visit, Day 3 visit, Day 5
           visit, Day 7 visit, Day 10 visit, and Day 14 visit.
