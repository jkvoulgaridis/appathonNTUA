  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objects of this research are to investigate the ability of the motor learning and test
      the possible differences between younger and older healthy human, and between non-pain and
      acute experimental pain and chronic clinical pain conditions.

      The project consists of four experimental studies. In the first experiment, younger and older
      healthy human subjects are involved in a short-term neuromuscular training on the accuracy
      and precision of knee movement to investigate the possible age effect of the motor learning.
      The second experiment focuses on the experimental pain on the learning effect of the younger
      subjects. The third experiment will investigate a group of knee osteoarthritis patients to
      show the influence of chronic pain on the motor training compared with age-, gender-matched
      pain free subjects. 3D camera tracking system will be used to record the knee movements at
      the baseline and after 6-day motor task training. The variability in amplitude of the values
      of knee movements was transformed to percentage in relation to the target position (accuracy)
      or to the mean position (precision). The results of the study will contribute to both basic
      and clinical understanding of the mechanisms related to knee movement control and influences
      of varies painful conditions.

Using 3D camera to calculate the accuracy and precision of knee movements at 30, 45, 60 degree respectively both with and without visual feedback (baseline), before and after motor training, also before and after injection.</description>

    <description>Immediately following the injection, participants will be instructed to rate the pain intensity for ten minutes using a digital visual analogue scale (VAS; eVas Software: Aalborg University, Denmark), on a tablet.The scale will be measured from 0 to10, where 0 represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'worst pain imaginable'.</description>
