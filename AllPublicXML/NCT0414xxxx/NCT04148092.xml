      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter expanded access study to provide patients who
      have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and
      have received treatment with at least 2 prior Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
      therapies early access to ripretinib until such time that ripretinib becomes commercially
      available or the Sponsor chooses to discontinue the program.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of informed consent

          2. Histologic diagnosis of GIST

          3. Patients must have received prior treatment with at least 2 of the FDA-approved drugs
             for GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib.

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             Screening.

          5. Patients of reproductive potential must agree to follow the contraception
             requirements.

          6. Patient is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the
             ICF. A signed ICF must be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed.

          7. Adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve as determined by the Investigator at
             Screening.

          8. Resolution to Grade 1 or baseline of all serious toxicities from prior therapy prior
             to initiating treatment with ripretinib

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Eligible to participate in another ongoing clinical study in which the patient may
             have access to ripretinib

          2. Received treatment with anticancer therapy, including investigational therapy, or
             investigational procedures within 7 days or 5 × the half-life (whichever is longer)
             prior to the first dose of ripretinib. For prior biological therapies (eg, monoclonal
             antibodies with a half-life longer than 3 days), the interval must be at least 28 days
             prior to the first dose of ripretinib.

          3. Received prior treatment with ripretinib

          4. Known active central nervous system metastases

          5. With a concurrent malignancy for which treatment is being received that may interfere
             with the potential benefits of ripretinib to the patient

          6. Undergone major surgeries (eg, abdominal laparotomy) within 4 weeks of the first dose
             of ripretinib. Following major surgeries, &gt; 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             ripretinib, all surgical wounds must be healed and free of infection or dehiscence.

          7. Any other clinically significant comorbidities which in the judgment of the
             Investigator, could predispose the patient to safety risks

          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C infection only if the patient is
             taking medications that must be avoided or taken with caution per protocol, active
             hepatitis B, or active hepatitis C infection

          9. If female, the patient is pregnant or lactating.

         10. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational product.
             Patients with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome on a prior tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor are excluded.

         11. Gastrointestinal abnormalities including but not limited to:

               -  inability to take oral medication

               -  malabsorption syndromes

               -  requirement for intravenous alimentation

         12. Any active bleeding excluding hemorrhoidal or gum bleeding
