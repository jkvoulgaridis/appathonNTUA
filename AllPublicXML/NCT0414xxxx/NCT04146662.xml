  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer can arise from polyps, which can become cancerous. Polyps are little outgrowths
      within the lining of the bowel (similar to skin warts). Depending on their size and their
      potential to become cancerous, they can cause bleeding. However, it is not known which polyps
      harbour cancerous potential. Therefore, at present all patients undergo a colonoscopy (camera
      examination of the large bowel) in order to identify and remove any polyps. However, not all
      patients who undergo a colonoscopy will have polyps. Moreover, colonoscopies are invasive and
      disruptive to patients, as they require bowel preparation. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate non-invasive stool and urine tests to identify patients who are at risk of polyps
      and if the polyps have the potential to become cancerous. This in turn, will significantly
      reduce the number of 'unnecessary' polyp surveillance colonoscopies with resultant benefits
      to both patients and the NHS.
