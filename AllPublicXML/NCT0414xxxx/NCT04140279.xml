  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of latanoprostene bunod (LBN)
      ophthalmic solution 0.024% (a single dose and 7 days of once daily [QD] dosing) on 2 aspects
      of aqueous humor (AqH) dynamics (episcleral venous pressure [EVP] and outflow facility) in
      participants with ocular hypertension (OHT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive both the investigational (LBN ophthalmic solution 0.024%) and
      placebo treatments, with 1 eye receiving LBN 0.024% and the contralateral eye receiving
      placebo. Each participant will be randomized as to which eye (right or left) will receive LBN
      0.024% versus placebo.

      All participants will undergo a minimum 14-day to maximum 42-day washout period prior to the
      start of study drug administration.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Episcleral Venous Pressure (EVP) at Intervals on Days 1 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, and 5 hours post-instillation at Day 1 and 12, 16, and 20 hours post-instillation at Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>EVP will be measured non-invasively by using a custom-designed slit-lamp mounted venomanometer. This device utilizes the pressure chamber technique, in which a clear flexible balloon is placed against the surface of the eye, and the pressure is increased until an episcleral vein is noted to blanche. Each EVP measurement will be determined from the mean of up to 3 readings. EVP (millimeters of mercury [mmHg]) will be assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post instillation for changes from baseline following a single dose of drug on the first day of treatment and at approximately 12, 16 and 20 hours post-instillation after 7 days of QD in the evening treatment.</description>

    <description>EVP will be measured non-invasively by using a custom-designed slit-lamp mounted venomanometer. This device utilizes the pressure chamber technique, in which a clear flexible balloon is placed against the surface of the eye, and the pressure is increased until an episcleral vein is noted to blanche. Each EVP measurement will be determined from the mean of up to 3 readings. Diurnal EVP will be computed for Days 1 and 8 separately as the mean of the posttreatment values observed on the day for each eye. Change from the mean of 2 sets of baseline measurements will be computed for each post-treatment time (including diurnal means) as the post-treatment value minus the baseline value for each eye. The difference between treatments (LBN minus placebo) in change from baseline will be computed for each participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trabecular Outflow Facility at Intervals on Days 1 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, and 5 hours post-instillation at Day 1 and 12, 16, and 20 hours post-instillation at Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Outflow facility will be measured non-invasively by using constant weight tonography. Four-minute tracings with a 5.5-gram or 7.5-gram weight or two-minute tracings with a 10-gram weight will be used, and tonographic outflow facility will be calculated from the pressure decay curves and standard tables. Outflow facility (mmHg) will be assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post instillation for changes from baseline following a single dose of drug on the first day of treatment and at approximately 12, 16 and 20 hours post-instillation after 7 days of QD in the evening treatment.</description>
