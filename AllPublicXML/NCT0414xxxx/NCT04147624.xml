  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test whether the 12-month daily intake of a specific
      multi-nutrient is safe and effective at delaying or reversing the effects of normal aging on
      memory, and other thinking abilities.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Cognitive Battery Attention Measure: Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test has a total test score based on algorithm derived from a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Raw scores range from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate better ability to sustain attention and inhibit impulses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the NIH Cognitive Battery Processing Speed Test: Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Cognitive Battery Processing Speed Test: Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test has raw scores ranging from 0 to 130 and reflects the total number of correct responses within 90 seconds. Higher scores indicate better pattern comparison processing speed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the NIH Cognitive Battery Working Memory Test: List Sorting Working Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Cognitive Battery Working Memory Test: List Sorting Working Memory Test has raw scores ranging from 0 to 28 and are calculated based on the number of correctly sequenced items across two-category trials. Higher scores indicate better list sorting working memory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the Delayed Recall Score of the Ray Verbal Learning Test (DR-RVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DR-RVLT has raw scores ranging from 0 to 15 and is based on the total number of words reproduced. Higher scores indicate better delayed non-contextual verbal memory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-R): Total Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BVMT-R: Total Recall follows three learning trials producing raw scores ranging from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating better visual learning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-R): Delayed Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BVMT-R: Delayed Recall has raw scores ranging from 0 to 12 and reflect accurate recall of shapes and their positioning on the page relative to other figures. Higher scores on delayed recall indicate better visual memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the Boston Naming Test (BNT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BNT is a measure of cognitive word retrieval by the naming a picture presented. The possible total score for the test ranges from 0-30 with the higher score indicating better word retrieval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normal cognitive aging using the Verbal Fluency Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal Fluency test assesses phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks by generating as many words as possible in one minute. Scoring will be based on the number of words generated per minute. A higher score indicates increased verbal fluency.</description>
