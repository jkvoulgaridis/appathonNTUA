      Intention to review patient letters from sleep clinic to see if their lung function fit in
      with Dysynapsis in wheezing patients or if it is true asthma

      There is no evidence that the World Wide prevalence of asthma is declining. There is some
      evidence that this Western disease may give the appearance of declining prevalence due to
      improved healthcare. However evidence from the Office of National Statistics suggests that
      the mortality rate for asthma may be increasing year on since 2007 until 2017. The true
      burden of asthma in the United Kingdom is difficult to ascertain.

      Obesity has effects on lung function which lead to low functional residual capacity and low
      end reserve volume. This leads to rapid shallow breaths near to the airway closing pressure
      and lung closing volume as illustrated in this review. This suggests that obesity itself may
      be a source of breathlessness.

      High Body Mass Index (BMI) has been shown to be associated with asthma. It was also
      associated with wheeze that is not asthma. This finding suggests that obesity in itself may
      be linked to wheeze which is not asthma. It has been shown in children that sleep disordered
      breathing is associated with asthma as well as wheeze. Obese children are known to display
      dysanapsis (airway cross sectional area is small for the size of the lung) whether associated
      with or without asthma, however if associated with asthma, the severity of asthma can be
      worse.

      AIM: To investigate if asthma is truly associated with Sleep disordered breathing in adult
      subjects. To investigate if there is an association of wheeze with dysanapsis in patients
      with sleep disordered breathing

      NULL HYPOTHESIS: There is no difference between subjects who have sleep disordered breathing
      with asthma and those subjects who have sleep disordered breathing without asthma, with
      respect to lung function parameters.

      Methods

      Initially the investigators' aim is to interrogate clinical records and look at lung function
      testing in subjects with and without asthma who attend the sleep disordered breathing clinic.
      The investigators intend to investigate 100 with asthma in the sleep clinic and 100 without
      asthma in the sleep clinic. The Investigators will also look at eosinophil results of those
      with asthma compared to those without asthma and any markers of atopy.

      The investigators will use Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to undertake
      simple frequency analysis and cross tabs as well as odds ratio from binary logistic
      regression.
