  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is in one single group of participants with advanced solid tumors who have not
      been cured by other treatments. It is the first time the drug will be used in humans, and
      will be in two parts.

      The primary purpose of the parts are:

        -  Dose Escalation Part: To evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the
           maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose for expansion of DS-7300a.

        -  Dose Expansion Part: To investigate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of
           DS-7300a.

      This study is expected to last approximately 3.5 years from the time the first participant is
      enrolled to the time the last participant is off the study.

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants who continue to
      benefit from the study treatment may continue, unless:

        -  they withdraw

        -  their disease gets worse

        -  they experience unacceptable side effects.
