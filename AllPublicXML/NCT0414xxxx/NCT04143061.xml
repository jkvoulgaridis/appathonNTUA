  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of immunogenicity
      of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to Menactra® in adolescents and
      children aged 2 to 17 years in terms of serum bactericidal assay using human complement
      (hSBA) titers.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the antibody titers to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before
           and at Day 30 after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a licensed
           meningococcal vaccine in adults in India aged 18 to 55 years (Menactra®) or ≥ 56 years
           (Quadri Meningo™)

        -  To describe the antibody titers to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before
           and at Day 30 after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menactra® in children
           and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years in India and/or Republic of South Africa (RSA)

    <masking_description>This trial is a modified double-blind trial, which means that the participant's parent / legally acceptable representative, the Investigator, and other study personnel remain unaware of the treatment assignments throughout the trial. An unblinded vaccine administrator administer the appropriate vaccine but is not involved in safety data collection. The Sponsor and laboratory personnel performing the serology testing are also blinded to treatment assignments throughout the trial until database lock.</masking_description>
