  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim is to assess the role of microglial activation and norepinephrine
      transporter binding in pathogenesis of MS-related fatigue, using novel Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) radiotracers, [F-18]PBR06 and [C-11]MRB.

      Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship of cerebral microglial activation, as assessed
      by [F-18]PBR06 PET, with MS-related fatigue.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the relationship of norepinephrine transporter (NET) binding, as
      assessed by [C-11]MRB PET, with MS-related fatigue.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the relationship of microglial activation and NET binding, with
      grey matter pathology (lesion load and brain atrophy) assessed using 7T MRI, and evaluate
      their independent contribution in development of MS-related fatigue.

  <detailed_description>

      Design: This is a single center, cross-sectional study of patients with multiple sclerosis,
      who will each, undergo both, [C-11]MRB-PET (norepinephrine transporter binding) and
      [F-18]PBR06-PET (microglial activation), in addition to 7 Tesla brain MRIs. Patients will
      also undergo cross-sectional estimations of blood markers.

      Genotype Testing:

      Blood sample drawn on the initial screening visit will be used to obtain genomic DNA for
      genotyping for polymorphism within the TSPO gene on chromosome 22q13.2, using a Taqman assay.
      High affinity and medium affinity binders will be included while the low affinity binders
      will be excluded from the study.

      PET Scanning:

      During the PET scan visits, all women subjects of child bearing age will undergo a stat
      quantitative serum hCG pregnancy test and only women with a negative test will undergo the
      radiopharmaceutical injection. The radiotracers will be produced using standardized
      procedures. At the time of imaging, the subjects will be positioned in the gantry of a
      high-resolution PET/CT camera. Head alignment will be made, relative to the canthomeatal
      line, using projected laser lines whose positions are known with respect to the slice
      positions of the scanner. A head support apparatus will be used to minimize head
      motion.Dynamic data over 120 minutes for PET quantification will be acquired, according to
      previously described methods for both tracers.

      MRI Scanning:

      High resolution MRI scanning will be performed using the 7T Siemens MAGNETOM Terra MRI unit
      at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital (BWH).

      Serum assays:

      Serum measurements for inflammatory markers and relevant neurochemicals will be performed
      according to established procedures.

      Clinical Data

      The following non-imaging, clinical data will be obtained:

      Modified fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) Fatigue Severity Status Scale (FSSS) Expanded Disability
      Status Scale (EDSS) Timed 25-feet walk (T25W) MS Functional Composite (MSFC) Symbol digit
      modalities test (SDMT) MSQOL-54 scale (QOL) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Beck's
      Depression Inventory (BDI) Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D)
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
