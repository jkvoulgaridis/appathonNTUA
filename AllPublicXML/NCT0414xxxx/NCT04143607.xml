             preclude adequate absorption of ASK120067.

          6. Any of the following cardiac criteria:Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470

             risk of arrhythmic events or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
             first-degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval.
