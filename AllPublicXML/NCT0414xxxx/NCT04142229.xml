  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is a randomized crossover trial that will compare the efficacy and
      safety of an automated insulin delivery (AID) system in patients with type 1 diabetes using a
      Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm versus sensor augmented pump therapy
      (SAP)/Predictive Low Glucose Suspend (PLGS), and will include different stress induction and
      assessments over a 4 week period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: 1) AID for two
      weeks and SAP/PLGS for two weeks , or 2) SAP/PLGS for two weeks and AID for two weeks. During
      the 4-week trial, subjects will wear the Empatica E4 wristband every day to record
      electrodermal activity, accelerometer and heartrate data. Subjects will also complete
      logbooks to record activity and stress. During each two-week period, subjects will come to
      the clinical center twice for stress induction tests in a medically supervised setting.
