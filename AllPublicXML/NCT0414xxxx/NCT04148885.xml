    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the male genitourinary system.
      In 2017, the American Oncology Society will report that 161,360 new prostate cancers were
      estimated, accounting for 21% of male tumors, ranking first in male new tumors; 26,730 death,
      cancer death. The rate is second only to bronchial lung cancer and colorectal cancer. In
      China, although the incidence of prostate cancer is lower than the world epidemiological
      level, the incidence of prostate cancer in China has shown an increasing trend in recent
      years. The latest statistics from the National Cancer Center 2017, the incidence of male
      prostate cancer is 2.4%, which is a male malignant tumor. Seventh place in the disease. The
      taxane drug docetaxel showed good anti-tumor activity in castration resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) patients, and paclitaxel combined with carboplatin also had a certain effect on CRPC.
      However, in clinical practice, patients with prostate cancer are mostly old, often
      accompanied by other underlying diseases, poor physical status, and poor tolerance in the use
      of docetaxel and paclitaxel. Albumin-bound paclitaxel has more tumor-targeted enrichment than
      traditional paclitaxel and is less toxic. Therefore, this study intends to explore the
      efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the treatment of
      CRPC, providing a reference for the treatment options of CRPC in clinical practice.
