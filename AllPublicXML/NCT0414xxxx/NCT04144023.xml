    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of a vaccine called H2NVAC before
      surgery in treating patients with HER2 expressing ductal carcinoma in situ. H2NVAC is a
      vaccine designed to stimulate specialized white blood cells in hopes of increasing immune
      response and protecting against breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of multi-epitope HER2 peptide vaccine H2NVAC
      (H2NVAC) given every 2 weeks for 4 cycles in patients with HER2 expressing ductal carcinoma
      in situ (DCIS) prior to surgery.

      II. To determine the dose level of H2NVAC with maximum systemic and intratumoral
      immunogenicity as measured by activated HER2-specific T lymphocytes or high-affinity
      antibodies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine intratumoral immunogenicity of H2NVAC in patients with HER2-expressing DCIS.

      II. To assess the complete pathological response after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant H2NVAC.

      III. To assess the systemic immunogenicity of H2NVAC in patients with HER2-expressing DCIS.

      IV. To assess changes in HER2 expression in the DCIS after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant H2NVAC.

      V. To assess the distribution of the helper T cell response among T helper cell
      differentiation states.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of multi-epitope HER2 peptide vaccine H2NVAC.

      Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating
      factor (GM-CSF) admixed with multi-epitope HER2 peptide vaccine H2NVAC intradermally on day
      1. Treatments repeat every 14 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after
      surgery and optionally at 18 and 24 months after surgery.
