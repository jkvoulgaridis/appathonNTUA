  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotion regulation difficulties appear to play a role in the development and maintenance of
      several eating disorders. This pilot study aims at examining whether a short add-on group
      skills training in emotion regulation for young adults with different eating disorders is
      feasible in a psychiatric clinical setting. We also investigate if the treatment increases
      knowledge of emotions, and decreases self-reported difficulties with emotion regulation,
      alexithymia, symptoms of eating disorder, anxiety and depression, as well as clinical
      impairment.

      Six skills training groups were piloted with a total of 29 participants (M = 21.41 years, SD
      = 1.92). The treatment consists of five sessions dealing with psychoeducation about emotions
      and emotion regulation skills training. Paired samples t-test was used to compare differences
      between before-and-after measures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale measures difficulties with emotion regulation. It contains a total of 36 items that are rated on a Likert scale between 1-5. Total score ranges between 36-180 with higher scores indicating more difficulties with emotion regulation. The scale has 6 subscales: nonacceptance (ranging from 6-30); goals (ranging from 5-25); impulse (ranging from 6-30); awareness (ranging from 6-30); strategies (ranging from 8-40) and clarity (ranging from 5-25).</description>

    <measure>Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Toronto Alexithymia Scale measures alexithymia. It contains a total of 20 items with 3 subscales (difficulties describing feelings: 7 items ranging from 7-35, difficulties identifying feelings: 5 items ranging from 5-25 and externally oriented thinking: 8 items ranging from 8-40). Total scores range from 20-100 with higher scores indicating higher levels of alexithymia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) is the self-report version of Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and measures the characteristics of eating disorders. The 6.0 version used in this study consists of 28 items. EDE-Q is scored on a 7-point Likert scale, from &quot;no days&quot; to &quot;every day&quot; and higher scores indicate higher eating pathology. The total score ranges from 0-196. The questionnaire comprises a total scale and subscales for restraint, eating concerns, shape concerns and weight concerns.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Clinical Impairment Assessment Questionnaire (CIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Impairment Assessment Questionnaire (CIA) measures the psychosocial impairment of eating disorders. It focuses on the last 28 days and consists of 16 items, graded on a Likert scale from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;A lot&quot;. Higher scores indicate higher level of secondary psychosocial impairment and the total scores ranges from 0-48. The CIA is designed to be completed immediately after filling in a measure of current eating disorder features that covers the same time frame (e.g., the EDE-Q).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, self-report version (MADRS-S).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale measures symptoms of depression. Its main purpose is to monitor the development of symptoms during treatment. The scale consists of 9 items, which are graded from zero to six. Total scores range from 0-54. Higher scores indicate higher level of depression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
