    <textblock>
      CATIS-ICAD is a clinical pilot study in which patients who have had a recent ischemic stroke,
      that is a stroke caused by a blood clot or a narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain due
      to the build up of plaque, will be randomly assigned to receive either low-dose rivaroxaban +
      aspirin or aspirin alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 40 years

          2. Recent brain ischemia attributed to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of 30-99% as
             evidenced by CT or MR angiography, occurring between 7 to 100 days prior to
             randomization and consisting of either:

               1. a high-risk TIA defined as TIA with motor and/or speech involvement or

               2. an ischemic stroke

          3. Written informed consent consistent with local regulations governing research in human
             subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Indication for DAPT for &gt; 90 days on guideline recommendations or investigator ́s
             judgment; e.g., cardiac stenting.

          2. Indication for chronic anticoagulation based on guideline recommendations or
             investigator ́s judgment; e.g. patient with prosthetic mechanical valve, venous
             thromboembolism, hypercoagulable state

          3. Atrial fibrillation or a history of atrial fibrillation

          4. Intracranial arterial occlusion (e.g. 100% stenosis) responsible for the acute brain
             ischemia

          5. Intracranial arterial stenosis secondary to causes other than atherosclerosis

          6. Extracranial carotid artery disease ipsilateral to the qualifying brain ischemia with
             a plan for carotid revascularization

          7. Intraluminal thrombus

          8. Subdural hematoma within 12 months of randomization

          9. Previous spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke (e.g. intracerebral or subarachnoid
             hemorrhage)

         10. Traumatic brain hemorrhage within 1 month of randomization

         11. Contraindication for MRI scan (e.g. pacemaker incompatible with MRI)

         12. Advanced stable kidney disease (estimated GFR &lt;30 ml per minute as assessed at local
             laboratory within 1 month of randomization)

         13. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) &gt;4 at entry

         14. Platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 at enrolment or other bleeding diathesis

         15. Uncontrollable hypertension with systolic BP/ diastolic BP consistently
             above180/100mmHg after treatment

         16. Known hypersensitivity to either ASA or rivaroxaban

         17. Life expectancy less than 6 months

         18. Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4)
             and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), i.e., human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors and
             the following azole-antimycotics agents: ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or
             posaconazole, if used systemically

         19. Female of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile, or, if sexually
             active not willing to use adequate contraceptive measures with a failure rate less
             than 1% per year (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections,
             intrauterine device, double-barrier method, male partner sterilization) before entry
             and throughout the study, as well as pregnant or breast-feeding women

         20. Inability to adhere to study procedures

         21. Close affiliation with the investigational site; e.g. a close relative of the
             investigator, dependent person (e.g., employee or student of the investigational site)

         22. Previous randomization to this study or participating in a study with an
             investigational drug or medical device at the time of randomization
