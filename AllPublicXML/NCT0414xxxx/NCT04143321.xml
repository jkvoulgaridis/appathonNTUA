      this study was aimed to evaluation of antiangial effect of a new fda drug approval on angina
      in diabetic patient with refractory angina

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized pilot trial in which a total of 75 subjects
      were enrolled with T2DM and refractory angina, despite using conventional anti-anginal
      agents; and were randomly assigned to group A(Empagliflozin group) or B(placebo group) by
      blinded envelopes method. the study was conducted in two tertiary centers in Isfahan, Iran.
      The protocol of the study was revised and approved by the institutional ethics committee of
      Isfahan University of Medical Sciences; and each patient provided an informed consent before
      participating in the study. The primary aim of the trial was to examine the efficacy of
      Empagliflozin versus placebo on angina frequency in subjects with T2DM, CAD, and chronic
      stable angina who remain symptomatic, despite treatment with either one or two anti-anginal
      agents.The secondary outcome of this study was the evaluation of Physical limitations, angina
      stability, treatment satisfaction, quality of life, and overall SAQ andeffects o
      Empaglofolzine vs placebo on treadmill exercise duration, times to angina onset and to 1mm ST
      segment depression and mean of heart rate recovery(HRR) prior to randomization and after 6
      weeks of treatment at peak drug level.
