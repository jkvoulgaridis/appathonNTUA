  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study at St. Olavs hospital in Norway. Data are gathered
      from defibrillators that have been in use during resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Aim is to
      investigate the changes in electrocardiograms (ECG) during resuscitation from pulseless
      electrical activity (PEA), which is a type of cardiac arrest. ECG changes may be useful as a
      prognostic marker during resuscitation from PEA. In addition the researchers will describe
      the effect of adrenaline and chest compressions on clinical state transitions during
      resuscitation from pulseless electrical activity. Clinical state transitions are changes
      between different types of cardiac arrest. This study is expected to increase our
      understanding of the dynamics during treatment of cardiac arrest.
