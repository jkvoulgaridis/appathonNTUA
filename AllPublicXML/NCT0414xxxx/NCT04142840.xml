      1. This clinical research aims to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on
           the treatment of emergence agitation in adult patients after general anesthesia.

        2. Half of participants will receive dexmedetomidine while the other half will receive
           propofol when emergence agitation happens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a common problem observed in pediatric patients after sevoflurane anesthesia, emergence
      agitations are investigated mainly in children.For adults,previous studies were almost about
      the efficacy of premedication on preventing emergence agitation. Once emergence agitation
      happens, there is still no guidelines established to recommend the medication usage in the
      post-anaesthesia care unit.So high-quality prospective clinical studies are required to
      provide evidence for emergence agitation treatment.

      Dexmedetomidine and propofol are both widely used in general anesthesia and can be acquired
      easily.When emergence agitation occurs,both injections are common choices in daily clinical
      administration on emergence agitation.To the investigator's knowledge ,propofol with a very
      quick onset is superior for anesthesia goals, but is without analgesia effects.While
      dexmedetomidine can produce sedation,analgesia,anxiolysis.So the investigators propose the
      hypothesis here that dexmedetomidine is prior to propofol on the treatment of emergence
      agitation in adults patients after general anesthesia.Therefore this research is undertaken
      to verify the hypothesis.

    <description>General anesthesia will be maintained by sevoflurane and remifentanil. End-tidal carbon dioxide will be controlled between 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.Mean blood pressure(MAP) will be administrated between 80% and 120% of the baseline.Heart rate is going to be maintained between 50-100 beats per minute.
In consultation with the surgeons and 5 minutes prior to the departure of the operating room,all the anesthesia agents are discontinued and the patient will be transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit.And reversal agents are given to antagonize the residual muscular relaxant.Once emergence agitation occurs,the patient assigned to the dexmedetomidine group will be infused with a single dose of 0.7ug/kg dexmedetomidine.</description>
