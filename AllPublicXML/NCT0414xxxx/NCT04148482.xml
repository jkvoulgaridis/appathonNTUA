  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary intake is a major driving force behind the escalating obesity and type 2 diabetes
      epidemics. Large, high-quality clinical trials have shown that close adherence to healthy
      dietary recommendations significantly reduce the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes,
      especially among people at increased risk. However, large inter-individual variability exists
      in response to dietary interventions. To inform more effective obesity and type 2 diabetes
      prevention strategies, it is crucial to better understand the biological, environmental, and
      social factors that influence how people interact and respond to specific foods.

      In a recent large-scale genome-wide association study, our research team has identified 96
      genomic regions associated with overall variation in dietary intake. This study provided
      evidence that inherited molecular differences are likely to impact on food intake (i.e.,
      preference for certain foods) and metabolic homeostasis (i.e., glucose regulation).
      Connecting knowledge about human genetic variants with information from circulating
      metabolites can be particularly useful in understanding the mechanisms by which some people
      experience a detrimental response to specific foods.

      The specific objective of the PREMIER study is to carry out an interventional dietary study
      to measure the response of blood glucose and other biomarkers to a standardized meal, and
      evaluate the extent to which food choices differ among individuals with distinct genetic
      susceptibility.

    <description>Record of hunger perception before and after test meals using visual analogue scales. Participants will provide ratings raging from 0 to 100 based on six questions commonly used in visual analogue scales including: &quot;How hungry do you feel?&quot; (0=not at all hungry / 100=as hungry as I've ever felt); &quot;How full do you feel?&quot; (100=not at all full / 0=as full as I have ever felt); &quot;How strong is your desire to eat?&quot; (0=very weak / 100=very strong); &quot;How much do you think you could eat now?&quot; (0=nothing at all / 100=a large amount); &quot;Urge to eat&quot; (0=no urge to eat / 100=strong, want to eat now, waiting is very uncomfortable); &quot;Preoccupation with thoughts of food&quot; (0=no thoughts of food / 100=very preoccupied difficult to concentrate on other things). The minimum and maximum values range from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher hunger perception.</description>
