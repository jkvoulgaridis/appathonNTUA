  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical effect of
      systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole therapy in conjunction with initial non-surgical
      treatment of peri-implantitis. The secondary objective is to assess the microbiological
      effectiveness of this peri-implantitis treatment approach.

      The present study is a single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Adult patients
      with at least one endosseous implant in the oral cavity with clinical and radiographical
      evidence of periimplantitis will be included in this study.

      Patients with implants affected by peri-implantitis will receive initial periodontal
      treatment existing of oral hygiene instructions and mechanical cleansing of both implants and
      remaining dentition. Immediately after initial periodontal therapy patients will be
      instructed to rinse their mouth with 0.12% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride
      without alcohol twice daily during 30 seconds for 2 weeks. Additionally patients will receive
      a recipe for medication consisting of 500 mg amoxicillin and 500 mg metronidazole to be taken
      every 8 hours for the following 7 days or no recipe.

      The main study parameter is the mean peri-implant bleeding score.

    <description>Patients will receive full-mouth mechanical cleansing of both implants and remaining dentition using ultrasonic instruments (EMS®) and hand instruments (scalers and curettes) in one or multiple sessions (max. 4). Prior to each session patients will rinse their mouth using 0.12% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride without alcohol during 30 seconds. At the final session all previously cleaned areas will be re-examined and cleaned. At the end of the final treatment session, the dental hygienist will give the patients an envelop containing a recipe for medication consisting of 500 mg amoxicillin and 500 mg metronidazole to be taken every 8 hours for the following 7 days plus a recipe for 500 ml mouthrinse (0.12% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride without alcohol, Perio-Aid®). After the final session patients will rinse their mouth using that mouthrinse twice daily during 30 seconds for 2 weeks.</description>
