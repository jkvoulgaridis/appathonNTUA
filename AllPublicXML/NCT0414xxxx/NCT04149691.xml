      01FGFR2018 is an Open-label, Multicentre, Dose Escalation Study to Assess Safety,
      Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Oral CPL304110, in Adult Subjects with Advanced Solid
      Malignancies. The study consists of 3 parts: initial dose escalation (Part 1 - without FGFR,
      fibroblast growth factor receptor, molecular aberrations), dose escalation (Part 2 - with
      FGFR molecular aberrations) and dose extension (Part 3 - with FGFR molecular aberrations).
