      New-WAVES Study seeks to expand understanding/results from prior study (NCT02585726).
      Assessing both clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction after treatment with
      Venaseal/Cyanoacrylate Adhesive Closure System

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New WAVES is an investigator initiated protocol that will assess clinical outcomes and
      patient satisfaction after treatment with VenaSeal(TM)/ Cyanoacrylate Adhesive Closure System
      3 years post-treatment. All patients treated from a multi-provider practice, whom meet
      protocol inclusion criteria, will be invited to consider participation in this study.

    <measure>Complete Closure of Target Vein(s) at 3 years after index treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Complete closure is defined as Doppler Ultrasound examination showing closure along entire treated target vein segment with no discrete segments of patency exceeding 5 cm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Venous disease severity assessed via Venous Clinical Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS). The rVCSS is an Investigator assessment of the severity of venous reflux disease, assessing signs and symptoms such as pain, varicose veins, venous edema, skin pigmentation, induration, and inflammation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Severity via Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) is a disease specific 13 item questionnaire is used to assess the impact of varicose veins on the quality of life, such as pain caused by varicose veins, and the need to take pain medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life and Patient Satisfaction of Treatment: EQ-5D Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via EQ-5D Questionnaire. The EQ-5D is a short generic quality of life survey that is commonly used outside of the United States for health technology assessments. The &quot;health state today&quot; question provides an overall assessment along a 20 cm visual analog scale (VAS) with a range from 0 (&quot;worst imaginable health state&quot;) to 100 (&quot;best imaginable health state&quot;).</description>

        Subjects will be recruited from the practice by identification of all patients treated with
        the Venaseal Closure System from October 2015 to December 31, 2016. This will include 50
        prior subjects whom participated in the WAVES trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
        NCT02585726), and up to 75 additional subjects whom also received the treatment with
        Venaseal but were not enrolled in the WAVES trial. All potential subjects for this study
        will have received treatment at Lake Washington Vascular, PLLC. Prior WAVES trial subjects
        initially enrolled will be approached with an introductory letter to be sent via e-mail or
        physical address. The correspondence will be sent to all potential study subjects
        explaining the purpose of the study and inviting them to participate. This correspondence
        will be followed up with a phone contact from study personnel.
