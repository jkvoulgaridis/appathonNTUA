    <description>Participants will receive anakinra 100mg subcutaneous ever 12 hours starting on day 2 after T cell infusion, or after 2 consecutive documented favers of &gt;/=38.5 degrees Celsius, whichever time point is earlier. Anakinra will be continued until day 10 in the absence of a fever, or until the resolution of fever, defined as temperature &lt;/= 38.0 degrees Celsius for at least 24 hours.</description>

    <description>If Cohort 1 is considered promising with respect to neurotoxicity and with complete disease response rates 30% or above, then enrollment to Cohort 2 will commence.
In Cohort 2, participants will receive anakinra 100mg subcutaneous daily on day 0 of T cell infusion and will continue daily doses until day 6. If participants experience fever or neurotoxicity between days 0 and 6 the dose of anakinra will be escalated to 100mg subcutaneous ever 12 hours, and participants will follow the same treatment schedule per Cohort 1.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (age &gt;/= 18) with a diagnosis of relapsed CD19+ B-cell ALL or NHL receiving
             commercially approved CD19-specific CAR T cells (e.g. tisagenleuleucel and
             axicabtagene) are eligible for the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled systemic fungal and bacterial infections

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived proteins

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (women who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for
             at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential)
