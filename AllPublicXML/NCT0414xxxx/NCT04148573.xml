    <textblock>
      In summary, this small-scale study is designed to demonstrate that the NFX88 is safe and well
      tolerated, as well as preliminary evidence of improvement in the score of VAS, PD-Q, and PGIC
      scales.

      This is a Phase IIa (proof of concept), randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel group, multicentric, clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of daily oral treatment with NFX88 in SCI patients who are not receiving opiates or
      cannabinoids and present neuropathic pain with an average pain score ≥ 4 measured with a VAS
      scale during the last week at screening
