  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Low back pain (LBP) is the largest cause of years lived with disability worldwide
      and often associated with low quality of life, inability to work and low physical activity
      levels. In Danish general practice, LBP accounts for nearly 10% of all yearly consultations,
      making it the number one reason for consulting a general practitioner in Denmark. An increase
      in care-seeking children and adolescents with LBP in general practice is seen in the
      pre-teen-age-years.

      At present, no study has investigated on the natural prognosis of LBP among care-seeking
      adolescents in general practice. Furthermore, the potential impact of patient and
      parent-related factors on prognosis remains unknown. The aims of the study are to 1)
      investigate the natural prognosis of LBP and 2) identify patient and parent-related factors
      which my influence prognosis.

      Methods Adolescents aged 8 to 19 years consulting their general practitioner due to LBP will
      be invited to participate in this prospective cohort study. One parent of each patient will
      be invited to be a part of the parallel cohort. Online questionnaires will be used to collect
      data on patient characterises, pain intensity, pain frequency, medication, health-related
      quality of life, physical activity and illness perception at baseline and at the one-year
      follow-up. Data on pain intensity and parent-related worries will be collected through
      biweekly text messages. LBP will be assessed by latent class analysis.

      Discussion This study will be the first to uncover the natural prognosis of LBP within a
      young, care-seeking population in general practice and to investigate if factors related to
      the patient or parents influence prognosis.
