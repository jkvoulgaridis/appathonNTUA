  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial of adolescent and young adults with advanced cancer and
      their caregivers to assess preferences for care in advanced cancer. This research study is
      examining the similarities and differences between patient's and caregiver's goals of cancer
      care.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study may include:

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Video

        -  Phone Interview

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study interventions
      including questionnaires and follow up visits.

      - Patients and their caregivers will be randomized into the same group; either ACP video
      decision aid intervention or usual care.

        -  Patients' and caregivers' knowledge, preferences (goals of care, CPR, ventilation), and
           decisional conflict be assessed before and after the ACP video decision aid intervention
           or usual care.

        -  Participants will be in this research study for up to 3 months with only 2 study visits.

        -  It is expected that about 100 people (50 patients and 50 caregivers) will take part in
           this research study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject Enrollment: All patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of
             Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (both pediatric and adult clinics) and the inpatient
             settings of Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Eligible
             study participants will give written consent to the primary investigator or study
             staff member before initiation of study procedures.

          -  Patient Eligibility criteria will include patients who are:

               -  Diagnosed with advanced cancer (i.e., initial first-line therapy is unsuccessful,
                  and cure is unlikely) and are eligible for, previously been treated on, or have
                  agreed to participate in a Phase I/II trial;

               -  Aged between 18-24, which is the legal age for completing an ACP document (e.g.,
                  POLST/MOLST);

               -  Speak English; and

               -  Have a caregiver or identified surrogate decision maker who is able to
                  participate.

          -  Exclusion criteria will include:

               -  Visually impaired (note, hearing impaired is not an exclusion as the video is
                  closed captioned)

               -  Psychological state not appropriate for ACP discussions as determined by the
                  primary oncologist

               -  Unable to participate in ACP discussions due to mental incapacity as determined
                  by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire

          -  Over 95% of patients with advanced cancer in the Dana-Farber inpatient setting are
             accompanied by a caregiver (i.e., family member, spouse or friend; this person is not
             necessarily the designated surrogate decision-maker since most AYA have not appointed
             one).

          -  Eligible patient participants will be asked to self-identify one caregiver or
             surrogate decision-maker that will also be approached for enrollment.

        Caregiver eligibility criteria include:

          -  Speak English;

          -  Aged 18 or older

          -  Not visually impaired

          -  Have an associated patient with advancer cancer who is able to participate.

          -  Only dyads will be enrolled, both patient and caregiver must consent to participation
             in the study.
