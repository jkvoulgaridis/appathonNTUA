  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Stage II randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial seeks to assess the acceptability,
      feasibility, and effects of a driving decision aid use among geriatric patients and
      providers. This multi-site trial will (1) test the driving decision aid (DDA) in improving
      decision making and quality (knowledge, decision conflict, values concordance and behavior
      intent); and (2) determine its effects on specific subpopulations of older drivers
      (stratified for cognitive function, decisional capacity, and attitudinally readiness for a
      mobility transition). The overarching hypotheses are that the DDA will help older adults make
      high-quality decisions, which will mitigate the negative psychosocial impacts of driving
      reduction, and that optimal DDA use will target certain populations and settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a multi-site, two-armed randomized controlled trial of older
      drivers (n=300; ≥70 years) from clinical settings, and one family member each (n=up to 300),
      with longitudinal follow-up. Study goals are to test how much the DDA improves outcomes and
      identify who benefits most from the DDA. Evaluation of the DDA's efficacy (Aim 1) and its
      relative effect in subgroups (Aim 2) corresponds to Stage II in the NIH Stage Model for
      Behavioral Intervention Development. Findings from Aims 1 &amp; 2 could identify necessary
      refinements (Stage I) and inform future efficacy, effectiveness or implementation trials.

    <measure>Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) Scores at Day 0 (Post-intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The DCS is a 16-item scale (with Likert scale response options) that has high reliability and test-retest correlation (Cronbach's alpha coefficients &gt; 0.78). In prior work, the DCS has been shown to discriminate between known groups who make or delay decisions (effect size 0.4-0.8),53 with lower scores indicating low decision conflict (and greater likelihood of implementing a decision). Scores &lt;25 (out of 100 total) are associated with implementing decisions; scores &lt;25 represent positive outcomes. The measure will be assessed immediately following administration of control condition or intervention</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Values Clarity Subscale Score at Day 0 (Post-intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Values Clarity&quot; subscale of the DCS will be used to examine specifically how much participants feel their decisions are in line with their values. Three DCS items are summed and multiplied by 8.33; scores range from 0 (extremely clear) to 100 (extremely unclear about personal values). Lower Values Clarity Subscale Scores are associated with positive outcomes. The measure will be assessed immediately following administration of control condition or intervention</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Older adult driving safety knowledge scores as assessed by true/false questions at Day 0 (Post-intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The following true/false questions will be used to examine participants' safe driving knowledge: 1) Older drivers pose a bigger risk to other drivers and pedestrians than younger drivers do; 2) Drivers aged 70 years and older are more likely to be hurt or killed if they are in a crash; 3) There is a milestone age when everyone should stop driving; 4) With age, a person needs more light to see well; 5) Getting lost on familiar roads is a sign that it might be time to stop driving. A higher number of correctly answered questions indicate better outcomes. The measure will be assessed immediately following administration of control condition or intervention</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Self Efficacy score at Day 0 (Post-intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Decision Self-Efficacy Scale will be used to assess decision self efficacy. Scores range from 0 (extremely low) to 100 (extremely high self-efficacy). Higher scores indicate better outcomes. The measure will be assessed immediately following administration of control condition or intervention</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4-item depression score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in depression will be measured using the PROMIS 4-item scale, with higher scores indicating higher depression. All PROMIS scores are analyzed as standardized T-scores (mean=50, standard deviation=10). Lower scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ottawa Decision Regret score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in decision regret will be measured by the Ottawa Decision Regret Scale. This validated measure correlates with decision satisfaction and conflict, and overall quality of life. Scored from 0-100, high scores represent higher regret. Lower scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Life Space score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Life space is a global measure of mobility and community engagement. The Life-Space Assessment instrument (UAB Study of Aging) is a validated tool assessing recent mobility and function. Composite scores range from 0 (bedbound) to 120 (travel out of town every day without assistance); scores of ≤60 are correlated with lower levels of social participation and higher mortality. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported driving frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported driving frequency will be measured by number of days per week participants drive, with consideration of higher or lower frequency as a positive or negative outcome in the context of participant's intent to drive with lower or higher frequency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported situational driving avoidance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Driving avoidance in certain situations will be measured by asking participants about their avoidance of riskier driving situations, e.g., nighttime driving, with consideration of avoidance in certain situations as a positive or negative outcome in the context of participant's intent to avoid these situations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of driving cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Driving cessation will be measured by asking participants which of the following driving cessation options best describes their driving behavior: no driving cessation, partial driving cessation, or complete driving cessation. Consideration of driving cessation as a positive or negative outcome will be determined in the context of participant's intent to engage in driving cessation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of self-reported crashes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of self-reported crashes will be measured by ≥1 crash versus no crashes, where ≥1 crash is a negative outcome.</description>
