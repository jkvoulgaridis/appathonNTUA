  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to define an effective and safe dose of AP-002 in advanced or
      recurrent solid tumors for which there are no standard therapies to use in subsequent studies
      in advanced or recurrent breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or prostate cancers.

      The Phase 1 portion of this study will determine the Pharmacodynamically Active Dose (PAD) of
      AP-002 in humans, defined as the dose at which the plasma concentration of AP-002, as
      measured by Ga, is 300-500 ng/mL and which is at or below the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD),
      to use in the clinical setting of advanced or recurrent solid tumors. This will be followed
      by a Phase 2 expanded cohort treated at the PAD, to estimate the efficacy of AP-002 in
      patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer, NSCLC and prostate cancer.

      Patients will receive AP-002 orally, once daily for 14 days of a 21 day cycle.

* Note: 21-day schedule with 2 weeks on, one week off. The actual sample size will be guided by the CRM; sample size may be larger for dose levels that require expansion.
