  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial using a web-based adaptation of the RealConsent
      program among 400 eligible college men in Hanoi, Vietnam. This study will test the impact of
      the program on promoting prosocial bystander behavior and preventing sexual violence
      perpetration, through improvements in the seven knowledge, attitudinal, and emotional
      mediators over a seven month study period, with a baseline survey and two follow-up surveys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexual violence is any sexual act committed against a person without freely given consent.
      Men and women may experience sexual violence, but most victims are women. Women's first
      experiences of sexual violence often occur in adolescence. In Asia and the Pacific, about 14%
      of sexually experienced adolescent girls report forced sexual debut. Thus, early prevention
      with men is critical; yet, young men often are difficult to reach and may resist programs
      that target sexual violence, not seeing themselves as potential perpetrators. Prevention with
      men that integrates a bystander framework, which treats men as &quot;allies&quot; of women, is one way
      to target attitudes and behaviors while decreasing resistance to participation. In this
      study, the researchers will adapt an existing program for use with men attending one of two
      universities in Hanoi, Vietnam. This study will test the impact of the adapted program on
      knowledge/attitudinal/emotional mediators, and in turn, on sexual violence perpetration and
      prosocial bystander behavior in this target group. The adapted program is a novel,
      six-session, web-based serial drama and educational program designed to prevent sexual
      violence perpetration and to enhance prosocial bystander behavior in young men. The program
      has reduced the incidence of sexual violence among men attending an urban, public university
      in the Southeastern United States.

      After conducting interviews with men and women, and focus group discussions with college men
      and university stakeholders the researchers will produce a web-based adaptation of the
      RealConsent program in Vietnam. The researchers will then conduct a randomized controlled
      trial to test the impact of the adapted program (200 participants), relative to a
      health-education control condition (200 participants), on knowledge/attitudinal/emotional
      mediators, and in turn, on sexually violent behaviors, and prosocial bystander behavior in
      freshmen men attending two universities in Hanoi. This project will be the first to adapt and
      to test the impact of a novel, theoretically grounded, web-based intervention to prevent
      sexual violence perpetration and to promote prosocial bystander behavior among young men for
      use in a middle-income country. If this study shows that the adapted program is effective
      cross-culturally, it will have exceptional potential for scale-up to prevent men's
      perpetration of sexual violence against women globally.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Posttest (immediately after completing the intervention), 6 Months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Bystander self-efficacy to intervene when witnessing sexual violence will be assessed with a 15-item survey asking how much they agree with different scenarios of violence. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 1 = totally agree and 5 = totally disagree. Total scores range from 15 to 75 with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy for intervening when witnessing situations of sexual violence.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Posttest (immediately after completing the intervention), 6 Months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The readiness of participants to intervene when witnessing acts of sexual violence is assessed with 19 items where respondents rate how confident they are to intervene on a scale of 0 to 2 where 0 = not confident at all and 2 = very confident. Total scores range from 0 to 38 and higher scores indicate greater confidence with intervening.</description>

    <description>Participants are asked about strategies they have used to intervene when witnessing sexual violence with 17 items describing behaviors they may have witnessed in the past 12 months. Items are scored as 0 = never performed, 1 = performed once, 2 = performed more than once, and with an option to indicate they have not witnessed that particular event. For participants witnessing every event, scores range from 0 to 34 with higher scores indicating increased behaviors to intervene when witnessing sexual violence.</description>
