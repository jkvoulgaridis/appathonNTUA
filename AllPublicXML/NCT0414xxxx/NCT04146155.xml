  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic lower extremity arterial disease ( DLEAD ), is a common complication of type 2
      diabetes. However, DLEAD remains less studied than other diabetic vascular complications; and
      only few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have dealt with major lower-limb adverse events
      as prespecified endpoints. Studies have suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      analogues have a protective effect on the development of atherosclerosis, potentially
      mediated via the GLP-1 receptors expressed on endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and in
      monocytes/macrophages. The investigators aim to evaluate the improvement of lower extremity
      ischemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with lower limb vascular
      lesions after liraglutide, compared with the standard-of-care treatment group.

      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that mediates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Accumulating
      data from both animal and human studies confirmed a beneficial effect of GLP-1 on myocardium,
      endothelium and vasculature, suggesting the potential ameliorative effect of peripheral
      atherosclerosis. In our preliminary studies shown that liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1R
      agonist (GLP1RA), stimulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. The study aims to
      test the hypothesis that sustained activation of the GLP-1R enhances microvascular perfusion,
      promotes angiogenesis, leading to increased walking distance and limb perfusion in diabetes
      patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      with or without liraglutide treatment by a 6-month follow-up. The primary endpoints are the
      change in initial and absolute claudication distance and assessment of limb ischemia at 6
      months compared with baseline. This trial will collect important mechanistic and clinical
      information on the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in T2DM patients with PAD.

    <description>The primary outcome measures used to assess efficacy were pain-free walking distance (distance walked to the onset of symptoms, or the initial claudication distance [ICD]) and the maximum distance walked (absolute claudication distance [ACD]) on standardized treadmill testing. Evaluation of walking performance was accomplished with standardized treadmill testing. A constant speed of 3.2 km/h (2mile/h) and a fixed incline of 12.5% were used.</description>

    <description>ankle-brachial index is ratio of ankle systolic pressure to arm systolic pressure: using a 10-12 cm sphygmomanometer cuff placed just above the ankle and a doppler instrument used to measure the systolic pressure of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries of each leg. These pressures are then normalized to the higher brachial pressure of either arm to form the ankle-brachial index (ABI). The index leg is often defined as the leg with the lower ABI.</description>
