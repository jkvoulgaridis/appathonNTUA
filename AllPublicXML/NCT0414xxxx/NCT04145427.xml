    <textblock>
      This study is looking to see how a 6-month low carbohydrate diet can affect the body's
      ability to use energy in addition to the affects it has on the heart and blood vessel health.

    <textblock>
      Weight gain often occurs following a liver transplant. This weight gain is problematic as it
      leads to many other health problems. The reasons of this weight gain are still poorly
      understood. To better understand weight gain, this study is looking to see how a 6-month low
      carbohydrate diet can affect the body's ability to use energy in addition to the affects it
      has on heart and blood vessel health.

      This study will help researchers to better understand weight gain after a transplant. This
      knowledge will help doctors prevent weight gain after a liver transplant and therefore
      improve the health of liver transplant patients.
