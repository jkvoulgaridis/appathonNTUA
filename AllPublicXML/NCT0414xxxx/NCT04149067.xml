  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a retrospective, multicenter and observational study in
      Spain in real clinical practice to assess the employment of dapagliflozin and to compare its
      effectiveness and safety with the data of sitagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor. This is a widely
      used molecule in Spain with a large safety profile. It was chosen as a comparator because of
      the number of patients treated and because it is a real alternative at the time of making a
      decision about the treatment.

    <description>The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the SGLT2i (dapagliflozin) and DPP4i (Sitagliptin) over the composite endpoint of Hb1Ac and weight at six month of treatment.
The main variable is composite, including Hb1Ac and body weight. It will be evaluated the proportion of patient to achieve a change of 0.5% in Hb1Ac and 1.5 kg in body weight.
It was chosen sitagliptin because the researchers involved in this study have much experience with this molecule with a large number of patients already treated.</description>
