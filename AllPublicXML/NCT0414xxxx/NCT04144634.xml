  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On average, people become physically weaker during even a short stay in hospital. This study
      is a feasibility/pilot study to see if additional physiotherapy exercises undertaken in
      hospital is feasible and acceptable to patients.

      The study will compare two different types of physiotherapy exercise. Both exercise
      programmes involve twice-daily physiotherapy provided by one of the hospital's physiotherapy
      assistants, but only one of the two exercise programmes expected to provide benefit. This is
      on top of the care that people would normally receive, and will last for the first 7 days of
      their hospital admission (or until they are discharged if this is earlier).

      Patients will be asked to consent to the study during the first 36 hours of their hospital
      admission. If patients provide consent, they will undergo a baseline assessment of their
      functional ability (including testing of their muscle strength) before being randomly
      assigned to one of the two exercise programmes. The study aims to recruit 15 patients to each
      group (30 in total).

      Once randomised patients will be seen twice a day by a physiotherapy assistant who will
      supervise the exercise programme.

      On the day that participants are discharged (or day 7 of their admission if earlier) the
      assessor will repeat measures of the participants functional ability. Following these
      measures participants will be invited to be interviewed to discuss their experience of taking
      part in the study.

      Approximately one month after discharge, a researcher will visit the participant to repeat
      measures of their functional ability at their home.
