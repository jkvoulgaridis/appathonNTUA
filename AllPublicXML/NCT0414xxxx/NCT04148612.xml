  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disease characterized by depressed mood,
      diminished interests, impaired cognitive function and vegetative symptoms, such as disturbed
      sleep or appetite. MDD affects one in six adults in their lifetime. To date, decisions
      regarding specific treatment protocols for MDD are based on clinical experience and risk
      factors with limited data on outcome prediction. In addition, since it takes 8 weeks to
      assess if a treatment is successful, the long and often unsuccessful search for an effective
      antidepressant is accompanied by significant decrease in patients' quality of life, an
      increased risk of suicidal action, and decreased chance of response and remission with each
      attempt. This has led to examination of various markers (e.g., neuroimaging,
      electrophysiological, genetic and behavioral) in an attempt to predict the response to
      various forms of treatments, including pharmacotherapies and TMS (Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation) for depression.

      Elminda had developed a novel, non-invasive imaging EEG-based technology, Brain Network
      Analytics (BNA), for visualization and quantification of specific brain functions. The
      rationale of the study is to develop a reliable marker for MDD treatment outcome based on the
      BNA.
