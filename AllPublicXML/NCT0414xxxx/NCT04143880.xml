  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of preclinical studies have confirmed that progesterone and its metabolites
      have strong neuroprotective effects. As a neuroprotective agent, progesterone has been
      effective in several animal models of nerve injury, suggesting that the drug has a wide range
      of neuroprotective effects. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that some characteristic
      mechanisms of the action of the neurosteroid on brain injury and cerebral congestion include:
      prevention of inflammatory reaction and cell death (by inhibiting the activation of
      inflammatory cytokines and microglia); control of angiogenic brain edema (by reestablishing
      blood-brain barrier and regulating aquaporin-4 water transporter) and cytotoxic edema (by
      regulating Progesterone can also improve the neural dysfunction after cerebral hemorrhage,
      promote the regeneration and repair of damaged axons (activate PI3K / Akt pathway to inhibit
      the expression of RhoA), prevent the loss of Ca2 + caused by excitotoxicity and improve the
      survival rate of neurons. It was found that progesterone injection could reduce brain edema
      and promote the recovery of nerve function after brain injury.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      progesterone in the clinical application of major cerebral congestion diseases. The Second
      Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University is the unit in charge of clinical research, and
      six units participate in the multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute hemorrhagic stroke was confirmed by CT or MRI. There should be no obvious
             sequelae symptoms in the first stroke or previous stroke, Mrs &lt; 2 (slight or no
             neurological dysfunction).

          -  Patients aged 40-80 (male, menopausal women);

          -  Patients with 6-48 hours of onset;

          -  3 points ≤ NIHSS score ≤ 15 points for light and medium patients;
