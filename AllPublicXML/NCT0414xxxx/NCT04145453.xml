  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the project is to test whether the TAS2R38 polymorphism affects the
      effectiveness of dietary intervention aimed at increasing the consumption of vegetables and
      citrus fruits.

    <textblock>
      In humans, the TAS2R38 receptor gene is responsible for differences in the perception of
      bitter taste. This gene codes for a G protein that is associated with a flavor receptor
      regulated by phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and propylthiouracil (PROP) ligands, which by binding
      to the receptor determines the degree of bitter taste. Cruciferous vegetables contain
      glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, which resemble PTC and PROP and thereby affect their
      perception of bitter taste through the TAS2R38 regulated receptor.

      The polymorphism of this gene allows to distinguish three phenotypes:

        -  insensitive to bitter taste [bitter-non tasters]

        -  moderately sensitive to bitter taste [intermediate-bitter tasters]

        -  sensitive to bitter taste [bitter taster] Previous studies have shown that people who
           are carriers of one PAV haplotype experience a bitter taste more than AVI / AVI
           homozygotes, which are less sensitive to bitter taste. Hence, the TAS2R38 gene
           polymorphism is associated with nutritional decisions, including choice of vegetables
           and coffee.

      Aim of the study is to verify whether effectiveness of the dietary intervention depends on
      genotype.

    <intervention_model_description>To achieve the goals of the study, a group of healthy adults will be qualified. Potential participants will be assessed before and after consumption of fruit and vegetables. The duration of the study will be 8 weeks. Vegetable and fruit consumption, as well as overall food consumption, will be assessed at the beginning and after the intervention. For the basic characteristics of study participants, their anthropometric and biochemical parameters will be analyzed. The intervention effect, including the TAS2R38 polymorphism, will be analyzed by statistical analysis.
In a randomized manner volunteers will be assigned to one of two groups:intervention and study group.</intervention_model_description>
