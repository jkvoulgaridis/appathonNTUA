  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoxygenation is recommended before performing tracheal intubation. In intensive care units
      (ICU) patients, there is no specific recommendation regarding the duration of preoxygenation,
      which usually is applied for 3 to 5 minutes. Monitoring the effectiveness of preoxygenation
      with end-tidal oxygen concentration (EtO2) is strongly recommended in the operating room but
      it is never used in ICUs. The first aim of this pilot study is to assess the effect of the
      preoxygenation duration on EtO2, and secondarily, as an exploratory objective, to determine
      whether targeting a given value of EtO2 during preoxygenation might insure a safer intubation
      than when targeting pulse oximetry (SpO2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled pilot study. 110 patients who require intubation
      in the ICU will be randomly assigned, with a 1:1 ratio, to 3 or 5 minutes of preoxygenation
      duration. EtO2 will be continuously measured but hidden to the clinician. The primary outcome
      measure will be the obtention of an optimal preoxygenation defined by an EtO2 &gt;90%. Secondary
      outcomes include the occurrence of hypoxia and complications during the procedure.

      A pulse oximetry (SpO2) greater than or equal to 96% (SpO2 ≥ 96%) at the end of
      preoxygenation will be the target in each group. If at the end of the preoxygenation, SpO2 is
      still lower than 96%, clinician will be allowed to extend the duration of preoxygenation (up
      to 5 minutes in the 3 minutes period of preoxygenation group and up to 8 minutes in the 5
      minutes period of preoxygenation group).

      End-tidal oxygen concentration (EtO2) will be measured during preoxygenation and will be
      hidden to the clinician in order to not influence the duration of preoxygenation.
