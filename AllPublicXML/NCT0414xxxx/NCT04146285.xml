      This study is a phase I clinical study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      BAT4406F injection in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study in NMOSD patients in which subjects will
      receive BAT4406F injection via intravenous infusion. A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to
      define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The overall objective is to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BAT4406F injection in NMOSD patients.
