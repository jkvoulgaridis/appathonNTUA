  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine whether change in alcohol use among college
      students can be transmitted through social network ties to other members in the network.
      Members of one college class at a northeastern university will be enrolled in a longitudinal
      study in which they will provide self-reported behavioral information and information about
      their social ties to others in their college class. A subset of heavy drinking participants
      will be asked to meet in person to complete an interview about their alcohol use - called a
      Brief Motivational Interview. There is evidence that this sort of interview can reduce
      harmful alcohol use. The investigators expect that following the Brief Motivational Interview
      others in their friendship clusters will show reduced harm associated with alcohol use as
      well.
