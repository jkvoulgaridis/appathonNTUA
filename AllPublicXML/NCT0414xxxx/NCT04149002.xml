  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot an intervention that was developed to improve uptake
      and adhere to an Individualized Prematurity Prevention Plan (IP3) for preterm birth
      prevention. Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women are at higher risk for preterm birth compared to
      other racial and ethnic groups. Building on qualitative data from NHB women with input from a
      multidisciplinary stakeholder group, a patient-centered intervention was developed to improve
      uptake and adherence to an IP3 in NHB women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will pilot test the intervention via a pilot randomized controlled trial. 60
      pregnant NHB women will be recruited who have a history of singleton preterm birth and are
      currently pregnant with a singleton gestation. Consenting participants will be randomized to
      the intervention or an active control. The intervention includes: 1) an informational
      narrated powerpoint presentation that reviews the logistical details of the IP3, 2)
      structured encouragement via text messages and 3) employment law education sheet. The
      powerpoints will also be available for review on our you-tube channel for intervention
      patients. The active control arm includes: 1) a narrated powerpoint describing the Duke
      Prematurity Prevention Program and 2) text messages with general pregnancy information (i.e.
      it is safe to take Tylenol in pregnancy). At study intake, we will collect demographic data
      (age, self-described race, pregnancy history, social history, pregnancy-related anxiety
      scale, interpersonal processes of care and maternal social support index.

      The team will collect feedback on the intervention based on an intake questionnaire and an
      exit interview.

      Information will also be collected on adherence to the IP3 based on review of the
      participant's medical record. The primary aim of the study is to evaluation feasibility and
      acceptability. These endpoints will be measured via enrollment and participant feedback
      during the exit interview.

    <description>A narrated powerpoint presentation describing the logistical details and medical rationale for components of the IP3. Participants will view the chapters of the presentation that are relevant to their specific IP3. There are a total of 4 possible chapters (lifestyle modifications, cervix length screening/cerclage, progesterone therapy, low dose aspirin). Each chapter of the presentation is ~ 10 - 15 min in length. Each chapter also includes a 4- 5 questions pre-test and the same questions are delivered as a post-test after the presentation.
Print materials including a letter explaining the importance of prenatal care for preterm birth prevention to employers.
Text messages sent weekly to encourage the patient to continue with their IP3 and provide basic pregnancy information
