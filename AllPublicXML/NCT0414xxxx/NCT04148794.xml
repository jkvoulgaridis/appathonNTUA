  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this project for integrating the point-of care ultrasound skill
      (POCUS) in to the American Heart Association (AHA) Advanced Cardiopulmonary Life Support
      (ACLS) guidelines and other critical conditions. Through lecture, head-on practice and
      scenario simulations, junior physicians who are the participants would be more familiar with
      the practice of POCUS in the settings of resuscitation and on the critical condition
      patients. The investigators aimed to increased the success rate of resuscitation and improve
      the outcomes of critical condition patients.

      The investigators also try to make a template of ultrasound education in the board of
      emergency medicine and critical care medicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced life support (ALS) is an important training course for junior physicians to learn
      how to manage critical patients. Ultrasound is an indispensable and easily accessible tool in
      emergency departments and critical care settings. Current guidelines suggested that
      ultrasound could be an integral part of resuscitative medicine. However, structured training
      is needed for better efficacy of ultrasound use during clinical use. The aim of this project
      is to incorporate ultrasound into the ALS course, including common critical diseases, such as
      dyspnea, shock, major trauma and cardiac arrests. Junior physicians at the National Taiwan
      University Hospital will be enrolled in this study as participants. Through lectures and
      hand-on practice, the junior physicians could be familiar with managing critical patients
      with ultrasound assistance. This study will be lasted for two years. In the 1st year, the
      investigators will establish the echo-assisted ALS (eALS) training course, set up assessment
      modules and simulation scenarios. In the 2nd year, the investigators will provide the formal
      eALS training course for 4 to 6 times, analyze the data and establish on-line learning
      modules. In addition, the investigators will promote the eALS course to other hospitals and
      other countries.

      This pioneer study can provide experience of eALS training course and contribute to current
      medical education. Moreover, it can improve decision-making process and quality of care of
      the participants. Furthermore, the integrated on-line learning programs can be used to lessen
      the maturation time of the participants and would provide them to other departments and
      hospitals to improve patients' care.
