  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A considerable proportion of patients with clinically suspected coronary artery disease (CAD)
      do not have angiographic signs of luminal narrowing caused by coronary atherosclerosis. In
      patients with suspected CAD, we will assess the ability of cardiovascular biomarkers to
      identify patients with (a) angiographically normal epicardial coronary vessels (b) absence of
      significant epicardial coronary stenosis, as assessed by coronary computed tomography
      angiography (CCTA). Patients will be stratified according to the presence or absence of
      dynamic changes of high sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels above the 99th percentile.

      This is an observational study of patients with suspected coronary artery disease referred to
      coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The plan is to include 1000 patients prior
      to CCTA at two centers.

      Blood samples for biomarker measurement will be obtained prior to the procedures. The
      diagnostic results of the imaging tests will be compared to the levels of circulating
      troponins. Patient will be followed for a minimum of 12 months and the incidence of
      cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndromes, revascularization, heart
      failure, stroke and cardiac arrhythmias requiring rehospitalization. Symptoms of angina
      pectoris according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading of angina pectoris and
      symptoms of chronic heart failure according to the New York Heart Association classification
      of chronic heart failure will be recorded.

      Blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture by dedicated study personnel in relation to
      the routine pre-procedural clinical examination conducted the same day or the day before the
      CCTA. The samples will be left at room temperature to coagulate and subsequently centrifuged
      at ~1500g for 15 minutes, and the supernatant will be transferred to acid-handled plastic
      tubes and analyzed directly or stored at -80℃.
