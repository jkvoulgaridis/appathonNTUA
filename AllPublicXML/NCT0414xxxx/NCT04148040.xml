  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is the most common condition for surgical
      treatment in infant. Traditionally, laparoscopic or open pyloromyotomy are the standard
      treatments. However, because of severe dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and
      malnutrition, these patients have lower tolerance about surgery and recover more slowly than
      usual. We are going to study the per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP), also named as gastric per-oral
      endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM), which showed promising results for adult gastroparesis, for a
      novel application of treating IHPS.

    <description>The procedure includes four steps: a) a transversal mucosal incision was performed at the proximal antrum. b) a submucosal longitudinal tunnel was created across the pyloric ring. c) full-thickness pyloromyotomy was performed, with a little extension of the antrum. After pyloromyotomy, an ultrathin gastroscope was used to inspect the mucosa and pyloric outlet. d) after careful hemostasis, the mucosal entry was closed by clips.</description>
