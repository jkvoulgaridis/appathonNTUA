    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, intermediate-sized expanded access treatment protocol to
      the existing IND 111,695 for ensartinib (X-396). The treatment plan is designed to provide
      ensartinib to participants with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (&gt;18 years-of-age) with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC as determined by an
             FDA approved test.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1.

          3. Informed consent must be provided by each patient.

          4. Patient is not eligible or does not have access for participation in any of the other
             ongoing clinical trials for ensartinib.

          5. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.

          6. Male and female patients must agree to abstain or to use two highly effective forms of
             contraception during the treatment period and for 90 days after the last dose of study
             medication.

          7. Adequate organ system function.

          8. Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible if they are asymptomatic with
             respect to the CNS metastases and do not require escalating doses of systemic
             corticosteroids. ALK-positive patients with untreated CNS lesions may be allowed to
             enroll as long as the patients are asymptomatic with respect to the CNS metastases and
             do not require systemic corticosteroids or anticonvulsants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients currently receiving cancer therapy.

          2. Use of an investigational or targeted drug within 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is shorter) prior to the first dose of ensartinib. A minimum of 10 days between
             termination of the treatment and administration of ensartinib is required. However, in
             the case of ALK TKIs, a 2-day window between termination of the TKI and the start of
             ensartinib is allowed. In addition, any drug-related toxicity should have recovered to
             Grade 1 or less, with the exception of alopecia.

          3. Any major surgery or immunotherapy within the last 21 days (focal radiation does not
             require a washout period; â‰¥4 weeks for whole brain radiotherapy). Chemotherapy
             regimens with delayed toxicity within the last 4 weeks (or within the last 6 weeks for
             prior nitrosourea or mitomycin C). Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a
             weekly basis with limited potential for delayed toxicity within the last 2 weeks.

          4. Patients with a known allergy or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to drugs chemically
             related to ensartinib (e.g., crizotinib) or to the active ingredient of ensartinib or
             to tartrazine, a dye used in the ensartinib 100 mg capsules.

          5. Patients receiving CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, strong CYP3A
             inhibitors, and strong CYP3A inducers.

          6. Presence of active gastrointestinal (GI) disease or other condition that will
             interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             ensartinib.

          7. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease.

          8. Patients who are immunosuppressed (including known HIV infection), have a serious
             active infection at the time of treatment, have known hepatitis C, or have any serious
             underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive
             protocol treatment.

          9. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.

         10. Have a history or the presence at baseline of pulmonary interstitial lung disease,
             drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis.

         11. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         12. Patient with any concurrent condition or receiving any concurrent medication that, in
             the investigator's opinion, would impart excessive risk associated with study
             participation or otherwise make it inappropriate for the patient to participate.
