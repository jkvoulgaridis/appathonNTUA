      This study aims to develop a web-based epilepsy education program for adolescents with
      epilepsy and their parents and to evaluate the efficacy of web-based epilepsy education
      program on health management.

      This randomized controlled study was conducted with 69 adolescents with epilepsy aged between
      9-18 and their parents (n=71) who were accepted to Pediatric Neurology Policlinic of Antalya
      Training and Research Hospital of Health Science University between November 2017 and April
      2018. The study sample was divided into two groups as study (35 adolescents, 37 parents) and
      control (34 adolescents, 34 parents) groups using simple randomization method. The web-based
      epilepsy training program which was developed during the preparation stage of the study was
      evaluated by 13 experts using the Quality of Criteria for Consumer Health Information
      measurement instrument. The data collection materials (Seizure Self efficacy scale, E-Health
      literacy scale, Child Attitude Toward Illness Scale, Website Analysis and MeasureMent
      Inventory Scale) were administered by the researcher to the adolescents and parents in both
      groups before applying eb-based epilepsy education program. Following the administration of
      eb-based epilepsy education program to the initiative group, all participants were observed
      for three months. The data collection materials were reapplied to all the participants at the
      end of the third month. In addition, the adolescents and their parents in the study group
      were applied Website Analysis and Measurement Inventory measurement tool for the evaluation
      of usability of the site.

    <measure>Website Analysis and MeasureMent Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Website Analysis and MeasureMent Inventory had applied both website under preparation and post test for control group.There are 5 dimensions that measure concepts like Attractiveness, Controllability, Efficiency, Helpfulness and Learnability. The total usability score is the weighted combination of expressions from each of the five sub-dimensions. The higher the scores obtained from the scale, the higher is the usability of the website and the more useful it is. The score obtained from the Website Analysis and MeasureMent Inventory is calculated in percentiles. the fact that each sub-dimension is above 50% means that its availability is high.</description>
