  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation will be conducted as a double blinded, randomized, crossover
      within-participant comparison design with two 1-week intervention periods separated by
      2-weeks for wash out, recovery, period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following inclusion, familiarization and baseline assessments, the participants will be
      randomly allocated to receive either a multi-ingredient, pre-workout supplement (PREW) or
      maltodextrin (CHO). Thereafter, the participants will take a 5-day microcycle, involving
      three resistance training sessions (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) intercalated with two
      endurance training sessions (Tuesday and Thursday). After the first interventional
      microcycle, and the 2-week washout period, the participants will switch to the other
      nutritional condition for continuation with the second 5-day identical microcycle.
      Assessments of muscle contractile properties via Tensiomyography on Vastus Medialis, Biceps
      Femoris Long Head and Anterior Deltoids will be taken before and after each resistance
      training session. Measurements of strength (Isometric Mid Thigh Pull) upper and lower body
      muscular power (Medicine Ball Throw and Vertical Jump) will be performed immediately after
      each resistance training workout. The supplements will be ingested 15 min before each
      training session, just before completing an energy feeling questionnaire. In addition, the
      perceptual response to training will be assessed during and 20 min after the completion of
      all workouts. The contribution of carbohydrate and fat metabolism will be estimated using a
      gas analyzer via the calculation of respiratory exchange ratio the (RER) during each
      endurance training session.

    <description>-Resistance Training days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday): Before training starts, Tensiomyography and Energy Feeling will be assessed (Energy Level, Fatigue Level, Feeling of Alertness, and Feeling of Focus on the task). Immediately after finishing, Tensiomyography and Performance (Vertical Jump, Overhead Medicine Ball Throw, and Maximal Mid-Tigh Pull Isometric Strength) will be assessed. Training Protocol: 10 minutes of standardized warm-up, Strength Circuit training using free weights (Parallel Squat; Bench Press; Alternate Box Set-Ups; Shoulder Press; Alternate Lunges; Up-right Row; Hip-Thrust; Squat on Isoinertial Fly-Wheel or Drop Jump). The participants will have to perform 16 repetitions of each exercise, with 30 seconds rest and 3 minutes rest after every set. If they can complete 16 repetitions easily, 2,5 to 5 kg will be added for the next set. Also, whole-body Perceptual Response will be assessed using the 0-10 OMNI-RES Scale, after every set and 15 minutes after finishing.</description>

    <description>- Endurance Training days (Tuesday-Thursday): Energy Feeling Questionnaire will be implemented before training. The training will consist of 30 minutes cycling at their Fatmax Intensity (~60% Vo2max) on a Cycloergometer (estimated during familiarisation week). Also, the Heart Rate will be recorded during the whole training. Besides, Perception of Effort will be assessed using the 6-20 version of the Borg Scale every 5 minutes during training and 15 minutes after it has been completed.</description>
