  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility and its treatment result in a considerate emotional burden and a recent guideline
      of the European Society of Human Reproduction (ESHRE) highlight the importance to support
      couples facing fertility problems. Mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) have been proven
      effective in improving well-being and combatting mood disturbances in a wide range of
      conditions in both treatment and prevention. The overall aim of this project is to evaluate
      the impact of a mobile mindfulness programme (mMP) on quality of life and emotional
      well-being in individuals/couples experiencing fertility problems. The present study is a
      two-group randomized controlled trial with assessments at baseline, at 1,5 months and at 3
      months. Sixty couples experiencing fertility problems will be enrolled. They will be assigned
      to either an intervention group (immediate access to the mMP) or a control group (waitlist
      condition). The mobile MBP is developed by a team of experienced mindfulness trainers,
      clinical psychologists, and a psychiatrist and adheres to a standardized protocol. The
      primary outcomes will be quality of life and emotional distress. Secondary outcomes will be
      repetitive negative thinking, self-compassion and mindfulness skills. Additionally, the
      feasibility of the mMP will be evaluated.

    <description>The mobile mindfulness programme adheres to a standardized protocol developed from the MBSR curriculum (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). The program consists of six modules. Each module consists of a short movie (talking head) explaining the content and two audiofiles to guide experiential mindfulness meditation exercises. Participants can follow the different modules based on their own time-schedule.
Key objectives are: (1) to increase awareness of one's present moment experience; (2) to teach an attitude of openness and acceptance (non-judging) toward one's experience.</description>
