  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prehypertention is defined as systolic blood pressure between 120 and 139 mmHg and/or
      diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg. People with prehypertension have the higher
      risk to develop hypertension compared to people with normal blood pressure (normotensive)
      especially when getting old, therefore prehypertension is known for preliminary stage of
      hypertension. Framingham Heart Study have shown the progression rate from prehypertension to
      hypertension was as high as 19% over 4 years. Prehypertension will also lead to abnormality
      of the cardiovascular system. Thus it is very important to identify the prehypertension at
      early stage, so that steps can be taken to slow down the progression to hypertension and to
      normalize the blood pressure level. Minimal reduction in blood pressure produce a large
      benefit to human health, as stated in JNC (Joint National Committee) VII report, a 5mmHg
      decrease in systolic blood pressure would be able to reduce as much as 9% mortality rate
      caused by coronary heart disease, 14% mortality related to stroke, and 7% decrease in
      all-cause mortality. Previous studies have focused on effect of music therapy in hypertensive
      elderly, prehypertensive pregnant women, prehypertensive elderly but no research has been
      conducted on prehypertensive young adults. In addition, prehypertension increase risk of
      developing cardiovascular disease, thus early intervention is needed to prevent the
      progression of prehypertension to hypertension status and normalize the blood pressure level.

    <description>Music group (N=15) will receive listen to music therapy passively for 20 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, along with lifestyle modifications. Music therapy will be provided via headphones in an isolated quiet non-disrupted room, with room temperature maintained between 20-22 degree Celsius and having medium light intensity. Participants would be instructed to listen to music with eyes closed in sitting position, back supported in comfortable position on a chair. The participants will be given 5 minutes' rest in sitting position before and after each music therapy session.</description>

    <description>Control group (N=15) would receive only lifestyle modification. Handout of lifestyle modification according to the Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC VII) report guidelines will be given to all participants. Participants would be instructed to not participate in any form of physical activity and to focus only on two components from the guideline which includes practice the DASH eating plan (diet rich in fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy or unsaturated fat) and limit the daily sodium intake (less than 100 mmol per day).</description>
