      Necrosis Factors Receptors 1/2 (sTNFR1/2), with or without Nivolumab, in patients with
      inoperable or metastatic solid Tumors. This study evaluates Immunicom fs LW-02 device used
      with Spectra Optia apheresis system, aiming to answer two different study questions:

        -  Safety, tolerability and effectiveness of the device, escalating plasma volume
           ultrafiltration from 2X plasma volumes to 3X plasma volumes.

        -  Safety, tolerability and effectiveness of the device, employed as monotherapy, or
