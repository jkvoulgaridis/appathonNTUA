  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 1 study measuring the
      safety and tetanus antibody responses to Tdap vaccine administered to plasma donors every 3
      months ±1 week for 12 months (5 vaccinations) with a 6 month follow-up after the last
      vaccination. After obtaining informed consent and screening for eligibility including
      plasmapheresis donor eligibility, subjects will have other baseline assessments performed and
      if eligible, will receive the scheduled vaccinations, will be assessed for adverse events
      (AEs) and have plasma samples collected for antibody titers each month thereafter for 11
      months, and then at 1 and 6 months after the last vaccination. As these subjects are
      participating in a standard donor plasmapheresis donor program, assessments for donor
      eligibility and routine plasmapheresis will be performed; however, only the data specifically
      required to meet the objectives of this study will be collected.
