    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease using mesenchymal stem cells is a perspective
      method to influence on the pathogenesis of the disease. At the same time, this is a complex
      and still insufficiently explored process. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells will be
      transplanted to 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. The results of the effectiveness of the
      combined and intravenous routes of mesenchymal stem cells administration on the motor and
      non-motor symptoms in these patients will be evaluated and compared with the results of
      control group.

    <measure>motor symptoms change</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Positive trend is going to be detected in the overall score of the third part of the UPDRS scale(Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale) in the off- and in the on-period:neurological examination of patients in the dynamics is carried out in the morning after a 12 (24) - hour break in taking anti-Parkinsonian drugs &quot;off-state&quot;, then one hour after they were taken &quot;on-state&quot;.
A score of 64 on the third part of the UPDRS scale represents the worst (total motor disability) with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>non-motor symptoms change</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Identification and assessment of the severity of non-motor symptoms is carried out using Non-motor Symptoms Questionnaire (PD NMS Questionnaire).A score of 30 represents the worst result with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>sleep quality change</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is used to assess sleep quality over the last month.The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>daytime sleepiness change</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is used to measure daytime sleepiness.The ESS score can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

    <measure>signs of depression change</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>We use the Hamilton Depression Scale - Hamilton psychiatric rating scale for depression (HDRS) - to identify signs of depression. A score of 52 represents the worst result with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>
