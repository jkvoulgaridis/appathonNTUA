  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to individuals with Actinic Keratoses (skin lesions that have the
      potential to turn into skin cancer), who are receiving photodynamic therapy (PDT) as part of
      their clinical care. The purpose of this study is to test and demonstrate that vitamin D
      pre-treatment can enhance PDT efficacy in the treatment of Actinic Keratoses.

      Participants will be asked to take vitamin D supplements prior to their standard of care PDT
      treatment.

      Participation in the research will last about 3-4 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether acute supplementation
      (neoadjuvant Vitamin D3), adjusted according to baseline Vitamin D status, can improve the
      clinical PDT response relative to participants receiving PDT alone

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether gene polymorphisms in VDR and
      CYP27B1 are predictive for the degree of responsiveness to Vitamin D as a neoadjuvant for
      PDT.

      This study is a non-randomized interventional trial, in which the study group will be
      compared to a baseline cohort of patients from a previous study who received the same regimen
      of PDT, but without any Vit D. It is anticipated that 30 participants will be involved in
      this study.

PpIX accumulation in areas of both actinic damage and normal skin will be measured with a fluorescence dosimeter. The level of calcidiol, a clinically accepted marker of vitamin D status, will be measured in each patient to see if supplementation with 10,000 IU of Vitamin D increase the accumulation</description>

    <description>PDT is a technique that combines a photosensitizing drug and an intense light source to kill tumor cells
Noninvasive fluorescence dosimetry may be performed on up to 6 lesions. Levulan Kerastick will be applied to each lesion and left to incubate for 30 minutes. Blue light (Blu-U device, 20 J/cm2, 33 minutes) will be administered.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Actinic keratoses in sufficient numbers (&gt;10) to warrant PDT therapy in the clinic

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Female subjects must not become pregnant during the study:

               -  The effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (LevulanTM) on the human fetus are unknown.
                  For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use contraception
                  (double barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, and
                  throughout study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that
                  she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform the
                  treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing.

          -  At risk for hypercalcemia (renal disease, sarcoidosis, etc.)

          -  Using topical retinoids, since these can exacerbate the post-PDT erythema reaction.

          -  Using any topical treatment on their AKs; must stop at least one month prior.

          -  Currently undergoing treatment for other cancers with medical or radiation therapy.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to 5-aminolevulinic acid or any component of
             the study material.

          -  Patients with history of a photosensitivity disease, such as porphyria cutanea tarda.

          -  Currently participating in another clinical trial.
