  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if functional muscle stimulation, directed by
      electroencephalogram (EEG) output, can increase the extent of stroke recovery on behavioral
      measures and induce brain plasticity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI). Participants will include stroke patients with upper-limb hemiparesis and can expect
      to be on study for approximately 4 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ongoing research (NCT02098265) suggests that noninvasive EEG driven Brain Computer Interface
      (BCI) systems hold the potential for facilitating recovery in the chronic phase after stroke
      by synchronizing central or brain activity with peripheral movements and thereby harnessing
      brain plasticity.

      The specific aims of this study are:

      Aim 1: To investigate the efficacy of active FES vs. passive FES, as measured by changes in
      behavioral measures. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in motor function will
      be significantly greater using the active FES therapy than the passive FES therapy.

      Aim 2: To investigate the relationship between brain functional activation patterns and
      behavior changes induced by active vs. passive FES intervention. The investigators
      hypothesize that changes induced by active FES (as measured by brain fMRI and EEG measures)
      will show greater adaptive brain reorganization changes (i.e. brain changes that correlate
      with improved outcomes) than that induced by the passive FES.

      Aim 3: To investigate the relationship between brain white matter integrity and behavior
      changes induced by active vs. passive FES intervention. The investigators hypothesize that
      changes induced by active FES (as measured by brain DTI measures) will show greater adaptive
      brain reorganization changes (i.e. brain changes that correlate with improved outcomes) than
      that induced by the passive FES.

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is designed for evaluation of upper extremity function. This test consists of sections for Grasp, Grip, Pinch and Gross Movements and comprise a total of 19 tests. Each test is scored 0-3 where 0 is 'no movement' and 3 is 'the movement is performed normally'. Each section is scored separately and the scores added for a total possible range of scores from 0-57 where the higher the score, the complete and efficient the movement. Scores will be reported for baseline, mid (~7 weeks), post (~10 weeks), and end of study, up to 4 months.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale, or SIS, was created to assess changes in impairments, activities and participation following a stroke. Scores on the SIS will provide an index of clinically &quot;meaningful&quot; change representing the change in the patient's mental and physical abilities concurrent with their performance on the verbal fluency and memory tasks. The 4 physical function domains (strength, hand function, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility) will be collapsed to a physical function subscale. All domain scores range from 0 to 100 with 100 being the best.</description>
