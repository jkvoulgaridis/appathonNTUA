  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgical procedures have been advocated as an alternative to catheter
      ablation for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation. Initial results have been
      promising in maintaining sinus rhythm compared to catheter ablation, but are associated with
      a considerably greater number of procedural-related adverse events compared to catheter
      ablation. This study investigates the safety and feasibility of a new subxyphoid
      epicardial/endocardial hybrid atrial fibrillation ablation and LAA exclusion approach for
      patients with persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will assess the ability of a subxyphoid and percutaneous hybrid
      epicardial/endocardial ablation approach consisting of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), LAA
      exclusion, isolation of the left atrial (LA) posterior wall and cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)
      line (Hybrid Sub-X MAZE) to (1) demonstrate that the hybrid procedure does not result in an
      unacceptable risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) in persistent or longstanding persistent
      atrial fibrillation (AF) subjects for whom an ablation procedure is planned; and (2) assess
      freedom from episodes of persistent AF &gt; 30 seconds duration during the observation period
      through 12 months post PVI.

             atrial fibrillation

               -  Persistent AF is defined as atrial fibrillation sustained for ≥ 7 days and ≤ 1
                  year;

               -  Longstanding persistent AF is defined as continuous atrial fibrillation &gt; 1 year
                  duration;

               -  Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is defined as cases without a mechanical heart
                  valve requiring anticoagulation or without moderate to severe mitral stenosis.

             Note: Persistent AF and Longstanding Persistent AF must be documented as follows:

               -  Physician's note indicating that patient has experienced symptomatic continuous
                  AF that is sustained ≥ 7 days duration and &lt; 1 year and clinical history of
                  non-paroxysmal AF &lt; 3 years; and

               -  A ≥7-day continuous rhythm monitoring (e.g., Zio patch, implantable loop recorder
                  (ILR), pacemaker) which documents 90% AF burden over at least 7 consecutive days
                  or alternatively, two electrocardiograms from any form of rhythm monitoring (e.g.
                  12-lead ECG, Holter, event monitor) documenting continuous AF, with
                  electrocardiograms taken at least 7 days apart, for subjects with sustained AF ≥
                  7 days, as confirmed by the ECG Core Laboratory, obtained within 90 days prior to
                  randomization.

             Longstanding Persistent AF:

               -  Physician's note indicating that patient has experienced symptomatic continuous
                  AF that is sustained &gt; 1 year duration and clinical history of non-paroxysmal AF
                  &lt; 3 years; and

               -  A ≥7-day continuous rhythm monitoring (e.g., Zio patch, ILR, pacemaker) which
                  documents 90% AF burden over at least 7 consecutive days or alternatively, 24
                  hour continuous rhythm monitoring (e.g. holter, event monitor) obtained within 90
                  days prior to the index procedure showing continuous AF, as confirmed by the ECG
                  Core Laboratory. Note: The performance of a successful cardioversion (sinus
                  rhythm ≥30 seconds) within 12 months of an ablation procedure with documented
                  early recurrence of AF within 30 days should not alter the classification of AF
                  as Longstanding Persistent.)
