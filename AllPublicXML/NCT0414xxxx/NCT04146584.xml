      This is a prospective, open label, multi-center, self-controlled clinical study to
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SofWave treatment to lift lax tissue in the submental
      and neck zones and to lift the eyebrow.

      Up to 112 healthy candidates who are seeking treatment from participating investigators will
      be enrolled at up to 5 participating study sites. Patients will receive 2 treatments (4-6
      weeks ± 2 weeks apart) with the SofWave system and will be followed up to 3 months post the
      last treatment (FU2).

    <description>Evaluate the clinical efficacy of SofWave treatment to lift lax tissue in the submental and neck zones and to lift the eyebrow, as assessed by independent masked evaluators. The two independent masked evaluators would be delivered a presentation with images randomly ordered for 'before' and 'after'. Each investigator would have to guess the correct 'after' image. Both investigators must agree on more than 50% of the cases to match success criteria. Each treated zone (Eyebrows, Neck &amp; Submental) would be ranked individually. The primary endpoint would only be achieved along with success in outcome #5.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the clinical safety of SofWave treatment to lift lax tissue in the submental and neck zones and to lift the eyebrow, as assessed by study physician. The investigator would examine the patient's skin before and after treatments and on follow up visits and would be requested to fill in a physician assessment, ranking Edema, erythema, ulceration/erosion, hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation on a 5 option scale ranging from 0. - Absent to 4. Prominent. Safety would be checked every visit.</description>

    <time_frame>On the second treatment visit date (pre treatment), 3 months post last treatment follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate investigator assessment of clinical improvement in the treated zones using the Physician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (PGAIS). In this scale the treating physician would have to select the proper answer regarding treatment efficacy out of 5 options ranging from: 1. Very Much Improved to 5. Worse. Each treated zone (Eyebrows, Neck &amp; Submental) would be ranked individually.</description>

    <time_frame>On the second treatment visit date (pre treatment), 3 months post last treatment follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate patient assessment of clinical improvement in the treated zones and treatment satisfaction using the patient satisfaction questionnaire. The patient would be given a patient satisfaction questionnaire with three questions regarding overall improvement (scale of 5 options ranging from 0. Worse to 4. Very much improved ), overall satisfaction (scale of 5 options ranging from 0. Very Satisfied to 4. Very Unsatisfied) and a question regarding willing to participate in future studies (options of Yes, No, Not sure). Each treated zone (Eyebrows, Neck &amp; Submental) would be ranked individually.</description>

    <description>Photo analysis and measurements. Success criterion: point estimate of eyebrow lift &gt; 0.5 mm Objective measurement of submental lift Success criterion: point estimate of submental lift &gt; 20 mm.

    <description>The device used in this study will be the SofWave system manufactured by SofWave Medical ltd. The SofWave device is an ultrasonic system combined with an inherent cooling system that generates High Intensity non-focused Ultrasonic pulses (HIUS), causing a controlled thermal damage by elevating the temperature to 60-70°C in the dermis layer while sparing the epidermal layer using surface cooling. Each patient would receive 2 Sofwave treatments on the face and/or the neck.</description>
