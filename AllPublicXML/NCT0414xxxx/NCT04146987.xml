    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints in orthopedic practice.
      Rotator cuff injuries account for up to 70% of pain in the shoulder girdle. There is no
      clinical study carried out in Brazil comparing cost effectiveness between the open and
      arthroscopic methods of rotator cuff repair surgery.

      The present study aims to determine which method of repair of the rotator cuff, open or
      arthroscopic, has the best cost effectiveness ratio.

      A randomized clinical trial will be carried out in which patients with symptomatic rotator
      cuff lesion will be submitted to repair surgery by either open or arthroscopic technique and
      will be subsequently evaluated.

      Introduction:

      Musculoskeletal injuries are a major cost to the healthcare system. In 2004, 30% of the North
      American population had some kind of musculoskeletal disorder that required medical
      treatment; between 2002 and 2004, the estimated cost of treating these changes was $ 510
      billion. Shoulder diseases represent the third most common cause of these changes, behind
      only spinal and knee disorders.

      An evaluation of the primary health care system in Cambridge, United Kingdom, showed that the
      average frequency of shoulder pain was 9.5 per 1,000 individuals. Of these, 86% had rotator
      cuff tendinopathy. North American data estimate that approximately 4.5 million patients
      annually seek medical attention due to shoulder pain; of these, two million have some
      symptoms related to the rotator cuff. About 250,000 rotator cuff repair surgeries are
      performed annually in the United States of America (US), and with the continued increase in
      life expectancy and aging, there is a tendency to increase this number.

      The rotator cuff is composed of the tendons of the subscapularis, supraspinatus,
      infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. The long portion of the biceps tendon also contributes
      to cuff function, which is to stabilize the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing
      superior migration of the humeral head.

      The possible lesions range from tendon degeneration (tendinosis/tendinopathy), through
      partial lesions (articular, interstitial or bursal), to complete lesions. Diagnosis is made
      by associating history and physical examination along with imaging methods, and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the method of choice.

      Currently, the indication for surgical treatment is based on the persistence of symptoms
      and/or the degree of muscle weakness and/or size of the lesion, after a time of conservative
      treatment. In general, when opting for surgery, imaging can assist in the planning of
      surgical treatment, since it allows measuring the extent of the lesion (partial or total) and
      discriminating which tendons are involved (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, etc.).

      Treatment of rotator cuff diseases depends on the type of injury, the patient's degree of
      activity, age, and the presence of symptoms. In general, tendon degeneration and partial
      lesions are treated non-surgically, with physiotherapy, infiltrations and analgesic
      medications. Complete and incomplete lesions that did not respond well to conservative
      treatment, however, should be treated surgically. Among the surgical options, the open method
      is still considered the gold standard, with good or excellent results in over 90% of cases.
      With the advent of arthroscopy and the evolution of arthroscopic instruments and implants in
      the last decade, the arthroscopic repair technique has gained space and is widely used in the
      investigator's country. Several studies abroad did not demonstrate superiority of one
      technique over another in terms of clinical outcomes. As the cost of arthroscopic surgery is
      higher, due to the equipment needed to perform it, it is important to establish which option
      has the best cost-effectiveness.

      Some studies abroad even suggest the superiority of the open method over the arthroscopic
      method. However, there are no studies comparing cost-effectiveness between open and
      arthroscopic methods in Brazil. Therefore, the present study aims to compare the open and
      arthroscopic methods for rotator cuff repair and determine which presents the best
      cost-effectiveness ratio.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis of this study is that the open method of rotator cuff repair will be more
      cost-effective compared to the arthroscopic method.

      Justification:

      In a systematic literature search, it was observed that there are no studies in the Brazilian
      literature comparing the cost-effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair
      methods. Data from the international literature suggest that the open repair method is more
      cost-effective than the arthroscopic method (same clinical outcome and lower cost).

      Thus, despite the high incidence of rotator cuff injury, there is insufficient evidence from
      the Brazilian experience to determine the best method for treating these injuries. So, this
      project proposes to conduct a study to answer the clinical question of which method, open or
      arthroscopic, has the best cost-effectiveness in the surgical treatment of rotator cuff
      injury. According to the levels of scientific evidence, the most appropriate study design to
      answer this clinical question is a randomized clinical trial.

      Study Goal:

      The present study aims to compare the open and arthroscopic methods for rotator cuff repair
      and determine which presents the best cost-effectiveness ratio.

    <description>EuroQol-5D-3L (European Quality of Life), a generic score developed to describe health-related quality of life will also be assessed preoperatively, at 6, 24 and 48 weeks postoperatively. This score includes five health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; each domain has 3 levels: no problem; some problems and extreme problems. In addition, the EuroQol-5D-3L has a visual analog scale where the participant assigns a value between zero and one hundred to his or her own health condition. At the end of its application, EuroQol-5D-3L will provide a unique numerical value that can be used for longitudinal comparison between two time periods (pre and postoperative, for example).</description>

    <description>Patients will be positioned in a beach chair position with the affected limb pending off the table, allowing manipulation and full range of motion range. After asepsis, antisepsis and placement of sterile surgical fields, anterolateral incision will be made in the shoulder in question; the deltoid muscle belly will be gently divided along its fibers until exposure of the subdeltoid / subacromial bursa, which will be partially excised for exposure of the subacromial space and rotator cuff tendons. After mobilization and release of the ruptured tendons and debridement of the rotator cuff footprint, the tendon repair to the bone will be performed using 5.5m metal anchors, according to the preference and technique chosen by the surgeon. In all cases, the release of the coracoacromial ligament and acromioplasty will be performed.</description>

    <description>The patients will be positioned in lateral decubitus position, with the arm to be operated attached to a skin traction device, which trough a traction post and 07 kg, will maintain the shoulder in the following position: abduction of 30 to 60 and flexion of 20 to 30 degrees. After asepsis, antisepsis and placement of impermeable sterile surgical fields, a posterolateral incision will be made in the shoulder for optic introduction, with a 50 mmHg pressure pump and a 0.90 flow, and inspection of the GU joint. After joint inspection, the optic will be introduced into the subacromial space with detachment of the subacromial and subdeltoid. Using shaver blades, partial bursectomy will be performed as well as debridement of the rotator cuff footprint. The tendon will then be reinserted to the bone using metallic 5.5mm anchors. After tendon repair, the coracoacromomial ligament will be released, as well as acromioplasty.</description>
