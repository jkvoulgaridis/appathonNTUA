    <time_frame>Up to Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed measurable concentration, and lambda(z) is apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 113 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAEs are AEs which will occur up to 113 days that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
