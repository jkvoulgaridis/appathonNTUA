      The proposed study is a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, subject- and
      assessor-blind trial. It is designed according to CONSORT and STRICTA recommendations. The
      138 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two arms using block randomization in a
      1:1 ratio: (I) acupuncture treatment, and (II) sham treatment. In groups (I) and (II),
      acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment will be given twice a week for 6 weeks (12
      sessions). A maintenance tapering treatment schedule will then be applied once per month for
      3 months (3 sessions). The primary outcome will be improvement in sleep quality as measured
      by the change of ISI after 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcome assessment tools will
      include PSQI, HADS, BPI, BFI, FACT-B, sleep diaries, drug diaries, blinding success
      questionnaire and reports of adverse events. The subjects will be scheduled for on-site
      follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months after the last treatment. An intention to treat (ITT)
      approach will be used for data analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a frequent and disturbing symptom among cancer patients. Studies have found that
      cancer treatments, particularly chemotherapy, are a major cause of cancer-related insomnia.
      However, insomnia is under-treated in most breast cancer patients because effective, safe
      evidence-based treatments are lacking.

      Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases, including
      insomnia. Our previous research demonstrated the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as a
      treatment for insomnia. However, the effect of acupuncture on insomnia in breast cancer
      patients who undergo chemotherapy has been rarely studied. We propose this randomized
      controlled trial to examine the feasibility, effect and safety of acupuncture as a treatment
      for insomnia in breast cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that acupuncture is a feasible, effective and safe method for the
      alleviation of insomnia symptoms in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy as
      compared with a sham control.

      Primary Aim: To determine whether the insomnia condition in the acupuncture group is
      significantly improved when compared to the sham control group, as measured by the ISI after
      6 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary Aims: 1) To determine whether other sleep-related parameters in the acupuncture
      group improve more than those of the control group, as measured at different time points by
      Actiwatch, sleep diary, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer (FACT-B), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief
      Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). 2) To assess by adverse event (AE)
      analysis whether acupuncture is safe for treatment of insomnia in breast cancer patients
      undergoing chemotherapy.
