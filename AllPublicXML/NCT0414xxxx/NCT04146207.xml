      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SHR0302 in combination with
      Prednisone as first line therapy in patients with moderate to severe chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

    <textblock>
      Treatment: Once patients are diagnosed with chronic GVHD, the combination therapy should be
      initiated as soon as possible. 1. Prednisone: 1mg/kg/d po. Taper steroid every two weeks
      according to patient's response. 2. SHR0302 QD po. for at least 28 days. Indication for
      stopping SHR0302 treatment: 1. No response after SHR0302 treatment for 12 weeks. 2. Develop
      life-threatening complication. 3. ANC&lt;0.5×10e9/L or PLT&lt; 30×10e9/L.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 70 years old, male or female;

          -  Patients receiving allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for
             hematological diseases;

          -  The primary hematological malignancies are completely relieved and are expected to be
             stable for at least 3 months;

          -  Chronic GVHD that was first attacked after transplantation and at least 100 days after
             transplantation, reached a moderate or severe level by NIH classification;

          -  There was no previous systemic treatment (including in vitro illumination [ECP]);

          -  The patient may be receiving other immunosuppressive agents to prevent or treat acute
             GVHD, but if the subject receives prednisone to prevent or treat acute GVHD, it must
             be &lt;0.5 mg/kg/d or equivalent dose of other glucocorticoids;

          -  The chronic GVHD that has started hormone therapy does not exceed 72 hours;

          -  Karnofsky score &gt; 60 points;

          -  Patients must be able to understand and are willing to participate in the study and
             sign an informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Can not tolerate prednisone dose 1mg / kg / d or equivalent dose of other
             glucocorticoids for the treatment of cGVHD;

          -  Receive any systemic treatment of cGVHD, except for corticosteroids that treat cGVHD
             within 72 hours prior to the signing of informed consent;

          -  Patients with GVHD overlap syndrome (NIH criteria);

          -  Patient blood routine: ANC &lt;1.0 × 109 / L or PLT &lt; 50 × 109 / L;

             aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is more than 3 times normal or the direct bilirubin
             normal value is more than 3 times;

          -  Renal dysfunction: endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) &lt; 50mL/min or normal serum
             creatinine 1.5 times or more, regardless of hemodialysis treatment;
