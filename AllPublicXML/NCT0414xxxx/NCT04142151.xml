      This clinical trail will evaluate the effect of Sanchitongshu combined with antiplatelet
      drugs (Aspirin or Clopidogrel) in the treatment of high-risk ischemic stroke patients in
      adults. Half of participants will receive SanchiTongshu and one of antiplatelet drugs
      (Aspirin or Clopidogrel) in combination, while the other half will receive a placebo and one
      of antiplatelet drugs (Aspirin or Clopidogrel).

      The aim of this clinical trail is to evaluate the effect of Sanchitongshu in the treatment of
      high-risk ischemic stroke patients in adults. All patients included in the study should meet
      the inclusion criteria. All participants will receive one of antiplatelet drugs (Aspirin or
      Clopidogrel). Half of participants will receive Sanchitongshu and Aspirin or Clopidogrel,
      while the other half will receive a placebo and Aspirin or Clopidogrel. All participants will
      be assigned to either the active group or the control group randomly. During the clinical
      trail both doctors and patients are double-blind except serious adverse events occurred.

    <description>Drug: SanchiTongshu The study drugs were manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) by the Pharmaceutical Factory of Chengdu Huasun Group Inc. Ltd. and presented in the form capsules. Every Sanchitongshu capsule weighed 200 mg, contained 100 mg of panaxatriol saponin (PTS) and 100 mg inactive excipient (starch). PTS comprised of dried extracts from roots of Radix Notoginseng, and had been standardised with respect to Ginsenoside Rg1 (50%), Ginsenoside Re (6%), Notoginsenoside R1 (11%). The amounts of the active ingredients were determined by analytical RP-HPLC using an acetonitrile-water gradient system as mobile hase. The peaks were detected by UV-DAD.
