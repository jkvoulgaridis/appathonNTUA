  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer have extremely poor prognosis with five year
      survival below 8% in Norway. Life-prolonging chemotherapy has very limited effect, but is the
      only therapeutic option for these patients. This tumor is characterized by poor uptake and
      chemoresistance. Toxic effects on healthy tissue restrict doses applied and maintenance of
      treatment intensity. This severely limits clinical outcome. Increasing the local uptake of
      chemotherapy has potential benefits for patients in connection to side effects, survival and
      possible cure. Treatment with Focused Ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) is
      proved promising to improve treatment response in animal and clinical trials. Ultrasound can
      induce biological effects deep inside the body without surgical intervention. This opens for
      local delivery of drugs at desired sites. FUS in combination with regular contrast MBs has
      been reported to influence the delivery of drugs to tumors.

      In this trial FUS and MB will be applied to locally advanced pancreatic cancers shortly after
      the administration of conventional chemotherapy. Primary aim of the trial is to investigate
      whether the effect of the cytostatic drug, measured in tumor volume, can be increased.
