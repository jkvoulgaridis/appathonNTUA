  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neuroguard IEP System is a 3-in-1 carotid stent delivery system consisting of an
      angioplasty balloon, an integrated embolic protection device and a nitinol self-expanding
      stent loaded over the balloon and constrained by an outer sheath. The PERFORMANCE I study is
      a multi-center, prospective, single arm open label study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of the Neuroguard IEP System for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. The
      primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with Major Adverse Events (MAE) reported
      within 30 days from the index procedure.

      The primary objective of the PERFORMANCE I study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      the Neuroguard IEP Carotid Stent System when used in patients with clinically significant
      carotid artery stenosis requiring revascularization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and non-breastfeeding female subjects whose age is ≥18 years.

          2. Patient is willing and capable of complying with all study protocol requirements,
             including specified follow-up period and can be contacted by telephone.

          3. Patient is willing to provide written informed consent prior to enrollment in study.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must have documented negative pregnancy test within
             7 days of the Index procedure.

          5. Patient is either:

               -  Symptomatic with carotid stenosis ≥50% as determined by angiography using NASCET
                  methodology. Symptomatic is defined as transient ischemia attack (TIA) or
                  non-disabling stroke within 180 days of the procedure within the hemisphere
                  supplied by the target vessel; or

               -  Asymptomatic with carotid stenosis ≥80% as determined by angiography using NASCET
                  methodology.

        7. Patient has a target lesion located at the carotid bifurcation and/or proximal internal
        carotid artery (ICA).

        8. Patient has a single de novo or restenotic (post carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) target
        lesion or severe tandem lesions close enough that can be covered by a single Neuroguard
        stent.

        9. Target lesion reference vessel diameter between 4.0 and 7.0 mm. 10. Distal vessel
        diameter at the site of filter deployment between 4.0 mm and 7.0 mm.

        11. Sufficient landing zone in the cervical internal carotid artery distal to the lesion to
        allow for the safe and successful deployment of the primary embolic protection filter
        (commercially available) and the Neuroguard integrated embolic protection filter.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Life expectancy of less than one year.

             stroke in the last 30 days.

          3. Recently (&lt;30 days) implanted heart valve (either surgically or endovascularly) which
             is a known source of emboli as confirmed on echocardiogram and anticipated or

             the sheath, guiding catheter, integrated embolic protection device (EPD) or stent.

         20. Patient has severe calcification of the target lesion that may prevent full expansion
             of the carotid stent.

         21. Intraluminal mobile filling defect or fresh thrombus in the target lesion.

         22. Occlusion or presence of a string sign in the ipsilateral common or internal carotid
