      Goal

      The objective of this study is to assess structured group education onboarding protocol of
      the 670 G Hybrid Closed Loop systems in achieving glucose control of patients on MDI.

      Methods

      This study is a single-arm, single-center, clinical investigation in subjects with type 1
      diabetes on HCL insulin pump (Minimed 670G) in a period of 3 months. A total of 40 subjects
      (age 18-65) will be enrolled in order to reach 34 subjects who will complete the HCL study.
      The investigators will start the clinical process for initiating an insulin pump, which is
      typically done with pre-pump classes. HbA1c, derived from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
      will be performed at baseline and at the end of the 3-month study period. The following
      parameters will be analyzed&quot; % patients achieving glucose readings Time in Range (TIR) &gt; 67%
      in (70-180 mg/dl); % patients achieving &lt;3% Time below Range ( &lt;70 mg/dl) and % patients
      achieving both TIR &gt; 67% and &lt;3% Time below Range.Collection of demographics and medical
      history, data for diabetes devices (eg meters, sensors, pumps) and brief clinical physical
      exam including vital signs and skin assessment will be obtained via Hospital Electronic
      Medical File (Cerner Millennium) and will be kept as electronic data on a separate research
      server.
