  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of moderate to high intensity exercise on
      gut function and inflammatory markers in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and to
      compare them with individuals of matched age who do not suffer from Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease. Participants will be asked to complete 60 minutes of continuous cycling at a
      moderate to high intensity followed by a three hour recovery period. Gastrointestinal
      function will be measured using a non-invasive breath test. Blood samples will be collected
      at multiple time-points during the visit and these samples will be measured for markers of
      immune function and intestinal integrity.

      There is limited research on the effect of exercise on patients with Ulcerative Colitis. The
      aim of this investigation is to study the acute effects of moderate to high intensity
      exercise on gut function in patients with Ulcerative Colitis and to compare them with
      individuals of matched age who do not suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

      Patients in remission from disease activity and age and gender matched healthy control
      participants will be recruited from the general population. Participants will attend the
      laboratory on two occasions. The first visit will last approximately one hour and will
      include an exercise test to determine peak oxygen uptake capacity (VO2peak) which is an
      indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness. The second visit will last for approximately four and
      a half hours and will consist of a 60 minute continuous cycle on a stationary cycle ergometer
      at an intensity of 65% VO2peak followed by a recovery period. Gastric emptying rate of a
      commercially available sports drink will be measured and blood samples will be collected at
      regular time-points throughout the visit and analysed for concentrations of inflammatory
      markers and intestinal integrity/function.
