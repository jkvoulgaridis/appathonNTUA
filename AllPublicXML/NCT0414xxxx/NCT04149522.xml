    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the use of Mepitel Film® in preventing radiation
      epidermitis in patients receiving radiation treatment for breast cancer. Mepitel® Film is a
      thin, flexible, waterproof, and breathable film made of a soft silicone layer and
      polyurethane film. Mepitel ® film is not made with natural rubber latex (NRL). It is FDA
      approved for the management of superficial wounds, such as superficial burns. As a part of
      this research study, the Mepitel Film® will be placed prior to participant's first radiation
      treatment, and will be removed one week following the end of treatment. Throughout the study,
      information will be collected to analyze at the end of the research study to determine if the
      Mepitel Film® helps prevent skin breakdown. The subjects will be followed per standard of
      care and examined for skin redness, warmth or swelling as normally examined and cared for
      during standard radiation therapy. If radiation burns are noted, the subject will be treated
      normally and depending on the severity of the radiation burns, may be removed from the study
      treatment and treated through standard of care.

      Clinical Phase II trial to determine if Mepitel Film® is a viable prophylactic option for
      high-risk women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer to reduce side effects of radiation
      on the skin.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of use of Mepitel Film® in the
      prevention of grade II or higher radiation epidermitis in high-risk patients undergoing
      radiotherapy for breast cancer.

      Test Article(s) Mepitel Film ®

      The proposed study is a cohort trial of women with breast cancer who are at a high risk of
      having pain, swelling, inflammation with skin tenderness, skin ulceration, pruritis, and
      scarring during radiation treatment.

      Each subject's participation will last approximately eight weeks. The entire study is
      expected to last up to 24 months.

      The primary analysis will be based classification of radiation dermatitis from treated and
      untreated skin at each visit. Secondary endpoints will review quality of life responses
      compared to dermatitis.

      Statistical analysis will be completed by Highmark Health Data Science R&amp;D. The principal
      investigator will share any updates, AEs and safety concerns to the Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB), a group of scientists, physicians, statisticians, and others that collect and
      analyze data during the course of a research study to monitor for adverse events and other
      trends that would warrant modification or termination of the trial or notification of
      subjects about new information that might affect their willingness to continue in the trial.
      The Highmark Health Data Science Research and Development department are the statisticians
      for this study and will participate on the DSMB.

      General Schema of Study Design Women who meet inclusion/exclusion for the trial and are
      consent to participate in the trial are enrolled in the study. Prior to standard of care
      radiation treatments, women will have the area of the breast divided into two, approximately
      equal parts; medial and lateral. The in-field ipsilateral axilla will be included with the
      lateral breast segment to the extent necessary for coverage of the breast or chest wall only.
      The infra-mammary crease will be part of both the medial and lateral breast segments.
      Axillary irradiation is allowed and the nodal areas irradiated should be considered as part
      of the evaluable field and covered with the Film as required by division of the breast as
      above. The aspect of the breast covered by the Mepitel Film® will alternate with consecutive
      patients and the axilla will be separately evaluated for acute reaction. Each woman will act
      as her own control. The breast will be photographed (digital images). At each treatment, the
      breast will be evaluated for signs of infection, erythema, induration, dry or wet
      desquamation or frank skin breakdown. A Quality-Of-Life (QOL) Instrument will be completed by
      the patient.

      All radiotherapy visits are standard of care for participants. The Mepitel Film® has been
      purchased for this study by the AGH Auxiliary and each box of Film received will be then
      labeled for investigational use only.

      Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites Length of time on study is dependent upon the
      radiotherapy regimen (25 fractions or 28 fractions) and any AE probably or definitely related
      to study participation. The expected length of time on study is 6 - 7 weeks: 25 to 28
      business days (Monday-Friday) for the radiotherapy plus the one week post treatment follow up
      visit. Visits related to an adverse event (AE) will continue until the AE is resolved, which
      may extend participation time.

      The study will be conducted at approximately 5 investigative sites in the Allegheny Health
      Network and the accrual goal is 40 women.

    <description>The breast will be photographed and assessed at the beginning of therapy and at weeks 3, 5 and 6 the 3 (which will occur if clinically indicated) and one week following the completion of therapy. At each treatment, the breast will be evaluated by a physician for signs of infection, erythema, induration, dry or wet desquamation or frank skin breakdown, utilizing a Radiation Dermitis scale (NCI CTCAE v4.03) at each visit. The scale ranges from 0 to 4, with 0-being no change, 1-faint erythema or dry desquamation, 2-moderate to brisk erythema, 3-confluent moist desquamation, 4-skin necrosis or ulceration, as assessed by the physician. The primary analysis will be based on the classification of radiation dermatitis from treated and untreated skin at each visit and will be analyzed using a chi-square or Fisher's Exact test as appropriate. Analysis will be stratified by any significant confounding factors or effect modifiers.</description>

    <description>A QOL questionnaire will be completed by each patient prior to first radiation treatment and at weeks 3, 5 and 6 (which will occur if clinically indicated) of radiotherapy, and 1 week following the completion of irradiation. The questionnaire asks subjects to rate symptoms on a scale from 1 to 4 (1 being excellent or no side effect to 4 being poor or worst side effect). The symptoms include: nipple appearance, arm movement, breast tenderness, breast swelling, breast sensitivity, swelling of breast, breast warm to touch, breast skin is red, breast skin is tanned, breast skin is flaking or peeling, breast itching, blisters or breast skin moist and raw, sharp shooting pains in the breast. Subjects will also be asked to choose the word (with definition) that best describes how their breast looks (excellent, good, poor or fair). Data will be analyzed using McNemar's test to compare the pre/post differences in survey response. Analysis will be stratified by any significant confounders.</description>

    <description>Women assigned to the medial breast tissue arm, will have the area of the breast visually divided into 2 equal parts; medial and lateral. The film will be applied to the medial breast tissue by clinically trained staff on day 1 of radiotherapy, the lateral segment will not be covered. The treatment area is cleaned with mild soap, rinsed with water, and dried. The film is applied, sticky side to the skin, then the paper frame is removed. Multiple sheets of non-overlapping film will be used to adequately cover the treatment area. During course of radiotherapy, new film may be applied by clinically trained staff in the event the film no longer adheres to the skin or comes off. Replacement of the film may be done as often as necessary. If there are signs of infection (e.g. redness, feeling warm or swollen), film can be removed. The film will remain in place until one week following the last day of radiotherapy, where it will be removed by the physician or clinically trained staff.</description>
