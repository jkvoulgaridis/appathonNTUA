  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of sleep-wake behavior is considered to be one of the most important
      maturation processes occurring in the first year of life. Sleep-wake behavior is related to
      neurobehavioral regulation of the infant and cognitive function, and gives important
      information about infant's health. It is suggested that the identification of sleep-wake
      patterns in preterm infants is critical to the detection of future disorders, early diagnosis
      and planning of intervention studies In this study we aimed to recruit a total of 25
      premature babies born between 28 to 37 weeks of gestational age over six month in the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital.
      Sleep wake cycles of these premature infants will be assessed at 32 weeks corrected age by
      actigraphy, sleep diaries, direct observation and Amplitude integrated electroencephalography
      (aEEG). We also aimed to investigate the maturation of sleep patterns of these infants
      included in the study at postconceptional 40th weeks of age, and 12th, and at 24th weeks
      corrected age, by sleep diaries and actigraphic measurements at their home environment.
      Development will be assessed by Bayley and Ages and Stages Questionnaire.

      Studies show that the patterns of sleep-wakefulness reflect the maturation of the central
      nervous system in preterm infants and are indicative of behavioral development. It is
      emphasized that the identification of sleep-wake patterns in preterm infants is critical to
      the detection of future disorders, early diagnosis and planning of intervention studies.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess factors affecting the maturation of sleep
      wake cycles in preterm infants by actigraphy, sleep diaries, direct observation, and aEEG.
      Our secondary objectives were to assess the neurodevelopment of these infants.

      In this study we aimed to recruit a total of 25 premature babies born between 28 to 37 weeks
      of gestational age over a six month period in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Marmara
      University Pendik Training and Research Hospital. Sleep architecture will be assessed at 32
      corrected age by actigraphy, sleep diaries, and aEEG. Simultaneous video recording and direct
      observation will be performed and sleep stages will be defined. Anderson Behavioral State
      Scale will also be applied. Philips Respironics Actiwatch-2 devices will be used. The follow
      up will be at post conceptional 40 weeks, 12 and 24 weeks corrected age. Development will be
      assessed by Bayley test and Ages and Stages Questionnaire.
