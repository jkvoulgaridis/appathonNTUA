    <textblock>
      DESIRIAL® PLUS is a CE-marketed hyaluronic acid (since 2011) whose registered indications are
      moderate hypotrophy, severe hypotrophy or atrophy of the vulvar Labia Majora by subcutaneous
      injections. The aim is to restore volume, rehydrate and add tone and tension to connective
      tissue areas by filling.

      In this study, 58 female subjects above or equal to 18 years old at inclusion, who have
      moderate hypotrophy or severe hypotrophy or atrophy of the vulvar Labia Majora (according to
      investigator's judgement), who have given her informed consent and meet all the eligibility
      criteria, will be enrolled. Subjects will come to a total of 6 visits over a period of 12
      months. An optional screening visit may be done before injection (additional visit).
      Proportion of patients having an improved perception of aesthetics (GAIS score after mirror
      self-examination) after baseline injection will be assessed. Global Aesthetic Improvement,
      Sexual function, subject's satisfaction, subject's symptoms, pain at injection and safety
      will be also assessed.

      ESOLANE is a prospective multicenter post-marketing study of a class III medical device. This
      uncontrolled open-label study investigates the efficacy and safety of DESIRIAL® PLUS in
      volume restoration of Labia Majora. The study duration is 12 months with an optional
      screening visit (V0) up to 14 days before injection, the baseline visit (injection of
      DESIRIAL®PLUS, V1) and 5 follow-up visits after 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (V2 to V6). At 4
      weeks (V2) an optional touch-up may be done (if needed). It is envisaged to enrol 58 female
      patients with the wish for volume restoration in France to obtain at least 48 evaluable
      patients, which will be monitored over 1 year after baseline injection of DESIRIAL® PLUS.

      The primary endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients having an improved perception
      of aesthetics (GAIS score after mirror self-examination) at 12 weeks after baseline injection
      of DESIRIAL® PLUS, which may be touched-up once after 4 weeks (V2).

      Global Aesthetic Improvement (evaluated by the patient and the doctor), Sexual function,
      subject's satisfaction, subject's symptoms &amp; pain, will be measured at all time-point with a
      Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), patient's
      satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) and a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) respectively. Safety will
      be also assessed.

    <description>DESIRIAL® PLUS is a cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel to restore volume by filling the labia majora, to rehydrate and to add tone and tension to the area of connective tissue.
The baseline injection is performed at V1, with a maximum volume to be injected per labium of 2 ml. The exact volume will be determined by the physician in order to reach optimal volume correction.
One optional touch-up injection of DESIRIAL® PLUS is allowed at V2 (4 weeks after Baseline), with a maximum volume to be injected per labium of 1 ml. No other touch-up injections are allowed until the end of the study.</description>
