  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the difference in the reduction of pain
      at 1 month after intradiscal infiltration of corticosteroids depending on symmetrical or
      asymmetrical active discopathies with MRI examination.

      As secondary objective, the study aims to study the correlation between pain reduction which
      will be assessed by numerical scale at 1 month and 6 months after intradiscal infiltration of
      corticosteroids and following parameters: the duration of chronic lumbago, the presence of
      associated root pains, the morphological characteristics with RMI examination of active
      discopathies, the co-existence of scoliosis, the sign of inter-somatic instability, the
      muscular trophicity of muscle erector of low back, the pelvic incidence, degree of lumbar
      lordosis, Cobb angle, wearing a corset.

    <description>The pain reduction and the co-existence of scoliosis will be assessed. The change in pain will be evaluated by NRS for pain (numeric rating scale, a scale from 0 to 10) by phone call after intradiscal infiltration of corticosteroids, according to the presence of associated scoliosis or not will be assessed. Scoliosis will be investigated by interviewing the patient and analazing the patient's x-rays, performed as part of routine care prior to the pre-inclusion consultation. Scoliosis is any lateral spinal curvature with a Cobb angle &gt;10° on x-rays.</description>

    <description>The change in pain will be evaluated by NRS for pain (numeric rating scale, a scale from 0 to 10) by phone call after intradiscal infiltration of corticosteroids, according to the presence of signs of inter-somatic instability or not will be assessed. Signs of inter-somatic instability will be investigated by interviewing the patient and analazing the patient's x-rays and MRI, performed as part of routine care prior to the pre-inclusion consultation. Intersomatic instability is defined as the anterior, posterior or lateral translational displacement of a vertebral body against another (more than 3 mm) on x-rays or MRI.</description>

Signs of posterior articular osteoarthritis will be investigated by interviewing the patient and analazing the patient's x-rays and MRI, performed as part of routine care prior to the pre-inclusion consultation. Posterior articular osteoarthritis will be defined by the presence of bone protrusions, narrowing of joint space, effusion of the joint and periarticular inflammation on x-rays or MRI.</description>

Signs of atrophy of the erector muscles of the lumbar spine will be investigated by interviewing the patient and analazing the patient's MRI, performed as part of routine care prior to the pre-inclusion consultation. Atrophy of the erector muscles of the lumbar spine will be defined by the presence fat infiltration in erector muscles of the lumbar spine MRI.</description>
