  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, structured physical exercise with high intensity was implemented as a part of the
      treatment program at St. Olav Hospital Clinic of Substance Use and Addiction Medicine.

      The objective of this study is to examine whether implementing structured physical exercise
      in the treatment program has implications for patients' physical and mental health and
      quality of life after completing a 3 month residential treatment program.

      The results of this study will benefit substance use disorder patients in the future, and may
      have an impact on further implementation of physical exercise in addiction treatment clinics
      both nationally and internationally.

    <description>assessed by a in-house developed questionnaire, which is composed of 4 parts: Severity of Dependence 5-items (each of the five items is scored on a 4-point scale (0-3). Total score is the sum of the 5-item ratings. The higher the score the higher the level of dependence); Circumstances, Motivation, Readiness, and Suitability instrument (Five items measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (totally agree). High scores indicate increased intrinsic motivation); Quality-of-Life rating five items recorded on a five-point Likert scale: 1 (very poor) - 5 (very good). The raw scores are transformed to a decimal scale, ranging from 0.1 worst score to 0.9 best score); Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10): Ten items recorded on a four-point Likert scale: (1) not at all - (4) extremely.</description>
