  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is an irreversible, slow and progressive process. It is influenced mainly by age,
      but also by external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, smoking, alcohol, among others.
      It is increasingly common to look for procedures that slow this process by limiting or hiding
      its effects on the skin and its appearance. Intradermal platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection
      is a new modality of treatment which has possible beneficial effects on skin rejuvenation. In
      addition, studies have shown photobiomodulation (PBM) benefits to the skin. The purpose of
      this paper is to investigate the effects of combined use of intradermal PRP injection on the
      face and photobiomodulation for facial rejuvenation. To this end, a randomized, double-blind,
      controlled clinical trial will be conducted with volunteer participants who wish to improve
      facial aesthetics, attended at the Nove de Julho University specialty medical outpatient
      clinic in the city of São Paulo. Participants will be divided into three groups: one group
      will undergo intradermal application of PRP in association with PBM; another group will
      undergo intradermal application of PRP and placebo light and a third group will receive
      intradermal application of 0.9% saline solution (placebo) associated with PBM. Only one
      application of PRP or saline solution will be performed at defined points on the face. PBM
      sessions will be held immediately after the first application of PRP or saline solution, 3
      days after the first application and weekly for the next 3 weeks. The following variables
      will be studied for further analysis: face moldings analyzed by optical coherence tomography;
      skin viscoelasticity; histological study of the dermis; evolutionary comparison of
      photographic images by plastic surgeons (Wrinkle Assessment Scale) and participants'
      satisfaction level (FACE-Q). All data will be statistically evaluated according to their
      distribution.

    <masking_description>A single researcher will perform the treatment and he/she will not perform any evaluation. Pre- and post-treatment evaluations will be made by four examiners (three plastic surgeons and one pathologist) who will not be aware of the group to which each patient will be allocated. Participants will not be aware of whether or not they have received the PRP, the application syringes will be camouflaged with opaque adhesive on the outside and they will not be aware whether or not they have received the PBM application as they will be using eye protection and the person who applies it will position the equipment at the irradiation sites on all participants and will only turn on the light in the specific experimental group. The characteristic sound of the device will be triggered by recording in the placebo groups for the PBM.</masking_description>

    <description>Digital photographs of the face obtained before and after 3 and 6 months will be analyzed by 3 plastic surgeons. Each evaluator will receive the same image of wrinkles, all at the end of the experiment. There will be 15 standardized photographs of the face per patient over 6 months of study, totaling 1440 images for each evaluator. Each image should be scored from 0 to 5 using the Wrinkle Assessment Scale.</description>

    <description>Negative silicone molds of frontal wrinkles, bilateral periorbital wrinkles and nasolabial folds will be analyzed before treatment and after 3 and 6 months. The parameters to be analyzed are: average surface roughness; average roughness and maximum profile height.</description>
