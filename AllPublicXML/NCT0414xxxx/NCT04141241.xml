      After a screening, 114 patients will be stratified randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 3 arms
      (PH100 800mg/day, PH100 1600mg/day, Placebo) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PH100.

      Subjects will visit the centers on Week 4, 8 and 12 during the entire 12-week treatment
      period.
