  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as
      diltiazem for patients presenting in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,
      without evidence of pre-excitation, are recommended first-line therapies by the American
      Heart Association.1 Hypotension warrants careful consideration in the treatment of atrial
      fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Hemodynamic stability is a continuum,
      however, and rate control is often vital, particularly in patients who are refractory to
      electrical cardioversion [or who have underlying conditions such that tachycardia is not well
      tolerated]. Diltiazem has been utilized in dosing such as 2.5 mg/min in those with decreased
      blood pressure and atrial fibrillation with elevated ventricular rate.2 Lim et al. in 2002
      demonstrated the effectiveness of a slow infusion of diltiazem 2.5 mg/min to a maximum of 50
      mg to control rate in supraventricular tachycardia.

      The study of the slow infusion of diltiazem has been limited to supraventricular tachycardia.
      No literature exists evaluating the efficacy of such a gradual infusion in atrial
      fibrillation or atrial flutter, rhythms affecting 2.7 million to 6.1 million Americans.1,3 It
      can be reasoned that a gradual infusion of diltiazem will minimize side effects,
      predominantly hypotension, and perhaps even demonstrate efficacy in alleviating hypotension
      due to decreased stroke volume from excessive tachycardia. The proposed benefits of an
      infusion, as compared to a bolus, would allow for the termination of an infusion as soon as
      rate control is achieved thus limiting the potential for hypotension. With current
      evidence-based literature validating the superiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel
      blockers and questions surrounding present recommendations of weight based intravenous
      dosing, the authors suggest an inquiry into the utility of a gradual infusion of diltiazem
      for initial rate control in patients presenting with atrial fibrillation or flutter with or
      without hypotension related to excessive tachycardia.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind investigation to compare the effectiveness of
      standard IV (intravenous) push diltiazem at 0.25 mg/kg (to a maximum of 25 mg) over 2
      minutes, with a potential repeat dose of 0.35 mg/kg if the initial dose is not effective
      versus a slow infusion of 50 mg of IV diltiazem diluted in 50 mL of 0.9% normal saline (NS)
      administered over 20 minutes. The investigators anticipate the data to be collected over the
      course of 2-3 years. These methods of diltiazem administration are already accepted practices
      at our institution and are consistent with current approved product labeling and professional
      judgment based upon clinical experience, and therefore the investigators do not foresee any
      additional risk to patients enrolled in our proposed study. In either treatment group, should
      hypotension or other clinical evidence of poor systemic perfusion, no additional IV
      diltiazem, or additional administration of a diltiazem infusion will be administered. The
      primary outcome measured will be the efficacy of treatment as defined by the obtainment of a
      heart rate of &lt;110 beats/minute within 30 minutes of drug administration. Secondary outcomes
      evaluated will include the need for additional medications to achieve rate control including
      the need for repeat diltiazem bolus at 0.35 mg/kg, electrical cardioversion, admission,
      allergic reactions, and side effects including, but not limited to, systolic blood pressure
      less than 90 mmHg or bradycardia with heart rate less than 60 bpm.

    <intervention_model_description>A parallel randomized blinded model. Eligible and consented participants will be randomized to diltiazem IV push or diltiazem slow bolus. Each will receive an opposite sham infusion of saline provided as IVP push or slow bolus t0 maintain the blind. All participants will receive 30 mg oral dose of diltiazem. Standard of care measures will be provided concurrently as per routine care of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
Participants will be randomized in 15 blocks of 20 to ensure there are equal numbers of participants in each group for interim analyses. The randomization scheme will allow for 300 participants to account for issues, including dropouts.</intervention_model_description>
