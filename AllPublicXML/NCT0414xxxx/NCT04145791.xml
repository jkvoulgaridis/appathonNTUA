      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the effectiveness of cryotherapy as an
      additional form of pain control in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign
      gynecologic conditions through a randomized trial. The following aims will be pursued:

      Primary Aim: To determine if cryotherapy patients will have lower pain scores on VAS compared
      to standard pain management patients.

      Primary Hypothesis: Patients receiving cryotherapy will have lower VAS scores compared to
      patients receiving pain management.

      Secondary Aim 1: To determine if cryotherapy will reduce the number of morphine milligram
      equivalent (MME) compared to patients with standard pain management.

      Secondary Hypothesis 1: Patients receiving cryotherapy will have lower MME values compared to
      patients with standard pain management.

      Secondary Aim 2: To determine if cryotherapy will result in earlier return to baseline
      activity as measured by Quality of Recovery Questionnaire (QoR).

      Secondary Hypothesis 2: Patients receiving cryotherapy will return to baseline activity level
      sooner than those receiving standard pain management.

      Secondary Aim 3: To determine if cryotherapy will result in a faster time to discharge as
      determined by duration between admission to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and discharge
      home.

      Secondary Hypothesis 3: Patient receiving cryotherapy will be have a shorter stay in PACU.

    <description>To determine if cryotherapy patients will have lower pain scores on a visual analog scale (VAS) compared to standard pain management patients at the time of same day discharge. VAS requires that patients mark their level pain along a straight 100mm line. There are no number markings on the scale. The beginning of the line is labeled on the left as &quot;no pain&quot; and the end of the line on the right is labeled as &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Once marked by the patient, the distance from beginning of the line to the patient's hash mark is measured in millimeters and that value is recorded as the pain level. The minimum is 0 (no pain) and the maximum is 100 (worst pain imaginable).</description>
