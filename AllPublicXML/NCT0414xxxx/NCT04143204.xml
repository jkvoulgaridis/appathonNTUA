  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the relation of early nutritional intake, especially oral
      nutrition intake, with growth and body composition among very preterm or very low birth
      weight infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the survival of very preterm infants increases, it is important to evaluate their
      long-term outcomes. Nutritional intake during early life was important to the growth and
      development in infants, especially in preterm infants. Studies found that early nutrition
      exposure in preterm infants can effect scored of Griffith Mental Development Scales and body
      fat percentage at later life. Insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, Ghrelin, C-Peptide are
      associated with fat mass in children. And accumulation of fat and insulin resistance (IR) in
      the early postnatal period are related to metabolism diseases in adulthood. However, previous
      studies on nutrition and growth or the body composition of preterm infants were mostly
      completed in developed countries, and no relevant data were available in China. Therefore,
      this study aims to establish a prospective cohort of very preterm infants to observe the
      effects of nutritional exposure in early life on growth and body composition in later life.
