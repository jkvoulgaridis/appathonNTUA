  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to test the safety of Repetitive Magnetic Stimulation (RMS) treatment for dry
      eye disease. Patients are asked to undergo a one-time treatment with Epitech Ocular Magnetic
      Stimulation Device on one eye in the first stage and both eyes sequentially in the second
      stage of the study. Changes are monitored for over a study period of 3 months.

    <description>First stage: Patients will be asked to undergo a one-time treatment with Epitech Corneal Magnetic Stimulation Device on one eye. The worst eye will be treated; if both eyes are equal, the right eye will be treated.
Second stage: will be treated on both eyes, applying treatment to both eyes sequentially during the same visit.</description>
