      To see whether MINGO, a food supplement, will be able to lessen the drastic weight loss seen
      among X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP, formerly known as DYT3) occurs primarily in Filipino
      males and is characterized by neurodegenerative dystonia and parkinsonism. It is currently
      recognized to have wide phenotypic variability relating to age of onset, location of disease
      onset and rate of severity/disease progression. Most patients begin with focal dystonia that
      generalizes with the development of parkinsonism later in disease course. XDP patients suffer
      from severe nutritional loss due to symptoms such as dysphagia, loss of appetite, and
      consistently high metabolic requirements brought about by their movement disorder.
      Approximately 79% of patients with XDP have experienced rapid weight loss since the onset of
      their disease. It is the aim of the researchers to assess the clinical usefulness of adding a
      nutritional supplement to the daily dietary needs of these patients.

      MINGO is a supplement consisting of local ingredients such as moringa, rice and mung beans,
      which can be added to any type of edible paste, food, and liquid. Mingo has gained popularity
      as an emergency food in disaster relief operations due to the ease of its preparation, its
      high nutritional value and relatively low price. For the last two years, it has also been
      used as an agent for nutritional build up in malnourished populations of children. This study
      will provide valuable information on whether patients with XDP can increase their weight by
      consuming MINGO, which will lead to improvements in the patients' medical care and wellbeing.

    <limitations_and_caveats>A major limitation to this trial is that it was a community-based clinical trial that relied on 14 CHWs to measure the weight and MUAC due to the far distance and difficult terrain. The accuracy of subject’s food diary is a limitation.</limitations_and_caveats>
