      This proposal will test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with sildenafil with and
      without the use of nitric oxide substrate, L-arginine, protects against fatty acid induced
      impairment of endothelial function, improves insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment,
      insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in CD36 rs3211938 G-allele carriers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects carrying the G-allele of CD36 coding SNP rs3211938 that results in 50% reduction of
      CD36 levels in ~25% of African Americans have endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial
      dysfunction results in impairment of insulin's vascular actions and eventually reduced
      insulin sensitivity. Insulin induces microvascular recruitment via stimulation of nitric
      oxide(NO)-cGMP pathway, which facilitates nutrient flux, e.g., glucose to skeletal muscle.
      Elevated fatty acids impair insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment and reduce insulin
      sensitivity. Chronic treatment with sildenafil increases vascularity and muscle glucose
      uptake in high fat fed mice. In humans, Drs. Shibao (PI) recently reported that a 3-month
      treatment with sildenafil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose
      tolerance. More relevant to this project, endothelial dysfunction improved after 4-week
      treatment with sildenafil in G-allele carriers. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
      chronic treatment with sildenafil with and without the use of NO substrate, L-arginine,
      protects against fatty acids induced impairment of endothelial function, improves
      insulin-stimulated microvascular.

      The protocol design was changed to single arm design.

             significant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (left ventricular hypertrophy
             acceptable), deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, second or third degree heart
             block, mitral valve stenosis, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

          -  Any underlying or acute disease requiring regular medication which could possibly pose
             a threat to the subject or make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of
             the study results difficult

          -  Treatment with chronic systemic glucocorticoid therapy (more than 7 consecutive days
             in 1 month)

             possible consequences of the study

          -  Inability to comply with the protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for follow-up visits, unlikelihood of completing the study, and investigator
             discretion
