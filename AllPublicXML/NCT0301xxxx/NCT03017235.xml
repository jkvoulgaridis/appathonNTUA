    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Classified as a Responder Defined by &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>During colonoscopy procedure (5-9 hours after completed treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of overall colon cleansing in terms of responders was measured by a blinded endoscopist using the Modified Aronchick Scale. Modified Aronchick scale is a 4-point scale that grades colon cleansing as Excellent (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal suctioning needed for adequate visualization), Good (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate visualization), Fair (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mixture of liquid and semisolid stool, could be suctioned and/or washed) or Inadequate (&lt;90% of mucosa seen, mixture of semisolid and solid stool which could not be suctioned or washed).The participant is considered to be a responder if overall colon cleansing is &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; on this 4-point scale.</description>

    <description>The percentage of subjects classified as responders, defined by a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score ≥2 in the right segment of the colon was determined.
The BBPS scale:
0= Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared; 1= Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid; 2= Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well; 3= Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid.</description>

          -  Upper gastrointestinal surgery (gastrectomy, gastric banding, gastric by-pass)

          -  Uncontrolled angina and/or myocardial infarction (MI) within last three months,
             congestive heart failure (CHF), uncontrolled hypertension, or ascites

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in medical history, physical examination,
             vital signs, ECG, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis at
             Screening Visit 1

          -  Rhabdomyolysis

Modified Aronchick scale is a 4-point scale that grades colon cleansing as Excellent (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal suctioning needed for adequate visualization), Good (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate visualization), Fair (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mixture of liquid and semisolid stool, could be suctioned and/or washed) or Inadequate (&lt;90% of mucosa seen, mixture of semisolid and solid stool which could not be suctioned or washed).The participant is considered to be a responder if overall colon cleansing is &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; on this 4-point scale.</description>
