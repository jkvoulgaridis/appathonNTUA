  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research deals with behaviors that are part of opioid dependence. The purpose is to
      study how stress and medication dose can affect opioid drug use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If participants meet all the criteria, their involvement in the study (Phases 1 and 2
      described below) will last for 10-13 weeks. Participants will be asked to stay at the
      research site for a minimum of 2 nights on 4 separate weeks and will have 22 office visits
      During that time, participants can't leave the unit unescorted or have visitors.

      Participants will receive a medication called Buprenorphine/Naloxone. Buprenorphine/Naloxone
      is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat opioid addiction, and is a
      safe and effective alternative to methadone. Participants will receive this medication every
      day. When participants are not living on the inpatient unit they will come to the research
      clinic every day to receive the medication.

      On Day 1, one single 1-mL (0.2 teaspoon) blood sample will be collected to assess the effect
      of the Buprenorphine/Naloxone medication dose on gene expression pattern.

      On each day of admission (once on weeks 3, 5 and 7), a single 1-mL (0.2 teaspoon) blood
      sample will be collected to assess the effect of the buprenorphine/naloxone medication dose
      on the participant's gene expression pattern.

      On the 8 days while participants are an inpatient they will participate in experimental
      sessions that involve drug administration. On some days participants will receive morphine
      and on some days participants will receive oral medications called yohimbine and
      hydrocortisone that will be used to study stress responses. Each afternoon study staff will
      collect one blood sample (10 mL or 2 teaspoons) from a vein in the participant's arm; these
      samples will be used to measure biological signals of stress.

      At the end of the study participants will be detoxified from the Buprenorphine/Naloxone
      medication over a 3-week outpatient period.

      Study participants will be scheduled for one separate in-person visit at 1 month after week
      11. At this follow-up visit participants will be asked to provide a urine sample and to
      complete questionnaires that ask about drug craving and use, withdrawal symptoms, risky
      situations for drug use, coping with stress, and consequences experienced from using drugs or
      being abstinent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Opioid dependent, as determined by structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and

          -  Participants must be in generally good health to be eligible. All candidates will
             receive a routine medical exam (history and physical) with standard laboratory tests
             (including blood and urine samples, EKG, mandatory TB testing, and voluntary HIV
             testing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No candidate who has a current DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than Drug Dependence or a
             history of serious psychiatric problems (e.g. psychosis, bipolar or major depression)
             will be allowed to participate.

          -  Candidates meeting criteria for opioid or nicotine dependence will not be excluded,
             but those with other Substance Dependence disorders will be excluded. Those with Abuse
             of Alcohol, Cannabis, Cocaine, will not be excluded, but participants must provide an
             alcohol free breath specimen.

          -  No candidate with medical (neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary or systemic)
             disorders will be allowed to participate. This will be determined with history and
             physical exam, standard laboratory testing (blood and urine), EKG, and TB tests (to
             avoid transmitting this communicable disease on the residential unit or in the
             laboratory).

          -  Candidates with evidence of cognitive impairment (based on reading ability and
             comprehension, will be excluded.

          -  Female candidates who are pregnant (urine pregnancy test), lactating, or not using
             adequate birth control methods (self-report) will be excluded.

          -  Candidates with injection phobia, or seeking treatment for opioid dependence will be
             excluded.
