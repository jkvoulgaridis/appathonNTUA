    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and to see how well it works when
      given together with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide in treating patients with Hodgkin
      lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) and does not respond to treatment (refractory).
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as nivolumab, may help the body?s immune system
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and
      etoposide may work better in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of nivolumab as single agent and in combination with
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy (nivolumab [N]ICE) as assessed by
      complete response (CR) rate prior to autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      II. To estimate the proportion of patients experiencing unacceptable adverse events. (Cohort
      B) III. To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab + ICE chemotherapy through
      evaluation of toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, and
      duration. (Cohort B) IV. To obtain estimate of overall response rate (ORR), complete response
      rate, response duration and survival (overall and event-free). (Cohort B) V. Summarize stem
      cell mobilization outcomes (e.g., total CD34+ cell yield, number of apheresis days,
      proportion of patients who achieve &gt;= 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg). (Cohort B) VI. Evaluate
      Hodgkin lymphoma biological markers in subjects treated with nivolumab. (Cohort B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab +/- ICE chemotherapy through evaluation of
      toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      II. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), response duration and survival (overall
      and event-free).

      III. Summarize stem cell mobilization outcomes (e.g., total CD34+ cell yield, number of
      apheresis days, proportion of patients who achieve &gt;= 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg).

      IV. Evaluate Hodgkin lymphoma biological markers in subjects treated with nivolumab.

      V. Among subjects who undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT), estimate
      the post-AHCT overall/progression free survival (PFS) probability and cumulative incidence of
      relapse/progression, non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days, 1-year and 2-years.

      VI. Among subjects who undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT),
      characterize post-AHCT toxicities during the first 30- and 100- days post stem cell infusion
      by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      VII. Among subjects who undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT),
      evaluate short and long-term post-AHCT complications, including: delayed engraftment
      (neutrophil and platelet) and infection, graft versus host disease and sinusoidal obstruction
      syndrome.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from lymphoma specimens and
      serial plasma samples for future biomarker evaluation.

      II. Evaluate potential changes in Hodgkin lymphoma biological markers of patients treated
      with nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 14 days for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with CR or partial response (PR) receive nivolumab for an additional 6
      weeks. Patients with only stable disease (SD) after 6-week nivolumab treatment receive
      nivolumab for an additional 6 weeks or receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1,
      etoposide IV on days 1-3, ifosfamide IV continuously over 24 hours on day 2, and carboplatin
      IV on day 2 every 21 days for 6 weeks per physician/investigator's discretion. Patients with
      progressive disease (PD) after 6-week nivolumab treatment or patients with PR, SD, or PD
      after 12-week nivolumab treatment receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV
      on days 1-3, ifosfamide IV continuously over 24 hours on day 2, and carboplatin IV on day 2.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on cycle 1 (cycle 1 is 14 days), day
      1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in cycle 2,
      patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3, ifosfamide
      IV continuously over 24 hours on day 2, and carboplatin IV on day 2. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

          -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring systemic treatments

          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study
             outcomes at undue risk

          -  Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures

          -  Unable to understand the purpose and risks of the study and to provide a signed and
             dated informed consent for (ICF) and authorization to use protected health information
             (in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations)

          -  Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active
             infection

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, or concurrent
             biological therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy or radiation for =&lt; 3 weeks before
             study enrollment, or those who have not recovered from the adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier are excluded

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities; prior study entry, any
             electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality at screening has to be documented by the
             investigator as not medically relevant

          -  Significant screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities including, but not limited
             to, left bundle branch block, 2nd degree atrioventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd
             degree block, or corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;= 470 msec; subjects with a cardiac
             pacemaker who have a QTc interval of &gt;= 470 msec may be eligible if these findings are
             considered not clinically significant as documented via a cardiology evaluation

          -  DLCO &lt; 60%; the clinical studies in support of accelerated approval for nivolumab in
             chronic (c)HL after failure of ASCT required DLCO &gt; 60%; certain HL induction regimens
             have the potential for pulmonary toxicity, and nivolumab carries the potential of
             pneumonitis or other pulmonary toxicities

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the
             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease or history of brain
             metastases are excluded from study

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued

          -  Recent infection requiring systemic treatment that was completed =&lt; 14 days before the
             first dose of study drug

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; subjects who are positive for hepatitis B core
             antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a negative polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) result before enrollment, those who are PCR positive will be excluded; subjects
             who have an undetectable HIV viral load with CD4 &gt;= 300 and are on highly active
             antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medication are allowed; previously treated hepatitis C
             patients are also allowed; as there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab
             or nivolumab/ipilimumab combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity
             should be used with caution in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen

          -  History of allergy or adverse drug reaction to study components
