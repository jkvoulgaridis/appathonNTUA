    <description>Hypoglycemic episodes are defined as events that are associated with reported signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and/or documented blood glucose (BG) concentrations of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). The overall yearly rates (events/participant/year) of those hypoglycemic events, calculated as, for each participant, the number of episodes times 365.25 and then divided by the participants treatment duration, will be summarized, and analyzed by a Negative-binomial regression model with treatment as fixed effects and log of (patient's treatment duration/365.25) as an offset variable.</description>

    <description>Insulin treatment change can be insulin treatment discontinuation, switch, intensification or reduction in frequency.
Discontinuation: Defined as stopping insulin treatment for 30 days or more.
Switch: Defined as stop the initial insulin therapy and started another insulin therapy of different class.
Intensification: Defined as any of the following: adding meal time insulin in basal insulin analog QD group; changing from BID to TID (Three times a day) in insulin analog mid mixture BID group
Reduction in frequency: Defined as any of the following: changing from BID to QD; changing from TID to BID or QD.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Self-Efficacy About Insulin Therapy Questionnaire (SEITQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SEITQ is designed to measure an individual's self-efficacy related to insulin therapy. The SEITQ consists of 5 items (that is, statements). The first 4 statements imply confidence in completing the tasks needed to take insulin correctly and avoid both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, whereas the last statement is an outcome expectation and implies that performance of these tasks will lead to avoidance of complications. Each item score ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The total SEITQ score is the sum of each item scores, with the range of 5 to 35. Higher SEITQ score indicates better outcome (higher self-efficacy). LS Mean was calculated using Mixed Models Analysis (MMRM) for repeated measures with all post-baseline SEITQ as responses, baseline SEITQ as a continuous covariate, treatment group, Visits, and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <description>Insulin treatment change can be insulin treatment discontinuation, switch, intensification or reduction in frequency.
Discontinuation: Defined as stopping insulin treatment for 30 days or more.
Switch: Defined as stop the initial insulin therapy and started another insulin therapy of different class.
Intensification: Defined as any of the following: adding meal time insulin in basal insulin analog QD group; changing from BID to TID (Three times a day) in insulin analog mid mixture BID group
Reduction in frequency: Defined as any of the following: changing from BID to QD; changing from TID to BID or QD.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Self-Efficacy About Insulin Therapy Questionnaire (SEITQ) Score</title>
        <description>The SEITQ is designed to measure an individual's self-efficacy related to insulin therapy. The SEITQ consists of 5 items (that is, statements). The first 4 statements imply confidence in completing the tasks needed to take insulin correctly and avoid both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, whereas the last statement is an outcome expectation and implies that performance of these tasks will lead to avoidance of complications. Each item score ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The total SEITQ score is the sum of each item scores, with the range of 5 to 35. Higher SEITQ score indicates better outcome (higher self-efficacy). LS Mean was calculated using Mixed Models Analysis (MMRM) for repeated measures with all post-baseline SEITQ as responses, baseline SEITQ as a continuous covariate, treatment group, Visits, and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>
