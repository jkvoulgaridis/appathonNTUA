  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way is effective at
      fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most
      patients. This study combines both T cells and antibodies to try to create a more effective
      treatment. This investigational treatment is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen
      receptor cells targeted against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.

      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes
      make up the chemical structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human
      characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells
      makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody can flow through the blood and
      can find and stick to leukemia cells because these leukemia cells have a substance on their
      surface called CD19. Anti-CD19 antibodies have been used to treat people with leukemia but
      have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has
      been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood a piece of it is now joined to the
      surface of the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the leukemia cells is
      attached to the T cells instead of the entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T
      cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination)
      receptor-activated T cells kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body
      and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.

      Preliminary results of giving ATLCAR.CD19 cells to leukemia patients have been encouraging;
      however, many subjects receiving this treatment have experienced unwanted side effects
      including neurotoxicity and/or cytokine release syndrome (also referred to as cytokine storm
      or an infusion reaction). Cytokines are small proteins that aract as e signals to other cells
      and are the way cells talk to one another. During cytokine release syndromesyndrome, too many
      cytokines are released and too many cells in your body react to their release. Symptoms
      resulting from cytokine release syndrome vary from flu-like symptoms to more severe side
      effects such as cardiac arrest, multi-system organ failure or death. We predict that about
      50% of patients on this study will experience mild to severe cytokine release syndrome.

      To help reduce cytokine release syndrome symptoms in future patients, a safety switch has
      been added to the ATLCAR.CD19 cells that can cause the cells to become dormant or &quot;go to
      sleep&quot;. The safety switch is called inducible caspase 9 or iC9. The modified ATLCAR.CD19
      cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the iC9-CAR19 cells is safe and
      tolerable (there are not too many unwanted effects). If you experience severe cytokine
      release syndrome or moderate to severe cytokine release syndrome that does not get better
      once you are given standard treatments, you may be given a second study drug called
      rimiducid. Similar studies showed that rimiducid can to turn on the safety switch, iC9 in
      other therapies. Using rimiducid to activate the safety switch may be done in addition to
      treating you according to hospital guidelines and making all efforts to immediately attend to
      your cytokine release syndrome symptoms

      OUTLINE

      Cell Procurement

      Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL total (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects
      for cell procurement. In subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood, a
      leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for apheresis
      will be up to 2 blood volumes.

      Lymphodepleting Regimen

      Subjects will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day administered IV
      over 30 min for three consecutive days and a single IV dose of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2
      administered over 1 hour on the fourth day. If iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion is delayed for &gt;4
      weeks, lymphodepletion may be repeated prior to iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion.

      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T Cells

      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will
      receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning chemotherapy
      regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at dose levels specified. A phase
      I trial performed by Lee et al established that 1×106 CAR19+ T cells/kg was safe and
      associated with significant in vivo expansion and we anticipate similar results with
      iC9-CAR19+ T cells.

      Second Cell Infusion Requirements:

      Subjects will be offered a second infusion based on B-cell recovery and MRD status &gt;4 weeks
      after the initial infusion if cells are available or if the subject has sufficient stored
      peripheral blood to manufacture additional iC9-CAR19 T cells.

      Duration of Therapy

      Therapy in LCCC1541-ATL involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells. Treatment with one infusion
      will be administered unless:

        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or

        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      A second infusion with prior lymphodepletion will be given to subjects enrolled in the
      expansion cohort and to subjects enrolled in the dose escalation cohort once the RP2D is
      reached if they meet the eligibility requirements for lymphodepletion and infusion.
      Specifically, only subjects with the following characteristics will be offered a second
      infusion:

        -  B-cell recovery (defined as absolute CD19+ cell count &gt;50/μL in the blood or bone marrow
           within 6 months of initial infusion AND/OR

        -  MRD positive (defined as ≥0.01% as assessed by multi-parameter flow cytometry) with
           CD19+ expression at any time after the initial infusion.

        -  *Note that subjects who receive dose level 1 in the dose escalation will receive the
           RP2D for their second infusion, if applicable.

      Duration of Follow-up

      Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years after the final iC9-CAR19 T-cell infusion for
      RCR evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study for
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse
      event.

      Subjects who receive new therapy (such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant) after a cell
      product administration will still be required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.
