      Robust I study is a feasibility study for evaluating the safety and efficacy of DCB.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness for drug coated balloon
      (DCB).

      Up to 50 subjects is planned to be enrolled and treated with the study device at up to 5
      clinical sites outside of US. Due to significantly higher prevalence of strictures in men vs.
      women and the etiology of those strictures being different, the study will focus on male
      subjects with single anterior urethral stricture. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment
      to one year and then annually for up to 5 years. The annual follow up after the first year is
      optional.

             paclitaxel

          4. Subjects who have a suprapubic catheter and are unable to complete study required
             testing, such as uroflowmetry

          5. Previous urethroplasty within the anterior urethra

          6. Stricture due to bacterial urethritis or untreated gonorrhea

          7. Stricture dilated or incised within the last 3 months

          8. Presence of local adverse factors, including abnormal prostate making catheterization
             difficult, urethral false passage or fistula.

          9. Presence of signs of obstructive voiding symptoms not directly attributable to the
             stricture such as BPH at the discretion of the clinical investigator

         10. Previous radical prostatectomy

         11. Previous pelvic radiation

         12. Diagnosed kidney, bladder, urethral or ureteral stones or active stone passage in the
