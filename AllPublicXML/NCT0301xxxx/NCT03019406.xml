      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety profile of avalglucosidase alfa in patients with infantile-onset Pompe
      disease (IOPD) previously treated with alglucosidase alfa.

      Secondary Objective:

      To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of avalglucosidase alfa and to evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa.

      The duration of the study per patient will be up to 3 years that will consist of a 14-day
      screening period, that may be extended to up to 4 weeks in pre-specified situations, a
      25-week treatment period, a 120-week extension period, and a 4-week post-treatment
      observation period.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has confirmed acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency from any
             tissue source.

          -  The patient who has reached legal age of majority as defined by local regulation, or
             the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide signed informed consent prior to
             performing any study-related procedures. If the patient is legally minor per local
             regulations, assent shall be obtained from patients, if applicable.

          -  The patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is legally minor as defined by
             local regulation) must have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol.

          -  The patient is &lt;18 years old.

          -  The patient, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) and must not be breastfeeding at
             screening/baseline.

          -  The patient has cardiomyopathy at the time of diagnosis: i.e, left ventricular mass
             index (LVMI) equivalent to mean age specific LVMI plus 2 standard deviations.

          -  The patient has been receiving a stable dose of alglucosidase alfa regularly for a
             minimum of 6 months immediately prior to study entry.

          -  For participants in Stage 1: The patient has documented evidence of clinical decline
             in at least 1 of the following parameters related to Pompe Disease and NOT related to
             intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: respiratory function, motor
             skills, and/or cardiac parameters.

          -  For participants in Stage 2: The patient has documented evidence of suboptimal
             clinical response in at least 1 of the following parameters related to Pompe Disease
             and NOT related to intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: respiratory
             function, motor skills, and/or new onset of ptosis.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has high antibody titer to alglucosidase alfa.

          -  The patient has a high risk for a severe allergic reaction to neoGAA.

          -  The patient requires any prohibited concomitant medications (e.g., immune modulatory
             treatment) for the duration of the study.

          -  The patient has previously participated in any ACT14132 study cohort.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective
             contraceptive method of birth control and/or who is unwilling or unable to be tested
             for pregnancy

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
