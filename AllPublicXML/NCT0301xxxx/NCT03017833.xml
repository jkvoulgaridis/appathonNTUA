  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sapanisertib and metformin in
      treating patients with cancers that have spread to other parts of the body
      (advanced/metastatic), have come back (recurrent), or do not respond to treatment
      (refractory). Sapanisertib and metformin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      the combination of sapanisertib (TAK-228) with metformin in patients with advanced cancers
      refractory to standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical tumor response of this combination. II. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of metformin and TAK-228.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive metformin orally (PO) 1-3 times daily on days 1-42 and sapanisertib PO daily
      on days 15-42 of cycle 1. Patients then receive metformin PO daily and sapanisertib PO daily
      on days 1-28 of cycle 2 and beyond. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.
