  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four aims were pursued: (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of video messaging on adolescent donor
      designations in comparison to a regionally-matched historical comparison group of
      adolescents; (2) Compare the differential effectiveness of three commonly-used donation
      messaging strategies (informational, testimonial, and blended) on donor designations; (3)
      Examine the impact of donation messaging on changes in secondary outcomes (donation
      engagement, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, likelihood of donor designation, discussion with a
      parent) before and after video intervention; and (4) Assess the commitment of parents to
      follow their adolescent's donation wishes in the event of death. Our central hypotheses were
      that integrating donation video messaging into driver education classes would generate a
      higher proportion of donor designations compared to a historical comparison group and that
      blended video messaging (informational + testimonials) would yield a higher proportion of
      donor designations and more change in secondary outcomes.

    <description>The primary outcome was donor designation (yes-no) at time of obtaining first driver's license post-intervention. We provided the name, date of birth, last four digits of social security number, residential address, and study identification number of each adolescent to the Massachusetts DoT, which then returned to us a data file containing the donor designation status for each study identification number. For the regionally-matched historical comparison group, the DoT provided a de-identified data file of all adolescents who obtained their first driver's license in the six months prior to study enrollment at six motor vehicle offices.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Organ Donation Knowledge and Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately before, shortly after, and 1 week following video messaging exposure, adolescents completed a questionnaire to assess the following donation constructs: engagement (2 questions -- 1-10 scale), knowledge (3 questions -- correct/incorrect total score range 0-3), general attitude (1 question), beliefs (4 questions -- strong disagree-strongly agree scale), designation likelihood (1 question -- 1-10 scale), and willingness to communicate donation decision to a parent (1 question -- 1-10 scale). Adolescents received a $5 gift card for each survey completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Commitment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>One week following the adolescent's exposure to the donation video, we mailed parents a brief questionnaire that included questions about their donor designation status (Yes/No), general donation attitude (1 question -- 1-10 scale), any communication with their adolescent about his/her donor designation intention (Yes/No), and likelihood of following their adolescent's wishes about donation (1 question -- 1-10 scale).</description>

    <description>This video features four personal testimonials with strong emotional appeal, including an adolescent kidney transplant recipient, a pediatric liver transplant recipient, a young adult kidney transplant candidate, and an adolescent whose twin brother was a deceased organ donor. There are minimal facts about transplantation or donation.</description>

    <description>This video mirrors common educational campaigns and included segments of HRSA's animated video, Organ Donation and Transplantation: How Does it Work? The IM video presents facts about donation, including the current supply-demand problem in transplantation, common reasons for/against donor designation, donation myths, and the importance of communicating with parents about donation. Information about how to register as a donor is also included. The video contains no personal testimonials.</description>
