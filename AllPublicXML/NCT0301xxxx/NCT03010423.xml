  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center, interventional, pilot study to evaluate the improvement of
      microvascular function by positron emission tomography (PET) after twelve-week treatment of
      oral nicorandil in female non-obstructive CAD Participants.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early, due to the lack of approval of data exportation from the Office
