  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir is a potent integrase strand transfer inhibitor.
      Abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC) is a fixed dose combination regimen containing
      two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and dolutegravir. This is a phase 3b,
      non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, two treatment rollover study. The primary objective
      of this pediatric interventional study is to provide continued access to age appropriate
      formulations of investigational product (dolutegravir), either as Tivicay or as part of fixed
      dose combination ABC/DTG/3TC, for eligible participants who previously participated in parent
      studies P1093 (NCT01302847) or P2019 (NCT03760458) and who cannot locally access age
      appropriate formulations of dolutegravir or ABC/DTG/3TC in the public sector. The P1093 study
      was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and antiviral
      activity of dolutegravir in combination with optimized background regimens in human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experienced adolescents and children as well as
      treatment na√Øve infants and toddlers. The P2019 study was designed to evaluate PK, safety,
      tolerability and antiviral activity of ABC/DTG/3TC dispersible and immediate release tablets
      in HIV-1-infected children. Participants who have tolerated investigational product in the
      parent studies without any significant toxicity or signs of virologic failure leading to the
      permanent discontinuation of investigational product and withdrawal from the parent study
      will be considered for this open label continued access study. Participants will receive
      their age/weight appropriate dose of investigational product as defined in the parent study.
      The duration of participation in the study will extend until age appropriate formulations of
      Tivicay or ABC/DTG/3TC receive local (by country) regulatory approval and are available in
      those countries from another source (e.g. government programs, aid programs, assistance
      programs, etc.) or the participant is no longer deriving benefit from treatment or meets a
      protocol defined reason for discontinuation. Participants will be enrolled after all
      screening procedures have been completed. In most cases, the Screening visit will overlap
      with the participants penultimate visit on the parent study (at Week 180 of P1093, or Week 36
      of the P2019 study). Participants who meet all entry criteria may enroll and will be seen in
      the clinic every 12 weeks for a safety evaluation and to receive investigational product. It
      is estimated that no more than 300 participants will be enrolled in this study. Tivicay is a
      registered trademark of ViiV Healthcare.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have completed participation in one of the following parent studies,
             for the duration noted, with continued benefit from investigational product: a. P1093
             parent study through at least Week 180; b. P2019 parent study through at least Week
             48. Participant with evidence of Virological Failure in either parent study must have
             eligibility for this rollover study discussed and agreed with the ViiV Healthcare
             Medical Monitor.

          -  Virological control: a. Participants in parent study P1093 must have virological
             control defined as HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;400 copies per milliliter (c/mL) at
             their penultimate visit (on or after the Week 180 visit); b. Participants in parent
             study P2019 must have virological control defined as HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 c/mL at their
             penultimate visit (on or after Week 36).

          -  Males and Females: All participants who are engaging in sexual activity should be
             counseled on safer sexual practices including the use and benefit/risk of effective
             barrier methods (example [e.g.] male condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to an
             uninfected partner. Females: Female participants who are of child bearing potential
             and who are engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to
             use one of the acceptable birth control methods until the last dose of study
             medication and completion of the follow-up visit (4 weeks after the last dose).
             Condoms are recommended in addition, because their appropriate use is the only
             contraception method effective for preventing HIV-1 transmission.

          -  Parent or legal guardian or participant &gt;=18 years of age is able and willing to
             provide signed informed consent.

             hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase
             [ALT], lipase, serum creatinine and total bilirubin). Repeat testing is allowed for
             eligibility determination.

             entry. Participants with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Class B or greater) as
             determined by Child-Pugh classification should be excluded.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) bedside Schwartz formula; &lt;60 milliliter
             per minute per 1.73 square meter within 30 days prior to study entry.

             surface antigen positive).

          -  Female who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study.

          -  Participant is currently participating in or has participated in a study with a

             Leukocyte Antigen-B*5701-negative based on documented testing at any time prior to
             entry.

          -  Use of any disallowed medications at time of Screening.

          -  Anticipated need for Hepatitis C virus therapy with interferon or any drugs that have

             entire study period.

          -  Participant is unlikely to adhere to the study procedures, keep appointments, or is
             planning to relocate during the study.

          -  Clinical or symptomatic evidence of pancreatitis, as determined by the clinician.

          -  Any condition (including but not limited to alcohol and drug use) that would, in the
             opinion of the site investigator, place the participant at an unacceptable risk of
             injury or render the participant unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.
