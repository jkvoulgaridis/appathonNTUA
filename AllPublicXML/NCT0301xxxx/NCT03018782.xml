    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating refugee torture survivors who are receiving services at the
      Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights. There are two research questions in this study: if the
      current standard of care results in the under or missed diagnosis of pain and pain syndromes,
      and if a validated pain screening tool can supplement the current standard protocol used in
      the assessments of survivors of torture.

      The research plan consists of three components:

        1. The Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights will coordinate with the research team
           regarding eligible subjects.

        2. Researchers will contact potential subjects utilizing interpreter services.

        3. Interested participants will be scheduled for an appointment for an examination by a
           pain physician and to complete the Brief Pain Inventory.
