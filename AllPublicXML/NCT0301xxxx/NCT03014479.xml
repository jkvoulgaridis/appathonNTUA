      The purpose of this study is to assess the reduction in treatment burden during 12 weeks of
      trelagliptin administration in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise therapy
      only. Eligible participants will be randomized to either the study drug (trelagliptin) group
      or the comparative drug (daily DPP-4 inhibitor) group. Treatment burden will be assessed
      using Diabetes Therapy Related -QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaire and Diabetes Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ).

    <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

          <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL including 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13; number of questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7 and will be added up, and summed scores will be converted from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score for All Question Items in the Diabetes Therapy Related -QOL (DTR-QOL) Questionnaire at the End of Study</title>
        <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score for Each Factor Provided Through the DTR-QOL Questionnaire [Factor 3: Hypoglycemia] at Each Assessment Time Point</title>
        <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score for All Question Items in the DTR-QOL Questionnaire at Each Assessment Time Point</title>
          <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

          <description>The DTSQ is a self-reported instrument consists of 6 questions about treatment satisfaction and 2 questions regarding blood sugar level. Each question answered on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6, based on concern with the diabetes treatment and experiences in the past few weeks. Higher total score for questions about treatment satisfaction indicate greater satisfaction with treatment and experiences. Reported data was the score stratified by the use of medication for treatment of comorbidities at baseline (Used/ Not used).</description>

        <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score for Questions About Treatment Satisfaction in the DTSQ at the End of Study Stratified by the Total Number of Daily Tablets of Medication for Treatment of Comorbidities (&lt;2 Tablets or ≥2 Tablets) at Baseline</title>
        <description>The DTSQ is a self-reported instrument consists of 6 questions about treatment satisfaction and 2 questions regarding blood sugar level. Each question answered on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6, based on concern with the diabetes treatment and experiences in the past few weeks. Higher total score for questions about treatment satisfaction indicate greater satisfaction with treatment and experiences.</description>

        <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Score Per Question in the DTR-QOL Questionnaire at the End of Study</title>
          <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across 4 subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 (the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

        <description>The DTSQ is a self-reported instrument consists of 6 questions about treatment satisfaction and 2 questions regarding blood sugar level. Each question answered on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6, based on concern with the diabetes treatment and experiences in the past few weeks. Higher total score for questions about treatment satisfaction indicate greater satisfaction with treatment and experiences.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
