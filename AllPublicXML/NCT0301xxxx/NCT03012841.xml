  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of subjects free from treatment failure at 12 months after the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure is defined as any of the following components:
Acute procedural failure
Documented AF/AT/AFL after the 90 day blanking period
A reablation for the treatment of recurrent AF/AT/AFL after the 90 day blanking period
Class I or III antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) dose increase from the historic maximum ineffective dose (prior to the ablation procedure) or initiation of a new Class I or III AAD after the 90 day blanking period.
Ablation using RF in the left atrium
Blanking period is defined as the first 90 days after the index ablation procedure.
Acute procedural failure is defined as:
Inability to isolate all accessible targeted pulmonary veins (minimally assessed for entrance block and, where assessable, exit block) during the index procedure
Left atrial non-PVI ablations including but not limited to, ablation of linear lesions complex fractionated electrograms or non-PV triggers</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of subjects free from a primary safety event at 12 months after the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary safety event is defined as a serious procedure-related or serious system-related adverse event including the following:
Transient ischemic attack (within 7 days of ablation procedure)
Cerebrovascular accident (within 7 days of ablation procedure)
Major bleeding that requires transfusion (within 7 days of ablation procedure) Cardiac perforation, tamponade or pericardial effusion (within 7 days of ablation procedure)
Pulmonary vein stenosis (&gt; 75% reduction within 12-months of ablation procedure)
Myocardial infarction (within 7 days of ablation procedure)
Phrenic nerve injury (unresolved at 12-months)
Atrio-esophageal fistula (within 12-months of ablation procedure)
Death (within 7 days of ablation procedure)</description>
