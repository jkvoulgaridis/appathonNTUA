  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health threat. The body uses antibodies to
      fight infection. VRC07-523LS is an antibody directed against HIV. It may be used to prevent
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It may also prevent sexual transmission of HIV and treat
      HIV-1 infected people.

      Objective:

      To test the safety, tolerability, dose, and pharmacokinetics of VRC07-523LS in healthy
      adults.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18-50

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 7 groups:

      Groups 1-5 will get the drug at 1 visit and then be observed for 24 weeks.

      Groups 6 and 7 will get the drug at 1 visit every 12 weeks, for a total of 3 doses over 48
      weeks.

      Participants will get the drug in 1 of 2 ways:

      Infusion into a vein over at least 30 minutes. Participants will have blood tests 1, 3, and 6
      hours after the infusion. They will have 1-3 visits during that week. Those in Group 7 will
      have 4-5 visits in the week after their second and third doses.

      Injection into the fatty tissue under the skin. Participants will have blood tests before the
      injection. They will have 1-3 visits during that week. Those in Group 6 will have 4-5 visits
      after the second and third doses.

      Visits include:

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Optional oral swabs to collect saliva

      Participants will keep a diary of their temperature and symptoms for 3 days after each dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of the VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) monoclonal antibody (MAb) in
      healthy adults. It is a phase 1, dose-escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, dose,
      and pharmacokinetics of VRC07-523LS. The hypothesis is that VRC07-523LS will be safe for
      administration to healthy adults by the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes.

      Healthy adults 18-50 years of age will be enrolled. There are 4 open-label, dose escalations
      of VRC07-523LS from 1 mg/kg IV to 40 mg/kg IV, 1 route escalation from IV to SC, and 2
      open-label groups to assess repeat dosing. Groups 1-5 are expected to include 3 subjects and
      Groups 6-7 are expected to enroll 5 subjects. Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after
      the last study product administration.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 3 Days of Any Product Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after each product administration</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recorded 3-day systemic symptoms in a diary after each study product administration. Solicited systemic symptoms include: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, nausea, temperature and joint pain. Subjects recorded highest measured temperature daily. Clinicians reviewed the diary with the subject and collected resolution information for any symptoms that were not resolved within 3 days. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.0.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of Any Product Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after each product administration</time_frame>
    <description>Local symptoms assessed and recorded by the clinicians. Solicited local symptoms include pain/tenderness, swelling, redness, bruising, and pruritus (itchiness) at the product administration site. Clinicians assessed the study product administration site for local symptoms on the day of product administration after completion of the administration and on Days 1, 2 and 7 post administration. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. If symptoms were experienced, clinicians collected resolution information for any symptom that was not resolved within 7 days. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity recorded without an attribution assessment. If symptoms were reported, grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.0.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 3 Days of Any Product Administration</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded 3-day systemic symptoms in a diary after each study product administration. Solicited systemic symptoms include: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, nausea, temperature and joint pain. Subjects recorded highest measured temperature daily. Clinicians reviewed the diary with the subject and collected resolution information for any symptoms that were not resolved within 3 days. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.0.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 3 Days of Any Product Administration</title>
          <description>Subjects recorded 3-day systemic symptoms in a diary after each study product administration. Solicited systemic symptoms include: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, nausea, temperature and joint pain. Subjects recorded highest measured temperature daily. Clinicians reviewed the diary with the subject and collected resolution information for any symptoms that were not resolved within 3 days. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.0.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of Any Product Administration</title>
        <description>Local symptoms assessed and recorded by the clinicians. Solicited local symptoms include pain/tenderness, swelling, redness, bruising, and pruritus (itchiness) at the product administration site. Clinicians assessed the study product administration site for local symptoms on the day of product administration after completion of the administration and on Days 1, 2 and 7 post administration. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. If symptoms were experienced, clinicians collected resolution information for any symptom that was not resolved within 7 days. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity recorded without an attribution assessment. If symptoms were reported, grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.0.</description>
