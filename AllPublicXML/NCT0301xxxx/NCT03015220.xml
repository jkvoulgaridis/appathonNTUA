    <measure>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey Scores: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Therapy-Related Quality of Life (DTR-QoL): Total Score and Scores for the 4 Domains</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>DTR-QoL questionnaire is a 29-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the influence of diabetes treatment on health related-QoL on 4 domains on individual scale ranges: &quot;Burden on social activities and daily activities&quot;, &quot;Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment&quot;, &quot;Hypoglycemia&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction with treatment&quot; on a 7-point graded response scale. The domain score is calculated from the mean score of the attribute items, and the scoring range is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worst case response = 0). The total score, after simple addition of the item scores, is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worst case response = 0). Change from baseline (week 0) in the scores were evaluated at week 26, week 52. Data based on in-trial observation period is presented. W26 and W52 refer to week 26 and week 52 respectively.</description>

        <title>Participants Who Achieve HbA1c Below 7.0% (53 mmol/Mol) Without Severe or Blood Glucose Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemia Episodes and no Weight Gain (Yes/No)</title>
        <description>Participants who achieved HbA1c below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes and without weight gain (yes/no) at weeks 26 and 52 are presented. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode with plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

Rescue medication was defined as any new anti-diabetic medication used as add-on to trial product and used for more than 21 days with the initiation at or after randomisation (week 0) and before last day on trial product, and/or intensification of anti-diabetic medication (a more than 20% increase in dose relative to baseline) for more than 21 days with the intensification at or after randomisation and before last day on trial product. Results are based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>

          <title>Change in ECG Evaluation</title>
          <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in electrocardiogram (ECG) was evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. Change from baseline results are presented as shift in findings (normal, abnormal and not clinically significant (NCS) and abnormal and clinically significant (CS)) from week 0 to week 26 and 52. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>
          <population>Overall number of participants analyzed = SAS which comprised all randomised participants who received at least one dose of trial product. Number Analyzed = number of participants with available data.</population>

        <description>Participants with physical examination findings, normal, abnormal NCS and abnormal CS at baseline (weeks -2), week 26 and weeks 52 are presented. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product. Results are presented for the following examinations: 1) Cardiovascular system; 2) Central and peripheral nervous system; 3) Gastrointestinal system, incl. mouth; 4) General appearance; 5) Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck; 6) Lymph node palpation; 7) Musculoskeletal system; 8) Respiratory system; 9) Skin; 10) Thyroid gland.</description>

        <description>Treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded during weeks 0-57 (52-week treatment period plus the 5-week follow-up period). Hypoglycaemic episodes with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period was defined as the time period when a subject was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Confirmed by a glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

          <description>Treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded during weeks 0-57 (52-week treatment period plus the 5-week follow-up period). Hypoglycaemic episodes with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period was defined as the time period when a subject was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Confirmed by a glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey Scores: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Diabetes Therapy-Related Quality of Life (DTR-QoL): Total Score and Scores for the 4 Domains</title>
        <description>DTR-QoL questionnaire is a 29-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the influence of diabetes treatment on health related-QoL on 4 domains on individual scale ranges: &quot;Burden on social activities and daily activities&quot;, &quot;Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment&quot;, &quot;Hypoglycemia&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction with treatment&quot; on a 7-point graded response scale. The domain score is calculated from the mean score of the attribute items, and the scoring range is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worst case response = 0). The total score, after simple addition of the item scores, is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worst case response = 0). Change from baseline (week 0) in the scores were evaluated at week 26, week 52. Data based on in-trial observation period is presented. W26 and W52 refer to week 26 and week 52 respectively.</description>
