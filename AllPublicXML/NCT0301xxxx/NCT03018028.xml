    <measure>Change in SF-36: Sub-domains</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline in the sub-domain scores is presented. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Data based on on-treatment without rescue medication observation period is presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change in short form 36 v2.0 acute domain PCS from baseline (week 0) to week 56. SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. It consists of 2 component summary measures that further summarize 8 health domain scales. The PCS measure is derived from domain scales of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in DTR-QOL: Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaire is a 29-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the influence of diabetes treatment on HRQoL on 4 domains on individual scale ranges: &quot;Burden on social activities and daily activities&quot;, &quot;Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment&quot;, &quot;Hypoglycemia&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction with treatment&quot; on a 7-point graded response scale. Higher item scores indicate a higher level of HRQoL for items 1-25. For items 26-29 a higher score indicates a lower level of HRQoL. The domain score is calculated from the mean score of the attribute items, and the scoring range is converted to 0 - 100. The total score, after simple addition of the item scores, is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worstcase response = 0). Data based on on-treatment without rescue medication observation period is presented.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) to week 26 in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The endpoint was analysed based on data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. On-treatment without rescue medication observation period - time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication. The endpoint was also evaluated based on data from the in-trial observation period. In-trial observation period - time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

          <description>Presented results are the number of participants who had taken rescue medication anytime from week 0 to week 52. 'Rescue medication': use of new anti-diabetic medication as add-on to trial product and used for more than 21 days with the initiation at or after randomisation and before last day on trial product. Time to rescue medication was estimated based on data from on-treatment without rescue medication observation period.</description>

          <description>This outcome measure is only applicable for the oral semaglutide treatment arms (3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg). It is based on the data from participants who were measured with anti-semaglutide antibodies anytime during post-baseline visits (weeks 0-57). Results are presented as percentage of bound radioactivity-labelled semaglutide /total added radioactivity-labelled semaglutide (%B/T). Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.

        <title>Change in SF-36: Sub-domains</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline in the sub-domain scores is presented. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Data based on on-treatment without rescue medication observation period is presented.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36: Physical Component Summary (PCS)</title>
        <description>Change in short form 36 v2.0 acute domain PCS from baseline (week 0) to week 56. SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. It consists of 2 component summary measures that further summarize 8 health domain scales. The PCS measure is derived from domain scales of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Data based on on-treatment without rescue medication observation period is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DTR-QOL: Total Score</title>
        <description>Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaire is a 29-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the influence of diabetes treatment on HRQoL on 4 domains on individual scale ranges: &quot;Burden on social activities and daily activities&quot;, &quot;Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment&quot;, &quot;Hypoglycemia&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction with treatment&quot; on a 7-point graded response scale. Higher item scores indicate a higher level of HRQoL for items 1-25. For items 26-29 a higher score indicates a lower level of HRQoL. The domain score is calculated from the mean score of the attribute items, and the scoring range is converted to 0 - 100. The total score, after simple addition of the item scores, is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worstcase response = 0). Data based on on-treatment without rescue medication observation period is presented.</description>
