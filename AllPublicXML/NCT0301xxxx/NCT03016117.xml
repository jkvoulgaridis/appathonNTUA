      The study evaluate the anesthetic efficacy of Pecs II block II and parasternal block during
      quadrantectomy with or without axillary dissection, in breast cancer surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive Pecs II block and parasternal block, under ultrasound guidance. Pecs II
      block, performed at the 4th rib level, and parasternal block performed at the level of the
      2nd and 4th intercostal space level. Data on the anesthesia, side effects and pain, will be
      recorded

    <description>Pecs II block and parasternal block performed to provide anesthesia of breast, before of quadrantectomy with or without axillary dissection. Pecs II block performed at the 4th rib level and 20 ml of 0.5% Levobupivacaine injected, and parasternal block performed at the level of the 2nd and 4th intercostal space level, and 4 ml of 0.375% Levobupivacaine injected</description>

    <description>The Pecs II block will be performed under ultrasound guidance, at fourth rib level, on the axillary line, into the fascial plane between pectoralis minor muscle and serratus muscle. The parasternal block will be performed under ultrasound guidance, at the second and fourth intercostal space, between the pectoralis major muscle and the intercostal muscles, near to the external intercostal membrane.</description>
