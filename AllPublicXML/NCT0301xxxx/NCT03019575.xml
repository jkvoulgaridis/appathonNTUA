  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether corifollitropin alfa (MK-8962),
      administered in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), increases the testicular
      volume in adolescent males aged 14 to &lt;18. In addition, the study will evaluate participants
      for the development of corifollitropin alfa antibodies over the course of 64 weeks of
      treatment.

          -  Have legal representative who understands the study procedures, alternative treatments
             available and risks involved with the study, and voluntarily agrees to the
             individual's participation by giving written informed consent, and the individual has

             panhypopituitarism), either congenital or acquired with onset prior to puberty.

          -  Have bilateral pre-gonadarche testes as defined by testicular volume &lt;4.0 mL for each

             or local radiologist with appropriate training and expertise in reading testicular
             ultrasound. Note: participants with a volume of &lt;4.0 mL in one testicle and a volume
             of 4-8 mL in the other testicle are considered to be pre-gonadarche and may
             participate, if there is no history or evidence of a primary testicular disorder (see
             Exclusion Criteria 1 and 2).

          -  Brain radiotherapy within 12 months of start of treatment for a primary tumor, or any

          -  Has renal insufficiency, as determined by investigator, based on serum creatinine,
             blood urea nitrogen, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

          -  Clinically significant liver disease, including active viral hepatitis or cirrhosis.
             Individuals with a prior history of liver disease which is now inactive or
             successfully treated may be enrolled if all liver function values performed within the
             past year have been normal and within the normal range at Visit 1.
