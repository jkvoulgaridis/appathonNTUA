    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a single oral dose of moxidectin on the QT interval
      associated with moxidectin plasma concentrations.

      The effect of moxidectin on other ECG intervals, and on safety, will also be assessed, as
      will preliminary pharmacokinetics and metabolism

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moxidectin is being developed as a treatment for Onchocerciasis (river blindness), a serious,
      debilitating, disease caused by a parasitic worm, Onchocerca volvulus.

      Five dose levels of moxidectin will be administered to healthy volunteers and ECG assessments
      undertaken at pre-specified pharmacokinetic time points to correlate QT interval with
      moxidectin concentration in plasma.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in QTc Interval (Corrected by Friderica's Formula, dQTcF) Associated With Plasma Moxidectin Concentrations After a Single Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours post dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 10-second ECG recordings taken 1 minute apart using a Mortara continuous 12-lead digital ECG recorder connected to each subject during the Baseline to 72-hour post dose confinement period. Baseline only and baseline and placebo adjusted changes in QTc interval (corrected using the Friderica formula, QTcF) at each timepoint for each dose level were determined. The mean change from baseline (without and with placebo correction, dQTcF and ddQTcF respectively) at each of the 14 time points was calculated for each dose level. The primary outcome measure was the mean dQTcF for all subjects(the dQTcF gradient). The mean dQTcF for each active treatment group was determined at each post dose timepoint but the mean dQTcF by dose level was not calculated. The mean dQTcF at approximate moxidectin Tmax (hour 3 or hour 4) for each active treatment group and at hour 3 for the placebo group is reported.</description>

    <measure>Concentrations of Moxidectin in Plasma</measure>

    <description>Concentrations of moxidectin in plasma were assessed by collection of plasma samples at pre-specified intervals after oral dosing with moxidectin. The concentration of moxidectin was determined using a validated LC MS/MS method.The pharmacokinetic time points coincided with ECG collection timepoints (within 5 minutes and no later than 10 minutes after ECG recordings). Plasma PK parameters were estimated from the concentration measurements, including maximum concentration (Cmax) for each individual and mean for each dose cohort.</description>

    <description>Changes from Baseline were assessed at each timepoint up to 72 hours post dose. Mean changes across the 72 hour assessment period for each parameter were calculated for each moxidectin group and the placebo group and for the population overall.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in QTc Interval (Corrected by Friderica's Formula, dQTcF) Associated With Plasma Moxidectin Concentrations After a Single Dose</title>
        <description>Triplicate 10-second ECG recordings taken 1 minute apart using a Mortara continuous 12-lead digital ECG recorder connected to each subject during the Baseline to 72-hour post dose confinement period. Baseline only and baseline and placebo adjusted changes in QTc interval (corrected using the Friderica formula, QTcF) at each timepoint for each dose level were determined. The mean change from baseline (without and with placebo correction, dQTcF and ddQTcF respectively) at each of the 14 time points was calculated for each dose level. The primary outcome measure was the mean dQTcF for all subjects(the dQTcF gradient). The mean dQTcF for each active treatment group was determined at each post dose timepoint but the mean dQTcF by dose level was not calculated. The mean dQTcF at approximate moxidectin Tmax (hour 3 or hour 4) for each active treatment group and at hour 3 for the placebo group is reported.</description>

The concentration of moxidectin was determined using a validated LC MS/MS method.The pharmacokinetic time points coincided with ECG collection timepoints (within 5 minutes and no later than 10 minutes after ECG recordings). Plasma PK parameters were estimated from the concentration measurements, including maximum concentration (Cmax) for each individual and mean for each dose cohort.</description>
