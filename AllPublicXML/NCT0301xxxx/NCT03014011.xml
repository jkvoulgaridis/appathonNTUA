    <textblock>
      Hypoglycaemia in subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes may have substantial consequences
      including a significant negative impact on quality of life. Further, repeated minor
      hypoglycaemias may result in significant productivity losses.

      Here, the investigators propose to provide quantitative results on cognition during an acute
      mild hypoglycaemic episode (target plasma glucose 3 mmol/L) in 28 subjects with type 2
      diabetes. Data will be provided on executive function, attention and memory.

      Hypoglycaemia in subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes may have substantial consequences
      including a significant negative impact on quality of life. Further, repeated minor
      hypoglycaemias may result in significant productivity losses. In healthy subjects a number of
      studies show that during a hypoglycaemic episode with plasma levels of 2.2 - 2.5 mmol/L
      (40-45 mg/dl) brain areas responsible for cognition have an altered neuronal function when
      measuring cerebral blood flow. This is accompanied by severely impaired cognitive function
      with a reduced ability to solve simple cognitive tasks. At higher levels of glucose (above 3
      mmol/L (54 mg/dl)), it remains to be settled whether cognitive functions are also affected
      negatively and whether this may be accompanied by changes in brain metabolism. Apart from
      raising the blood glucose directly or indirectly via glucagon, no treatment for hypoglycaemia
      exists, but since Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies used in type 2 diabetes may
      affect brain glucose consumption, therapeutic interventions to prevent negative results of
      hypoglycaemia may eventually become clinically possible.

      Here, the investigators propose to provide quantitative results on cognition during an acute
      mild hypoglycaemic episode (target plasma glucose 3 mmol/L). Data will be provided on
      executive function, attention and memory.

    <time_frame>All neurocognitive testing was assessed at each intervention when glucose levels had been stabile for 40 minutes, an average of 2 hours after clamp procedure start. The duration of neurocognitive testing was approximately 40 min.</time_frame>
    <description>Symbol Digit Modalities Test was used as a measurement of psychomotor speed.
For the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, participants were required to use a coded key to match nine abstract symbols paired with numerical digits. The final score is the correct number of substitutions in 120 s, and scores range between 0 and 110. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

      <recruitment_details>37 participants were screened between May 2017 and July 2018 at the Department of Endocrinology, Bispebjerg University Hospital, Denmark.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 37 screened participants, 28 met inclusion criteria and were randomised. 25 completed both intervention visits. Three participants (one man, two women) withdrew from the study after randomisation for reasons not related to the intervention. Baseline characteristics are based on the 25 participants that completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Psychomotor Speed</title>
        <description>Symbol Digit Modalities Test was used as a measurement of psychomotor speed.
For the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, participants were required to use a coded key to match nine abstract symbols paired with numerical digits. The final score is the correct number of substitutions in 120 s, and scores range between 0 and 110. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>All neurocognitive testing was assessed at each intervention when glucose levels had been stabile for 40 minutes, an average of 2 hours after clamp procedure start. The duration of neurocognitive testing was approximately 40 min.</time_frame>
        <population>The two interventions were hypoglycaemia (aiming for a plasma glucose target of 3.0 ± 0.2 mmol/l) and euglycaemia (plasma glucose clamp target 6.0 ± 0.2 mmol/l).</population>
