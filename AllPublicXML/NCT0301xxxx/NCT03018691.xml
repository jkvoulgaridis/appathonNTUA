    <measure>The Number of Subjects Experiencing AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0-4</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects experiencing AEs will be calculated for each treatment group.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring after the start of IMP administration are summarized. The number of subjects with events, the number of events is obtained for all the TEAEs reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate of Investigator's Global Assessment(IGA) of Disease Severity at Week4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator assessed the skin symptoms using IGA. The investigator or subinvestigator scored the severity (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 =mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe/very severe) of the overall symptoms of the treatment area (erythema, infiltration, papules, effusion and scab formation) from baseline to Week4. Incidence of success in IGA was defined as the rate of subjects whose IGA score was 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and had improved by at least 2 grades (responders) from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub investigator assessed the symptoms of AD using EASI. EASI's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 72 scores respectively. The higher the EASI score is, the more severe the symptoms of AD, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0-3 points) and affected BSA (%) based on the 4 symptoms (erythema, infiltration/papules, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4 body regions (face, neck and head ; upper limbs ;; and lower limbs). Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) for Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator evaluated the level of pruritus based on VAS. The subjects aged 7 to 14 years old marked the point of pruritus intensity during the last 24 hours on a 0 to 100mm VAS, with 0 being no pruritis to 100 being very severe pruritis.For subjects aged 2 to 6 years, this would not be evaluated. The negative value showed the degree of improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Verbal Rating Scale(VRS) for Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Hour 156</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator evaluated the pruritus intensity based on VRS. The subjects aged 7 to 14 years old evaluated the pruritus intensity according to the following criteria. The subjects recorded the level of pruritus and the time and date of evaluation in a pruritus diary.
0 : None
: Mild
: Moderate
: Severe For subjects aged 2 to 6 years, this would not be evaluated. The negative value showed the degree of improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure(POEM) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub investigator evaluated eczema according to the POEM. The subjects answered 7 questions about their eczema by 0-4 points per question. The POEMS's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 28 scores respectively. The higher the POEM score is, the more severe the symptoms are, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. If it is difficult for subjects to answer the questions, their parents answered them instead. Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percentage Affected Body Surface Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, 16, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or subinvestigator drew the affected BSA (range of skin eruption at the time of examination) on the human body drawing to determine the affected areas (%) on the respective 4 body regions (face, neck, and head; upper limbs; trunk; and lower limbs). One palm of the subject corresponds to 1% BSA. The negative value showed the degree of improvement.</description>

The investigator or subinvestigator scored the severity (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 =mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe/very severe) of the overall symptoms of the treatment area (erythema, infiltration, papules, effusion and scab formation) from baseline to Week4. Incidence of success in IGA was defined as the rate of subjects whose IGA score was 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and had improved by at least 2 grades (responders) from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score</title>
        <description>The investigator or sub investigator assessed the symptoms of AD using EASI. EASI's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 72 scores respectively. The higher the EASI score is, the more severe the symptoms of AD, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0-3 points) and affected BSA (%) based on the 4 symptoms (erythema, infiltration/papules, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4 body regions (face, neck and head ; upper limbs ;; and lower limbs). Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>

The subjects recorded the level of pruritus and the time and date of evaluation in a pruritus diary.
0 : None
: Mild
: Moderate
: Severe For subjects aged 2 to 6 years, this would not be evaluated. The negative value showed the degree of improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure(POEM) Score</title>
        <description>The investigator or sub investigator evaluated eczema according to the POEM. The subjects answered 7 questions about their eczema by 0-4 points per question. The POEMS's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 28 scores respectively. The higher the POEM score is, the more severe the symptoms are, and a negative change from the baseline means improvement and a positive change means worsening. If it is difficult for subjects to answer the questions, their parents answered them instead. Number of participants analyzed represents number of participants with data at both Baseline and Week4. Participants who have no data were excluded.</description>
