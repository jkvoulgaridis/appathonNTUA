  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum
      administered dose (MAD) of MK-1454 alone and of MK-1454 in combination with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas in Part 1, and
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-1454 via intratumoral (IT) injection in combination
      with pembrolizumab in selected solid tumors in Part 2.

      MK-1454 will be administered IT; pembrolizumab (pembro) will be administered via intravenous
      (IV) infuison. In Part 1, participants will be allocated to one of three treatment arms:
      MK-1454 monotherapy (cutaneous/subcutaneous [cut/subcut] lesions), MK-1454+pembro (cut/subcut
      lesions), or MK-1454+pembro (visceral lesions).

      In Part 2, participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are
      anti-programmed cell death-protein 1 or anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1)
      refractory or with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment-naïve triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or
      with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment-naïve solid tumors with liver metastases/lesions will receive
      MK-1454 via IT injection at the RP2D determined in Part 1 PLUS pembrolizumab via IV infusion
      for up 35 cycles (up approximately 2 years).

    <textblock>
      Participants will receive either MK-1454 monotherapy or MK-1454 in combination with
      pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). Participants will undergo at least
      a 24-hour inpatient observation period following the first dose administration of MK-1454 on
      Cycle 1 Day 1 in Part 1. For Part 2, with Protocol Amendment 06 (dated 23 Aug 2019), the
      length of the observation period following administration of the first dose of MK-1454 on
      Cycle 1 Day 1 is at least 8 hours.
