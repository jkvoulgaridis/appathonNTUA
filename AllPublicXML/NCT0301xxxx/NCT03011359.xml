  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon resection is one of the major surgery, the postoperative pain is so severe that it is
      necessary to use additional analgesics as well as a patient controlled analgesia (PCA). The
      most common pain management of this surgery is the intravenous (IV) PCA. If it is relatively
      insufficient amount of narcotic analgesics ,in the case of IV PCA, may be failed to reduce
      the pain effectively. Consequently, it may result in the a lot of rescue analgesics use,
      which leads to the adverse effects in patients who are very sensitive to narcotic analgesics.
      And the patient's satisfaction to the PCA may be low.

      For the recently released PCA instrument 'PAINSTOP', the investigators can specify the mode
      setting including total volume, flow rate (basal rate) per hour, bolus dose, and lock out
      time (LOT). Furthermore, this device can be set to optimize basal infusion (B.I), which is a
      new mode, so that the administered rate and amount of drug can be increased or decreased
      according to the patient's use of bolus button. Therefore, this PCA device can be implemented
      to the conventional mode, and added the function of automatically controlling the basal rate
      and administered amount of drug according to the use demand of the patient. However, since
      there are few studies related to this new mode of PCA, more research is needed in patients
      with postoperative pain.

    <description>In the intervention group, the optimizing B.I PCA mode will be setted. This mode is setted that the amount of administered drug per hour will be increased by 0.3 ml by pressing bolus button (The interval: ~ 6 hr: 1.5 - 3.5 ml, 6-24 hr: 1 - 3 ml, 24 hr ~ : 0.5 - 2.5 ml). Conversely, if the bolus button is not used for 90 minutes, the administered amount of drug per hour is setted to be reduced by 0.1 ml, and the maximum (or minimum) allowable flow rate is 3.5 ml (or 0.5 ml).</description>
