      THINK (THerapeutic Immunotherapy with NKR-2) is a multinational (EU/US) open-label Phase I
      study to assess the safety and clinical activity of multiple administrations of autologous
      NKR-2 cells in seven refractory cancers, including five solid tumors (colorectal, ovarian,
      bladder, triple-negative breast and pancreatic cancers) and two hematological tumors (acute
      myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase I study aims at assessing the safety and clinical activity of the NKR-2
      treatment administered 3 times with a 2-week interval between each administration in
      different tumor types. In absence of progressive disease at the first tumor assessment
      following NKR-2 administratio, the patient will receive a new cycle of 3 administrations
      maximum with a 2-week interval. The study will contain two consecutive segments: a Phase I
      dose escalation and a Phase I expansion segment.

      The Phase I dose escalation segment will include 2 arms, one in solid tumors and one in
      hematological tumors. The dose escalation design will include 3 dose levels: The dose
      escalation phase will consist of 3 cohorts (Cohorts 1-3) for the solid tumors, and 3 cohorts
      (Cohorts 4-6) for the hematological tumors; with each set of 3 cohorts receiving escalating
      doses of the NKR-2 therapy.

      Two additional cohorts will be added in each dose escalation arm with the aim to provide a
      more intense treatment during the induction treatment. These additional cohorts in both the
      solid arm (cohort 8-9 - only in CRC) and in the hematological arm of the study (cohort 10-11
      - only in AML/MDS) will therefore evaluate a tighter schedule of NKR-2 injections with the
      three first injections within the induction cycle separated by a 1-week interval followed two
      weeks later by a second cycle (cycle 2) with a 2-weeks interval between each three NKR 2
      injections. These cohorts will each enroll 3 patients in case of no DLT. Based on safety and
      early clinical data from these cohorts, the specific schedule of cohorts 8-11 might be
      selected for the expansion.

    <description>The dose escalation arm for hematological tumors will use a 3 +3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Two additional cohorts will be added in this dose escalation arm with the aim to provide a more intense treatment during the induction treatment (cycle 1 of injection). Cohort 10-11 (only in AML/MDS) will evaluate a tighter schedule of NKR-2 injections at 1x109 or potentially 3x109 NKR-2 per injection with the three first injections within the induction cycle (cycle 1) separated by a 1-week interval followed two weeks later by a second cycle (cycle 2) with a 2-weeks interval between each three NKR 2 injections.</description>

    <description>In cohorts 1-6, the schedule of administration will be 3 NKR-2 doses administered with a 2-week interval. In absence of progressive disease at the first tumor assessment following NKR-2 administration (on Visit D29 for hematological tumors or on Visit D57 for solid tumors), and according to product availability, the patient will receive a new cycle of 3 administrations maximum with a 2-week interval, at a dose of 1x109 NKR-2 cells per injection, or at the same dose of cycle 1 if it was below 1x109 NKR-2 cells.
Patients in cohorts 8-9 (solid arm) and 10-11 (hematological arm) of first segment will receive 3 treatment doses at 1x109 NKR-2 (cohorts 8 and 10) or 3x109 NKR-2 (cohorts 9 and 11) per injection, with a 1-week interval between each dose. A second cycle of three NKR-2 injections at the same dose as in 1st cycle will be administered 2 weeks after the third NKR-2 injection, and with a 2-week interval between each dose.</description>
