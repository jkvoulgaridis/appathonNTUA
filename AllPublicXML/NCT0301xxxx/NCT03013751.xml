  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-month (52 week) safety extension study to supplement the FUEL Phase III
      clinical trial to provide safety information regarding the long-term use of udenafil in
      adolescents with single ventricle congenital heart disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label extension study. All enrolled subjects will be provided with
      udenafil for the duration of the study. Subjects completing the Phase III FUEL study will be
      eligible for recruitment. Additional subjects will be recruited as needed to ensure a minimum
      of 300 total subjects enroll. Safety, pharmacodynamic and quality of life data will be
      collected and analyzed.

          5. Undergoing evaluation for heart transplantation or listed for transplantation.

          6. Diagnosis of active protein losing enteropathy or plastic bronchitis within the last
             three years, or a history of liver cirrhosis.

          7. Known Fontan baffle obstruction, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, or pulmonary vein
             stenosis resulting in a mean gradient of &gt; 4 mm Hg between the regions proximal and
             distal to the obstruction as measured by either catheterization or echocardiography.

          8. Single lung physiology.

          9. Maximal VO2 less than 50% of predicted for age and gender at enrollment.

         10. Severe ventricular dysfunction assessed qualitatively by clinical echocardiography
             within six months prior to enrollment.

             completion of planned study testing or would invalidate its results.

         21. Cardiac care, ongoing or planned, at a non-study center that would impede study
             completion.
