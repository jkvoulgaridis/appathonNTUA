  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is recommended for some people with heart
      problems. But the usual TMVR techniques might cause an obstruction for some people. A new
      technique is called LAMPOON. It may have less risk of obstruction. Participants in this study
      will be among the first in the world to have this technique done.

      Objectives:

      To test the safety and effectiveness of the LAMPOON technique in TMVR.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 21 and over who are recommended to have TMVR with LAMPOON

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and exam and by review of medical records.

      Participants will have blood tests, a scan, and a heart test before the procedure.

      Participants will have TMVR with LAMPOON. They will have anesthesia. Doctors will use a wire
      to split the diseased mitral valve and move it out of the way. They will replace a heart
      valve.

      Participants will stay in the hospital for about 1 month.

      They will repeat the previous tests before leaving the hospital, 1 month later, and 1 year
      later.

      They will have yearly follow-up phone calls for about 5 years.

      In the event of a participant's death, researchers will ask for an autopsy and to analyze the
      heart. Permission for this is not required as part of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an option to treat mitral valve failure when
      no surgical options exist. In as many as half of patients, TMVR can cause life-threatening
      blockage of the left ventricle by displacing the existing mitral valve leaflet. For these
      patients the only options appear to avoid TMVR or in some to cause a focused heart attack and
      to wait 6 weeks. The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing
      mitral valve leaflet and enable TMVR in patients who have no other options. The procedure is
      called intentional laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet to prevent left ventricular
      outflow tract obstruction (LAMPOON). Although there are no dedicated TMVR devices
      commercially available, there has been short-term success with implanted transcatheter aortic
      valve devices in the mitral position for TMVR.

      The purpose of this study is to perform LAMPOON and TMVR in patients who have no good options
      to treat their mitral valve failure, using heart valve devices designed to implant in the
      aortic valve position.

All of the following must be present:- Successful LAMPOON traversal and laceration; and- Peak LVOT gradient &lt; 50 mm Hg; and- Absence of procedural mortality; and- Successful access, delivery, and retrieval of the LAMPOON device system; and- Successful deployment and correct positioning of the first intended device; and- Freedom from emergency surgery or reintervention related to the device or access procedure.The first two factors are modifications of the MVARC (mitral valve academic research consortium) consensus endpoint19, specific forLAMPOON procedure.</description>

    <description>Based on feedback from the FDA, the co-primary endpoint is Technical Success OPTIMAL (measured at exit from the catheterization laboratory).This differs from O only in the magnitude of the peak LVOT gradient.All of the following must be present:- Successful LAMPOON traversal and laceration; and- Peak LVOT gradient less than 3O mm Hg; and- Absence of procedural mortality; and- Successful access, delivery, and retrieval of the LAMPOON device system; and- Successful deployment and correct positioning of the first intended device; and- Freedom from emergency surgery or reintervention related to the device or access procedure.</description>

    <description>The Astato 0.014&quot; guidewire is used for transcatheter electrosurgery in two steps in this procedure. First it is used for leaflet traversal during electrification. This procedure is similar to the use of the Astato XS20 and an amputated Asahi Confienza Pro 12 in the transcaval IDE investigation recently published. Second, the midshaft is focally denuded and electrified for the leaflet traversal step.</description>
