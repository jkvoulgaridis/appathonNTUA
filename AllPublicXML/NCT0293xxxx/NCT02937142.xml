  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which starts
      in childhood and is characterized by symptoms of attention deficit, hyperactivity and
      impulsivity. Persistence into adolescence is frequently associated with among other low
      educational achievement, interpersonal difficulties, anxious and depressive symptoms and
      sleep problems. Treatment guidelines recommend psychological treatment as part of the
      treatment plan, however compared to children and adults, there is still a substantial lack of
      knowledge about appropriate psychological treatment in adolescents. The present study
      examines a psychological intervention for adolescents with ADHD, cognitive behavior group
      therapy. The intervention consists of 12 weekly cognitive behavioral therapy sessions
      addressing core difficulties and concerns of the adolescent population with ADHD. The
      investigators wish to determine the efficacy of group therapy in adolescents with ADHD who
      receive medical treatment but still have impairing ADHD symptoms.
