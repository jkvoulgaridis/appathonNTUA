  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Cohort 1 of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      antiviral activity (HBV DNA &lt; 20 IU/mL) of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 25 mg once daily
      versus placebo through Week 24 in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adolescents (aged
      12 to &lt; 18 years) with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

      Cohort 2 will consist of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) data will
      be collected from all participants in Part A to confirm the dose of TAF in each dose group
      and the remaining participants will be enrolled into Part B once dose confirmation is
      achieved. The primary objectives of Part A are to evaluate the steady-state PK of TAF and
      tenofovir (TFV) and confirm the dose of TAF given once daily in children (aged 2 to &lt; 12
      years) with CHB. The primary objective of Part B is to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of TAF at Week 48 and the antiviral activity (HBV DNA &lt; 20 IU/mL) of TAF at Week 24 in
      children (aged 2 to &lt; 12 years) with CHB.
