  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the Pharmacokinetic and to confirm the popPK
      model derived from healthy volunteers in hospitalized adults who are infected with
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to determine in adults who are hospitalized with
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection the dose response relationship of multiple
      regimens of lumicitabine on antiviral activity based on nasal RSV shedding using quantitative
      real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay.

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase, a treatment phase from Day 1 to
      Day 5/6 (depending on the timing of the loading dose), and a follow-up phase for a total of
      28 days post randomization. Participants will have assessments completed at Day 7, Day 10,
      Day 14, and Day 28. Depending on discharge date, assessments will be completed either while
      hospitalized or during outpatient visits. The duration of the participant's participation
      will be approximately 28 days. The study will be performed in 2 parts. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment groups in part 1, and to one of 3 treatment groups in
      part 2. Treatment groups will be evaluated for PK and safety after a target of approximately
      24 participants have been enrolled in part 1 and before initiating part 2 (approximately 90
      participants in part 2). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established
      to monitor the safety of participants and will review data in an unblinded manner on a
      regular basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study and
      to evaluate whether efficacy objectives are met. The committee will meet periodically to
      review interim data. Based on the recommendations of the IDMC following interim
      analyses/reviews, an increase in duration may be implemented.

    <measure>Least Square Mean Difference (Low and High Dose Lumicitabine Versus Placebo) of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Viral Load Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Day 1 to 7 (AUC[1-7])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) to 7</time_frame>
    <description>RSV RNA viral load in log10 copies/milliliter/day (log10 copies/mL/day) was measured in mid-turbinate nasal swabs and in endotracheal samples (obtained from intubated participants or via suction through tracheostomy or other sampling methods) using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Due to early termination of study, the analysis was not conducted as planned. Instead, using the same specification as for the primary analysis, a comparison was made on the AUC(1-7) days of pooled active treatment groups versus pooled placebo. The comparison was done as planned using a mixed model for repeated measures, using all available viral load data of baseline up to and including Day 7. The model computes the AUC at group level based on all available data, taking missing data into account under the missing at random assumption. The table reports the planned difference versus (pooled) placebo. No adjustment for multiplicity was applied.</description>

An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

    <description>It is the time from first dose of study drug until the time to return to pre-RSV functional status. Functional status is the total points on the KATZ index of independence in activities of daily living (KATZ ADL score). Katz activities of daily living assessed questions related to bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence and feeding components. Total score was calculated by adding the scores for all 6 activities which ranges from 0 high (participant independent) to 6 low (participant very dependent). If one or more component was missing, then the KATZ ADL score was not calculated. The return to pre-RSV functional status occurs at the timepoint where for the first time the KATZ ADL score is equal or higher than the pre-RSV KATZ ADL score and after which no scores lower than the pre-RSV KATZ ADL score occur anymore.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Sponsor halted screening and enrollment in study on 22 June 2018 due to emerging lumicitabine nonclinical data. On 17 October 2018, study was stopped prematurely by sponsor as a precautionary measure, to allow further evaluation of new nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety findings and determine their relevance to human studies.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 49 participants were randomized and treated (2 participants in Part 0, 36 participants in Part 1 and 11 participants in Part 2). Analyses were conducted on pooled groups across the 3 study parts.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>RSV RNA viral load in log10 copies/milliliter/day (log10 copies/mL/day) was measured in mid-turbinate nasal swabs and in endotracheal samples (obtained from intubated participants or via suction through tracheostomy or other sampling methods) using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Due to early termination of study, the analysis was not conducted as planned. Instead, using the same specification as for the primary analysis, a comparison was made on the AUC(1-7) days of pooled active treatment groups versus pooled placebo. The comparison was done as planned using a mixed model for repeated measures, using all available viral load data of baseline up to and including Day 7. The model computes the AUC at group level based on all available data, taking missing data into account under the missing at random assumption. The table reports the planned difference versus (pooled) placebo. No adjustment for multiplicity was applied.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

        <title>Time to Return to Pre-RSV Functional Status as Assessed by KATZ Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score</title>
        <description>It is the time from first dose of study drug until the time to return to pre-RSV functional status. Functional status is the total points on the KATZ index of independence in activities of daily living (KATZ ADL score). Katz activities of daily living assessed questions related to bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence and feeding components. Total score was calculated by adding the scores for all 6 activities which ranges from 0 high (participant independent) to 6 low (participant very dependent). If one or more component was missing, then the KATZ ADL score was not calculated. The return to pre-RSV functional status occurs at the timepoint where for the first time the KATZ ADL score is equal or higher than the pre-RSV KATZ ADL score and after which no scores lower than the pre-RSV KATZ ADL score occur anymore.</description>
