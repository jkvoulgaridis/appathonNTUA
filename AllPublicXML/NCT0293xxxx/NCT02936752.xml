  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) therapy failure. Entinostat may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      entinostat together with pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome after DNMTi therapy failure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      entinostat given in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers
      (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death protein-1
      [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epigenetic-immunotherapy and correlation
      with any observed clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.

      Patients receive lower dose entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 8 or higher dose entinostat
      PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of
      cycle 2 and cycles thereafter. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve an objective
      response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 cycles may continue to
      receive entinostat and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months.

The association between the clinical outcome and a meaningful reduction in MDSCs, which will be defined after a review of the data, will be assessed with the chi-square test.
