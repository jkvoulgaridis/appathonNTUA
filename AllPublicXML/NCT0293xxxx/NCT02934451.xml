  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare inherited disorder that causes bones to break easily.
      Individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta break bones often and may have other problems,
      including hearing loss and pain and difficulty getting around. People with moderate to severe
      OI may also be diagnosed with dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI). DI is characterized by grey or
      brown teeth that may chip and wear down and break easily. People with DI may also have skull
      and neck defects. These patients may have severe teeth misalignment resulting in clinically
      significant chewing problems. Teeth misalignment in OI is very hard to treat because of the
      quality and quantity of bone. The overall goal of this study is to improve dental health to
      improve the quality of life of people with OI.

      Investigators will look at dental health in people with OI and will describe teeth
      misalignment and head and neck defects in individuals with moderate to severe Osteogenesis
      Imperfecta (OI).

      Investigators will look at results from the Longitudinal study of OI to complete the study
      evaluations. Several x-rays will be performed for this study. Participants will have a 3D
      scan of the mouth and a Cone Beam CT scan of the jaw at a baseline visit and at 3 years after
      the baseline visit. These study visits can be at the same time as the Longitudinal Study of
      OI study visits.

    <ipd_description>The clinical information collected for this study will be stored in a computer database at the Data Management and Coordinating Center at the University of South Florida in Tampa, FL and also sent to a Federal data repository. A data repository provides a way for researchers to store the information collected during the research study for future research studies. The data management center uses several layers of protection for the clinical data stored in its computer database. It meets all of the local and federal security requirements for research datacenters. Information is stored only using a study identification number. Only the investigators and the study staff who collect and enter study data will have access to the key which links the identification number to the participant.</ipd_description>
