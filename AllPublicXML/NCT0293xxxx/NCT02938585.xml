    <description>Reported results are baseline (month 0) and change from baseline (at month 6) of end of disease and age specific HRQOL. HRQOL was collected through use of the patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments, HAEMO-QOL (for children (8-12 years)/adolescents (13-16 years)) and HAEM-A-QOL (for adults (&gt;=17 years)). HAEMO-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, family, friends, perceived support, other persons, sports and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, and relationships. HAEM-A-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, and partnership and sexuality. Scores range for each question was 0-100, with a lower score indicating better quality of life related to haemophilia. Observed mean of the means of all the questions for HAEMO-QOL and HAEM-A-QOL, respectively are presented.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 10 sites in mainland China.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study design: This was an open-label and non-randomised trial. Participants with severe haemophilia A were administered a prophylaxis (preventive) or on-demand regimen of turoctocog alfa (trial product) at the investigator’s discretion.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Small Children (0 to &lt;6 Years)</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive turoctocog alfa intravenous (i.v.) injections for at least 6 months (main phase) as either prophylaxis or on-demand treatment at investigator’s discretion. The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 30 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 25−50 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 25−60 IU/kg (3-times-weekly). Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by the investigator and based on the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) guidance. Participants who underwent surgery were treated with turoctocog alfa according to WFH guidance and their coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity levels were to be maintained as per the following guidance: Minor surgery: 30−60 IU/dL. Major surgery: 80−100 IU/dL pre- and postoperatively.</description>

The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 25 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 20−40 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 20−50 IU/kg (3-times-weekly). Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by the investigator and based on the WFH guidance.

Participants who completed 6 months of treatment (prophylaxis or on-demand) in the main phase, were to continue the same treatment for up to approximately 18 months (extension phase). Participants were allowed to switch between treatments in the ‘extension phase’. The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 25 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 20−40 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 20−50 IU/kg (3-times-weekly).

The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 25 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 20−40 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 20−50 IU/kg (3-times-weekly). Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by the investigator and based on the WFH guidance. Participants who underwent surgery were treated with turoctocog alfa according to WFH guidance and their FVIII activity levels were to be maintained as per the following guidance: Minor surgery: 30−60 IU/dL. Major surgery: 80−100 IU/dL pre- and postoperatively.</description>

The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 25 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 20−40 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 20−50 IU/kg (3-times-weekly). Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by the investigator and based on the WFH guidance. Participants who underwent surgery were treated with turoctocog alfa according to WFH guidance and their FVIII activity levels were to be maintained as per the following guidance: Minor surgery: 30−60 IU/dL. Major surgery: 80−100 IU/dL pre- and postoperatively.</description>

The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 30 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 25−50 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 25−60 IU/kg (3-times-weekly). Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by investigator and based on the WFH guidance. Participants who underwent surgery were treated with turoctocog alfa according to WFH guidance, and their FVIII activity levels were to be maintained as per the following guidance: Minor surgery: 30−60 IU/dL. Major surgery: 80−100 IU/dL pre- and postoperatively.</description>

HRQOL was collected through use of the patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments, HAEMO-QOL (for children (8-12 years)/adolescents (13-16 years)) and HAEM-A-QOL (for adults (&gt;=17 years)). HAEMO-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, family, friends, perceived support, other persons, sports and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, and relationships. HAEM-A-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, and partnership and sexuality. Scores range for each question was 0-100, with a lower score indicating better quality of life related to haemophilia. Observed mean of the means of all the questions for HAEMO-QOL and HAEM-A-QOL, respectively are presented.</description>

Participants who completed 6 months of treatment (prophylaxis or on-demand) in the main phase, were to continue the same treatment for up to approximately 18 months (extension phase). Participants were allowed to switch between treatments in the ‘extension phase’. The recommended prophylaxis starting dose was 25 IU/kg. Prophylaxis doses ranged from 20−40 IU/kg (once every-second-day), or 20−50 IU/kg (3-times-weekly). Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by the investigator and based on the WFH guidance. Participants who underwent surgery were treated with turoctocog alfa according to WFH guidance and their FVIII activity levels were to be maintained as per the following guidance: Minor surgery: 30−60 IU/dL. Major surgery: 80−100 IU/dL pre- and postoperatively.</description>

          <description>Reported results are baseline (month 0) and change from baseline (at month 24) of end of disease and age specific HRQOL. HRQOL was collected through use of the patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments, HAEM-A-QOL (for adults (&gt;=17 years)) and HAEMO-QOL (for children (8-12 years)/adolescents (13-16 years)). HAEM-A-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, and partnership and sexuality. HAEMO-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, family, friends, perceived support, other persons, sports and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, and relationships. Scores range for each question was 0-100, with a lower score indicating better quality of life related to haemophilia. Observed mean of the means of all the questions for HAEM-A-QOL and HAEMO-QOL, respectively are presented.</description>

        <title>Incremental Recovery of FVIII</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the evaluation of incremental recovery of FVIII were taken during a period of 48 hours post-dosing for participants 12 years and older and 24 hours post-dosing for participants below the age of 12 years. The incremental recovery was calculated as (FVIII: coagulant (C) activity measured in plasma 30 minutes after dosing - FVIII:C activity measured in plasma immediately before dosing)/(dose injected at time 0 minute), where the dose was expressed as IU FVIII product per kg body weight. The results are based on the chromogenic assay.</description>
