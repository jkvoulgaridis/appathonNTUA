    <textblock>
      A cluster-randomized crossover trial involving adult ICU patients, family members, and ICU
      professionals will be conducted. Forty medical-surgical Brazilian ICUs with visiting hours
      &lt;4.5 h/day will be randomly assigned to either a restrictive family visitation model (RFVM)
      (visits according to local policies) or a flexible family visitation model (FFVM) (visitation
      during 12 consecutive hours per day) at a 1:1 ratio. After enrollment and follow-up of 25
      patients, each ICU will be switched over to the other visitation model, until 25 more
      patients per site are enrolled and followed. The primary outcome will be the cumulative
      incidence of delirium among ICU patients, measured twice a day using the Confusion Assessment
      Method for the ICU. Secondary outcome measures will include daily hazard of delirium,
      ventilator-free days at day 7, any ICU-acquired infections, ICU length of stay, and all-cause
      hospital mortality among the patients; symptoms of anxiety and depression and satisfaction
      among the family members; and prevalence of symptoms of burnout among the ICU professionals.
      Tertiary outcomes will include need for antipsychotic agents and/or mechanical restraints,
      coma-free days at day 7, unplanned loss of invasive devices, and ICU-acquired pneumonia,
      urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection among the patients; self-perception of
      involvement in patient care among the family members; and satisfaction among the ICU
      professionals.

    <intervention_model_description>The following interventions will be evaluated in the present study: restrictive family visitation model (intermittent visits according to local ICU regulation) and flexible family visitation model (12 consecutive hours per day). The unit of of concealed randomization is the ICU to minimize the risk of contamination, given that we intend to apply the intervention to the whole ICU multidisciplinary team. We will randomize ICUs to either an RFVM or to an FFVM as the initial intervention (T1). After enrollment of 25 ICU patients, there will be a 30-day period without recruitment to avoid contamination bias. After this period, each ICU will be assigned to an intervention contrary to that which initially receive (T2) until the enrollment of more 25 ICU patients.</intervention_model_description>
