  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With only limited prospective longitudinal data currently available on Creatine Transporter
      Deficiency (CTD), its natural history is at present incompletely understood. This
      international study is designed to provide additional insights into disease progression, to
      characterize how patients perform on clinical neurodevelopmental assessments, and to evaluate
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in patients with
      CTD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study designed to determine an appropriate clinical assessment
      battery for males with CTD, and to evaluate MRS along with other potential biomarkers. It is
      designed to explore developmental domains of interest and to examine the feasibility and
      utility of various neuropsychological assessments to measure domains of interest, and to
      identify possible endpoints for interventional studies. Study will also explore
      genotype-phenotype correlations.

      This study will consist of a Screening Period, a Baseline period, and Ongoing Assessment
      Periods. During the Screening Period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility
      including verification of existing laboratory evidence of a pathologic mutation at Solute
      Carrier Family 6 (Neurotransmitter Transporter), Member 8 (SLC6A8) gene. A comprehensive
      history and physical and neurological examination, including evaluation of growth and
      dysmorphic features, will be completed for all subjects. During the Baseline Period, the
      caregiver will be interviewed and study staff will administer scales/questionnaires at the
      study site. For purpose of this protocol, a duly authorized patient representative (e.g.
      parent, legal guardian) will be referred to as a caregiver. Biological, physiological and
      radiographic assessments, including ERP recordings, MRS, skin biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid,
      urine and blood will be obtained. During the Ongoing Assessment Period, growth assessments
      and limited physical and neurological examinations will be performed. All
      scales/questionnaires will be repeated every 6 months (Â± 2 weeks) for 48 months either at the
      study site or with instructions for completion at home.

      Clinical adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.

      This study was previously posted by Lumos Pharma, which has been transferred to Ultragenyx in
      June 2019.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male and between 6 months and 65 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Subject has genomic confirmation of a pathologic mutation in the SLC6A8 gene.

          3. Subject is able to complete study-related procedures.

          4. Subjects' parents/guardians/caregivers must provide written consent (informed consent)
             to study-related procedures, and if appropriate, the subject will provide an assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has had status epilepticus within 3 months of screening.

          2. Subject is unable to comply with the study procedures or with a clinical disease or
             laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would potentially
             increase the risk of participation.
