      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Bausch + Lomb
      samfilcon A soft (hydrophilic) contact lens, a new silicone hydrogel contact lens, compared
      to the Bausch + Lomb PureVisionÂ® soft contact lens when worn for 7-day extended wear by
      adapted soft contact lens wearers.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 816 participants (1,632 eyes) will be enrolled in this 12-month randomized,
      parallel, Investigator/Sponsor masked study at approximately 35 investigative sites in the
      US.

      At the Screening/Dispensing Visit, approximately one-half of the participants will be
      randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb investigational samfilcon A soft contact lenses (Test)
      and approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb
      PureVision soft contact lenses (Control). Both groups will wear the assigned lenses
      bilaterally on a 7-day extended wear basis throughout the 12 month study. The lenses are to
      be worn overnight for up to six consecutive nights per week. The lenses are to be removed,
      cleaned and disinfected on the seventh night and re-inserted the following morning. The
      lenses will be replaced with new lenses at the beginning of each month. Lenses will be
      provided at the Screening/Dispensing, 3-Month, 6-Month and 9-Month Follow-Up visits to
      maintain a monthly replacement schedule. Participants will also be required to complete a
      paper diary.

    <measure>High Contrast Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>For determination of high contrast visual acuity (VA), the participant was seated at the photoropter so that the distance from the participant's eyes to the logMAR chart was 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). The chart was at eye level for each participant. The logMAR charts had two alternative letter sequences from 28 letters (0.3 logMAR) to 62 letters (-0.3 logMAR). The visual acuity was measured through the phoropter using the distance refractive correction with the addition of +0.50 Diopter to compensate for the reduced test distance of 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). A scoring sheet for each eye was provided to keep track of the letters correctly identified by the participants. Scores were recorded as the numbers of letters correctly identified in the eye examination. VA was converted to the Log10 of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) by using the score (number of letters).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse events were defined as those events that resulted in, or had the potential to cause, either permanent impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure, and might necessitate medical or surgical intervention. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in reported AE section.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be correctable through spherocylindrical refraction to 42 letters
             (0.1 logMAR) or better (distance, high contrast) in each eye.

          -  Participants must be adapted lens wearers and wear a lens in each eye; each lens must
             be of the same manufacturer and brand.

          -  Participants must be myopic and require lens correction from -0.50 diopters (D) to
             6.00 D in each eye.

          -  Participants must have clear central corneas and be free of any anterior segment
             disorders.

          -  Participants must agree to wear their lenses on an extended wear basis (6 nights/7
             days) for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have worn gas permeable (GP) contact lenses within the last 30 days
             or who have worn polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses within the last three months.

          -  Participants with an active ocular disease or who are using any ocular medication.

          -  Participants with any systemic disease currently affecting ocular health or which in
             the Investigator's opinion may have an effect on ocular health during the course of
             the study.

          -  Participants using any systemic medications that will, in the Investigator's opinion,
             affect ocular physiology or lens performance.

          -  Participants who are not correctable to 42 letters (0.1 logMAR) in each eye with soft
             spherical contact lenses.

          -  Participants who currently wear monovision, multifocal, or toric contact lenses.

        <title>High Contrast Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>For determination of high contrast visual acuity (VA), the participant was seated at the photoropter so that the distance from the participant's eyes to the logMAR chart was 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). The chart was at eye level for each participant. The logMAR charts had two alternative letter sequences from 28 letters (0.3 logMAR) to 62 letters (-0.3 logMAR). The visual acuity was measured through the phoropter using the distance refractive correction with the addition of +0.50 Diopter to compensate for the reduced test distance of 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). A scoring sheet for each eye was provided to keep track of the letters correctly identified by the participants. Scores were recorded as the numbers of letters correctly identified in the eye examination. VA was converted to the Log10 of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) by using the score (number of letters).</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse events were defined as those events that resulted in, or had the potential to cause, either permanent impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure, and might necessitate medical or surgical intervention.
