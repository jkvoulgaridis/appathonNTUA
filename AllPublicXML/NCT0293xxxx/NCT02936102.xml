  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this &quot;first-in-human&quot; study of FAZ053 is to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of FAZ053
      administered Intravenously (i.v.)as a single agent or in combination with PDR001 in adult
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      By blocking the interaction between Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) and its receptors,
      Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and B7.1, FAZ053 inhibits the PD-L1 immune checkpoint, resulting in
      activation of an antitumor immune response by activating effector T-cells and inhibiting
      regulatory T-cells.

      This study has been designed as a Phase I, open-label, multi-center study with a dose
      escalation part of FAZ053 as single agent and in combination with PDR001, followed by a dose
      expansion part of FAZ053 as single agent.

      FAZ053 will initially be dosed every three weeks. A less frequent dosing regimen such as
      every 6 weeks may be evaluated in parallel.

      A patient may continue treatment with FAZ053 single agent or in combination with PDR001 until
      the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression per immune
      related Response Criteria and/or treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the
      investigator or the patient.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent prior to any procedure.

          -  Dose escalation cohorts of FAZ053 single agent and FAZ053 in combination with PDR001:
             Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors with measurable or non-measurable
             disease as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version
             1.1 who may or may not have received prior treatment with an immune checkpoint
             inhibitor, who have progressed despite standard therapy, or for whom no standard
             therapy is available.

          -  Dose expansion groups of FAZ053 single agent: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid
             tumors with at least one measurable lesion as determined by RECIST version 1.1 who may
             or may not have received prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (for
             FAZ053 single agent no treatment with an anti-PD-L1 inhibitor is permitted), who have
             progressed despite standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available and
             fit into one of the following groups:

          -  FAZ053 single agent: TNBC/ Chordoma/ ASPS

          -  Performance Status (PS) ≤ 2:

          -  Patient must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy and be a candidate for tumor
             biopsy according to the treating institution's guidelines. Patient must be willing to
             undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening/ baseline and during therapy on this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or CNS metastases that
             require local CNS-directed therapy (e.g. radiotherapy or surgery) or increasing doses
             of corticosteroids within the prior 2 weeks. Patients with treated brain metastases
             should be neurologically stable (for 4 weeks post-treatment and prior to study
             enrollment) and off of steroids for at least 2 weeks before administration of any
             study treatment.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity to study treatment excipients and additives or
             other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and/or their excipients.

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with vitiligo, residual
             hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger
             should not be excluded. Patients previously exposed to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment who
             are adequately treated for skin rash or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies
             should not be excluded.

          -  Treatment with cytotoxic or targeted antineoplastics within 3 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment. For cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicity a washout
             period of one cycle is indicated (examples are nitrosoureas and mitomycin C which
             typically require a 6 week washout). Prior antibodies or immunotherapies require a 6
             week washout.

          -  Patients receiving systemic chronic steroid therapy or any immunosuppressive therapy
             (≥ 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent). Topical, inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic steroids
             are allowed.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
