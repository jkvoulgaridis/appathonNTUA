    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to look at the effects that height-adjustable workstations on
      occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in office workers. Participants
      workplace activity (sitting, standing and walking) and productivity was measured before the
      installation of the height-adjustable workstations. Workplace activity and productivity were
      then measured four weeks after the installation of height-adjustable workstations. The
      results were compared to a control group who received no intervention whilst the intervention
      had the height-adjustable workstations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behaviour has been found to be ubiquitous within the workplace and due to the
      negative consequences of sedentary behaviour upon health, research has began to look at ways
      to reduce and interrupt sedentary behaviour.

      Interventions that have introduced height-adjustable workstations into the workplace have
      been found to reduce sedentary behaviour. Some employees and employers are concerned that
      using height-adjustable workstations and trying to reduce workplace sedentary behaviour can
      lead to a loss of workplace productivity.

      The present study looked at the effects of installing height-adjustable workstations on
      occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in desk-based workers. Workplace
      activity was measured objectively using ActivPal accelerometers and productivity was measured
      via self-report measures. Measurements took place at baseline and four weeks after receiving
      the height-adjustable workstation.

    <description>Self-reported absolute absenteeism (the amount of time a participant was absent from work for during the previous 7-days) measured using the World Health Organisation Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. This is calculated in relation to a participants contracted hours, therefore a negative score shows that a participant worked less than they are contracted to, where as a positive score means a participant reported working more hours than they are contracted to.</description>

    <measure>Change in Workplace Presenteeism Using the World Health Organisation Health and Work Performance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks), 4 weeks after installation of height-adjustable workstations</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported absolute presenteeism (an employees productivity during working hours) measured using the World Health Organisation Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. The higher the percentage, the more productive a participant felt they were. 100% means that they felt they were productive the whole time they were working. Presenteeism can be impacted upon by illness and other health conditions, if a person was feeling ill or had a back problem, this may mean that they are less productive whilst at work.</description>

          <description>Self-reported absolute absenteeism (the amount of time a participant was absent from work for during the previous 7-days) measured using the World Health Organisation Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. This is calculated in relation to a participants contracted hours, therefore a negative score shows that a participant worked less than they are contracted to, where as a positive score means a participant reported working more hours than they are contracted to.</description>

        <title>Change in Workplace Presenteeism Using the World Health Organisation Health and Work Performance Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Self-reported absolute presenteeism (an employees productivity during working hours) measured using the World Health Organisation Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. The higher the percentage, the more productive a participant felt they were. 100% means that they felt they were productive the whole time they were working. Presenteeism can be impacted upon by illness and other health conditions, if a person was feeling ill or had a back problem, this may mean that they are less productive whilst at work.</description>
