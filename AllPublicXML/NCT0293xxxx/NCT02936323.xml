  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-221-001 is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2a study evaluating PEN-221 in
      patients with SSTR2 expressing advanced gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or lung or thymus or
      other neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
      of the lung.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-221-001 will first enroll patients into a dose escalation phase, where a
      Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle
      and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion
      phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal mid-gut neuroendocrine
      tumors or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer.
