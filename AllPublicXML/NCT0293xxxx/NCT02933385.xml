  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are very few studies that integrate classical interventions (screening
      clinics) and online tools in order to obtain sustainable lifestyle changes in workers
      efficiently. The current project aims to evaluate the efficiency of a combined approach
      versus the more traditional approach. Health Data collected by CAPSANA in the workplace
      between 2012 and 2014 showed that, out of 4231 workers, 69% should aim to do more active
      lifestyle and 74% to a better nutrition profile. In addition, 53% of the sampled population
      were overweight. In this context, the current project aims to motivate aims to motivate and
      follow individuals towards a healthier lifestyle. To do so, the Activate Your Health will be
      implemented and tested using various options (limited to more complete) in several companies.

      Currently, lifestyle habits of workers does not only represents a personal concern, but also
      a concern of the company. Currently there are very few studies that efficiently integrate
      classical interventions (screening) and online tools in order to obtain sustainable lifestyle
      changes in workers. The current project aims to evaluate efficacy of a combined approach
      versus more traditional approaches. Health Data collected by CAPSANA in the workplace between
      2012 and 2014 showed that, out of 4231 workers, 69% should aim at a more active lifestyle and
      74% at a better nutritional profile. In addition, 53% of the sampled population were
      overweight.

      In this context, the current project aims to motivate and follow individuals towards a
      healthier lifestyle. To do so, the Activate Your Health will be implemented and tested using
      various options (limited to more complete) in several companies. It is planned to compare to
      a control group receiving no intervention to the other groups containing little to complete
      set of interventions. The content of the interventions involves health assessment, electronic
      tools (SOScuisine and social media platform), health screening, activity monitor tool and
      closing events. The companies had to pick which option they would like to provide their
      employees. It is anticipated that the complete option will yield better results for the
      activity profile and other lifestyle habits. For example, changes in eating habits toward
      better habits are expected.
