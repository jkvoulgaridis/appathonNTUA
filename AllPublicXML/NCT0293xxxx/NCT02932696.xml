  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of our project is to study and describe the effect of exercise training on
      systolic and diastolic myocardial function assessed by 2D ultrasound strain after myocardial
      infarction.

      Our working hypothesis is that the intrinsic myocardial contractility and relaxation assessed
      by global longitudinal strain in phase II (or 2D strain) during post-infarction exercise
      training will be improved compared to baseline values as well as compared to values in a
      no-training group. Should this hypothesis prove true, it would help explain the improvements
      in functional capacity observed during the post-infarction period and after exercise
      training.

    <description>This program takes place at the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Department at the Nîmes University Hospital and includes a combination of various physical activities: treadmill, exercise bike, rower, aerobics, gymnastics, serious games, swimming. The program begins approximately within 3 months after myocardial infarction and consists of 20 consecutive days of training. The main physical activity is aerobic interval training (AIT).
30-minute AIT sessions will occur 5x per week for 4 weeks.
1 AIT session includes a warm up for 8 minutes to reach a heart rate during exercise corresponding to 20 to 30% of maximum aerobic power determined during the initial effort test. Then interval training occurs with 4x2 min of high intensity effort (heart rate during exercise corresponding to 80% of maximum aerobic power) alternating with 2 min of active recovery at 20-30% of maximum aerobic power. Then recovery for 8 minutes.</description>
