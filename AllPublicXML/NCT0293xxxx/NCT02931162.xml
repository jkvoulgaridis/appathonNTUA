      To investigate the mechanism and effects of moxibustion on patients with ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with UC were randomly divided into the following 2 groups: a)
      Herb-partition moxibustion (Treatment Group) and b) Sham herb-partition moxibustion (Control
      Group). All patients in the trial will be treated with moxibustion 3 times a week, once a day
      for 30 minutes, for a total of 12 weeks. MRI will be used to observe the changes on brain
      structure and function in patients with UC, and further research on the characteristics of
      the brain nerve response of these patients with herb-partition moxibustion. In addition,
      tissue morphology and molecular biology tests will be conducted to observe the regulation and
      expression of VDR and antimicrobial peptides in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients. All
      these steps will be done in order to provide experimental basis for the mechanism of the
      effects of herb-partition moxibustion in the treatment of UC.

    <description>Assay for the ulcerative colitis desease activity index. It is constructed by four scales, Including stool frequency、rectal bleeding、mucosal appearance at endoscopy and physician rating of disease activity. Every scale can be scored with o ,1 ,2 or 3 according to the activity index of scale. Scores should be compared to previous scores taken for a patient. The higher the score (minimum 0 point and maximum 12 points), the more severe the ulcerative colitis.</description>
