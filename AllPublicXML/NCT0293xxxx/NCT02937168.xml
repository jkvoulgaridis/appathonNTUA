  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study with the following primary objectives: 1) to establish that
      PET/CT of the lung can reliably distinguish healthy, non-asthmatic participants from
      participants with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype and 2) to examine the utility
      of PET/CT for demonstrating that reslizumab produces a reduction in lung inflammation in
      participants with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype .

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early due to challenges in recruitment. The decision to terminate the
    study was not related to any safety issues or concerns.

    <measure>Part 1: Average Global Lung Glycolysis (GLG) at Baseline (Day 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) of Part 1</time_frame>
    <description>GLG is the total FDG uptake in the whole lung. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around lung boundary in each axial slice. Standardized uptake value (SUV) mean and area of each ROI was recorded. Using the formula: area*slice thickness the volume of each slice was calculated. Then the SUVmean of each slice was multiplied by the volume of the corresponding slice, which represented the total FDG uptake in one slice. This number for each slice was summed together to provide GLG of that lung. Average between GLG of right lung and GLG of left lung was reported.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. SAEs included death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of serious and non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in 'Reported Adverse Events module'.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Average Global Lung Glycolysis (GLG) at Baseline (Day 1)</title>
        <description>GLG is the total FDG uptake in the whole lung. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around lung boundary in each axial slice. Standardized uptake value (SUV) mean and area of each ROI was recorded. Using the formula: area*slice thickness the volume of each slice was calculated. Then the SUVmean of each slice was multiplied by the volume of the corresponding slice, which represented the total FDG uptake in one slice. This number for each slice was summed together to provide GLG of that lung. Average between GLG of right lung and GLG of left lung was reported.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. SAEs included death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of serious and non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in 'Reported Adverse Events module'.</description>
