      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBI308
      monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with certain types of advanced
      solid tumors. Another purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      immunogenicity of IBI308

    <textblock>
      This is a study which consists of phase 1a study (dose escalation stage) and phase 1b study
      (expansion stage). Phase 1a study will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design,
      exploring safety and tolerance of 4 dose cohorts (1mg/kg, 3mg/kg, 200mg and 10mg/kg) and
      determining the recommended dose for phase 1b study. Phase 1b is expansion study of 8 cohorts
      which will evaluate anti-tumor efficacy and safety of eight IBI308 monotherapy or in
      combination with chemotherapy. Cohort A is IBI308 monotherapy for advanced melanoma. Cohort B
      is IBI308 monotherapy for malignancies of digestive system after failure or intolerance of
      first line standard therapy. Cohort C is IBI308 monotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) after failure or intolerance of first line standard therapy. Cohort D is
      IBI308 in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed for treatment-na誰ve locally advanced,
      recurrent or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Cohort E is IBI308 in combination with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin for treatment-na誰ve locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
      squamous NSCLC. Cohort F is IBI308 in combination with Cohort G is IBI308 in combination with
      etoposide and cisplatin for treatment na誰ve locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic high
      grade(G3) neuroendocrine tumor. Cohort H is IBI308 in combination with irinotecan and 5-FU
      for advanced high grade(G3) neuroendocrine tumor after failure of first line standard therapy
      oxaliplatin and capecitabine for treatment na誰ve locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
      gastric or esophagogastric junction carcinoma.

      Phase 1a and 1b consist of screening period (28 days before enrollment), treatment period and
      follow up period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). In phase 1a, dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) will be recorded for up to 28 days after the 1st dose of IBI308. Efficacy will
      be evaluated by RECIST v1.1. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Further
      exploration of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity information will be
      assessed throughout the trial.
