  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe and examine the dietary intake, eating behavior
      and physical activity level of a cohort of Hong Kong Chinese with T2DM and their association
      with weight and glycemic control at baseline and 1 year follow-up. The investigators
      hypothesize that Hong Kong Chinese T2DM patients with unhealthy dietary intake and pattern
      and low physical activity level are associated with poorer glycemic and weight control, and
      there will be no improvement with weight and glycemic control under usual care after 1 year.
