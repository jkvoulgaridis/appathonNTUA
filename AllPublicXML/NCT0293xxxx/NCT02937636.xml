  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-centre, examiner-blind, randomized, stratified, two-treatment, parallel group
      clinical study will evaluate the efficacy of a 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride dentifrice
      compared to a reference dentifrice to control gingivitis (gingival bleeding and visual signs
      of gingival inflammation) in dentally and periodontally healthy adult volunteers over 12
      weeks use in a Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will be carried out in healthy adult volunteers with moderate gingivitis.
      Treatment effect will be determined by evaluating the efficacy, in a Chinese population, of a
      dentifrice containing 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride to control gingivitis and supra-gingival
      plaque following 6 and 12 weeks twice daily brushing, compared to a fluoride control
      dentifrice. During the 12 week treatment period, participant will brush with their allocated
      study product twice daily.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Bleeding Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BI was performed by a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was inserted approximately 1 mm into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system to be used is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. This measure will be analyzed and summarized over all sites.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of bleeding sites were measured as BI via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was gently inserted approximately 1 millimeter (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. A bleeding site was considered as a BI score of 1 or 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Modified Gingival Index (MGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MGI was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces at two sites on each tooth (papillae and margin).The scoring of MGI was performed by a single examiner. The MGI scoring system is as follows:0=absence of inflammation;1=mild inflammation; slight change in color, little change in color; little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit;2=mild inflammation; criteria as above but involving the entire marginal or papillar gingival units;3=moderate inflammation; glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit;4=severe inflammation; marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Plaque Index (PI) (Overall and Interproximal)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The dental examiner used the PI to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. The plaque was first disclosed using a dye solution. Participants then rinsed with disclosing solution according to instructions. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including the mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Disclosed plaque was scored as follows: 0= No plaque; 1= Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2= A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3= A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4= Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less tan 2/3 of the crown of the tooth; 5= Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth.Overall PI score and interproximal PI score were calculated as the mean PI over all tooth sites and mean PI over interproximal sites (distal and mesial) respectively.</description>

        <title>Mean Plaque Index (PI) (Overall and Interproximal)</title>
        <description>The dental examiner used the PI to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. The plaque was first disclosed using a dye solution. Participants then rinsed with disclosing solution according to instructions. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including the mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Disclosed plaque was scored as follows: 0= No plaque; 1= Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2= A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3= A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4= Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less tan 2/3 of the crown of the tooth; 5= Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth.Overall PI score and interproximal PI score were calculated as the mean PI over all tooth sites and mean PI over interproximal sites (distal and mesial) respectively.</description>
