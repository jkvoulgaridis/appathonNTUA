    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Modified Rankin Scale (mRS 0-1) (Favourable Outcome) Response at Day 90 After Stroke Onset by Face-to-face Interview With Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS 0-1) (favourable outcome) response at Visit 5 (Day 90) after stroke onset by face-to-face interview with patient. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS): 0 = no symptom at all, 1 = no significant disability, 2 = slight disability, 3 = moderate disability, 4 = moderately severe disability, 5 = severe disability, and 6 = dead.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Symptomatic Intracranial Haemorrhage (sICH) Centrally Evaluated by Data-monitoring Committee (DMC) Consultants According to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III Definition Within the Whole Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) centrally evaluated by data-monitoring committee (DMC) consultants according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III definition within the whole study period. According to the protocol, sICH (ECASS III criteria) was defined as: any apparently extravascular blood in the brain or within the cranium that was associated with clinical deterioration (defined by an increase in the NIHSS score of 4 or more points), or that led to death and that was identified as the predominant cause of the neurological deterioration. sICH event was firstly evaluated by investigator. The DMC consultants evaluated all the patients with NIHSS score increase of at least 4 any time after treatment (including all fatal patients and sICH events evaluated by investigator). Wilson score confidence interval is presented.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Global Outcome Responder at Day 90 if he/She Obtains the Following Results at Day 90 (for All of the 4 Endpoints) mRS Score of 0 to 1; Barthel Index Score &gt;= 95; NIHSS Score of 0 to 1; Glasgow Outcome Scale Score of 1</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of global outcome responder at day 90 if he/she obtains the following results at day 90 for the endpoints mRS score of 0 to 1; Barthel Index score &gt;= 95; NIHSS score of 0 to 1; Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1. mRS: 0 = no symptom at all, 1 = no significant disability, 2 = slight disability, 3 = moderate disability, 4 = moderately severe disability, 5 = severe disability, and 6 = dead. NIHSS is composed of 11 items, and for each item a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. Glasgow Outcome Score applies to patients with brain damage allowing the objective assessment of their recovery in five categories: 1 Good Recovery, 2 Moderately Disabled, 3 Severely Disabled, 4 Vegetative State, 5 Dead. Barthel Index score to measure performance in activities of daily living with the scale ranging from 0 to 100. Global outcome response is the intersection of above four respective outcomes.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 121 patients were screened from 11 centres across China. Of the screened patients, 1 patient did not meet the study entry criteria. The first patient visit was on 12 December 2016 and the last patient visit was on 11 December 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Patients attended a specialist sites which ensured that they met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were not to be entered to trial if any one of the specific entry criteria was violated. Rescue medication was allowed for all patients as required.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Percentage of Patients With Symptomatic Intracranial Haemorrhage (sICH) Centrally Evaluated by Data-monitoring Committee (DMC) Consultants According to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III Definition Within the Whole Study Period</title>
        <description>The percentage of patients with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) centrally evaluated by data-monitoring committee (DMC) consultants according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III definition within the whole study period. According to the protocol, sICH (ECASS III criteria) was defined as: any apparently extravascular blood in the brain or within the cranium that was associated with clinical deterioration (defined by an increase in the NIHSS score of 4 or more points), or that led to death and that was identified as the predominant cause of the neurological deterioration. sICH event was firstly evaluated by investigator. The DMC consultants evaluated all the patients with NIHSS score increase of at least 4 any time after treatment (including all fatal patients and sICH events evaluated by investigator). Wilson score confidence interval is presented.</description>
