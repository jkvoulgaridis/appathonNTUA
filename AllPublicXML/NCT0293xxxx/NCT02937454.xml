      Study to Compare Ferric Carboxymaltose With Placebo in Patients With Acute Heart Failure and
      Iron Deficiency (Affirm-AHF)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Trial (RCT). The 52 weeks observation
      period following randomisation is considered appropriate to investigate the primary endpoint
      of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death. To evaluate the effect of intravenous ferric
      carboxymaltose (IV FCM) in iron deficient subjects with AHF, subjects will be enrolled during
      a hospital stay (Index hospitalisation) after the acute care treatment of the index event has
      been stabilised. All subjects will continue to receive their established standard therapy for
      HF and medical emergencies will be treated according to local routine.
