  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers are severe injuries and wounds causing a substantial burden on patients,
      caregivers, and on healthcare systems worldwide. There is common agreement, that effective
      pressure ulcer prevention is of crucial importance to maintain skin and tissue integrity in
      individuals at risk. Besides risk assessment and repositioning the use of special pressure
      ulcer preventive support surfaces are the key interventions in pressure ulcer prevention.
      Pressure ulcer preventive support surface modify the degree of skin and tissue deformation
      and/or skin temperature and moisture. Therefore, an association between the type and working
      mechanism of a pressure ulcer support surface and skin function after loading is highly
      likely. Furthermore, such a relationship may be used to characterize and/or to quantify the
      performance pressure ulcer support surfaces in terms of skin protection. The overall aim of
      this explorative study is to measure skin responses of the two most common pressure ulcer
      predilection sites (heel, sacral skin) after two hours loading on three different support
      surfaces and the sternal skin (control area).

        <description>Erythema was measured with the Mexameter® MX 18 device by using specific wavelengths (the intensity of the reflected red (λ = 660 nm) and green (λ = 568 nm) lights) to measure the absorption capacity of the skin (specifically the content of hemoglobin in the skin). Lower values represent less redness.</description>

        <title>Erythema Index in Arbitrary Units at the Sternum (Control- Area), After Two Hours Loading</title>
        <description>Erythema was measured with the Mexameter® MX 18 device by using specific wavelengths (the intensity of the reflected red (λ = 660 nm) and green (λ = 568 nm) lights) to measure the absorption capacity of the skin (specifically the content of hemoglobin in the skin). Lower values represent less redness.</description>

        <description>Skin roughness was measured using the Visioscan VC98 (Courage+Khazaka, Cologne, Germany) device. It consists of a UV light camera and measures the skin surface profiles. Rz is the arithmetic average of different segment roughness values calculated with visioscan software. The median was calculated from the Rz values from the 15 participants for each Intervention Group.</description>
