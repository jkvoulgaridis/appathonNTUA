  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One reason people gain weight is eating more calories from food than what they need for
      energy over 24 hours. Metabolism is the amount of energy a person uses over 24 hours.
      Researchers want to study the relationship between changes in metabolism and how much a
      person eats.

      Objectives:

      To see how much food a person eats when the body's temperature is cooled. To study how
      changes in metabolism may alter the amount of food a person eats.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18-55.

      Design:

      Participants will stay at NIH for 20 days.

      During the first 4 days, participants will have:

        -  Medical exam

        -  Electrocardiogram

        -  Blood and urine tests. One blood test includes drinking a sugar solution.

        -  DXA body composition scan

        -  Questions about foods they like, physical activity, and personal behavior

        -  Exercise test on a stationary bicycle

      Participants will spend 24-hour periods in a metabolic chamber. The chamber will be at normal
      room temperature or cooler.

      Some times, participants will eat a diet that matches their daily needs. Other times, they
      can eat as much as they wish from a vending machine.

      Participants will have blood and urine collected.

      Participants will swallow an ingestible wireless sensor and wear a small data recorder
      device.

      On the second to last day, participants will stay in the metabolic chamber but only consume
      water and non-caffeinated sugar-free beverages.

      Participants will come back for 1-day visits at six months and one year from the first
      admission. They will have blood and urine tests, and a DXA scan. They will answer questions
      on physical activity and food habits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 30% of adults are considered overweight. In general, lifestyle changes (diet and
      exercise) or current weight loss drugs only lead to about 5 to 10% weight loss. This may be
      because a person s energy expenditure, aka the number of calories the body uses, leads to
      hunger and may increase the amount of food a person eats. Cold exposure is known to increase
      metabolism but it may not lead to weight loss if appetite and the desire for food are also
      increased. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate whether changing energy expenditure
      by cool temperature exposure results in changes in food intake. This study will involve a
      stay on our clinical research unit where we will determine the energy requirements (at 24
      degree C) of 68 healthy, adult volunteers without evidence of diabetes. Exposure to cool
      temperatures (16 degree C) will be used to increase the number of calories a person s body
      uses in a day. Participants will spend 24 hours in a room that measures energy expenditure
      while the temperature in the room is turned down, once with a fixed diet and once with a
      buffet of food choices. After the fixed diet, volunteers will self-select how much food they
      wish to eat for one day from a vending machine. Volunteers will also spend one day fasting
      followed by a day self-selecting their food from the vending machine. Findings from this
      study will provide knowledge about a possible causal link between energy expenditure and
      eating behavior. This information may shed light on why many weight loss interventions that
      increase energy expenditure do not work as well as expected, and may eventually lead to new
      weight loss approaches and therapies.
