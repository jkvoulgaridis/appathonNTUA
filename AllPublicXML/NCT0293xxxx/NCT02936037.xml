      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of MD1003 over placebo in the
      disability of patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis and especially those
      with gait impairment.

    <intervention_model_description>PART 1:
Total duration of Part 1 is 27 months. The randomized double-blind placebo-controlled period ranges from 15 to 27 months depending upon the randomization date of an individual patient.
Once the last month 15 evaluation of the study has been completed, patients will switch to the active drug at the next planned visit. Participants and study personnel will remain blinded as to the original treatment assignment.
Maximum duration of double-blind period per patient will be no longer than 27 months.
PART 2:
At the last evaluation of Part 1 (Visit 11/Month 27) all participants will be offered active treatment in an open label extension for 39 additional months (From V11/M27 to V18/M66).
The purpose of the active drug extension is to further define the safety of MD1003.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Proportion of patients improved on either Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) or time to walk 25 feet (TW25) :
- with decreased EDSS at M12 confirmed at M15 (where decreased EDSS is defined as a decrease of at least 1 point if initial EDSS from 3.5 to 5.5 and of at least 0.5 point if initial EDSS from 6 to 6.5)
or
- with improved TW25 of at least 20% at Month 12 and Month15
compared to the lowest of the two EDSS and TW25* scores among inclusion and randomization visits.
*The lowest TW25 value recorded among the four values obtained during the inclusion and randomization visits will be considered as the baseline TW25 value.</description>

Date of 12-weeks confirmed EDSS progression will be the first date of an EDSS progression (as defined above) that is confirmed 12 weeks later.</description>
