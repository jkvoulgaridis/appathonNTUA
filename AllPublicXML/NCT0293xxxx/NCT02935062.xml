    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to verify phonological and auditory aspects of children submitted to
      traditional phonological therapy, phonological therapy using a software and placebo therapy
      in children with phonological disorders.

    <textblock>
      The study will provide different therapeutic approaches for cases of phonological disorders,
      the classical approach would be mediated by Cycles Model, innovated approach is performed by
      means of an intervention speech software-SIFALA, there will still be the group that does not
      receive any of the proposals therapies that will be the placebo group.The study will provide
      25 sessions for each group, with 30 minutes in each group. At the end of these sessions, the
      placebo group will receive one of the therapeutic approaches. With these three study groups,
      the investigators understand in what manner to obtain correct sounds is more effective.

    <measure>Percentage of Consonants Correct (PCC) Pre-treatment and Post-treatment Phonological Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of correct consonants corresponds to the number of phonemes produced by the child, evaluated initially before starting treatment and at the end of treatment. The variable of this calculation is based on the percentage which is determined at what phonological level of disorder the child is at. It is expected that at the end of treatment the percentage of correct consonants will increase due to the therapy stimuli offered.</description>

    <description>Electrophysiological evaluation of the auditory pathway through the protocol, Pretreatment and Post-treatment P300 waves were analyzed by the latency according to the parameters of MacPherson (1996).
The electrophysiological protocol was performed before and after therapy. The marking of the waves was judged by specialist judges in the field of audiology.
The variable that predicts P300 latency is quantified in milliseconds (ms</description>

The software SIFALA, allows to select target segments using the Modelo de Estratos (second model Strata), based on the level segment of production and complexity of distinctive features, from the child's sound system analysis and planned generalizations. It also seeks the treatment of phonological disorders, by selection stimulus words in more favorable environments and playful activities with computer resource for the correct production of the target segment in the words stimulus, promoting the spread segments.</description>

The variable of this calculation is based on the percentage which is determined at what phonological level of disorder the child is at. It is expected that at the end of treatment the percentage of correct consonants will increase due to the therapy stimuli offered.</description>
