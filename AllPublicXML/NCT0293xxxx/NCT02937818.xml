      Study design This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-drug, multi-center, multi-arm,
      signal-searching study in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who
      have refractory or resistant disease from prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the preliminary efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of novel combinations of immunotherapies and/or
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair inhibitors in patients with platinum refractory or
      resistant extensive-stage-disease SCLC. Patients who have progressive disease (PD) during
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum refractory) or PD within 90 days after
      completing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum resistant) will be enrolled to
      the study. The primary objective of the study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of each
      treatment arm based on objective response rate (ORR).

      This study consists of a number of arms (sub-studies), each evaluating the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of a specific agent or combination. This study was initially open with 2
      arms (Arms A and B), and additional arms may open, provided there is compelling rationale for
      the combination and safe and tolerable doses and schedules have been determined from ongoing
      Phase I studies. There are 2 pre-defined arms:

      A. Durvalumab + tremelimumab followed by durvalumab monotherapy B. AZD1775 + carboplatin
      (CBDP)

      Further arm was added in amendment 3:

      C. AZD6738 + olaparib Amendment #4 was updated with possibility to allow expansion of any
      arm, to a total of 40 eligible subjects, based on Review Committee assessment of data from
      the first 20 subjects (from Stage 1 and Stage 2). Currently Arm A will enroll 20 additional
      patients into expansion.
