      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a once
      daily topical application of IDP-121 Lotion compared with its vehicle (IDP-121 Vehicle
      Lotion) in participants with moderate to severe acne vulgaris (acne) (that is, acne having an
      Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] of 3 [moderate] or 4 [severe]).

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Mean Noninflammatory Lesion Count to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Noninflammatory lesions were defined as follows: Open comedones (blackhead) - plugged hair follicle with dilated/open orifice, black in color; and Closed comedones (whitehead) - plugged hair follicle: small opening at skin surface. For noninflammatory facial lesions, open and closed comedones were recorded as a single count.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Mean Inflammatory Lesion Count to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammatory lesions were defined as follows: Papule - a solid, elevated lesion less than 5 millimeters (mm); and Pustule - an elevated lesion containing pus less than 5 mm. For inflammatory facial lesions, papules and pustules were recorded as a single count, while nodular lesions were counted and recorded separately.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Success at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success was defined as at least a 2-grade reduction from Baseline in EGSS score and an EGSS score equating to &quot;Clear&quot; or &quot;Almost Clear&quot;. EGSS was based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4; where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

        <description>Treatment success was defined as at least a 2-grade reduction from Baseline in EGSS score and an EGSS score equating to &quot;Clear&quot; or &quot;Almost Clear&quot;. EGSS was based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4; where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

Multiple imputation (MCMC) was used to impute missing values. 1 participant was excluded from analysis of dichotomized EGSS because EGSS was not performed at baseline.</population>
