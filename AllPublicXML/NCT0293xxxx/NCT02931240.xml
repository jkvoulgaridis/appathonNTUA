    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, dual-arm pivotal study of the BioVentrix Revivent TC System,
      with 2:1 study vs. active concurrent control group allocation ratio. This study will include
      126 patients of which 84 patients will be treated with the investigational device and 42
      patients will be included in an active control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Revivent TC System is indicated for patients referred for surgical treatment of left
      ventricular scar that is contiguous, and includes both anterior and septal components.
      Primary and Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints will compare data from the patients treated
      with the Revivent TC System to a control pool of patients who comply with all aspects of the
      protocol except scar location and are not treated with the investigational devices but remain
      on Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT). The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints
      will be evaluated at 12 months post procedure. The study will be conducted at a maximum of 20
      clinical centers.
