      Plan to monitor central arterial pressure in women who are undergoing spinal anesthesia for
      cesarean delivery or epidural anesthesia for vaginal delivery.

      Subjects will be screened as they are admitted to the maternity care floor (5th floor St.
      Mary's Hospital). Subjects will be approached if they are desiring regional anesthesia.

      The subject will have an additional blood pressure cuff placed on the arm that anesthesia is
      not using for their blood pressure cuff. Central arterial pressure will be measured from the
      cuff:

        -  Prior to regional anesthesia placement

        -  Every 15 minutes for 1 hour

        -  Every 30 minutes for 2 hours Routine sphygmomanometer measurements will also completed
           at the above times. These are all study procedures.

      Anesthesia will use their usual protocol for blood pressure monitoring and management during
      placement of, and after the procedure. No changes in patient management will be made based
      upon the central arterial pressure as the guidelines were developed with routine brachial
      pressure.
