    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether peripheral circulating cell-free tumor DNA(ctDNA)
      can help early screening of pancreatic cancer recurrence or not. And we are also planning to
      evaluate correlation between ctDNA with clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer.

      In the formation and growth of a primary tumor, cells can released into the bloodstream.
      There are many researches for these circulating tumor cells(CTC) And recently circulating
      cell-free tumor DNA(ctDNA) released from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells has developed. At
      one report which checked ctDNA level after operation of colon cancer patients, they suggested
      that ctDNA could show recurrence of cancer several months earlier than the conventional
      follow up imaging. And several reports suggested that ctDNA can invade host cell and change
      host cell biology, which can evoke cancer metastasis.

      So in this study, the investigator will collect ctDNA of pancreatic cancer patients, benign
      pancreatic disease patients, and healthy population. And the investigator will evaluate
      whether peripheral ctDNA can help early screening of cancer recurrence. And we will study
      about genomic signature of ctDNA to evaluate relationship between ctDNA and clinical outcome
      of cancer patients.
