      Determine if brexpiprazole treatment will be associated with a dose-dependent reduction in
      resting pupil diameter as a reflection of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neuron
      target engagement in a group of subjects with PTSD. All subjects will be evaluated by
      physical examination, ECG, standard blood chemistry, hematologic labs, toxicology testing,
      and urinalysis. Results of these studies must demonstrate a lack of clinically significant
      abnormalities prior to enrollment. Subjects will need to satisfy DSM-5 criteria for PTSD and
      receive a CAPS-5 score of 40 or greater on testing for study enrollment. Resting pupil
      diameter during pupillometric evaluation after two weeks on each treatment will serve as the
      primary outcome measure. This will be compared in the treatment groups using mixed effects
      repeated measures models to evaluate if there is a significant difference in pupil size among
      the treatments studied. As a secondary analysis this approach will be used to evaluate
      whether there is treatment effect on total CAPS-5 score. Lastly, the investigators will
      compute correlations between pupil size and CAPS-5 scores.

      Primary Hypothesis: Brexpiprazole treatment will be associated with dose-dependent reduction
      in resting pupil diameter as a reflection of LC NE neuron target engagement in a group of
      subjects with PTSD. Secondary Hypothesis: Brexpiprazole therapy will be associated with a
      dosedependent decrease in CAPS-5 scores Tertiary Hypothesis: The pre-post treatment change in
      resting pupil diameter will be statistically significantly correlated with the pre-post
      change in CAPS-5 score.

      Subjects will be screened and will undergo pupil measures with rating scales on Visit 1.
      Subject must be free of all psychotropic medications for one week before Day 1 assessment,
      except that prior FLX treatment will require 4 weeks of abstinence, and MAOIs will require 2
      weeks of abstinence. They will be randomized to study drug an issued six weeks of study
      medication on Day 1 to take home. A phone call will then occur for safety assessment and
      medication adherence at every week. They will present back to the study site on Day 42 and
      undergo pupil measures with rating scales. They will then undergo a one week washout period.
      On Day 49 they will then be given another study drug to take home with rating scales and
      pupil measures obtained that day. A phone call will then occur for safety assessment and
      medication adherence at every week. They will present back to the study site on Day 91 and
      undergo pupil measures with rating scales. They will then undergo a one week washout period.
      On Day 98 they will then be given another study drug to take home with rating scales and
      pupil measures obtained that day. A phone call will then occur for safety assessment and
      medication adherence at every week. They will present back to the study site on Day 140 and
      undergo pupil measures with rating scales. No more study medication will be provide on Day
      140 and a final visit will be scheduled for on Day 147, one week later, for and end of study
      interview with labs and physical exam. At each visit, other than the final visit, subjects
      will complete the CAPS-5, MADRS, Insomnia Severity Index, and Clinician Assessment for
      Adverse Effects.

             hematologic labs, toxicology testing, and urinalysis at baseline and end of study.
             Results of these studies must demonstrate a lack of clinically significant
             abnormalities prior to enrollment. If results are outside of the normal reference
             range the study physician will be consulted to assess if clinically significant.

          -  Subjects will need to be free of psychotropic medications or treatments that could
             impact results of this study as deemed by the PI for at least 1 week.

          -  If the subject's primary psychiatrist or treating primary care physician are providing
