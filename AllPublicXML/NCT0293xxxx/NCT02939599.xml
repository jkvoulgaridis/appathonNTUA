  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term open-label safety extension to the Phase 2a study of inhaled QCC374 in
      adult patients with PAH. This study provides the patients who completed the QCC374X2201 study
      with the option to continue receiving QCC374. The study will monitor the long-term safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of QCC374 in patients with PAH.

    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Six Minute Walk Test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is able to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tricuspid Annular Peak Systolic Velocity (TA S') at Week 16 (Day 112) Using Echocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Two Years</time_frame>
    <description>Key Right Ventricular (RV) function endpoints such as Tricuspid Annular Peak Systolic Velocity (TA S') were assessed with echocardiography. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in RV Tei Index at Week 16 (Day 112) Using Echocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Key Right Ventricular (RV) function endpoints such as Tei Index were assessed with echocardiography. The RV Tei index is using both systolic and diastolic time intervals to evaluate the overall global dysfunction of the right ventricle in PAH patients. A lower number in RV Tei Index indicates an improvement. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>

        <description>Key Right Ventricular (RV) function endpoints such as Tei Index were assessed with echocardiography. The RV Tei index is using both systolic and diastolic time intervals to evaluate the overall global dysfunction of the right ventricle in PAH patients.
