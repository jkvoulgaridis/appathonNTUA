  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled double-blinded multi-center clinical trial enrolling
      female hip fracture patients who are 65 and older. It will compare the effects of six months
      of supervised exercise training combined with daily topical testosterone gel, to six months
      of supervised exercise and inactive gel, and to Enhanced Usual Care. One third of the
      participants will receive topical testosterone gel and a supervised exercise training
      program; one third will receive topical inactive gel and a supervised exercise training
      program; one third will receive a home exercise program. All participants will receive
      nutritional counseling, and calcium and vitamin D supplements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are common among older women and can have a devastating impact on their ability
      to remain independent. A clinically important functional decline and failure to recover
      following a hip fracture has been documented as late as a year after the fracture, even among
      women who were functioning at high levels before the event. Age-associated androgen
      deficiency in women contributes to deficits in muscle mass, strength and power that are
      common in this patient population before the fracture, and are exacerbated afterward. A pilot
      study of testosterone (T) supplementation in elderly female hip fracture patients has
      demonstrated the feasibility of T treatment in this population, and showed gains in lean body
      mass (LBM) and muscle strength with active drug, compared to placebo. The benefits of
      exercise in restoring muscle strength and physical function after a hip fracture have been
      documented. However, it remains unclear whether T treatment can augment the effects of
      exercise on mobility and patient-reported function after hip fracture.

      The STEP-HI study is a 3-group, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded,
      parallel group clinical trial in older female hip fracture patients. 300 female hip fracture
      patients, age 65 years and older, will be enrolled from 8 clinical sites, using objective
      screening criteria for T deficiency (serum total testosterone level &lt; 60 ng/dL) and physical
      frailty (Modified Physical Performance Test (PPT) Score of 12-28). The trial will compare the
      effects of Enhanced Usual Care with home exercises and no gel treatment (EUC), supervised
      exercise training (EX) with inactive (placebo) gel (EX+P), and EX combined with T therapy
      (EX+T), to ascertain the incremental impact of adding T to EX in older adult women with a
      recent hip fracture. The study team will carefully monitor testosterone levels, adverse
      events, biochemical parameters, and factors related to adherence to the interventions.

      Information from this study has the potential to alter treatment of hip fracture in older
      women, a problem that contributes to significant morbidity and mortality, and has a large
      public health impact. The STEP-HI study is highly aligned with NIA's mission of identifying
      interventions that target common geriatric conditions and improve treatment options for older
      adults with multiple morbidities or risk factors.
