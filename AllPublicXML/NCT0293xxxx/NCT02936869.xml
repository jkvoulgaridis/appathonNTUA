  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the causal impact of performance-based monetary
      incentives in increasing postnatal care (PNC) referrals by traditional birth attendants
      (TBAs), via a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

    <time_frame>Within 48 hours of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of delivery clients that are successfully referred by the traditional birth attendant for postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery. For each delivery client that the traditional birth attendant reported, we visited at least three days after delivery to ascertain if they had been asked to visit the postnatal clinic, clarify if they had visited the clinic within 48 hours of delivery, and what care they had received (if yes). The team visited traditional birth attendants every two weeks to identify new clients. Where a new client was not up to three days post-delivery, the interview was postponed until the next visit by the team to the community. This occurred repeatedly, over a five-month frame.</description>

        <title>Maternal Postnatal Care Referral</title>
        <description>The proportion of delivery clients that are successfully referred by the traditional birth attendant for postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery. For each delivery client that the traditional birth attendant reported, we visited at least three days after delivery to ascertain if they had been asked to visit the postnatal clinic, clarify if they had visited the clinic within 48 hours of delivery, and what care they had received (if yes). The team visited traditional birth attendants every two weeks to identify new clients. Where a new client was not up to three days post-delivery, the interview was postponed until the next visit by the team to the community. This occurred repeatedly, over a five-month frame.</description>
