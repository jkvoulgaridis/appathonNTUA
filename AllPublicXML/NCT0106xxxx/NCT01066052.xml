    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human
      growth hormone (r-hGH) treatment in girls with Turner Syndrome under the age of 4 years.
      After 4 years of treatment, height in these girls will be compared with an historical control
      group of untreated girls with Turner Syndrome, matched for age and height at baseline.

    <measure>Height SDS at Year 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>Height SDS was calculated as height minus reference mean height divided by standard deviation of the reference population. Height SDS reflects the height relative to a reference population of the same age and gender.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c develops when hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, joins with glucose in the blood, becoming glycated. The higher the level of glucose in the blood, the higher the level of HbA1c is detectable on red blood cells. The normal range for HbA1c is 4 percent (%) to 5.9%. Number of participants, who had abnormal HbA1c levels any time during the assessment, were reported.</description>

    <measure>Difference Between Bone Age (BA) and Chronological Age (CA) (BA-CA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1, Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>BA was determined using left wrist and hand X-ray. CA was determined using the date of birth. Difference of BA and CA (BA-CA) was reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>The normal range for IGF1 levels is 45 to 117 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) for girls aged less than (&lt;) 3 years and 80 to 236 ng/mL for girls aged 3 to 6 years. Values outside the normal range were considered abnormal. Number of participants, who had abnormal IGF1 levels any time during the assessment, were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Reached Normal Height at Year 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with normal height were those who attained a height which was within +/- 2 height SDS of reference population standard. Height SDS was calculated as height minus reference mean height divided by standard deviation of the reference population. Height SDS reflects the height relative to a reference population of the same age and gender.</description>

    <description>Participants (girls) will receive r-hGH as a subcutaneous injection administered by a parent in the evening. During Years 1-2, the dose of r-hGH received will depend on participants' baseline height standard deviation score (SDS) relative to the general population standard: participants with a height SDS of -2 standard deviation (SD) or lower will receive 0.05 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) per day r-hGH and those with a height SDS between -1 and -2 SD will receive 0.035 mg/kg per day r-hGH. After 2 years of treatment, all participants will receive a fixed dose of 0.05 mg/kg per day for a further 2 years.</description>

The higher the level of glucose in the blood, the higher the level of HbA1c is detectable on red blood cells. The normal range for HbA1c is 4 percent (%) to 5.9%. Number of participants, who had abnormal HbA1c levels any time during the assessment, were reported.</description>

During Years 1-2, the dose of r-hGH received depended on participants’ baseline height SDS relative to the general population standard: participants with a height SDS of -2 SD or lower received 0.05 mg/kg per day r-hGH and those with a height SDS between -1 and -2 SD received 0.035 mg/kg per day r-hGH. After 2 years of treatment, all participants received a fixed dose of 0.05 mg/kg per day for a further 2 years.</description>

          <description>HbA1c develops when hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, joins with glucose in the blood, becoming glycated. The higher the level of glucose in the blood, the higher the level of HbA1c is detectable on red blood cells. The normal range for HbA1c is 4 percent (%) to 5.9%. Number of participants, who had abnormal HbA1c levels any time during the assessment, were reported.</description>
