  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity causes frailty in obese older adults by exacerbating the age-related decline in
      physical function. However, appropriate management of obesity in older adults is
      controversial. Weight loss without exercise could worsen frailty by accelerating the usual
      age-related decline in muscle and bone mass that leads to sarcopenia and osteopenia,
      respectively. Because of the important problem of frailty in obese older adults, it is
      important to determine the most efficacious approach in reducing, or even reversing frailty
      in this population. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate which distinct type
      of physical exercise (resistance, aerobic, or combined resistance + aerobic) is most
      efficacious in preventing the weight-loss-induced reduction in muscle and bone mass and
      reversing frailty in obese older adults.

    <description>The Physical Performance Test includes seven standardized tasks (walking 15.2 m [50 ft], putting on and removing a coat, picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, climbing one flight of stairs, and performing a progressive Romberg test) plus two additional tasks (going up and down four flights of stairs and making a 360-degree turn). The score for each task ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating better physical performance; a perfect score would be 36.</description>
