  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NAFLD Database 2 will recruit at least 650 new pediatric participants with liver biopsies
      and contemporaneous biosamples, and will also invite pediatric participants from the prior
      NAFLD Database and TONIC trial (50 with a recent biopsy and 150 without a contemporaneous
      biopsy) to enroll in the NAFLD Pediatric Database 2 study. Combining the new and continuing
      participants leads to a recruitment goal for the pediatric Database 2 of 850 pediatric
      participants during the enrollment period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the new pediatric participants will have had a liver biopsy within 120 days prior to
      enrollment coupled with contemporaneous biosamples within 90 days prior to enrollment and up
      to 90 days before or 4-90 days after the biopsy. We estimate that at least 50 of the
      continuing pediatric participants will be due for a standard of care liver biopsy at the time
      of their enrollment into the pediatric Database 2 study, and will, as a result, also have a
      liver biopsy and contemporaneous biosamples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Continuing participants:

               -  Previously enrolled in the NAFLD Database study or TONIC trial

               -  Age at least 2 years and not older than 17 years during the consent process

               -  Willingness to continue to be followed for up to 4 years

               -  Ability and willingness to give written, informed parental consent and child
                  assent, per local IRB guidelines, to be enrolled into the pediatric Database 2
                  study

          -  New participants:

               -  Age at least 2 years of age and not older than 17 years during the consent
                  process

               -  Willingness to be followed for up to 4 years

               -  Ability and willingness to give written, informed parent consent and child assent
                  to be enrolled into the pediatric Database 2 study

               -  Minimal or no alcohol use history consistent with NAFLD

               -  Having undergone a liver biopsy that is obtained within 120 days of enrollment

               -  Collection of biosamples (serum, plasma, DNA, and, if available, liver tissue)
                  within 90 days prior to enrollment and 0-90 days before or 4-90 days after the
                  standard of care liver biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Total parenteral nutrition for more than 1 month within a 6 month period before
             baseline liver biopsy

          -  History of gastric or jejunoileal bypass preceding the diagnosis of NAFLD. Bariatric
             surgery performed following enrollment is not exclusionary. Liver biopsies obtained
             during bariatric surgery cannot be used for enrollment because of the associated
             surgical or anesthetic acute changes and the weight loss efforts that precede
             bariatric surgery

          -  History of biliopancreatic diversion

             (participants with isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, anti-HBc total, are
             not excluded)

          -  Evidence of chronic hepatitis C as marked by the presence of anti-HCV or HCV RNA in
             serum

          -  Low alpha-1-antitrypsin level and ZZ phenotype (both determined at the discretion of
             the investigator)

             iron by phlebotomy)

          -  Prominent bile duct injury (florid duct lesions or periductal sclerosis) or bile duct
             paucity

          -  Chronic cholestasis

          -  Vascular lesions (vasculitis, cardiac sclerosis, acute or chronic Budd-Chiari,
             hepatoportal sclerosis, peliosis)

          -  Iron overload greater than 3+

          -  Zones of confluent necrosis, infarction, massive or sub-massive, pan-acinar necrosis

             would interfere with completion of follow-up

          -  Active drug use or dependence that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would
             interfere with adherence to study requirements

          -  Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would impede compliance
             or hinder completion of study

          -  Inability for parent to provide informed consent and child 8 years or greater to give
             assent
