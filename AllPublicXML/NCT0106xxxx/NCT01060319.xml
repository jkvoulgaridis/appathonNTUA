  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that all human malignancies harbour a subpopulation of tumor initiating
      cells/cancer stem cells (CSCs) that drives tumor development and potentially recurrence or
      metastasis of the disease. The primary aim of this study is to develop strategies for
      prospective isolation/enrichment of CSCs from human tumors of different tissue origins. In
      addition, we will characterize the signaling pathways and/or tumor specific antigens that are
      specific for CSCs, in order to specifically target these CSCs as the endpoint of this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:N/A. We will recruit all non-melanoma skin and bladder cancer patients
        that are recommended for surgical removal of tumor tissues. This includes patients from all
        ages, gender and ethnicity background. Our sample collection criteria based on the tumor
        size of individual (e.g. tumor samples will only be collected if it will not affect the
        pathological diagnosis or treatment procedures of patients). Exclusion Criteria:N/A
