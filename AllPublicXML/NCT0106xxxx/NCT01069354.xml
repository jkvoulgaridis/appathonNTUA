    <measure>Pain Score Using a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain (0 = no Pain, 10 = Very Severe Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after injection (Time 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of whether a statistically significant reduction in pain score in the Radiesse® Mixed with Lidocaine nasolabial fold was observed when compared to the Radiesse® without Lidocaine nasolabial fold using a 10-cm visual analog pain scale (0 = no pain, 10 = very severe pain).
In the study protocol, the assessment of achieving a statistically significant reduction in pain at time zero was selected a priori to be analyzed using a paired t-test to test the null hypothesis that the mean of the differences in VAS scores between the Treatment and Control folds is equal to zero.</description>

    <description>In this split-face study, a clinically meaningful difference in pain was defined as a 2-cm &quot;reduction&quot; (i.e., subject reports at least 2-cm less pain on a 10-cm VAS) in the Radiesse® Mixed with Lidocaine NLF when compared to the Radiesse® without Lidocaine NLF.</description>

    <description>2 questions were asked of 101 subjects: 1) Was one treatment less painful than the other? and 2) Was the difference in pain levels significant enough to affect your preference for one treatment over the other?
Only those participants responding &quot;yes&quot; to these 2 questions about pain and preference for treatment are reported in the table below.</description>

        <description>Assessment of whether a statistically significant reduction in pain score in the Radiesse® Mixed with Lidocaine nasolabial fold was observed when compared to the Radiesse® without Lidocaine nasolabial fold using a 10-cm visual analog pain scale (0 = no pain, 10 = very severe pain).
In the study protocol, the assessment of achieving a statistically significant reduction in pain at time zero was selected a priori to be analyzed using a paired t-test to test the null hypothesis that the mean of the differences in VAS scores between the Treatment and Control folds is equal to zero.</description>
