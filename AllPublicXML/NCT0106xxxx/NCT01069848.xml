      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      the Vedera KXS for the reduction or elimination of myopia and astigmatism in patients with
      keratoconus, who are no longer able to achieve adequate vision with their contact lenses or
      glasses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 14 years of age or older

          2. Presence of central or inferior steepening on the Pentacam map

          3. Axial topography consistent with keratoconus

          4. I-S ratio &gt; 1.5 on the Pentacam map or topography map

          5. BSCVA worse than 20/20 (&lt;53 letters on ETDRS chart)

          6. Contact Lens Wearers Only: Removal of contact lenses for the required period of time
             prior to the screening refraction

          7. Signed written informed consent

          8. Willingness and ability to comply with schedule for follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Eyes classified as either normal or atypical normal on the keratoconus severity
             grading scheme.

          2. A history of previous corneal surgery or the insertion of Intacs in the eye(s) to be
             treated.

          3. Corneal pachymetry &lt;400 microns at diameter to be treated.

          4. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye(s) to be treated
             that may predispose the eye for future complications, for example:

               1. History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis,
                  recurrent erosion syndrome, corneal melt, corneal dystrophy, etc.)

               2. Clinically significant corneal scarring in the treatment zone that is not related
                  to keratoconus or, in the investigator's opinion, will interfere with the
                  treatment.

          5. A history of chemical injury or delayed epithelial healing in the eye(s) to be
             treated.

          6. Diagnosed with autoimmune disease, systemic connective tissue diseases or atopic
             syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or taking systemic medications likely to affect wound
             healing.

          7. Women who are pregnant or nursing or who plan to become pregnant over the course of
             their participation in this investigation.
