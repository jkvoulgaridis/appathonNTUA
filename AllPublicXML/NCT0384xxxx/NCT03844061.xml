  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52 week, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

      After patients maintain a stable dose of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) for at least 1 month,
      they will be randomized to treatment with either Belimumab &amp; Rituximab or placebo.Patients in
      both groups will be on background MMF for the entirety of the study. Belimumab will be
      administered subcutaneously and Rituximab intravenously. Placebo injections and infusions
      will be of normal saline. Randomization will be done in a 2:1 manner to favor the treatment
      group. It is hypothesized that that Rituximab and Belimumab combination therapy with
      Mycophenolate Mofetil background therapy will improve fibrosis in SSc skin when compared to
      treatment with placebo and Mycophenolate Mofetil in a group of patients with early dcSSc.

      The specific objectives of this study are to:

        1. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is safe and tolerable in the treatment of
           patients with early diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc when compared to patients treated with
           placebo/placebo/mmf, as assessed by comparison of adverse and serious adverse effects.
           In this study stand of care will be protocolized as mycophenolate mofetil.

        2. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is more effective than placebo/placebo/mmf, as
           measured by change in CRISS, which is a composite outcome measure provisionally endorsed
           by the ACR for scleroderma clinical trials. It incorporates change in the mRSS, FVC
           percent predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and HAQ-DI. Additionally,
           hemoglobin corrected diffusion capacity (DLCO), Medsger Severity Scale (MSS), and by
           other physician and patient derived outcome measures will be used.

        3. Determine the biological activity of rituximab/belimumab/mmf vs placebo/placebo/mmf as
           assessed by effect on histology of skin, gene expression of skin and blood, change in
           B-Cell profiles including assessment of B regulatory cells, and effect on serological
           and cutaneous biomarkers of disease activity.

    <measure>Primary Efficacy Outcome: Change in the ACR CRISS at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The American College of Rheumatology Composite Response Index in Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (ACR CRISS) was developed using expert consensus and data driven approaches for use in clinical trials (Khanna et al, 2016). The exponential algorithm determines the predicted probability of improvement from baseline, incorporating change in the mRSS, FVC percent predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and HAQ-DI. The outcome is a continuous variable between 0.0 and 1.0 (0 - 100%). A higher score indicates greater improvement. Subjects are not considered improved (ACR CRISS score = 0) if they develop new: 1) renal crisis; 2) decline in FVC% predicted by 15% (relative) from baseline and confirmed after 1 month; or 3) left ventricular failure (systolic ejection fraction &lt; 45%); or 4) new pulmonary artery hypertension on right heart catheterization requiring treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in the MRSS at 6 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MRSS is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin induration. It is correlated with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral involvement, especially in early disease2, 4. It is scored on a 0 (normal) to 3+ (severe induration) ordinal scales over 17 body areas, with a maximum score of 51 and is used to categorize severity of SSc. Minimally clinically significant difference in MRSS is 3-5 points (Amjadi et al., American College of Rheumatology; Aug 2009; 2493-2494) It has been extensively used as primary/ secondary outcome in RCT with Scleroderma. This will be collected at every study visit.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was developed during the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) to measure generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. It assesses physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health, and health change. For each, the minimum score is 0% and the maximum score is 100%. The 0% score is the poorest and the 100% score is the best score. On Short Form-36 (SF-36) forms, individuals with SSc score significantly lower than healthy controls in domains of physical component score, mental component score, physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, and mental health (Iudici et al, 2013).</description>

    <measure>Change in the scleroderma health assessment questionnaire-disability index (sHAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SHAQ-DI is a disease-targeted, musculoskeletal-targeted measure intended for assessing functional ability in scleroderma. It is a self-administered 20-question instrument that assesses a patient's level of functional ability and includes questions that involve both upper and lower extremities. The SHAQ-DI score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (severe disability). It has a 7 day recall period and has been extensively used in SSc65, 67. 5 visual analog scales are included in the scleroderma-HAQ assessing burden of digital ulcers, Raynaud's, gastrointestinal involvement, breathing, and overall disease 68.</description>

    <measure>Change in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in scleroderma score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 is a standardized set of outcome measures developed through literature review, patient focus groups and cognitive debriefing among patients with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, other common gastrointestinal disorders, SSc, and a census-based US general population control sample (Khanna et al, 2009). The scale consists of eight domains relating to gastroesophageal reflux (13 items), disrupted swallowing (7 items), diarrhea (5 items), bowel incontinence/soilage (4 items), nausea and vomiting (4 items), constipation (9 items), belly pain (6 items), and gas/bloat/flatulence (12 items). The scales correlated significantly with both generic and disease-targeted legacy instruments, and demonstrate evidence of reliability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Scleroderma Skin Patient Reported Outcome (SSPRO)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SSPRO includes patient-reported answers to 18 questions about how scleroderma affects the skin and how those skin problems affect how the person feels and does things. Each question is followed by 7 boxes with numbers 0-6, spaced equidistant in between. The boxes are anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, &quot;Not at all&quot; (box labeled 0) and &quot;Very Much&quot; (box labeled 6). The subject selects a box labeled by an integer in response to the question. The recall period is 1 week. The sum of the numbers associated with the answers to each question is the score. A higher score indicates worse skin symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28) is a system developed and validated by the EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) to measure the progress and improvement of Rheumatoid Arthritis. DAS28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0 while higher values mean a higher disease activity. A DAS 28 below the value of 2.6 is interpreted as Remission. A value between 2.6 and 3.2 corresponds to a low disease activity. A value between 3.2 and 5.1 corresponds to moderate disease activity. A value greater than 5.1 corresponds to greater disease activity. &quot;28&quot; describes the number of different joints being assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI): Measures joint tenderness and swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index is calculated by adding the swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient global assessment, and the evaluator global assessment. The total minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 76. A value of 0-2.8 indicates remission; 2.9-10.0 is low activity; 10.1-22.0 is moderate activity; 22.1-76 is high activity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Global Combined Response Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1 through month 15</time_frame>
    <description>The global rank composite score is an analytic tool that accounts for multiple disease manifestations simultaneously but does not measure disease activity or severity. It reflects how participants compare with one another on the basis of a hierarchy of ordered outcomes: death, event-free survival (survival without respiratory, renal, or cardiac failure), FVC, the score on the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI; range, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more disability), and the modified Rodnan skin score.</description>

    <description>Belimumab decreases B-Cell survival and has been FDA approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, another rheumatic autoimmune disease. Belimumab is a recombinant, fully human monoclonal antibody; it binds to the soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) with high affinity and inhibits its biologic activity. The background above provides a robust rationale for the investigation of belimumab in the treatment of dcSSc.</description>

    <description>Rituxan® (rituximab) is a genetically engineered IgG1 kappa chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody containing murine light- and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. The antibody reacts specifically with the CD20 antigen found on the surface of malignant and normal B cells, and established B cell lines. Studies have shown that rituximab binds via its Fc domain to human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines by complement dependent cytotoxicity through the induction of apoptosis and via antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Rituximab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat some types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis.</description>

          4. Limited scleroderma.

          5. Systemic sclerosis-like illness associated with environmental or ingested agents such
             as toxic rapeseed oil, vinyl chloride, or bleomycin.

          6. The use of other anti-fibrotic agents including colchicine, D-penicillamine, or
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors (nilotinib, imatinib, dasatinib) in the month prior to
             enrollment.

          7. Use in the prior month of corticosteroids at doses exceeding the equivalent of
             prednisone 10 mg daily. Use of corticosteroid at &lt; 10 mg of prednisone can continue
             during the course of the study.

          8. Concurrent serious medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes
             the patient inappropriate for this study such as uncontrollable CHF, arrhythmia,
             severe pulmonary or systemic hypertension, severe GI involvement, hepatic impairment,
             serum creatinine of greater than 2.0, active infection, severe diabetes, unstable
             atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, malignancy, HIV, or severe peripheral vascular
             disease.

          9. A positive pregnancy test at entry into this study. Men and women with reproductive
             potential will be required to use effective means of contraception through the course
             of the study, such as (1) surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy), (2) double-barrier methods (such as a condom and occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent

             as birth control pills, patches, implants or injections) may interact with and reduce
             the effectiveness of MMF so women receiving MMF who are using oral contraceptives for
             birth control should employ an additional method (e.g. barrier method). Contraceptive
             measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not
             acceptable methods for routine use.

             infection (such as tuberculosis, pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster and
             atypical mycobacteria) 23. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
