  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral changes following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are one of the biggest challenges
      for patients, as well as their family members and others involved in their recovery. One of
      the most common behavioral changes following TBI is the emergence of impulsive behavior,
      which has been associated with destructive, suicidal, and aggressive behavior, and is related
      to poor rehabilitation program adherence. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate the effect of a novel neuroplasticity based intervention that combines cognitive
      training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to reduce impulsivity and to
      improve outcomes and quality of life for those who have suffered a TBI.

      Behavioral changes following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are one of the biggest challenges
      for patients, as well as their family members and others involved in their recovery. One of
      the most common behavioral changes following TBI is the emergence of impulsive behavior,
      which has been associated with destructive, suicidal, and aggressive behavior, and is related
      to poor rehabilitation program adherence. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate the effect of a novel neuroplasticity based intervention approach utilizing
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to alter brain neuroplasticity combined with
      cognitive training tasks selected to functionally target cognition and brain circuits that
      are impaired in those TBI patients with impulsive behavior.

      This double-blind, randomized, placebo (sham) controlled study will recruit 30 Veterans with
      a history of mild, moderate or severe TBI, who exhibit a variety of impulsive behaviors.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either active or sham tDCS, both paired
      with cognitive training tasks, once a day for five days. Additionally, participants will
      attend three follow up visits at 1, 2, and 3 months after the course of intervention visits
      is completed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be collected before and after
      intervention, to measure brain activity changes across time depending on intervention type.

    <description>Participants will receive 5 sessions of cognitive training concurrent with sham tDCS. For sham tDCS, electrodes are placed at the same locations as for active tDCS, but current is ramped up for the initial 30 secs, then immediately ramped back down. This method mimics the initial physical sensation of stimulation, but there is no active current for the remainder of the session.</description>
