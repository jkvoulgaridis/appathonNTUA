    <textblock>
      Comparison between prophylactic continuous variable infusion of phenylephrine (starting dose
      0,5mcg/kg/min) and norepinephrine tartrate (starting dose 0,1mcg/kg/min) to prevent
      hypotension and maintain cardiac output under spinal anesthesia during cesarean delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension is a frequent complication after spinal anesthesia for cesarean
      delivery. Many vasopressors have been studied and used, but the perfect vasopressor is yet to
      be found. Phenylephrine is the most common used in obstetric anesthesia but its cardiac
      depressant activity, being an only alpha-adrenergic agonistic, is linked to frequent side
      effects such as bradycardia and decreased cardiac output.

      Norepinephrine is a vasopressor characterized by both alpha and minor beta-adrenergic
      agonistic activity, it has then a minimal cardiac depressant activity. Hence it would provide
      a better stability of hemodynamic and cardiac output, and appears as a better alternative to
      phenylephrine.

      In this study, the investigators will compare prophylactic continuous variable infusion of
      both vasopressors. Phenylephrine started at the dose of 0,5mcg/kg/min and Norepinephrine
      tartrate started at the dose of 0,1mcg/kg/min. The doses will be adjusted according to
      maternal systolic blood pressure in order to prevent hypotension (defined by a systolic blood
      pressure under 80% of baseline).
