  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate responses of pain and the maintenance of
      mechanical muscle hypersensitivity following an acute exercise-induced ischemic condition
      repeated over time in a prolonged NGF-sensitized muscle. Additionally, the influence of the
      pain modulating system on prolonged NGF muscle hypersensitivity caused by peripheral
      mechanisms and central mechanisms will also be investigated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that an ischemic conditioning in a NGF-sensitized muscle is able to
      facilitate pain responses and that over time the pain modulation system is responsible for a
      subsequent reduction in muscle sensitivity towards mechanical pressure and a decrease in pain
      intensity following a period of NGF-induced muscle hypersensitivity.
