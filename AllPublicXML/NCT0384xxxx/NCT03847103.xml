  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Task-specific repetitive training, an usual care in occupational therapy practice, and
      robotic-aided rehabilitation with bilateral practice to improve limb's movement control has
      been popularised; however the difference in treatment effects between this two therapeutic
      strategies has been rarely described. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of
      robotic-assisted therapy with bilateral practice (RTBP) and usual care on task and motor
      performance for chronic stroke patients.

    <description>Motor activity log is a structured interview with testing sensitivity used to examine how much (amount of use, AOU) and how well (quality of movement, QOM) the subject uses their more-affected arm. For the 30 items MAL, each item is scored on a 0-5-ordinal scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, endpoint (4 weeks) and follow-up (16 weeks) assessments</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.</description>

    <description>Power and frequency function of Surface Electromyogram signals are reliable parameter to evaluate motor behavior of stroke survivors. The location sEMG electrodes were placed on the muscle belly of the anterior deltoid, flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis of the affected forearm.</description>
