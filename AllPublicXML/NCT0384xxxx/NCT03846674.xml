      Depression is defined as a cluster of specific symptoms with associated impairment. The
      clinical and diagnostic features of the disorder are broadly similar in adolescents and
      adults.

      Nevertheless, depression in adolescents is more often missed than it is in adults, possibly
      because of the prominence of irritability, mood reactivity, and fluctuating symptoms in
      adolescents.

      While depression is the leading cause of disability for both males and females, the burden of
      depression is 50% higher for females than males. In fact, depression is the leading cause of
      disease burden for women in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries.

      The prevalence of depression in children is low (&lt;1% in most studies) with no sex
      differences, and then rises substantially throughout adolescence.

      Okasha found that the lifetime prevalence of depression in urban and rural Egyptian
      populations to be 11.4 and 19.7% Several studies show that depression during adolescence is a
      risk factor of academic failures, marriage struggles, suicide attempts, interpersonal
      conflicts, unemployment, drug abuse; it is also a strong predictor of adulthood depression.

      Girls married too early are also more likely to experience domestic violence, abuse and
      forced sexual relations.

      Similarly early married females when interact with new individuals after marriage are unable
      to deal them psychologically which is mostly due to the bad behaviours shown from in-laws
      towards them thus leading to lower self-esteem, increasing their risk of clinical depression
      which on extreme aspect can cause suicidal attempts.
