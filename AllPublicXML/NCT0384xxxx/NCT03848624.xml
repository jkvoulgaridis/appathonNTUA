  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has supported CUHK to launch a three-year project
      'CUHK Jockey Club HOPE4Care Programme' to implement four evidence-based advanced
      rehabilitation technologies in 40 local elderly day care centres and rehabilitation centres,
      to benefit the community.

      Our research team had developed the &quot;Interactive FES Cycling System&quot; that can be used as
      tools for rehabilitation by individuals who have suffered from a stroke or elderly. The
      system can integrate both motor power and muscle power in order to facilitate an active
      rehabilitative exercise.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower-Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the last training session</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower-Extremity (FMA-LE), consists of 34-level cumulative scoring system to examine lower-limb functions of hemiplegic stroke patients quantitatively through a set of lower-limb movement tasks in reflex, flexor/extensor synergy, volitional movement, coordination and speed (Fugl-Meyer, et al., 1975). All assessment items are either scoring &quot;full&quot;, &quot;partial&quot;, or &quot;none&quot; functionality in the affected side, which minimizes ceiling and floor effects. FMA-LE demonstrated high internal consistency and a reliable assessment tool for a group of 140 hemiplegic community dwelling patients (Park &amp; Choi, 2014).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the last training session</time_frame>
    <description>Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT), measures the maximum walking distance covered in fixed duration as a sub-maximal test of endurance and aerobic capacity. The measurement of 6MWT is highly correlated to FAC (Mehrholz, et al., 2007) with good reliability (ICC=0.94-0.96) (Steffen, Hacker &amp; Mollinger, 2002).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed 10-meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the last training session</time_frame>
    <description>Timed 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT), measures comfortable and fast walking speeds in short distance. The ability to increase walking speed above a comfortable pace suggests the capability to adapt to varying environments, such as crossing street, with high reliability (ICC=0.90-0.96) (Flansbjer, et al., 2005). Average walking speed of healthy elderly subjects ranges in 0.6m/s-1.4m/s, and can increase to 21%-56% above the comfortable pace for faster walking speed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the last training session</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS), consists of 56-level measures to examine balance ability and to predict falling risk with high reliability (ICC=0.98) (Steffen, Hacker &amp; Mollinger, 2002). Stroke patients were assessed based on their performance on 14 simple mobility tasks, including transfer, standing, and reaching.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the last training session</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), consists of 4-level scale to examine joint spasticity based on muscle tone and resistance detected during passive stretching with good inter-rater reliability (ICC =0.85) (Bohannon &amp; Smith, 1987).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Category Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the last training session</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC) is a reliable measurement of independent walking ability on level-ground walking and stair ambulation, which is a good prediction of independent community walking post-stroke (Mehrholz, et al., 2007). FAC consists of 6-level scale: patients with FAC=4 requires supervision in level ground walking, FAC=5 requires supervision only when walking on non-level surface such as stairs.</description>
