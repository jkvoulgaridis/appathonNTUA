  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extract of Gelidium elegans inhibits lipid differentiation, accumulation, and synthesis in
      vitro and in vivo. It has also anti-obesity effect by inhibiting weight gain and decreasing
      body fat. In a preliminary study of obese adults aged 20 years or older, the extracts of
      Gelidium elegans showed a tendency to decrease in body fat and visceral fat, and to increase
      lean body mass. Based on these results, we tried to confirm the effect of body weight and
      body fat reduction of Gelidium elegans extract in overweight and obese people.
