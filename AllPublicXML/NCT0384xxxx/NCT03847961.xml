  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis persists to be the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Moreover, the
      magnitude of health care resources utilized when managing septic patients is huge. All these
      hard facts call for constant efforts to optimize therapy. At present, the definitive therapy
      is adequate antibiotics and infectious source control. Fortunately, research has led to a
      better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, in which the activation of multiple
      pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators plays a key role. This has led to the development of
      treatment strategies aimed at restoring a balanced immune response by
      eliminating/deactivating these inflammatory mediators. Whilst animal models of sepsis have
      provided encouraging results with strategies aiming at immune response modulation, clinical
      studies in patients using targeted pharmacological approaches have so far proved
      disappointing.

      Besides of acute kidney injury (AKI), renal replacement therapy (RRT) is applied to remove
      inflammatory mediators extracorporeally. Across the different modalities, the application of
      adsorption may help deactivate and decrease the peak elevation of these mediators in earlier
      course of sepsis, when levels of endotoxins and cytokines are extremely high. Recently,
      attempts to improve the outcome of sepsis patients with such devices, ie CytoSorb cytokine
      hemoadsorption and polymyxin B (Toraymyxin) endotoxin adsorption, have seen a certain
      renaissance. However, the clinical evidence to date supporting hemoadsorption for removal of
      endotoxins and/or proinflammatory mediators in sepsis remains incompetent and controversial.

      CA330 (Jafron Biomedical Co , Ltd, Zhuhai, China) is a hemoadsorption device containing
      hemocompatible, porous polymeric beads capable of removing cytokines and other mid-molecular
      weight toxins from blood by size exclusion and surface adsorption. Compared with HA330,
      improved resin synthesis technology makes CA330 a better performance in removing cytokines.
      This trial is the first to evaluate CA330 efficacy of cytokine reduction using the change in
      plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations over time as a primary outcome. Although the trial
      was neither designed nor powered to evaluate outcome, we also evaluated organ function
      parameters as well as 28-day all-cause mortality.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are stratified by site and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either CA330
      hemoperfusion plus conventional medical therapy group or conventional medical therapy group.
      The randomization is performed by researchers on the central randomization system, provided
      by the Department of Biostatistics, Southern Medical University. In this study, the center
      coded random number table is produced by stratified and sectional randomization method.
      Statistical Analysis System(SAS) 9.4 statistical software is used to generate random coding
      tables with serial numbers (001-144) according to the number of cases allocated in each
      center and the proportion of experimental group and control group (1:1). The length of
      selected sections (block) and random seed number are sealed together as confidential data .
      The random number table is provided by the statisticians of the Department of Biostatistics,
      Southern Medical University.

      The experimental group receive routine treatment of sepsis combined with cytokine adsorption
      column (CA330) perfusion, and the control group receive routine treatment of sepsis only.

      Hemoperfusion treatments are performed using a perfusion machine via centrally inserted
      standard dialysis catheters at a prescribed blood flow rate of 100-300ml/min. In the
      beginning, lower flow rate is recommended, if there is no discomfort, then gradually
      increases. Each patient received 2 hemoperfusion treatments within 24 hours with a target
      duration for each treatment of 120-180 minutes (minimum of 120 minutes). The shorter the
      interval between the two hemoperfusion is, the better. It is suggested that the second
      hemoperfusion be performed within 0-5 hours after the first one.

      Anticoagulation was recommended with low-molecular-weight heparin in arterial line of the
      circuit at the dose of 60-80 international units (IU)/kg. No additional dose is required. The
      activity of anticoagulant factor α can be monitored at 60 minutes. It is suggested that the
      activity of anticoagulant factor α should be maintained at 500-1000units/L in subjects
      without bleeding tendency and 200-400units/L in subjects with bleeding tendency. If the
      clinical condition is limited, it is not mandatory to monitor this parameter.
