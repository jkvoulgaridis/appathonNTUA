    <textblock>
      This research objective is to compare quadriceps strength by measuring maximal voluntary
      isometric contraction (MVIC) and risk of fall before and after subsartorial femoral triangle
      block (SSFTB)

    <description>If the patient can be able to stand independently for at least 30 seconds without support, he or she will be asked to do functional reach test, which the patient should reach forward by staying put feet. The difference of starting and ending point of the reaching hand will be measured. If the patient cannot stand independently for at least 30 seconds without support or do functional reach test less than 25 cm indicates that he or she has a higher risk for falls.</description>

    <description>Patients who underwent major knee surgery and had already planned to perform subsartorial femoral triangle block (SSFTB) were included in the study. They were measured the outcomes the night before surgery. The saphenous nerve and nerve to vastus medialis were blocked at the subsartorial femoral triangle level by experienced anesthesiologists. After standard monitor, the distal femoral triangle was identified 2 cm proximal to the opening of adductor canal by ultrasound guidance. At this level, The location of nerve to vastus medialis was confirmed by nerve stimulator and it was blocked with 0.5% levobupivacaine 5 ml. Then, 0.5% levobupivacaine 10 ml would be injected perifemoral artery. The outcomes were re-assessed 30 min after block.</description>
