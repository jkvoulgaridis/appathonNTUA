  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in endoluminal devices are now allowing clinicians the ability to begin exploring
      bariatric procedures performed via flexible endoscopy. Although these procedures may not be
      as effective as their surgical counterparts, these less-invasive options may relieve patients
      of the significant risks associated with surgery (1).

      Endomina (Endo Tools Therapeutics, Gosselies, Belgium) is CE mark device that may be attached
      to an endoscope inside the body and allows remote manipulation of the arms of the device
      during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibilities of making transoral surgical full
      thickness sutures and may allow performing endoscopic therapeutic interventions, via a
      transoral route.

      A first trial including 11 patients assessed feasibility and safety of the technique (2).
      There were no complications and the short-term results were encouraging. Then a multicentric
      efficacy study was conducted, including 51 patients (3). The results where EWL of 31% at one
      year and TBWL of 9% without complications.

      Finally a randomized controlled study was done including 73 patients in a 2/1 randomized
      fashion with a crossover at 6 months. Treated group was with the endomina device and
      controlled group was diet only. The follow-up was the same in each group. Primary endpoint
      was to reach the ASGE guideline &quot;difference between a control group and a treatment group of
      minimum 15%&quot; (4).

      Technique and suture pattern have evolved since the first study. The aim of this prospective
      evaluation is to compare different suture patterns and their mechanism of action.
