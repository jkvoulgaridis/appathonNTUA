  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an observational trial. The objective of this study is to follow-up
      with participants 3 years after completion of an 18-month comprehensive behavioral weight
      loss intervention. Outcomes of interest include change in body weight, body composition,
      physical activity, energy intake, and sleep. In addition, investigators will explore the
      associations between current physical activity, sleep, and energy intake patterns and body
      weight regulation.

      A total of 170 participants were initially enrolled in the comprehensive behavioral weight
      loss intervention.In this study, investigators will conduct a follow-up visit 3 years after
      the completion of the intervention. Only participants who completed the behavioral weight
      loss intervention will be enrolled in this study. Participants will undergo testing of body
      weight, body composition, physical activity patterns, energy intake patterns, sleep patterns,
      resting metabolic rate, and total daily energy expenditure.
