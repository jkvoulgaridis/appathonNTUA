      This study deploys a novel digital pill with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (TDF/FTC) among MSM with
      substance use to monitor PrEP adherence. The investigators will enroll N=15 HIV uninfected
      MSM with self reported substance use who are on PrEP or initiating PrEP to use digital pills
      over encapsulating TDF/FTC for 3 months. The investigators will assess the feasibility of
      using digital pills in this study population as well as understand the acceptability of
      digital pills for adherence measurement using semi-structured individual interviews.
      Additionally, the investigators will measure adherence over time, as well as episodes of
      suboptimal PrEP adherence.

      Eligible study participants will be screened and enrolled at Fenway Health (Boston, MA).
      Participants will complete a quantitative assessment on their history fo substance use,
      sexual risk and PrEP adherence, and be trained to use the digital pill for 90 days and
      instructed to take PrEP daily during the course of the study. Participants will return each
      month for a study visit to assess their use of the technology. At study visit 1 and 3, we
      will obtain dried blood spots (DBS) to measure drug levels and to confirm adherence detected
      by the digital pill. The investigators will also obtain drugs of abuse screens from DBS. At
      the final study visit (3 months), participants will undergo a semi-structured qualitative
      interview to understand the user response to digital pills.
