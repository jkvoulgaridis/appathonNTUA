      This work will mark the first step in understanding the neural targets for rTMS in youth with
      difficult to treat depressive symptoms, creating benchmarks for optimizing the safety and
      efficacy of rTMS for pediatric populations through precision targeting, and encourage funding
      applications for larger sham- controlled randomized clinical studies.

      Problem Statement: Depression is a global health problem with limited novel and targeted
      solutions. Currently available interventions (medication and psychotherapy) have failed to
      provide adequate clinical improvement in 40% of adolescents with depression and only produce
      remission in 30% of youth. There is a clear need to develop better targeted interventions for
      this growing population of youth.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: To examine the efficacy of a targeting strategy to optimize repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) to reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents between 12-17 years of age. Hypothesis
      1: Six weeks of open-label daily intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) sessions
      delivered to the left DLPFC will be effective at reducing depressive symptoms between
      baseline and 10- week follow-up. Hypothesis 2: iTBS over left DLPFC will decrease functional
      connectivity between left DLPFC and subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) and will reduce
      depression-related hyperconnectivity between nodes of the default mode network (DMN).
      Hypothesis 3: Higher anti-correlation between left DLPFC and SCC and lower cingulate
      glutamate concentrations will predict better clinical outcome following iTBS.

      Aim 2: To determine the tolerability of iTBS in adolescents between 12-17 years of age.
      Hypothesis 1: iTBS will be well tolerated without any more than minimal side effects.
      Hypothesis 2: iTBS will result in sufficient cortical excitability, as measured by
      64-channel-EEG pre, during, and post iTBS, to induce an antidepressant effect but not induce
      seizures or other adverse events.

    <description>Open-label rTMS sessions will occur within ~2 days after the baseline session with daily sessions delivered to left DLPFC over 2-6 weeks. Stimulation will be administered using the MagVenture MagPro rTMS Research System at currently FDA approved parameters (www.magvitatms.com). The TBS parameters will be 3-pulse 50-Hz bursts given every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) and an intensity of 80% active motor threshold, as measured from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle by a hand-held 700-mm figure-of-eight coil. rTMS will be applied for 9 min delivering a total of 1800 pulses/session.</description>
