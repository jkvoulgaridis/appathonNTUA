  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is focused on developing the early integrated intervention for child
      brain-developmental disorders, including globe developmental delay (GDD), autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD), and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in China.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The early integrated intervention of GDD and ASD is developed by Children's Hospital of Fudan
      University.

      The early integrated intervention of ADHD is developed by Nanjing Brain Hospital.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline development quotient (DQ) in the Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese version at 1 year, 2 years for GDD and ASD</measure>
    <time_frame>from enrollment to end of intervention (2 years). The DQ will be measured at the following time point: enrollment, 1 year, 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese version consists of 5 subscales, which are locomotor scale, personal-social scale, eye&amp; hand coordination scale, hearing&amp; language scale. Each subscale has a development quotient. The developmental ages (DA) are referred from the norms and developmental quotients (DQ) are calculated by DA/CA (chronological age)*100. DQ for subscales have a mean of 100 (SD: 15). Higher DQ represent a better outcome. This is a repeate measurement</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of the Conners Early Childhood (Conners EC) at 1 year, 2 years for ADHD</measure>
    <time_frame>from enrollment to end of intervention (2 years). The score of Conners EC will be measured at the following time point: enrollment, 1 year, 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners Early Childhood (Conners EC) aids in the early identification of behavioral, social, and emotional problems. It consists of 110 items. According to the 110 items of Conners EC, parents score children's behavioral frequency based on daily observations. The higher the score is, the more serious behavioral problems the children have. This is a repeate measurement</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile-Infant Toddler Checklist（CSBS-DP-ITC）at 1 year, 2 years for ASD</measure>
    <time_frame>from enrollment to end of intervention (2 years). The score of CSBS-DP-ITC will be measured at the following time point: enrollment, 1 year, 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a parent-reported questionnaire widely used for screening communication disorders including ASD in infants and toddlers. The whole scale consists of 24 items divided into three subscales (social, speech, and symbolic composite) and an open question at the end. The changes in raw scores of each subscale and the whole scale partly reflect the change in social communication skills of children.This is a repeate measurement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline intelligence quotient (IQ) in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale at 1 year, 2 years for ADHD</measure>
    <time_frame>from enrollment to end of intervention (2 years). The IQ will be measured at the following time point: enrollment, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Wechsler Intelligence Scale consists of 2 subscales, which are verbal scale and performance scale. The intelligence quotient (IQ) are referred from the norms. Higher IQ represent a better outcome.This is a repeate measurement</description>
