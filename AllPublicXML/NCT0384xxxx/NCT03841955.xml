      Four clinical trial institutions that meet the national qualification are selected as
      clinical research centers. After informed consent of the subjects and meeting the selection
      criteria, the subjects will be included in this clinical study. After the follow-up, all the
      data were sorted out and analyzed. Finally, the data of the two groups were compared to prove
      whether the high-pressure-resistant peripherally inserted central venous catheter developed
      by L&amp;Z US, Inc. was not inferior to the control group.

    <description>Subcutaneous detection of blood vessel movements less than three times, and finally completed catheterization and confirmed that the end of the catheter in the pre-positioning proportion of the total number of patients (catheterization success refers to the chest X-ray and other fluoroscopy means to confirm that the end of the catheter is located in the middle and lower segment of superior vena cava).</description>
