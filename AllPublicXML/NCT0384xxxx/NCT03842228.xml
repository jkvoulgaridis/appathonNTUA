  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies side effects and best dose of copanlisib and olaparib when given
      together with durvalumab, and how well they work in treating patients with solid tumors that
      have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable). Copanlisib and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving combinations of copanlisib and olaparib or
      copanlisib, olaparib, and durvalumab may work better in treating patients with solid tumors
      compared to usual treatments such as surgery, radiation, or other chemotherapy drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the doublet
      combination of copanlisib and olaparib and of the triplet combination of copanlisib, olaparib
      and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with molecularly-selected solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of the doublet combination of copanlisib and
      olaparib, and of the triplet combination of copanlisib, olaparib and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in
      patients with molecularly-selected advanced solid tumors, as measured by objective response
      rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). Although the clinical benefit of
      the doublet and triplet combination of these drugs has not yet been established, the intent
      of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient
      will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and
      tolerability.

      II. To assess overall duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).

      III. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these combinations, and explore
      exposure-response relationships.

      IV. To correlate molecular alterations with OR (CR+PR).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib and olaparib.

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and olaparib
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Beginning cycle 2, patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour
      on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 2 years.

                  inhibitors prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks

               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk
                  of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
                  prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
                  herbal product

                  enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine,
                  nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan,
                  efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period for strong or moderate CYP3A
                  inducers prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital
                  and 3 weeks for other agents

               -  Copanlisib: copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the
                  concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole,
                  clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong
                  inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St.
                  John's Wort) are not permitted from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of
                  the study

               -  Other medications that are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:

                    -  Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)

                    -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin

               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to
                  avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures,
                  the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and
                  what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
                  considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression,
             superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on high
             resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible
             cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia,
             uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QT corrected by the
             Fridericia formula [QTcF] prolongation of &gt; 500 msec, electrolyte disturbances), or
             patients with congenital long QT syndrome

          -  Women who are breast feeding or pregnant are excluded from this study because olaparib
             is a poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with olaparib and copanlisib +/- MEDI4736 (durvalumab)

          -  Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
             transplantation (dUCBT)

          -  Packed red blood cell or platelet transfusion in the last 28 days prior to study entry

          -  Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to study entry. Whole blood
             transfusions performed within 120 days of study entry may interfere with blood samples
             taken for exploratory analysis

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. However,
             systemic corticosteroids may be indicated after starting the study drugs to treat
             immune-related adverse reactions. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease

          -  Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Patients with HbA1c &gt; 8.5%

               -  Note: for patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus that cannot meet
                  protocol requirements, a single re-screening (which includes all screening
                  procedures) should be performed when then patient's diabetes is controlled and
                  can meet protocol eligibility requirement for HbA1c

          -  Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident
             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
             within 6 months before the start of study medication

          -  Patients with active, clinically serious infections &gt; grade 2 (Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 5.0). Active infection including
             tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination
             and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis [TB] testing in line with local practice),
             hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen [HBsAg] result),
             or hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the
             presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.
             Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain
             reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). HBV/HCV screening is required 28
             days prior to starting the study drug using a routine hepatitis virus lab panel

          -  Active infection requiring IV antibiotics or other uncontrolled intercurrent illness
             requiring hospitalization

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and any medical condition or
             diagnosis that would likely impair absorption of an orally administered drug (e.g.
             gastrectomy, ileal bypass, chronic diarrhea, gastroparesis)

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial

          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are
             stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to
             the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability

          -  New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease

          -  History or concurrent interstitial lung disease of any severity and/or severely
             impaired lung function (as judged by the investigator)

          -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management (per
             investigator's opinion)

          -  EXCLUSION STEPS 2 AND 3 ONLY

          -  Patients who have not recovered from grade &gt;= 2 adverse even
