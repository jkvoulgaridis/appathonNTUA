  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia in preterm infants during the immediate postnatal phase is associated with
      morbidity and mortality and remains an unresolved, worldwide challenge.

      A list of interventions, including adequate room temperature, use of infant warmers,
      polyethylene bags/wrap, pre-heated mattresses, caps and heated and humidified gases, to
      prevent thermal loss at birth in very preterm infants has been recommended, but a certain
      percentage of very preterm infants are hypothermic at the time of the neonatal intensive care
      unit (NICU) admission suggesting that further measures are needed. The thermal
      servo-controlled systems are routinely used in the NICU to accurately manage the patients'
      temperature, but their role during the immediate postnatal phase has not been previously
      assessed.

      We hypothesized that using a thermal servo-control system at delivery could prevent heat loss
      during this delicate phase and increase the percentage of very low birth weight infants
      (VLBWI) in the normal thermal range (temperature 36.5-37.5°C) at NICU admission. The aim of
      this study will be to compare two modes of thermal management (with and without the use of a
      thermal servo-controlled system) for preventing heat loss at birth in VLBWI infants.

In the control group, thermal exposure will be determined manually by setting the power of the heater at the maximum output.</description>
