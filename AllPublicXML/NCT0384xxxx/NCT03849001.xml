    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of acute leg cycling conditions at three
      different intensities versus a control condition condition on symptoms of restless legs
      syndrome (RLS) in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study includes a proposed sample
      of 24 participants diagnosed with both MS and RLS that will complete four sessions of
      supervised exercise or rest conditions in the lab, one session per week, over the course of
      four weeks.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of acute leg cycling conditions at three
      different intensities (i.e., light, moderate, and vigorous) versus a control condition (i.e.,
      quiet rest) on symptoms of RLS in persons with MS. This study involves a within-subjects,
      repeated measures design that includes a proposed sample of 24 participants diagnosed with
      both MS and RLS. Participants will complete four sessions with supervised exercise or rest
      conditions in the lab, one session per week, over the course of four weeks. The order of the
      three conditions will be randomized and counterbalanced and include: (1) leg cycling with no
      resistance (i.e., light), (2) leg cycling at moderate intensity, (3) leg cycling at vigorous
      intensity, and (4) seated, quiet rest (i.e., control condition). The primary study outcome
      includes the objective measure of RLS severity using the Suggested Immobilization Test (SIT)
      that will be administered immediately before and immediately after each condition (i.e.,
      light, moderate, vigorous, and quiet rest).

    <time_frame>10 minutes pre-exercise condition</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be reclined at a 45 degree angle on a padded treatment table with legs outstretched and will be instructed to avoid any voluntary movement of the legs for the 60 minute duration of the test. Periodic limb movements during wakefulness (PLMW) will be quantified using two accelerometers and self-reported severity of leg discomfort during the SIT will be assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranges from 0 (no discomfort) to 100 (extreme discomfort) every five minutes during the test. The SIT will be completed immediately before the light exercise condition to capture pre-exercise RLS severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through screening</time_frame>
    <description>In order to characterize RLS symptom severity over the previous week, participants will be asked to complete the IRLS. The IRLS is a validated 10-question survey that provides a global score commonly used to assess the overall severity of symptoms as well as the frequency and impact of symptoms on daily life in reference to the previous week. Overall symptom severity scores are determined by combining the sum of the answers on the questionnaire with with a range of 0 to 40 and higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>
