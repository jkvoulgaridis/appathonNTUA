  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2a, 2-part, crossover study in approximately 33 adult subjects
      (12 subjects in Part 1 and 21 subjects in Part 2), with varying degrees of cirrhosis with
      analysis of PK data after Part 1 to guide dose regimen selection and PK sampling time points
      for OCR-002 in Part 2.

      Part 1, Phase 1: Dosing Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4:

      Single-dose, partially randomized, 4-period crossover study to evaluate 5 g OCR-002 oral
      solution administered under fed conditions, fasting conditions, or under fasting conditions
      following discontinuation of lactulose in 12 subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A and
      C).

      The purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics of PAA and PAGN following a single 5 g dose
      of OCR-002 oral solution administered under fed conditions, fasting conditions, or under
      fasting conditions following discontinuation of lactulose as compared to a single 5 g
      intravenous dose of OCR-002 under fasting conditions in subjects with cirrhosis (Child‑Pugh
      class A and C).

      Analysis of pharmacokinetic data will be conducted after completion of Part 1 in order to
      determine the dose regimen of OCR-002 oral tablets to use in Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2, Phase 2a: Dosing Periods 1, 2 and 3:

      Multiple-dose, randomized, 3-period crossover study to evaluate OCR‑002 oral tablets in
      subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B). The purpose is to characterize the PK and PD of
      OCR-002 tablets after TID administration for 5 days in subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh
      class B).
