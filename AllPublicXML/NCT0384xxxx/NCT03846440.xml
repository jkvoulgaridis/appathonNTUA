  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to determine if the inadequate protein intake per meal (defined as eating
      &lt;30 g protein or 0.4 g protein/kg body mass) at specific meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) is
      associated with functionality in middle to older aged Mexican adults. Functionality was
      evaluated with self-reported questionnaires to assess their functionality score for different
      activities of daily living.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detailed dietary information was obtained for each participant to estimate dietary protein
      intake per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). One meal was considered with inadequate protein
      intake if its content was &lt;30 g or 0.4 g/kg.

      Functionality was assessed with two validated questionnaires. One for instrumental activities
      of daily living (Lawton) and another for activities of daily living (Barthel). We calculated
      a score according to each author's scales. This score was divided into three possible groups
      as &quot;low&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;high&quot; scores.

      To analyze the association between inadequate protein intake per meal and functionality, we
      used multinomial logistic regression. The outcome variable was functionality (&quot;High&quot; was the
      reference group, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;low&quot; scores were considered as impaired functionality), and
      the predictive variables were inadequate protein intake at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They
      were adjusted for age, BMI categories, number of diagnosed diseases, sex, and inadequate
      protein intake per day (&lt;1.2 g/kg/d).

    <description>Functionality score for instrumental activities of daily living (assessed with Lawton questionnaire). This instrument assess how well the subject perform some daily activities involving tools (e.g. handling finances, taking medication, using the telephone). The instrument consists on five items for men and eight for women, and each item is coded for 0 or 1 depending on if subjects are capable to successfully complete the activity. Therefore, the score ranges from 0 to 5 in men and 0 to 8 in women, the higher the score, the more functional the subject.</description>

    <description>Functionality score for activities of daily living (assessed with Barthel questionnaire). This instrument assess how well the subject perform some daily activities (e.g. dressing, using stairs). The instrument consists on ten items for both men and women coded as 0 or multiples of 5 (i.e. 5, 10, 15) depending on if subjects are capable to successfully complete the activity. The score ranges from 0 to 100 for both men and women, the higher the score, the more functional the subject.</description>
