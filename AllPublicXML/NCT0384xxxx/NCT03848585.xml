  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to medication among patients with chronic diseases is a major problem. A
      patient group where the adherence to prescribed medications is extremely important are organ
      transplanted patients. It is well established that lack of adherence to immunosuppressive
      medication drastically increases the risk of rejection reactions, graft loss and deaths.

      Pilloxa is a device meant to help users manage medication and support adherence to
      medication. This study evaluates if Pilloxa improves adherence to treatment for transplanted
      patient compared with conventional management. Patients who have received a transplanted
      kidney or liver will be studied.

      Pilloxa is a system comprising of: a box with 14 separate containers to temporarily store
      tablets/capsules in and that can be open by 14 independent lids, a smartphone application and
      cloud based servers. The pillbox will at given times detect if pills are present in the
      different compartments and can connect, send and receive information to/from mobile
      application and the cloud.
