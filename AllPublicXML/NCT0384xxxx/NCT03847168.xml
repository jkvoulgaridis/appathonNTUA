  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study of KN026 in subjects with HER2 positive
      advanced breast and Gastric Cancer. The standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design was used for dose escalation.
      There are 3 proposed dose levels which are 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, but dosing interval may be
      adjusted during the study (such as QW, OR Q2W, OR Q3W) based on emerging data from this trial
      and/or from phase 1 trial of KN026 in other country. Dose escalation will continue until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or if MTD is not found, dose escalation will continue
      until the MAD of 20 mg / kg is reached.
