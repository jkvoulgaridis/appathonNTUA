    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in order to assess the need for dose adjustment for elafibranor
      in participants with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of elafibranor and its
      active metabolite (GFT1007) will be compared in severe renal impaired participants
      (eGFR&lt;15mL/mn/1.73m^2) versus healthy participants after a single oral administration of
      elafibranor 120 mg
