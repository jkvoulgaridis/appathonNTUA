  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project was designed to examine the metabolic level of branched-chain amino acids
      in plasm and monocyte/macrophage, and its role in immune dysfunction during sepsis.

      In this study, the investigators will collect the peripheral blood of 1,3,7,14 day after
      diagnose of sepsis. Then, the concentration of branched-chain amino acids(BCAAs) in monocytes
      and plasma, and the expression of BCAAs metabolic enzymes in monocytes will be determined.
      Additionally, the inflammatory cytokines, e.g., Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Tumor necrosis
      factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-10 (IL-10）, the chemokines macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α
      and 1β (MIP-1α and 1β) in the peripheral blood and the phagocytic function of monocytes will
      also be detected. The current project was designed to examine the metabolic level of
      branched-chain amino acids in plasm and monocyte/macrophage, and its role in immune
      dysfunction during sepsis.
