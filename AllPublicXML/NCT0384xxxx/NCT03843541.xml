    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, rater- and patient-blind, placebo- and
      active-controlled, 3-arm parallel group clinical trial. Patients will be randomized to
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or ambroxol or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. A total of approximately 333
      patients in China will be randomized. The total study duration will be approximately 8 months
      including the enrolment period of approximately 7 months and the patient participation
      duration of 1 month or 4 weeks. Each patient will undergo a screening period of up to 1 week,
      a 1-week treatment period and a 2-week follow-up period. This study will be conducted in
      approximately 15-25 sites in China.
