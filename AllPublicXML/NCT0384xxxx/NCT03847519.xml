        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject and/or their legally authorized representative must be capable of
             understanding the investigational nature, potential risks, and benefits of the study.
             The subject and/or their legally authorized representative must sign a written
             informed consent;

          2. Subject is ≥18 years of age upon signing the Informed Consent Form;

          3. Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV (metastatic) squamous
             or non-squamous NSCLC

               -  Part A only:

                  ▪ Subject has received, and then progressed or been intolerant to up to 3 lines
                  of prior therapy in the metastatic setting, including approved chemotherapy,
                  targeted therapy, immunotherapy and antibody therapy, if eligible. Subjects who
                  have received &gt;3 lines of prior therapy may be eligible for Part A, upon
                  discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.

                    -  Subjects will be eligible for Part A irrespective of PD-L1 expression.

                    -  Subjects will be eligible for Part A irrespective of EGFR or ALK mutation
                       status. However, subjects with an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK
                       translocation must have received and then progressed or been intolerant to
                       at least 1 prior line of approved targeted therapy to be eligible for Part
                       A.

               -  Part B only:

                    -  Subject is undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy for
                       metastatic NSCLC

                    -  Subject's most recent tumor assessment is consistent with PD according to
                       RECIST v1.1

                    -  The Investigator has determined that PD should be confirmed within 4-8
                       weeks, and pembrolizumab treatment will continue pending PD confirmation

                    -  Subject is willing to undergo a confirmatory scan 4-8 weeks from the prior
                       scan that indicated progression on pembrolizumab

                    -  There is no evidence of rapid disease progression or clinical deterioration
                       in the subject that would preclude continuation of pembrolizumab treatment
                       pending confirmation of PD.

               -  Part C only:

                    -  Subject has received no prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting.
                       Subjects previously treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are
                       eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months
                       prior to the diagnosis of metastatic disease.

                    -  Subject has provided a formalin-fixed tumor sample from a biopsy of a tumor
                       lesion either at the time of or after the diagnosis of metastatic disease
                       AND from a site not previously irradiated, to assess for PD-L1 status.
                       Biopsies obtained PRIOR to the administration of any systemic therapy to
                       treat the subject's tumor (such as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy) will not be
                       permitted for analysis. The tissue sample must be received by the central
                       laboratory vendor prior to enrollment. Fine needle aspirates, Endobronchial
                       Ultrasound (EBUS) or cell blocks are not acceptable. Needle or excisional
                       biopsies, or resected tissue is required. If the tumor specimen is not
                       evaluable for PD-L1 expression by the central laboratory, an additional
                       tumor specimen may be submitted.

                    -  Subject's tumor has PD-L1 expression of ≥50%, as determined by
                       immunohistochemistry (IHC) at a central laboratory.

                    -  Subject's tumor does not harbour an EGFR sensitizing (activating) mutation
                       or ALK translocation. EGFR sensitizing mutations are mutations that are
                       amenable to treatment with TKIs (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, afatanib,
                       osimertinib). ALK translocations are amendable to treatment with TKIs such
                       as crizotinib, alectinib and ceritinib. Investigators must produce the
                       source documentation of the EGFR mutation and ALK translocation status in
                       all subjects with non-squamous histology AND for subjects in whom testing is
                       clinically indicated. If either an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK
                       translocation is detected, additional information regarding the mutation
                       status of the other molecule is not required. If the clinical site is unable
                       to provide the source documentation, EGFR and ALK testing should be
                       performed per institutional standard of care.

          4. Subject has measurable disease for response assessment as defined by RECIST v1.1 by
             the Investigator;

          5. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1
             (see Appendix 11);

          6. Subject has a life expectancy of at least 3 months;

          7. Subject has recovered to Grade ≤1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03) of all clinically
             significant toxic effects of prior anti-cancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy or surgery before entering this study, except for alopecia;

          8. Subject has no major existing comorbidities or medical conditions that would preclude
             therapy in the opinion of the Investigator;

          9. Subject has adequate organ function

         10. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix 5),
             not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 5 OR

                  treatment;

         11. A female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment
             and throughout the study as defined in the SoA. If the urine test is positive or
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

         12. A male subject is eligible if he agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in
             Appendix 5 during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the final dose

             uncontrolled systemic infection, unstable angina, congestive heart failure,
             uncontrolled diabetes) or other chronic disease, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator could compromise the subject or the study;

          9. Subject has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV 1/2
             antibodies);

         10. Subject has a known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C infection

             exogenous implants). NOTE: More common devices and prosthetics that include arterial
             and venous stents, dental and breast implants and venous access devices (e.g.,
             Port-a-Cath or Mediport) are permitted. Sponsor must be contacted prior to consenting
             any subject who has any other device or implant;

         14. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding, or plans to become pregnant or to father

         19. Subject has any other serious or uncontrolled physical or mental condition/disease
             that, as judged by the Investigator, could place the subject at higher risk derived
             from their participation in the study, could confound results of the study, or would
             be likely to prevent compliance with the requirements of the study;

         20. Subject has received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy (except palliative
             radiation therapy for disease-related pain) within 2 weeks of the first dose of study
             treatment;
