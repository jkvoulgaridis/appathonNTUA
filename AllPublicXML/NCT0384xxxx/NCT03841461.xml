  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is closely associated with well-being condition and health development. The
      sleep quality and fatigue levels of individuals are also important components of health.
      Within the scope of our study, it is aimed to investigate the physical activity levels, sleep
      quality and fatigue levels of the academicians, who are generally working on a desk and we
      think that they live a sedentary life. Within the scope of this study, academicians were
      asked to respond to , International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-Short
      Form), general evaluation form, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Fatigue Severity
      Scale (FSS) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate that the effect of physical activity level on sleep
      quality and fatigue in academicians.

      First of all, a form including the purpose of the study, demographic information, daily
      working hours and assignment durations, was arranged; then obtaining general information
      about academicians who participated in the study and the physical activity levels of the
      individuals with International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-Short Form);
      sleep quality with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); fatigue levels with Fatigue
      Severity Scale (FSS) were planned to be measured. On-line communication was preferred as a
      data collection tool for all these assessments. In order to prevent bias in the results of
      the study, it was planned to transmit the questionnaire on-line to the academicians working
      in any program of any higher education institution. In this way, the voluntary involvement of
      the participant or any other threat to abuse was prevented. In other words, it was planned to
      ensure that individuals answer or don't respond the form on a purely voluntary basis.

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) consists of 7 questions;provides information about the level of physical activity in the last 7days.The calculation of the total score of the form includes total of duration and frequency whom walking,moderate activity and severe activity.The MET-minute scores;Walking 3.3MET,Moderate Severe Physical Activity 4MET,Severe Physical Activity 8MET,Seating 1.5MET.Classification is based on the numerical data obtained.Accordingly,there are 3 activity levels: Inactive,minimal active and very active.The lowest level of physical activity is inactive and the highest level of physical activity is very active.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a scale that provides information about the sleep quality of the individuals and the type and severity of the sleep disorder in the last month. It consists of 24 questions, 19 of which are evaluated. The PSQI consists of 1 total score and 7 sub-dimensions (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, usual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, sleep medication use, daytime dysfunction). Each item in the scale has a value between 0 (no distress) and 3 (serious distress). The sum of the scores related to the seven sub-dimensions gives the total PSQI score. The score of each subdimension ranges from 0 to 3. The total PSQI score ranged from 0 to 21. While the sleep quality of the patients with a total score of 5 and below is considered as 'good'; &gt;5 refers to poor sleep quality.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is one of the most commonly used self-report questionnaires to measure fatigue. Each question on this scale, which is composed of Likert type questions: 1.I strongly disagree 2.I do not agree 3.No tend to disagree 4. Indefinitely. The total score of the scale, which consists of 9 questions, varies between 9-63. People are asked to mark the appropriate options for each question taking into account their status in the last 1 month period. A total of 36 points and above indicate fatigue.</description>

    <description>IPAQ has been developed to obtain valid and comparable information about the level of physical activity based on individual reports on daily physical activity in the international arena. This form consists of 7 questions; provides information about time spent in walking, moderate and violent activities, and time spent sitting. The calculation of the total score of the short form includes total of duration and frequency whom walking, moderate activity and severe activity. The energy required for the activities is calculated by the MET-minute score.Standard MET values for these activities has been established. These; Walking = 3.3 MET;Moderate Severe Physical Activity = 4.0 MET;Severe Physical Activity = 8.0 MET;Seating = 1.5 MET.Classification is based on the numerical data obtained.Accordingly,there are 3 activity levels: Inactive,minimal active and very active.</description>
