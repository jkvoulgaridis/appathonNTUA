      This is an open-label, non-randomized, fixed sequence study conducted at a single study
      center with primary aim to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9977 in healthy volunteers
      when administered alone and in combination with multiple doses of itraconazole. Two types of
      treatments (treatment period 1 and treatment period 2) will be administered in a fixed order
      separated by a washout period of 3 days or more. Treatment period 1 will be single dose of
      AZD9977 (Dose 1) administration, in the fed state, on Day 1 followed by at least 3 days
      washout period. For treatment period 2, Itraconazole will be administered daily (Dose 2) from
      Day 4 to Day 8 plus AZD9977 (Dose 1, fed state) will be administered as a single dose on Day
      7. Dose of itraconazole has to be taken at -1 hour (1 hour prior to AZD9977 dosing) when
      co-administered with AZD9977.

             prior to study commencement and thereafter until study completion.

             23. The following exclusion criterion is driven by contraindications from the proposed
             concomitant CYP3A4 (itraconazole) inhibitor medications: Itraconazole (Sporanox)
             capsules are contra-indicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to itraconazole
             or to any of the excipients.
