  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to define a set of quantitative parameters related to articular
      biomechanics, which will be evaluated during some specific motor tasks. The goal is the
      prevention of primary and secondary anterior cruciate ligament injury in athletes.

      Specifically, the validation of a new comparative methodology of biomechanics analysis will
      be performed, based on inertial sensors and musculoskeletal models. This way, brief but
      exhaustive description of functional characteristics of athletes could be created and easily
      used in ambulatory environment.

    <description>The kinematics of lower limbs, trunk and upper limbs will be calculated both with inertial sensors (XSENS) and motion capture marker-based system (BTS ). Inertial sensors and markers will be placed on the subjects clothes and on the skin (totally non-invasive) to identify body segments. Then subjects will perform their motor tasks normally. Lately, through the data post-processing, the kinematics evaluated with both the systems will be used to describe how well the task is performed in terms of ACL prevention, through derived biomechanical parameters.</description>
