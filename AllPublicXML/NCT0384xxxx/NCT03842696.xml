  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of the drug Vorinostat
      in children, adolescents and young adults following allogeneic HCT and determine whether the
      addition of Vorinostat to the standard preventive therapy (tacrolimus [or cyclosporine] /
      methotrexate) will reduce the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) following
      allogeneic, myeloablative transplant in children, adolescents and young adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will undergo allogeneic blood and marrow transplant (BMT) according to local
      site institutional practice. The preparative regimen will depend upon the subject's
      underlying disease, previous therapy, and comorbidities. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of
      standard post-transplant immunosuppression, including tacrolimus [or cyclosporine] and
      methotrexate. Vorinostat will be administered at 30, 45 or 60 mg/m2 BID PO from 10 days prior
      to transplant (day -10), until day +100 post-transplant (110 total days of dosing).

             must be related or unrelated marrow or peripheral blood cells. A patient with history
             of CNS involvement is eligible if CNS disease is in remission at time of study
             consideration.

          -  The donor and recipient must have an HLA-8/8 allelic match at the HLA-A, -B, -C, and
             -DRB1. High resolution typing is required for all alleles.

               1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in first or
                  second remission. Remission is defined as the absence of blasts in the peripheral
                  circulation at the time of enrollment, &lt; 5% blasts in the bone marrow and absence
                  of extramedullary disease including CNS involvement.

               2. Chronic Myeologenous Leukemia (CML) in first or subsequent chronic phase failing
                  to respond (or intolerant) to at least two different tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
                  CML in accelerated or blast phase (CML-AP/BP) are eligible without requirement to
                  fail tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, but must be in remission at time of
                  enrollment. Remission is defined as the absence of blasts in the peripheral
                  circulation at the time of enrollment, &lt;5% blasts in the bone marrow and absence
                  of extramedullary disease including CNS involvement.

               3. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with intermediate or high-risk IPSS or equivalent
                  IPSSR score with &lt; 10% blasts in the bone marrow.

               4. Mature B Cell Malignancies (including Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Follicular Lymphoma.
                  Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma not otherwise
                  specified).Subjects should have extinguished standard of care options prior to
                  being considered eligible for this trial

          -  Subjects aged 3 to 21 years

          -  Karnofsky Performance Scale score of 70% or higher

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function (as defined in protocol)

          -  Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the vorinostat regimen

          -  For females of reproductive potential and men: The effects of vorinostat on the
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because histone deacetylase
             inhibitor agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial (e.g.,
             calcineurin inhibitor [tacrolimus, cyclosporine] and methotrexate) are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation and for 4 months after completion of
             vorinostat administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the Study

          -  For the cognitive assessment and patient-reported QOL exploratory correlative portion
             of the study, subjects and caregiver must speak, read and understand English. Subjects
             who are too young to read must be able to understand and speak English,
             age-appropriately. Subjects who do not speak, read and understand English but satisfy
             all other inclusion criteria may still participate in the study but will not complete
             the cognitive and QOL portions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are not a candidate for an allogeneic BMT based on the current local site
             institutional BMT program clinical practice guidelines. Organ function criteria will
             be utilized per the current local site institutional BMT program clinical practice
             guidelines. There will be no restriction to study entry based on hematological
             parameters.

          -  Subjects who are enrolled on another GVHD treatment or prevention trial.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vorinostat.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Subjects still under therapy for presumed or proven infection are
             eligible provided there is clear evidence (radiographic findings and/or culture
             results) that the infection is well-controlled. Subjects under treatment for infection
             will be enrolled only after clearance from the PI.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat is a histone
             deacetylase inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with vorinostat, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with vorinostat. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Subjects with evidence of HIV seropositivity and/or positive PCR assay, HTLV1/HTLV2
             seropositivity. The safety of allogeneic HSCT is not yet well-established for this
             population.

          -  Subjects with evidence of Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C PCR positivity. Hepatitis
             reactivation following myelosuppressive therapy can lead to fatal complications.

          -  Subjects with a history of prolonged QTc syndrome.

          -  Subjects who have had prior treatment with a drug like vorinostat (i.e., valproic
             acid) within the last 30 days.

          -  Subjects with documented evidence of cognitive impairment prior to enrollment on this
             study (diagnosis of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or other neurological
             illnesses that impacts cognition) are excluded from the cognitive assessment portion
             of the study only.
