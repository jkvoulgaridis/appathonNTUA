  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is one of the most common chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system in
      elderly. Patients with osteoarthritis experience pain, stiffness and loss of mobility. Due to
      ageing Western societies in the coming decades the number of elderly with osteoarthritis will
      progressively increase. Osteoarthritis is a common indicator for a Total Hip Arthroplasty
      (THA). A hip replacement is one of the most successful orthopedic surgeries. However, with
      regard to the postoperative rehabilitation a lot can be improved. The current situation after
      a THA is that physical therapy in the Netherlands is not prescribed by default. Patients are
      resigned from the hospital and receive home exercises. However, it is not clear whether
      patients actually carry out these exercises and whether they perform the exercises correctly.

    <measure>Change in mobility (objective measurement (TUG))</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess mobility objectively, the Timed Up &amp; Go test (TUG) will be performed. The TUG is an accepted test to measure mobility. During the TUG, participants will be instructed to stand up from the chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back and sit down on the chair again. Participants will be asked to walk at a fast but safe pace. The test will be performed three times. The TUG is considered reliable and practical. Measurements will be taken preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 4 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3).</description>

    <measure>Change in functional status (objective measurement (FTSST))</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess functional status objectively, the Five Times Sit-to Stand Test (FTSST) will be performed. The FTSST is a clinical test to assess lower extremity power and balance. For the FTSST, participants will be asked to stand up and sit down five times at a fast speed. Subjects will be instructed to perform the test with arms crossed in front of the abdomen when possible. The test was performed twice. The FTSST shows good reliability and validity. Measurements will be taken preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 4 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3).</description>

    <measure>Change in functional status and hip-related quality of life (self-reported measurement (HOOS))</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) will be used as a disease-specific outcome measure of functional status and quality of life. The HOOS consists of five subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living, function in sport and recreational activities, and hip-related quality of life. Standardized response options are given and each question is scored from 0-4 (on a 5-point Likert scale). A normalized score, ranging from 0-100, will be subsequently calculated for each subscale (0 indicating extreme symptoms and 100 no symptoms). The Dutch version has been proven valid and reliable. Measurements will be taken preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 4 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life (self-reported measurement (SF-36))</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure health-related quality of life, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) will used. The SF-36 is a widely used generic health status questionnaire consisting of 36 questions, divided into eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, general mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perceptions. Each raw scale score will be transformed into a linear 0-100 scale. The higher the score, the less disability. In this study only the subscales physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, and general health perceptions were analyzed. The SF-36 has proven to be practical, reliable and valid within a general and chronic disease population. Measurements will be taken preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 4 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3).</description>

    <description>To measure health-related quality of life, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) will used. The EQ-5D-3L has five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is divided into three degrees of severity: no problem, some problems and major problems. Actual quality of life will also be identified on the EQ-5D-3L Visual Analogue Scale. Measurements will be taken preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 4 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3).</description>

    <description>The duration of the program is 12 weeks. Patients start the program within 7 days after of the surgery. Patients perform exercises independently at home using the tablet PC for instructions. The program includes strengthening and walking exercises based on increasing the muscle force, balance, and functionality. The exercises comprise movements that train abductors, flexors, and extensors of the affected hip. The content of the program is based on previous research and on guidelines from the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons. For the rest, the program is designed in line with the most recent guidelines from the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy. Patients are asked to exercise at least 5 days a week, with rest days on Thursday and Sunday. Strengthening exercises will be performed 3 times a week. The instructions for the exercises will be provided by videos on the tablet PC, which patients have to imitate.</description>
