  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at verifying if a pulmonologist can reliably assess the tumor burden for
      the extractive molecular analysis in ROSE samples obtained with endoscopic sampling
      procedures from intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules.
