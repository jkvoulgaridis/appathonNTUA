  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-step exchange arthroplasty is more and more used in the treatment of chronic infections,
      especially in patients at risk anesthetic.

      This strategy is not recommended in patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms or
      difficult to treat because of a risk of bacterial persistence on the new implant.

      Antibiotic pretreatment by a narrow-spectrum molecule and for which resistance acquisition is
      difficult might be of interest to try to reduce the inoculum and avoid contamination of the
      new implant.
