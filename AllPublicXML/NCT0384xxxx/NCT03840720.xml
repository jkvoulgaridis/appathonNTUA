      &quot;The patient's journey&quot; is an interview based study assessing the patients' experience from
      the first symptoms to a final diagnosis focusing on patients with small intestinal
      neuroendocrine tumors.

    <textblock>
      The project focus on patients with small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SiNET's) with an
      incidence of 1-2/100 000 yearly. The primary tumor(s) are often small and symptoms usually
      arise when the disease has become metastatic with hormonal symptoms and/or symptoms due to
      local growth. As the tumors grow slowly and the symptoms in many cases are rather diffuse and
      develops gradually over a long time period there is often a long delay from onset to a final
      diagnosis both depending on &quot;patient's delay&quot; and &quot;doctor's delay&quot; The aim of the current
      project is to map and analyze the patient's journey from the first appearance of symptoms to
      the time point of a final diagnosis and to try to identify factors contributing to a delayed
      process.

      The method is interview based and the interviews will be analyzed through the Design Thinking
      Methodology
