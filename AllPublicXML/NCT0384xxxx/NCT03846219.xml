  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 once-daily oral doses of IMU-838 (vidofludimus
      calcium), a small molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), 30 mg/day and
      45 mg/day, in patients with RRMS and evidence of active disease.

      The trial consists of a screening period, a blinded 24-week main treatment period, and an
      optional initially blinded, then open-label extended treatment period of up to 9.5 years.

      About 40 centers are planned to participate in Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Poland;
      potential additional centers in Hungary and Croatia. In total, 195 patients are planned to be
      randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with 30 mg/day or 45 mg/day IMU-838, or placebo (65 patients
      each) in the main treatment period. During the extended treatment period, patients will be
      re-randomized such that patients previously on placebo will be re-randomized 1:1 to treatment
      with 30 g/day or 45 mg/day IMU-838, all other patients will be re-randomized to the same
      treatment they previously received.

    <masking_description>Trial participants, treating and evaluating physicians, central MRI readers and all other personnel directly involved in the conduct of the trial will be blinded to treatment assignments during the main treatment period and for the initial time of the extended treatment period. The evaluating physician will also be blinded to any clinical outcome or treatment change.
Once the results of the main treatment period are available, treating physicians, participants, and other involved personnel, except for the evaluating physician, will be unblinded. The evaluating physician will remain blinded to patients' clinical characteristics and treatment assignment during the entire clinical trial.</masking_description>

    <description>Main treatment period: All patients will receive half the assigned dose during the first 7 days of the main treatment period (1 tablet per day) and then start taking the full assigned dose from Day 7 onwards (2 tablets once daily).
Extended treatment period (optional): patients will receive 30 mg/day IMU-838 for up to 9.5 years. Patients on active treatment during the main treatment period will be randomized to continue their previous treatment assignment. Identical to the start of the main treatment period, all patients will receive half the assigned dose during the first 7 days of the extended treatment period and will then continue with the full assigned dose.
Once the results of the main treatment period are available, investigators and patients currently in the extended treatment period will be unblinded and investigators may then recommend switching the dose to a more effective dose or to an equally effective dose but with a lower risk for adverse events.</description>
