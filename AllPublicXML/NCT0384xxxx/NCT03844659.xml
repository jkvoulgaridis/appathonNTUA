  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Score of Anxiety Before Epidural Placement</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to procedure</time_frame>
    <description>3 different measures of anxiety prior to the procedure based on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory: 1) Numeric Rating Scale from 0-10 with 0 representing no anxiety and 10 representing worst anxiety possible. 2) Asking patient response to the question &quot;Are you calm&quot; with options scaling from &quot;very much, moderately, somewhat, or not at all&quot;. 3) Asking the patient to answer the question &quot;are you relaxed?&quot; with options scaling from &quot;very much, moderately, somewhat, or not at all.&quot; &quot;Very much&quot; will be treated as a positive finding and &quot;moderately, somewhat, or not at all&quot; as negative. The short form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory with these three measures has been shown to be a reliable measure of anxiety. A fourth measure used will be a Visual Analog Scale from 0-100 of overall anxiety with 0 representing no anxiety and 100 representing the worst anxiety possible.</description>
