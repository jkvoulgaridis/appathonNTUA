      Open-Label Study designed to evaluate the HPA axis suppression potential of Clobetasol
      Topical Oil and pharmacokinetic safety / systemic exposure to clobetasol when Clobetasol
      Topical Oil is applied to pediatric subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD)
      under maximal use conditions.

      The study duration for each subject will be up to 54 days (up to 38 days for Screening
      assessments, followed by up to 16 days of treatment and follow-up). Additional time will be
      required for subjects requiring additional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function
      testing due to an abnormal result at End of Treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the HPA axis suppression
      potential and systemic exposure to clobetasol, when administered as Clobetasol Topical Oil in
      pediatric subjects, under conditions consistent with anticipated clinical use and under
      conditions designed to maximize the potential for drug absorption in subjects with moderate
      to severe AD. The study will consist of three successively younger pediatric cohorts, as
      safety data allow:

        -  Cohort 1: ≥12 to &lt;18 years;

        -  Cohort 2: ≥6 to &lt;12 years; and

        -  Cohort 3: ≥2 to &lt;6 years. Enrollment into each successively younger pediatric cohort
           will proceed only after the preceding cohort has been completed and safety and
           exploratory data (including adverse events [AEs], tolerability assessments, clinical
           laboratory results, and the percentage of subjects with HPA axis suppression) have been
           reviewed and agreed to be acceptable for progression to the next cohort. Enrollment into
           Cohorts 2 and 3 will proceed only if the percentage of subjects with HPA axis
           suppression in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, is ≤40%. HPA axis suppression is defined
           as a cortisol concentration ≤18 µg/100 mL at approximately 30 minutes after stimulation
           with cosyntropin.
