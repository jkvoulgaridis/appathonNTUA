  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational clinical cohort study involving 100 mothers and their
      very preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation. The purpose of this study is to
      gain a thorough understanding of the microbiome (the collection of microbes in a biological
      site) establishment in very preterm infants. The study will also examine the perinatal
      factors associated with the pattern of microbiome development, the metabolome and immune
      development of this population in the first two months of life.

      All participants will be recruited from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Foothills
      Medical Centre (FMC) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

      Premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) occurs in about one in ten pregnancies
      each year. Babies that are born after less than 32 weeks of pregnancy are considered to be
      very premature babies. When babies are born very prematurely their gut is not as developed.
      One important factor in gut health is the large community of microbes (tiny living things
      such as bacteria) that live on the human body called the microbiome. Recent studies have
      shown that premature babies are more likely to have changes in their gut microbiome that are
      associated with health issues. However, sciences has not yet discovered what specific
      microbiome features are involved in development of premature babies. Therefore, this study
      examines the impact of very premature birth on the premature baby's microbiome.

      The kind of microbes that make up the microbiome in the gut in the first months of life have
      a major impact on the microbiome that will form during childhood. There are many
      environmental factors during pregnancy, birth and in first two months of life that can impact
      the microbiome development. These factors include diet, exposure to antibiotics, surgical
      procedures, and birth mode. This study will investigate how these factors influence the types
      of early microbes present in preterm infants.

      The hypothesis of the study is that specific microbial patterns, trajectories and/or
      metabolites will be significantly associated with single or a combination of perinatal
      maternal and/or infant factors.

      The primary objective of the study is to learn more about the development of the microbiome
      in very premature babies in the first 2 months of their life. To do this, participating
      baby's stool and urine samples will be studied.

      A secondary objective of the study is to find out how environmental factors impact the
      development of the microbiome and the health of preterm infants. In order to do this,
      maternal microbiome samples will be studied and information regarding maternal health,
      nutrition and environment during pregnancy will be collected. As well, information about the
      birth and health of participating preterm neonates will be collected.

        Due to the observational nature of this study and the need to understand early microbiome
        assembly in all very preterm babies, regardless of the pregnancy complication that led to
        their premature birth, this study aims to recruit most very preterm neonates that are
        expected to survive more than one week. Neonates with congenital gastrointestinal anomalies
        or that have a history of gastrointestinal surgery, will be excluded as these conditions
        severely affect the microbiome; however the microbiome will not have contributed to the
        development of these conditions. Participants must reside in the Calgary Metropolitan
        Region in order to ensure that they can be followed for the full 60 days of study
        participation if transferred to a level II NICU or discharged to home. Only mothers able to
        legally consent to study participation for themselves and their neonate are eligible to
        participate in the study.
