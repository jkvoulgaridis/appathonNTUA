  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of dry needling in perceived pain on patients with
      chronic unilateral neck pain with active or latent myofascial trigger points, and to evaluate
      the effectiveness of dry needling in mechanosensitivity, sensorimotor function, neck
      disability perception and quality of life. Finally, the study will aim to analyze the
      cost-utility of the intervention.

      Design: Quantitative, experimental, longitudinal, prospective, and single blind study.

      Subjects: Patients aged between 18 and 55 years, with non specific unilateral neck pain of at
      least 3 months of evolution. Methods: Both groups will undergo 4 sessions of treatment (2
      times per week during 2 weeks). Both groups will be instructed in the performance of cervical
      exercises, which will be carried out on intervention days and at home between sessions. The
      intervention group will receive dry needling, using a rapid entry and exit technique, as
      described by Hong, in the evaluated muscles. Dry needling will evoke at least four local
      twitch responses in order to be successful.

      For patients in the control group, the exercise program will be carried out following the
      same guidelines than the intervention group. Additionally, they will undergo deep dry
      needling in the affected muscles, but the needle will be inserted in a location far from the
      myofascial trigger point and without evoking local twitch responses.

    <measure>Neck disability index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to after treatment, and with a 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The neck disability index is a condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. The NDI can be scored as a raw score or expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means no pain and 5 means worst imaginable pain. The final score can range from 0 to 50 points (raw score) or from 0% to 100%, with 0 points or 0% denoting no activity limitations, and 50 points or 100% denoting complete activity limitation.</description>

    <description>The number of active or latent myofascial trigger points will be numerically quantified.</description>

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) in the evaluated muscles.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to after treatment, and with a 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>PPT levels, defined as the minimum necessary pressure to evoke pain will be evaluated using a handheld electronic pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Horby, Sweden) with a 1-cm2 contact rubber probe.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life, as assessed by the European Quality of Life test (EQ-5D).</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to after treatment, and with a 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is an instrument which evaluates the generic quality of life. The EQ-5D descriptive system is a preference-based health related quality of life measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers given to this questionnaire permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity and discrimination response, as assessed by the two-point discrimination test</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to after treatment, and with a 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The two-point discrimination test is used to assess if the patient is able to identify two close points on a small area of skin, and how fine the ability to discriminate this area is. It is a measure of tactile agnosia, or the inability to recognize these two points despite intact cutaneous sensation and proprioception.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will undergo sham-dry needling. For that purpose, sham dry needling will be carried out in those assessed muscles (anterior scalene, sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, splenius of the head, inferior fibers of the trapezius muscle and postero-inferior serratus) that present active or latent myofascial trigger points, according to the diagnostic procedures described by Travell and Simons. The intervention technique chosen for these participants will be to insert the needle in a location in the same muscle, but far away (at least 1-1.5 cm) from the location of the myofascial trigger point. Likewise, the needle will be inserted without evoking local twitch responses.
at a distance of 1,5 cm from the active or latent trigger point. Patients will also perform therapeutic neck exercises.</description>
