      Introduction. In the block climbing, the fluidity with which the athlete climbs a certain
      route is fundamental. The speed with which the movements are executed and the number of
      grippers of upper limbs is related to sports performance. Shoulder injuries are very
      prevalent in this sport. The inhibition of the stabilizing musculature can alter joint
      positioning and its normal biomechanics.

      Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of a program of stability exercises, scapulothoracic and
      glenohumeral, in the improvement of shoulder stability and sports performance, in boulder
      climbers.

      Material and method. Forty randomized subjects will be recruit into two groups: experimental
      (scapulothoracic and glenohumeral stability exercises) and control (glenohumeral
      stabilization). The stability of the shoulder (Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability
      Test) and the sports performance (Climbing Test) will be evaluated. The intervention last 6
      weeks, with two weekly sessions of 30 minutes each. Differences between evaluations will be
      analyzed with the t-sudent for related samples and the intra- and intersubject effect with
      the repeated measures ANOVA test.

    <description>The investigators used the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST). This scale evaluates the number of upper limb movements the subject is able to make during 15 seconds. A higher score represents better shoulder stability.</description>

    <description>Bouldering test, replicating the demands of a competition. The test was carried out on a 4-meter-high wall and with a 20 degree inclination, having a route with 15 climbing holds: 3 small, 7 medium and 5 large. A start hold and an end hold were clearly identified. The climber had 5 minutes to visualize the route, in a familiarization process often used in competitions. Before the test participants was told that they should be as efficient as possible in their movements. The time taken by the climber to complete the route was recorded, and the number of grips for the route.</description>

    <description>The experimental group followed a program that included three scapulothoracic stabilization exercises and three for glenohumeral stability, while subjects in the control group only performed the glenohumeral stabilization exercises. Two weekly sessions were carried out over a period of 6 weeks, and each session lasted 30 minutes. The intervention was conducted before starting the training session, to avoid muscle fatigue.</description>
