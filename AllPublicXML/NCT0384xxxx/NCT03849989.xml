  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hailey-Hailey disease is a genetic acantholytic dermatosis characterized by continuous
      erosion of the skin that results in a burning, painful sensation and restricts the patient in
      daily life. This disorder results from a genetic defect in a calcium pump, i.e. the hSPCA1
      pump. Calcium pumps are crucial for the processing of cell-cell adhesion proteins such as
      E-cadherin, part of desmosomes, the major glue between keratinocytes in skin epidermis. Today
      therapy is mainly focussed on symptom relief and prevention of secondary infection.

      Ablative laser therapy is known to result in a speedy healing of the affected skin site
      within 2 weeks following laser therapy. The fact that the treated skin site remains clear
      from this acantholytic disorder in the months/years following ablation, regardless the
      existence of a germline mutation, suggests that an epigenetic modification occurs in the
      process of wound healing.

      Objective: to (1) study the expression of hSPCA1 in keratinocytes before and after laser
      therapy and (2) verify the loss of acantholysis by immunohistochemistry and electron
      microscopy of cell-cell adhesions before and after laser therapy

    <description>Patients with Hailey Hailey, diagnosis confirmed by histopathology or genetics, with therapy resistant skin lesions suitable for ablative lasertherapy.
Skin biopsy specimens will be taken before and after lasertherapy at three time points.
Before treatment:
Affected skin 4 mm punch for immunofluorescence and RNA extraction 2 mm for electron microscopy Healthy skin within same anatomical region 4 mm punch for immunofluorescence and RNA extraction
Immediately after treatment of the treated area:
2 mm punch for histopathology
Six weeks after treatment:
Treated skin 4 mm punch for immunofluorescence and RNA extraction 2 mm for electron microscopy</description>

    <intervention_name>Skin biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>Skin biopsy:
Tissue samples will be taken by punch biopsy according to the daily routine of the Department of Dermatology of the Maastricht UMC+.
Steps:
Skin desinfection with chlorhexidine digluconate 1% solution
Local anaesthesia with lidocaine hydrochloride 1%
Biopsy specimens are taken with sterile punch device (disposable biopsy punch delivered by kai medical)
Biopsy specimens are retrieved with sterile pincer and cut with sterile blade
Wound is stitched with a single transcutaneous stich using absorbable suture (vicryl 4.0).
Wound will be treated with R/ fusidic acid ointment 3 to 5 times per day for two weeks
In the first week after laser therapy the wound will be covered by R/ Urgotull non-adhesive gauze, R/ Cutisoft cotton non-sterile gauze and R/ Klinipress exsupad absorbing bandage.</description>
