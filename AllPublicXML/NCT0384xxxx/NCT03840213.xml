  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated for cancer nowadays have many means of information and tend to become more
      and more involved in their health. The interest of a therapeutic fast with detoxifying or
      even curative properties, with a specific indication for cancer patients treated by
      chemotherapy, is nowadays relayed by the media. To date, there are no studies conducted on
      the scope of this information in cancer patients or on the attitudes of oncologists towards
      this practice and possible positioning requests from patients.

      We hypothesize that the choice of this practice and its modalities are rarely discussed with
      oncologists, although it may have deleterious repercussions on the patient's health.

      We propose a research based on the principles of sociological intervention. Its objectives
      are a first review of the issue and the establishment of a joint working group, including
      patients, carers and researchers, which will propose solutions to improve the patient/carer
      dialogue on this issue.
