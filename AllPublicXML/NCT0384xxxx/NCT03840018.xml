  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was a randomised intervention study, with before-and-after outcome measures and a control
      group, in patients who had an active long-term prescription for PPIs at high doses for at
      least 6 months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention consisted of sending patients an informative letter by post, in which their
      doctor invited them to seek an appointment for a medication review. Control group patients
      did not receive such a letter, and they were treated as usual (their doctors received a list
      of identifiers of patients on high doses).

      The main outcome variable was the number of active prescriptions of each PPI dose (high
      dose/standard dose/treatment cessation) at 6 months after the intervention.
