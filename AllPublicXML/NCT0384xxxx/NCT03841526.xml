  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period,
      crossover comparison in a clinical research center (CRC) setting, followed by a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, partially double-blinded, 3-arm parallel comparison in an outpatient
      setting to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of Glucagon Ready-to-Use (RTU) to
      prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia (EIH) in adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D),
      who perform regular, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise.

Sub-scale II (Worry) Subjects are asked to indicate from 0=never (min) to 4=almost always (max.), how often in the past 6 months they have worried about 18 things that people with diabetes often worry about because of low blood sugar. Lower scores are considered better, while higher scores are considered worse outcomes.

Subjects are asked to rate from 0=not confident at all (min.) to 3=extremely confident (max.), their level of confidence in avoiding severe problems with hypoglycemia during 5 common specific situations and 3 general situations relevant to people with diabetes. Subject is asked using the same scale to rate their perception of their spouse/partner's confidence in the subject's ability to avoid serious problems due to hypoglycemia. Lower scores are considered better, while higher scores are considered worse outcomes.
