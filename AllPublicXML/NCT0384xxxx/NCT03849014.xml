  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are one of the most frequent fractures in older adults. There is still
      controversy which surgical strategy is the best option for treatment of hip fractures
      especially trochanteric region fractures. Surgical intervention that follows hip fracture
      induces biochemical, physiological and fibrinolytic changes that are so-called &quot;second hit
      phenomenon&quot; which trigger systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The investigators are
      aiming to study this phenomenon after two different surgical procedures and help surgeons in
      everyday practice to choose the most suitable surgical treatment for patients with
      trochanteric region fracture and give the scientific community more evidence which methods is
      better since there is still controversy.

    <description>Dynamic Hip Screw is used for internal fixation of fractures of the certain types of hip fractures. The implant assembly consisting of a lag screw, a side plate, and cortical screws that fix the side plate to the proximal femoral shaft.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Proximal Femoral Nail</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Proximal Femoral Nail offers osteosynthesis for the several types of hip fractures. It consists of an anatomically curved nail, double neck screw, and two locking screws for distal end.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Dynamic Hip Screw</intervention_name>
    <description>Dynamic Hip Screw fixation: Fracture will be reduced under image intensifier. The incision will be made 7-10 cm with a lateral approach. The fascia lata will be incised and the vastus lateralis muscle will be splited along the axis of the femur, without stripping the periosteum. A135Â° angle guide will be inserted in the lower half of the femoral neck. The barrel of the plate will be guided to the hip screw by direct palpation to minimize the soft-tissue injury. After the insertion of the cortical screw, soft tissue will be protected with 4.5mm drill sleeve during drilling and tapping.</description>

    <description>Proximal Femoral Nail fixation: Fracture will be reduced under image intensifier. The incision 2-3 cm with a lateral approach that extended from the cranial part to the tip of the greater trochanter. After palpating the greater trochanter tip, the nail will be then introduced manually into the femoral shaft. The guide wire of the anti-rotational hip blade then introduced. The hip blade should be introduced in the direction of the lower half of the femoral neck. Drilling will be performed under soft-tissue protection with a retractor. The blade will be inserted, and a distal static locking screw and end cap will be inserted under soft tissue protection with a drill sleeve.</description>
