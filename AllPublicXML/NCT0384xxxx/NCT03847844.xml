  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication following
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mediated by stimulation of antigen
      presenting cells (APCs) which leads to donor T-lymphocytes activation and target tissue
      destruction, particularly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver in acute
      setting. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the application of mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSCs) as salvage treatment among steroid refractory GVHD patients improves
      outcomes without long-term risk association. On the other hand, the use of MSCs concurrently
      with steroids as front-line treatment for acute GVHD has yet to be researched on. The
      investigators hypothesize that this approach, as the MSCs will be administered at earlier
      stage of the disease, will increase survival rate and reduce mortality among aGVHD patients.

      Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to determine the efficacy and safety of
      allogeneic infusion of Cytopeutics® umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells
      (Cyto-MSC) in combination of standard corticosteroid therapy as front-line approach for
      treatment of grade II-IV acute GVHD patients.

      Study design: This is a phase I/II clinical study involving patients who underwent an
      allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non malignant haematological disorders and developed grade
      II-IV acute GVHD. A total of 40 eligible patients will be recruited in this study.

      For Phase I open labelled study, 5 eligible patients will be recruited to receive Cyto-MSC (5
      million UC-MSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment. Meanwhile, for Phase II double
      blinded placebo controlled study, another 35 eligible patients will be recruited and
      randomized into 2 study groups where 15 patients will be assigned into Group A to receive
      Cyto-MSC (5 million UCMSCs per kg bodyweight) and standard treatment, meanwhile another 20
      patients will be assigned into Group B to receive Placebo and standard treatment.

      Cyto-MSC or Placebo will be administered at Day 1 and Day 4. Another infusion of Cyto-MSC or
      Placebo will be given at Day 7 if the patient shows no or partial response based on GvHD
      grading criteria. All patients will be assessed up until 6 months follow-up which include
      medical history, clinical and physical evaluations, pathology investigations, biomarkers and
      immune cell subsets analysis, as well as quality of life questionnaires.
