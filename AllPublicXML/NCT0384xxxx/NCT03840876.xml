    <textblock>
      The key to a successful microlaryngoscopy is adequate operative field exposure and
      illumination. A variety of airway control procedures has been developed to improve operative
      exposure. A small size endotracheal tube is commonly used. However, some surgeon may suggest
      a 'no-tube' technique to optimize the surgical field. This study aims to investigate
      effectiveness and safety of a novel technique by supraglottic jet oxygenation and ventilation
      (SJOV) via nasal approach to facilitate optimal visualization in laser microlaryngeal surgery
      for small vocal polyps resection.

      The allocation sequence is generated by computer random number generation, and the allocation
      is placed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes by a non-investigator. Enrolment
      and data collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care
      of the patients. The treating clinicians are not possible to be blinded to the assignment
      group, but all other staff involved in both the collection and collation of data, and
      administration of neurocognitive testing, are blinded to group allocation.

      The primary measurement is numerical rating scale (NRS) rated by surgeon according to
      surgical exposure and visualization. The secondary measurements are operation duration, and
      Intraoperative pulse oximetry (SpO2), PetCO2.

      The continuous variables were expressed as means Â± standard deviation (SD) whereas
      categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentage for data description.
