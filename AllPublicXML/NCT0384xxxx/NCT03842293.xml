  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical validity of a set of PROMIS pediatric
      person-reported outcome measures in patients with chronic kidney disease. The evaluation
      includes longitudinal assessments of how measures change in association with clinical
      changes.

    <textblock>
      The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) network has developed over 20 pediatric instruments, both
      child-report and parent-proxy editions. Cross-sectional evaluations of the validity of the
      instruments have established that they are ready for integration into clinical research and
      practice. The next step in their ongoing evaluation is to assess their prospective clinical
      validity in a variety of health conditions. This study addresses the clinical evaluation of
      the measures in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Through baseline surveys and six follow-up surveys over a two-year period, Investigators are
      collecting self-report (child) and parent-proxy report of 11 pediatric PROMIS measures. Each
      of these PROMIS measures is described in the Main Outcome Measures section. Investigators are
      also collecting assessments of disease activity from clinical data. The selection of
      self-report and parent proxy patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures were determined through
      qualitative content validation. The analytic goal of this project is to evaluate baseline
      (cross-sectional) and longitudinal associations between PROMIS pediatric outcome measures and
      changes in the clinical status of patients with CKD. Our primary hypothesis is that as kidney
      function declines, self-reported health will worsen.

        Participants were initially recruited through an existing study, the Chronic Kidney Disease
        in Children (CKiD) study. CKiD is a long-term prospective cohort study that currently
        follows 364 children with CKD from 54 North American centers. Recruitment was expanded to
        also enroll children between the ages of 8 and 21 years who had been seen at a nephrology
        clinic at two CKiD participating sites, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and
        Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center (CCHMC) and had two eGFR readings
        (computed from serum creatinine) between 6-89 ml/min at least 3 months apart (eGFR of this
        level indicates CKD).
