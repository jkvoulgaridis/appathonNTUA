    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional, anonymous online survey aims to examine how salient variables influence
      PTSS, well-being, and suicidal ideation across the following professions of rescue workers:
      firefighters, ambulance personnel, police officers, and emergency and psychiatric nurses.
      PTSS, coping strategies, well-being, suicidal ideation, previously experienced and
      work-related trauma, and self-efficacy were measured and analyzed using multiple regression
      and structural equation modeling.

      Employees of rescue and emergency services are at a risk of posttraumatic stress symptoms
      (PTSS) due to exposure to trauma and work-related stressors. Salient predictors for the
      development of PTSS among rescue workers have been identified; however, little is known about
      how predictors (e.g. coping strategies) differ among professions requiring repeated
      engagement in emergencies. The present survey examines how these variables influence PTSS,
      well-being, and suicidal ideation across different professions of rescue Workers using
      multiple regression and structural equation modeling.
