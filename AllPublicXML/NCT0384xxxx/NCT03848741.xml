  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During middle-age, humans begin to lose muscle mass and strength. With increasing age the
      deterioration of muscle health is associated with a decline in quality of life and the loss
      of independence. β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) plus Vitamin D (VitD) have been proposed to
      increase skeletal muscle mass, contractile function and improve body composition but has yet
      to be evaluated in middle-aged women. The overall goal of this study is to determine the
      effects of HMB +VitD supplementation during 12 weeks of resistance exercise training or a
      non-exercise control on body composition, skeletal muscle size, and skeletal muscle function
      in middle-aged women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if HMB+VitD supplementation is an effective strategy to help prevent the loss of
      skeletal muscle size, skeletal muscle function and body composition in middle-aged women,
      forty eight women (45-60 yrs old) will be recruited to complete a 12-week intervention (n=12
      per group; 4 groups). Participants will be randomized to complete a non-exercise control
      period or a resistance exercise training program. In a double-blinded fashion, participants
      in the non-exercise or resistance exercise groups will be randomized to consume either
      placebo or HMB+VitD. Before and after each intervention the investigators will evaluate
      skeletal muscle size, skeletal muscle function, and body composition.
