      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of adenotonsillectomy on level of asthma control
      in preschool children with obstructive sleep apnea.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children ,in children younger than six years it
      is difficult to diagnose asthma as pulmonary function tests can not be performed reliably
      before the age six .

      Wheezing is one of the main symptoms of asthma. Young children with multiple trigger wheeze
      as activities ,laughing and crying are more likely to have asthma compared with episodic
      (viral) wheeze.

      The mainstay of asthma control is daily administration of inhaled corticosteroids, long
      acting beta2 agonists and avoid exposure of asthma triggers as seasonal allergens and
      environmental pollution particularly tobacco smoke exposure.

      Recent studies have found asthma to be associated with overlapping comorbidities including
      gastroesophageal reflux,obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.This studies have introduced
      therapeutic strategies aimed at improving asthma control by management of these coexisting
      conditions.

      Pathophysiological feature of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is presence of increased
      airway inflammation promoting of hypertrophy of upper airway adenotonsillar tissues .

      The latter promotes increased pharyngeal resistance thus predispose the upper airway to
      episodically collapse and cause fragmented sleep that characterize obstructive sleep apnea.

      Surgically adenotonsillectomy is the first line of therapy in childhood obstructive sleep
      apnea and has favorable outcomes ,including improvements of respiratory sleep disturbances
      and in reducing markers of asthma and reduction in the use of asthma therapies.

    <measure>preschool children who suffer from bronchial asthma will be assessed by questionnaire based history to assess level of asthma control as stated in GINA 2018 before and after adenotonsillectomy.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1year</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire based history will be obtained from the parents of children before adenotonsillectomy to assess level of asthma control in preschool children as stated in Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA 2018); ask parents in the past 4 weeks, has child had A-Day time asthma symptoms for more than a few minutes, more than once a week? B-Any activity limitation due to asthma? (Runs, tires easily, playing?) C-Reliever medication needed more than once a week? D-Any night waking or night coughing due to asthma? The child will be well controlled if none of this question were answered by yes.
The child will be partially controlled if 1-2 of this question were answered by yes.
The child will be un controlled if 3-4 of these questions were answered by yes. Repeat this questions after adenotonsillectomy to show prognosis of asthma after surgery.</description>

        study will be carried out on pre school children with bronchial asthma undergoing
        adenoidectomy or adenotonsilectomy for obstructive sleep apnea. The study will be conducted
        in otolaryngology department, Assiut university hospital. The study will be carried on 60
        consecutive cases.
