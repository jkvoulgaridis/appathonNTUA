  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of a 12-week aquatic walking exercise
      program on body composition, vascular function, cardiorespiratory capacity, exercise
      tolerance, muscular strength, and physical function in patients with peripheral artery
      disease (PAD). The effects of the 12-week aquatic walking exercise program were also compared
      to the effects of a 12-week land-based walking exercise program.

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 General Health Survey for Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The physical function domain score of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 General Health Survey was measured. The scale range is from 0 to 100 percent. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diastolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured as millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Higher values represent a worse outcome. Scale range for diastolic blood pressure is approximately 70-79 mmHg for most healthy populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic Arterial Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic arterial stiffness was estimated as measurement of brachial-to-ankle pulse wave velocity (meters per second). A higher value represents a worse outcome. Scale range is approximately 7.0 - 14.0 meters per second for healthy populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Claudication</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of claudication was measured during the 6-minute walking distance test (seconds). A higher value represents a better outcome. Healthy populations can typically walk the entire 6 minutes (360 seconds) without experiencing claudication.</description>

    <description>The aquatic walking exercise program was performed for 60 minutes per day, 4 times per week for 12 weeks.
The program consisted of a warm-up (10 min) and cool-down (10 min) which included stretching and gait training. The 40-minute main exercise session included 10 minutes of hip flexion-extension, hip abduction-adduction, and knee flexion-extension. The last 30 minutes included water walking (forward, backward).
The program intensity was established using heart rate reserve (HRR). Weeks 1-4 were at 50-60% HRR, weeks 5-8 were at 60-70% HRR, and weeks 9-12 were at 70-85% HRR. Subjects wore a heart rate monitor during the whole exercise training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.</description>

            <description>The aquatic walking exercise program was performed for 60 minutes per day, 4 times per week for 12 weeks.
The program consisted of a warm-up (10 min) and cool-down (10 min) which included stretching and gait training. The 40-minute main exercise session included 10 minutes of hip flexion-extension, hip abduction-adduction, and knee flexion-extension. The last 30 minutes included water walking exercise (forward, backward).
The program intensity was established using heart rate reserve (HRR). Weeks 1-4 were at 50-60% HRR, weeks 5-8 were at 60-70% HRR, and weeks 9-12 were at 70-85% HRR. Subjects wore a heart rate monitor during the whole exercise training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.</description>

The 40-minute main exercise session included 10 minutes of low-intensity forward, backward, and lateral side-stepping movements on flat group. The remaining 30 minutes included treadmill walking exercise.
The program intensity was established using heart rate reserve (HRR). Weeks 1-4 were at 50-60% HRR, weeks 5-8 were at 60-70% HRR, and weeks 9-12 were at 70-85% HRR. Subjects wore a heart rate monitor during the whole exercise training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.</description>

The program intensity was established using heart rate reserve (HRR). Weeks 1-4 were at 50-60% HRR, weeks 5-8 were at 60-70% HRR, and weeks 9-12 were at 70-85% HRR. Subjects wore a heart rate monitor during the whole exercise training session in order to maintain the designated training intensity.</description>
