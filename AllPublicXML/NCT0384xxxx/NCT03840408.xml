  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality. Among them, non small cell lung
      cancer accounts for 85%. Only part of patients could be treated with radical surgery.
      Mitochondria-targeted system therapy combined with radiofrequency ablation could be an
      alternative treatment. Small sample clinical cases verified that this therapy could be an
      efficacy and safe treatment in a short period. The primary aim of this trial is to determine
      if the efficacy of mitochondria-targeted system therapy combined with radiofrequency ablation
      is comparable to that of standard surgical interventions for patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer.
