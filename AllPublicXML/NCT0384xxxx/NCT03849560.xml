      The first Russian quadrivalent influenza vaccine was developed to improve the effectiveness
      of vaccination and the cost-effectiveness of preventive immunization.Current study was
      conducted to assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and efficacy of quadrivalent
      inactivated subunit influenza vaccine Grippol® Quadri (NPO Petrovax Pharm, LLC, Russia)
      versus trivalent inactivated polymer-subunit vaccine Grippol® Plus (NPO Petrovax Pharm, LLC,
