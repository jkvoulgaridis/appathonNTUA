  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seven different scoring systems used for prediction of perioperative bleeding were compared
      regarding patients operated for elective open cardiac surgery in the investigator's study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collected data of 500 consecutive patients, operated for elective open cardiac surgery were
      analyzed retrospectively. Seven different scoring systems were used to predict the
      probability of bleeding, including TRACK, PAPWORTH, WILL-BLEED, CRUSADE, ACTION, TRUST and
      ACTA-PORT. The scores are calculated for each of these systems by using their own parameters,
      and classified into four risk groups as very low, low, moderate and high. Then, these risk
      groups were compared with patients identified in two groups regarding the use of
      perioeprative erythrocyte suspension (ES) transfusions or not, as ES positive and ES
      negative.
