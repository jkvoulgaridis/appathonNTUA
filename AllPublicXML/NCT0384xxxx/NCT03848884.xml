      Does monthly adherence monitoring and education by a pharmacy resident impact Kroger star
      ratings, compared to the current standard?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if a monthly adherence monitoring and education service impacts the percent of
      patients adherent to oral diabetes and renin-angiotensin system antagonists (RASA)
      medications based on star ratings. It will also evaluate patient satisfaction of the
      adherence monitoring and education service, using a standard questionnaire.

    <description>Determine change in patients who are adherent to oral diabetes medications, determined by pharmacy star ratings in adherence measures; pharmacy analytics determines the star rating measure (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest) before and after the study. A student t-test will be used to determine if there is a difference.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine change in PDC after monthly follow-up on medication adherence and education; pharmacy analytics determines patient PDC in normal practice. The mean PDC for each patient at the end of the six-month study period will be compared to the baseline using a student t-test.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with education and monitoring service</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Patient Satisfaction Survey&quot; includes an 8-item 5-point likert scale (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree) about whether or not the pharmacist provided adequate education to the patient, whether or not the patient feels his/her health benefited from the service, and if the patient would recommend the service. The &quot;Patient Satisfaction Survey&quot; will be analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine how satisfied patients were with the medication adherence monitoring and education service.</description>
