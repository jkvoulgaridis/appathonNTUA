  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find out how smoking affects the way the brain responds to pleasure
      and how this impacts smokers' behavior. Participants will complete five sessions. The first
      session will be a screening visit to determine final eligibility. Participants who appear
      eligible based on this screening will work with a researcher to develop brief scripts about
      times when they smoke and do other activities. Next, participants will attend two magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They will smoke two study cigarettes at each of these visits -
      these cigarettes are like regular cigarettes you might buy at the store, but have different
      amounts of nicotine in them. After smoking, participants will be placed in an MRI scanner to
      complete some tasks. After the second MRI, participants will be given a one-week supply of
      study cigarettes and will be asked to smoke only those over the next week. They will also
      answer some questions on their phone every day during this period. Afterwards, they will
      return to the lab, provide a urine sample and complete some tasks, than get another one-week
      supply of a different type of study cigarette and repeat the process.

    <description>Anticipated and actual pleasure ratings acquired each day during EMA portion of study. Individual items are based on the 12-item Tripartite Pleasure Inventory (TPI). Participants rate their anticipated pleasure for activities they expect to engage in each day using a 0 (No pleasure) to 4 (Extreme pleasure) scale in the morning. They will then rate their actual experienced pleasure for activities they actually did engage in the evening using the same scale. Scores are summed across items for a theoretical range of 0-48.</description>

    <ipd_description>Detailed protocols, datasets and additional information will be available from the Principal Investigator and research team upon request. In order to maintain compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, as well as university data security policies, all data will be anonymized according to HIPAA guidelines prior to being shared. Individual participant scripts will not be made publicly available due to privacy concerns and because this could impact the nature of information participants were willing to provide for scripts. Data will be provided in widely accessible formats for both self-report and imaging data. We will work with the Office of Research Contracts to obtain guidance regarding any required Data Use Agreements as needed.</ipd_description>
