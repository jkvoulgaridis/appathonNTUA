  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study of 2'-FL in IBD, Crohn's Disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The overarching hypothesis is that 2'-FL supplementation in IBD will
      be safe and well tolerated, while increasing fecal Bifidobacterium abundance and butyrate in
      a dose dependent manner. The investigators will test 1, 5, or 10 gm 2'-FL compared to 2 gm
      dextrose placebo as a daily dietary supplement in pediatric and young adult IBD participants
      in stable remission receiving infliximab, adalimumab, or infliximab-dyyb biosimilar anti-TNF
      therapy.

    <description>Measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) is a specific 15-item questionnaire for patients with GI symptoms. Patients are asked to numerically score their subjective symptoms on a scale of 1-7 (1=no discomfort up to 7=severe discomfort). The sum of the scores for all 15 items is regarded as the GSRS total score</description>

          5. Disease is in remission

               -  Adult CD (age 18-25): CDAI score &lt; 150

               -  Pediatric CD (age 11-17): wPCDAI &lt; 12.5

               -  Adult UC (age 18-25): Modified Mayo sub-scores: stool frequency sub-score=0,
                  rectal bleeding sub-score=0

             stable adalimumab dose may range from 20 mg every 2 weeks to 40 mg every 7 days. While
             therapeutic drug monitoring will not be required for inclusion, all drug and anti-drug
             antibody levels obtained for clinical indications within six months prior to
             enrollment, and from the screening visit through week 20, will be recorded.
