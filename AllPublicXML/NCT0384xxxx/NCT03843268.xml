  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the Automated
      Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation (AMPS) therapy given via the Gondola™ device to improving
      Gait and Gait Related Disorders in patients with Parkinson'disease (PD). Gondola® is a
      portable device that runs on batteries and is fitted on both patient's feet when the patient
      is lying down. The device has been designed for the stimulation of two areas of both feet
      (first toe and metatarsal) through mechanical impulses set up for pressure, duration and
      sequence (Automated Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation - AMPS); the therapy requires less than
      2 minutes.

      The proposed project, through a randomized multicentric, placebo controlled double-blind
      crossover trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of AMPS Gondola therapy versus Sham
      Gondola therapy in PD subjects. 132 in/outpatients with PD will be recruited. Subjects will
      be randomized in 2 groups, one starting with AMPS treatment, the other with placebo
      treatment. At the end of the first cycle of 6 stimulations over a 3 weeks' time (AMPS or
      Sham), all subjects will undergo a washout period of minimum 6 weeks, then will undergo
      another equivalent treatment cycle (Sham or AMPS); a follow up valuation 14 days after the
      end of each treatment cycle will be performed.

      This project is aimed at studying and documenting the effects of the AMPS treatment given to
      PD patients via the Gondola device in:

        1. Improving gait, reducing bradykinesia, treating Freezing of Gait symptom;

        2. Improving UPDRS II and III scores;

        3. Improving balance. Another goal of the study is to document the safety of the Gondola
           device.
