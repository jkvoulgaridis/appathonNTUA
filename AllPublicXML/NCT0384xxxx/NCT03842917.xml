  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic treatment used to treat various solid cancers. Previous
      studies have shown that this treatment may have adverse effects like hypertension and
      proteinuria.

      This is an exploratory study aiming to better understand the relationship between various
      biomarkers and blood pressure changes and proteinuria measured for 4 to 6 weeks after the
      first infusion of anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab.

      Participants will be invited to participate to this research study by their oncologist within
      1 to 2 weeks before starting bevacizumab treatment, as part of standard treatment. They will
      finish the research at the end of the third infusion of bevacizumab.

      Patients will perform a home blood pressure self-measurement over three days and will collect
      urine over 24 hours prior to the start of each bevacizumab infusion at cycles 1, 2 and 3.
      Blood pressure measurements will also be performed during each bevacizumab infusion and blood
      tests will be performed before each infusion to measure the following biomarkers:

        -  Salt consumption as estimated by 24-hour natriuresis measured before each of the first 3
           infusions

        -  24 hours aldosterone excretion measured before the first and third infusions

        -  plasma methoxylated derivatives measured before the first and third infusions

        -  NTproBNP measured before the first and third infusions

        -  24 hours urinary free cortisol measured before the first and third infusions

        -  bevacizumab trough concentration measured before the first three bevacizumab infusion
