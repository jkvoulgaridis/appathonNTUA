  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to demonstrate whether balance, cognition and activities of daily
      living have changed in COPD patients with and without frailty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a common, preventable and treatable disease characterized by progressive respiratory
      symptoms and airflow limitation. Frailty defines a clinical syndrome characterized by
      multiple system effects, leading to decreased functional reserve and increased sensitivity to
      dependence or mortality following minor stress events. Inflammation, lack of physical
      activity, reduced exercise efficiency and maximum oxygen uptake may contribute to the
      development of frailty in patients with COPD. Balance, cognition and activities of daily
      living are associated with COPD.

      This study will evaluate the effect of frailty on balance, cognition and activities of daily
      living in patients with COPD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of The Frailty Will Be evaluated Using The Frailty Criteria by Fried</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty will be identified by the presence of three or more of the following criteria unintentional weight loss (10 Ibs in past year), weakness (grip strength), self-reported exhaustion, slow walking speed and low physical activity. Patients with three or more of the criteria present were classified as frail.</description>

    <measure>Balance Assessment Using Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Reach Test measures how far patient can reach forward from a normal relaxed stance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition Using MoCA-Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be evaluated with the secreening tool the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA is a 30-point screening tool.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perform activities of daily living (ADL) will be evaluated using the Glittre ADL-test</measure>
    <time_frame>1st Day</time_frame>
    <description>Glittre ADL-test was designed specifically to assess the functional limitation in patients with COPD. Glittre ADL-test time will be considered the main outcome variable, and will be recorded in minutes (metric).</description>
