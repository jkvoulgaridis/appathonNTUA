  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial attempts to explore the treatment outcome of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) for
      major depressive episode. Half of the participants will receive MST, while the other half
      will receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT).

      Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the
      substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from
      the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area
      of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition,
      electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only
      capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate
      focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the
      capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive
      side effects.
