  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In early phase tendinopathy, isometric exercises are seen as ideal to provide pain relief to
      patients. This approach is mainly based on a paper by Rio et al (2016), where they found that
      isometric exercises of a certain load magnitude and time (5 repetitions of 45 second hold at
      70% of maximum) gave 100% pain relief for 45 minutes in patients with patellar tendinopathy.
      This then helps patients to perform their more heavy load exercises during rehabilitation,
      which would otherwise be too painful.

      Unfortunately, the study of Rio et al only consisted of 6 participants, and recent papers
      have contradicted the findings. In Achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciopathy and lateral
      elbow tendinopathy, the pain relief was not consistently present, with &quot;responders&quot; and
      &quot;non-responders&quot; being found in these studies. Also, a study yet to be published (poster at
      conference), replicating Rio et al, also found a heterogeneous response, debunking the &quot;one
      size fits all&quot; approach that seemed to work.

      However, in our understanding, isometric exercises do have a crucial role in early
      tendinopathy management, but the way the exercise is performed, in which position, what
      magnitude of load, time under tension, … has an important influence. The same protocol (5
      repetitions of 45 second hold at 70% of maximum) might lead to big inter-individual
      differences. Therefore, there might be a mechanistic reason why some patients respond, and
      others do not.

      Fortunately, the P.I. of this current trial application has recently optimized an
      ultrasound-based method to quantify local tendon deformation during exercises. The main
      purpose of this trial is therefore to evaluate the local tendon deformation pattern of
      patients with tendinopathy during isometric exercises and evaluate whether there is an
      interindividual difference in pattern between &quot;responders&quot; and &quot;non-responders&quot;.
