  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test whether a once-weekly injection of abatacept will prevent
      the progression of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) to a more severe form.To evaluate the
      effectiveness of a 24-week course of treatment with abatacept plus usual care versus usual
      care to prevent polyarthritis (≥5 joints), uveitis, or treatment with other systemic
      medication within 18 months of randomization in children with recent-onset limited JIA.
