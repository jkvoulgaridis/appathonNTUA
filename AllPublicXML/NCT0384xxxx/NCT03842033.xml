  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test how good an app is in making asthma easier to
      manage for 372 adolescents/young adults. The app is a mobile version of the asthma action
      plan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aligns with our prior work targeting high-risk pediatric asthma
      populations in non-inner city environments by targeting adolescents at risk for future
      exacerbations from the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) at Arkansas Children's Hospital
      (ACH).

      We propose to conduct a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial with 372 adolescents with
      uncontrolled asthma to test the effectiveness of mAAP. mAAP provides real-time, personalized
      feedback, asthma education, and data logging/tracking capabilities.

    <intervention_model_description>We will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of 372 adolescents with uncontrolled mild-severe persistent asthma to examine the effectiveness of a personalized, interactive PEAKmAAP application with and without PCP data sharing in reducing asthma morbidity. The trial includes 3 groups: 1) a group utilizing the PEAKmAAP alone, 2) a group utilizing the PEAKmAAP with PCP data sharing (PEAKmAAP-DS), and 3) a usual care NutriMapgroup utilizing an application with daily non-asthma related reminders for attention control.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ACT is a validated five question survey that computes a number indicating asthma control. The instrument range is 1-25, with 25 indication well controlled asthma. A score of less than or equal 19 is considered poorly controlled asthma. We plan to prospectively assess clinical outcomes including (ACT) score, Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI) score, acute healthcare utilization, medication use, and lung function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CASI quantify disease severity by looking at impairment risk and the amount of medication needed to maintain control. The CASI includes the major domains of asthma namely, impairment, as measured by day and night symptoms, along with albuterol use; and risk measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percent predicted and past asthma exacerbations, both of which are important predictors of future exacerbations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We plan to utilize the PedsQOL instrument to measure participant quality of life. The PedQOL is a modular approach to measuring health related quality of life in children and adolescents with acute chronic health conditions. The instrument has a disease specific module for asthma. The instrument access four scales: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mediators of Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence and asthma self-efficacy. Pharmacy profiles will be accessed to determine medication adherence. We plan to administer the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQOL) to determine asthma self-efficacy. We plan to evaluate if participants are more likely to receive step up therapy per the national asthma guidelines.</description>

    <description>The Pulmonary Education and Asthma Knowledge mobile asthma action plan (PEAKmAAP) group will use a mobile &quot;app&quot; that will help manage asthma. Participants will be asked to enter asthma symptoms or peak flow every day. The PEAKmAAP guides participants when to take asthma medicines and sends reminders to take their medicines every day. mAAP also provides reminders when to get asthma medicines refilled. Asthma education messages and video links are also pushed via notification.</description>
