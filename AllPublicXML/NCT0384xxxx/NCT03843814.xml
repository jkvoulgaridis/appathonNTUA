    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the pattern of changes in various parts of the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) studies that patients have done to help plan their radiation therapy
      and to evaluate the effects of therapy.

      The MRI of the brain is one of the major ways a participant's doctors determine how to treat
      a participant's tumor and if the participant's tumor is growing or not. In this study the
      investigators want to learn if new sequences added to the MRI that the investigators are
      already getting to guide partipants' radiation treatment can be analyzed to help make better
      treatment decisions. MRI sequences that examine the composition and structure of the tissues
      in the brain in a different way will be obtained. These are called called Amide Proton
      Transfer (APT) and Diffusion Weighted MRI.

      These scans will first be performed at the time of participants' radiation plannings scan
      done before treatment and near the end of the course of radiation treatments. This will allow
      the study team to investigate if there are changes in these sequences before radiation
      treatment and to see if using these MRI studies will allow us to better plan radiation
      treatments for patients in the future. This pre-treatment scan will be done at the same time
      as participants' standard radiation planning MRI, but will cause the scan to take longer.
      Participants will also have an extra MRI during one of the last 5 days of the planned 28-33
      radiation treatments that are standardly used. This additional scan will not include
      administration of injected contrast agents, and would occur on a day when participants are
      also coming in for radiation. This scan will be compared with the first scan. The
      investigators will determine whether these changes may predict later long term outcome of
      treatment for patients. Patients who enroll in this study will get all of the standard
      therapy they would get for their tumor whether or not they participate in this study. There
      is no extra or different therapy given.

      The investigators anticipate that the radiation treatment volumes created using APT will
      largely overlap with the conventional plan but will be distinct at the margins. Disease
      failure is more likely to occur in areas with APT abnormalities suggestive of active tumor.
      In patients that have failure outside the contrast enhancing area, the region of failure will
      be predicted by regions of increased APT activity. Current MRI sequences do not allow for
      prediction of regions of recurrence or progression, or distinguish between tumor, pressure,
      or surgical injury as the cause of FLAIR/T2 abnormalities. Disease failure is more likely to
      occur in areas with APT abnormalities suggestive of active tumor. In patients that have
      failure outside the contrast enhancing area, the region of failure will be predicted by
      regions of increased APT activity. Current MRI sequences do not allow for prediction of
      regions of recurrence or progression, or distinguish between tumor, pressure, or surgical
      injury as the cause of FLAIR/T2 abnormalities. Volume containing elevated APT signal may be
      associated with outcome (survival). In an exploratory analysis, the investigators will
      evaluate whether there are characteristic patterns that should be prospectively studied in a
      larger trial.

      Currently, all brain tumors are routinely evaluated using gadolinium contrast-enhanced
      (Gd-CE) MRI, in combination with T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
      MRI, which are used to determine the extent of tumor involvement to guide treatments, and to
      assess therapeutic response. However, Gd-CE only depicts disruption of the blood brain
      barrier and is not specific for tumor activity. Therefore, standard MRI may not be optimal in
      defining the true extent of tumor, defining as abnormal areas that may contain only edema
      related to mass effect or surgery and miss tumor extensions that do not sufficiently disrupt
      the blood-brain-barrier. In addition, in the setting of radiation therapy which also disrupts
      the blood brain barrier, it does not serve as an early marker of tumor response.

      The primary goal of the current observational study is to explore whether Amide Proton
      Transfer (APT) imaging can better determine the extent of tumor involvement. APT signal is
      created by mobile cytoplasmic proteins, which are increased in malignant brain tumors and
      have been found in preclinical and clinical studies to be associated with a high APT weighted
      signal in glioma. Such imaging may provide information that may improve the ability of MR
      imaging to guide targeting of radiotherapy. In particular, it may (1) detect tumor bearing
      brain that is not contrast enhancing on the standard brain MRI scan for patients with high
      grade glioma and/or (2) fail to confirm tumor in areas of brain identified as abnormal on
      standard MRI. The investigators will also explore patterns of disease failure in patients
      with malignant gliomas to validate the observations, and whether such imaging may predict
      outcome.

      Similar questions may be important in the therapy of low grade glioma, and an exploratory
      informational cohort of patients with this less common diagnosis will be accrued during the
      study period to inform decisions about whether further study is desirable.

      A second APT image will be obtained during the final week of treatment for enrolled patients
      to determine whether changes in APT signal occur, and whether there is evidence that this may
      be prognostic for treatment success or failure when correlated with progression free survival
      and survival outcome. Currently, there is no imaging method to assess tumor response and
      predict outcome within the first several months as a result of the confounding effect of
      radiation on both the tumor and surrounding brain. In addition, standard brief apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) MRI sequences will be performed as part of the pretreatment
      imaging and the end of treatment scan as an additional potential early imaging biomarker that
      may be a part of multiparametric assessment of response to radiotherapy as identified in
      preclinical studies performed at Johns Hopkins.

      These first steps may form the basis for possible future studies to assess new approaches to
      radiation planning for patients with brain cancer.

    <description>Participants will have the standard MRI of the brain that is performed for radiation planning for brain tumors.
Addition of the additional MRI sequences to the standard MRI before radiation therapy. This typically adds 10-15 minutes to the length of the scan.
An additional MRI scan to be scheduled during one of the final five radiation treatment days that would not otherwise occur. There will be no contrast injection as part of this second scan. This may typically take 40-45 minutes.
Collection of information about participants' tumor, including copies of their MRIs and later outcome of treatment.</description>
