  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implanted cardiac devices are commonly used to treat a wide variety of heart diseases,
      including arrhythmias, cardiac resynchronization in select heart failure patients, and life
      threatening heart rhythms. Approximately 400,000 devices are implanted annually, and more
      than 3 million patients currently have implanted devices1.

      Implanted cardiac devices are made to 2 components, the can and the leads. The can contains
      the electric circuits and the battery, which must be replaced every 5-10 years. The can is
      connected to external leads which pass through the subclavian vein, and depending on the
      device, into the vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and/or coronary sinus. Leads
      typically last longer than the battery, and are simply reconnected to a new can at the time
      of replacement.

      Certain clinical situations necessitate lead removal, including pocket infection, device
      related endocarditis, venous stenosis or occlusion with the need for new access, and removal
      of abandoned or malfunctioning leads. Removing the leads is technically difficult due to
      fibrosis, and requires specialized equipment. Compared to lead implantation, extraction of
      leads is relatively rare, with a life time risk of a device patient needing an extraction in
      the 1-5% range. Given that this is a relatively rare procedure and is only done at a few
      centers, documentation of our experiences with lead extraction can lead to ongoing
      improvements in both procedural techniques and outcomes.

      Study Procedures

      This is a retrospective review of data on patient characteristics (such as age, gender,
      co-morbidities), procedure specifications and indications, and outcomes of lead extraction
      done at OHSU.

      Patients who have undergone either pacemaker or defibrillator lead extraction will have their
      charts reviewed for the desired data, which will then be compiled into a database. All
      procedures will be part of routine clinical care.

      Data Analysis:

      This is an observational registry study; there are no primary or secondary outcomes. Data
      will be analyzed to determine patient and procedural characteristics, procedure indications,
      complications and outcomes
