  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is associated with many health benefits for individuals with type 1
      diabetes. However, immediate and delayed exercise-induced hypoglycemia is frequent and thus
      the main limiting factor for physical activity practice in this population. To reduce the
      risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia, two types of adjustments may be considered by patients
      with type 1 diabetes : pre-meal insulin-dose reduction and carbohydrate supplements. Few
      evidence-based recommendations are available for patients using insulin pump to adjust
      insulin doses in order to limit exercise-induced hypoglycemia. The objective of this study is
      to address the magnitude of the needed reduction during two types of frequently practiced
      exercise (continuous vs. interval exercise) known to have a different impact on blood glucose
      reduction.

      Each study participant will be admitted at IRCM one to five days after sensor insertion.
      Participants will be asked to change their pump catheter 24 to 36 hours prior to the
      intervention visit. On the day of the intervention visit, participants will have a
      standardized lunch (45-65g CHO for females and 60-80g CHO for males ) at 12:00 and will be
      asked not to eat afterwards (except for correction of hypoglycemia). Participants will be
      asked not to exercise (excluding light exercise such as walking or taking the stairs) the day
      before and the day of the intervention visit. Participants will be asked not to consume
      caffeine after 12:00 the day of the intervention. The day before the intervention and the day
      of the intervention, participants will be asked to refrain from alcohol consumption.
      Participants will be blinded to the strategy used during the exercise intervention.
      Participants will be admitted at IRCM at 14:00. A catheter will be installed for plasma
      glucose and insulin measurements. At 14:30, insulin basal rate will be reduced by 40% or 80%
      depending of randomization. At 15:30, participants will undertake a continuous exercise
      (60-minute exercise on the ergocycle at 60% of VO2 peak) or an interval exercise (2-minutes
      alternating intervals at 85% and 50% of VO2peak for 50-minutes, with 5-minutes at 45% VO2peak
      at the start and the end of exercise). As a safety measure, plasma glucose will be measured
      every 10 minutes. Participants will be blinded to sensor glucose levels as well as plasma
      glucose measurements. At 17:00, the participant will be discharged if glucose levels are
      above 5.5 mmol/L. Participants will be asked to eat a standardized dinner at home (45-65g CHO
      for females and 60-80g CHO for males). Participants will have the freedom to choose at what
      time they wish to have dinner but it will have to be similar on all intervention visits.
