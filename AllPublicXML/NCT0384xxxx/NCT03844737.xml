  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VisuXL® is a medical device that is effective in various ocular surface disorders (ocular
      dryness, changes in the continuity of the corneal and conjunctival surface, environmental
      stress, exposure to UV and ionizing radiation, prolonged use of videoterminals, etc.).
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to demonstrate that the clinical benefits and quality of
      life of the swimmers, exposed for a long time to water added with chlorine, are strongly
      linked to the unique composition of the long-term VisuXL® medical device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, monocentric, open-label, randomized study of superiority, with the
      untreated eye considered as a comparator for the eye treated with VisuXL®, to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of VisuXL® in professional water-polo athletes exposed to pool water after
      VisuXL® ocular instillations for 2 months. Considered the category of subjects to study, the
      study is to be considered a fact-finding pilot study in a particular category of subjects.

      The study population will be enrolled only after having signed the informed consent; in each
      enrolled subject, only one eye will be treated with VisuXL®, while the other no, as will be
      considered the comparator, so the two randomized groups will be divided by treated eyes:

        -  Untreated control eye

        -  Eye treated with VisuXL®

      Each enrolled subject will be instructed to instill, TID, 1-2 drops of VisuXL® always in the
      same eye during the entire study, according to the present modality:

        -  Morning

        -  Before training (at least one hour before entering the pool)

        -  After training (maximum one hour after the end of the activity) Subjects will continue
           to instil 1-2 drops of VisuXL®, TID, always in the same eye, even in days without
           training (including weekends).
