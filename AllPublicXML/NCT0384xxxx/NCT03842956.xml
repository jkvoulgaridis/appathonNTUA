  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled single-center trial, based on a non-inferiority
      design, the outcome of the treatment of patients are analyzed, whereas in half of the cases
      the wounds are left open and the other ones are primary wound closed after local debridement
      after Fixator-Extern is removed. Although this topic embodies a daily business, there is no
      standard to be found in literature regarding the treatment of pin sites with closure by
      either primary or secondary intent.

    <textblock>
      In the orthopedic department of the Kantonsspital Lucerne (LUKS) after removal of the
      external fixator, the pin sites at the tibia and the back of the foot are routinely treated
      with primary wound closure. An international survey carried out by the LUKS shows that in
      comparison to our standard treatment the majority of surgeons left the pin sites open during
      the healing process. In order to find a standardized method to treat pin sites we conduct a
      randomized controlled trial, in which half of the pin site wounds are left open and the other
      half are treated by primary wound closure after local debridement (Treatment of the first
      pin-side will be randomized, then alternated treatment of the consecutive pin-sides). All
      patients of the study participants are treated within a fixed pre- and postoperative
      protocol, which includes antibiotic prophylaxis with a single shot of Cefazolin 2g
      intravenously 30 minutes prior to surgery. The postoperative pin care includes daily
      inspection of the pin sites, cleaning the secondary healing wound with Ringerfundin © and
      disinfection with Betadine ©. Primary wound closures are dressed with dry gaze bandage. The
      following out-patient treatment is provided either by a Spitex support, the family doctor or
      by the patient himself, depending on the patients compliance. Regular follow-up consultations
      at 2, 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after surgery ensure an adequate surveillance of the healing
      process, whereas the examining doctor at the second and last consultation was kept in dark
      what therapy was chosen for pin sites of the patient. To objectify the clinical progress the
      pin sites are photo documented at the consultations at week 2 and 52.
