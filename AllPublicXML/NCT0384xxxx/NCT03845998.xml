  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The laryngeal mask is widely used in general anesthesia in children. Selection of an
      appropriately sized laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is critical to ensure safe and effective use
      of the device. In children, the appropriate size of the LMA to be used is usually determined
      by the patient's weight. Up to now, this is the gold standard method, but the weight-related
      technique is not always possible. The patient's weight is sometimes unknown or medical staff
      do not remember the relationship between weight and size. Moreover, there are no constant
      correlations between laryngeal airways and body indices such as height and weight, so that
      the standard method could cause an inappropriate size of laryngeal mask airway to be chosen.
      Researchers from Spain introduced a new technique to determine the size of the LMA in
      children by choosing the LMA that best matched the combined widths of the patient's index,
      middle and ring fingers, but needs to be formally evaluated in clinical application. In order
      to compare the application effects of two methods (weight-related and three-fingers), we
      designed a research plan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The allocation sequence is generated by computer random number generation, and the allocation
      is placed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes by a non-investigator. Enrolment
      and data collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care
      of the patients. The treating clinicians are not blinded to the assignment group, but all
      other staff involved in both the collection and collation of data are blinded to group
      allocation. The primary measurement is the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) at the
      recommended intracuff pressure. The secondary measurements included insertion time,
      fibreoptic view grade, insufficient ventilation, and the occurrence of complications such as
      postoperative sore throat. The sample size was calculated to be 390 by a statistical software
      based on previous research results. The continuous variables were expressed as means Â±
      standard deviation (SD) whereas categorical variables were expressed as frequency and
      percentage for data description. P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

    <description>With the child's head in a neutral position, OLP was measured by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 l/minute, recording the airway pressure at which equilibrium was reached. Gas leakage was evaluated at the mouth (by detecting an audible sound) and stomach (by epigastric auscultation).</description>
