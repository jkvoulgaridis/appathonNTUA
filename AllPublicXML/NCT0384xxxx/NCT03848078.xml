  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre randomized non-inferiority trial investigating the (cost-)effectiveness of
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) versus regular punch biopsy in the diagnosis and subtyping
      of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin cancer incidence rises worldwide due to high sun exposure and ageing. Basal cell
      carcinoma (BCC) is the most prevalent form, with a lifetime risk of 16-20% in the
      Netherlands. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing and subtyping BCC is a punch biopsy.
      Since this technique is invasive, new non-invasive diagnostic methods have been developed,
      including optical coherence tomography (OCT). In patients with clinical and dermoscopic
      suspicion of BCC, OCT makes it possible to confirm and subtype BCC with high confidence,
      thereby obviating the need for a punch biopsy in a substantial part of patients. Hence, BCC
      diagnosis and treatment can be accomplished in one day. As a result, patients experience less
      distress and costs can be saved. By discussing diagnosis and treatment with the patient
      directly, care can be provided more efficiently, preventing treatment delay and saving extra
      hospital visits. The investigators hypothesize that the use of OCT is a cost-effective
      strategy when compared to regular care (always punch biopsy). However, it is important to
      evaluate whether an alternative OCT guided diagnostic approach does not lead to an
      unacceptable increase in risk of recurrent BCC.

    <description>The design of the study also enables evaluation of the ability of OCT to discriminate between BCC and non-BCC and between BCC subtypes (superficial, nodular and infiltrative BCC) using punch biopsy as reference standard. Diagnostic performance will be expressed as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value.

    <description>In the intervention arm, OCT imaging is performed which will take about 3 minutes. The decision on the most adequate treatment strategy will be based directly on the OCT diagnosis, but only when there is certainty about the presence of BCC and BCC subtype according to the OCT diagnosis. A 'safety' biopsy will be performed after the OCT scan. In patients where the OCT diagnosis leaves doubt or it is certain that there is no BCC, a biopsy will be taken anyway and the treatment decision will be based on the result of this punch biopsy.</description>

    <description>OCT is an imaging technique, which is able to produce real-time, in vivo, cross-sectional images of lesions with a depth of 1,5-2 mm. OCT imaging is based on light-interferometry, calculating the interference of an optical beam reflected by the tissue with a reference. In such ways, microscopic details of lesions and tissues can be visualized. This information can be used to identify a lesion as BCC, and to specify the subtype. Therefore, we assume that the use of the OCT might reduce the number of biopsies and the accompanying morbidity.
The investigator scans 6mm of skin with the OCT (30 seconds) and decides whether the lesion is a BCC or not.</description>
