      Tongji-Ezhou study (TJEZ) is a prospective cohort study launched at 2013 in EZhou city, Hubei
      province, with the goal of recruiting and assessing 10,000 individuals and then following
      them for at least 2 decades. In addition, blood samples would be collected every 3-5 years
      among 6000 of them to investigate the nutritional biomarkers and potential determinants of
      chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular
      disease.

      Blood, urine, and DNA were collected by clinicians during the morning after the examinees.
      Blood samples (5 ml) are collected with ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid anticoagulant tube
      from peripheral vessels. Plasma, buffy coat, and red blood cell layer are separated. The
      samples are stored at -80°C for future analyses. All bio-samples will be tracked through an
      electronic database.
