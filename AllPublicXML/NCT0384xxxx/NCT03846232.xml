  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the T1rho/BBRC2017 study is to assess the capability of the MRI sequences
      T1rho + multicomponent T2 relaxation analysis of detecting abnormal cerebral protein
      deposition in AD patients in comparison with an age-matched cognitively healthy control
      group. Both the AD and control groups will had previously undergone amyloid PET imaging to
      confirm/discard cerebral proteinopathy in the context of other research studies.

        Participating subjects are (1) patients with AD with typical presentation for which an
        amyloid PET is already available or (2) age-matched cognitively healthy adults that,
        similarly, have available amyloid PET imaging information.

        Specifically, a subsample of 40 cognitively healthy adult participants from the ALFA study
        [25] (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01835717; Estudi 45-65 FPM/2012) will be
        selected to undergo the present study on the basis of their cerebral amyloidosis as
        assessed by PET in the context of the PET FLUTEMETAMOL-FDG/BBRC2015 study (20 negative and
        20 positive). AD patients (n=20) will be recruited from collaborating institutions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 60 years

          -  Informed, written consent form

          -  To fully satisfy the criteria for one of the two following 2 groups:

               1. for the AD group:

                    -  Diagnosed with AD as defined per the International Working Group IWG 2
                       criteria (fulfilling core clinical criteria plus positive core AD CSF
                       biomarkers): Light to mild AD defined by Mini-Mental State Examination
                       (MMSE) score between 15 and 27 (included).

                    -  Documented positive visual read (as per EMA-approved procedures for each
                       respective tracer) of an amyloid PET scan, which in the opinion of the
                       principal investigator is consistent with a diagnosis of AD in the last 24
                       months.

                    -  Lumbar puncture with core AD CSF biomarkers available in the last 24 months.

               2. For the cognitively health group:

                    -  Normal cognition as defined by the ALFA study cognitive workup (Molinuevo et
                       al. 2016).

        CONFIDENTIAL 17

          -  [18F]-Flutemetamol PET scan performed in the context of the PET
             FLUTEMETAMOL-FDG/BBRC2015 study in the last 24 months.

          -  Lumbar puncture with core AD CSF biomarkers preferably available in the last 24
             months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past or present history of major brain disorders other than MCI or AD.

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning or conditions precluding entry into the scanners
             (e.g. morbid obesity, claustrophobia, etc.).

          -  Participation in a clinical trial for a disease modifying drug for AD.

          -  Hypoperfusion pattern not consistent with AD diagnosis, as assessed by ASL.
