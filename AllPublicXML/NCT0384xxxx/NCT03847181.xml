  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This population-based study will identify patients with rapid and irregular heartbeat which
      is not due to a fault with the heart valves (non-valvular atrial fibrillation) who initiate
      rivaroxaban, apixaban or warfarin as treatment for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation
      (SPAF). Purpose of the study is to learn more about the safety and how well the drugs
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and warfarin work in patients appropriately and inappropriately
      receiving standard and reduced doses of each drug for reducing the risk of stroke in atrial
      fibrillation. Real world data from routine general practice stored in the primary care
      database in the UK, The Health Improvement Network (THIN), will be used for investigation.

      Primary objectives are to assess the safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban, apixaban and
      warfarin based on the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhagic strokes (safety) and
      ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and myocardial infarction (effectiveness). Secondary
      objectives comprise the assessment of the mentioned risks in subpopulations of patients with
      renal impairment or diabetes, mortality rates, and drug utilisation as well as patient
      characteristics before and after the first intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic stroke.
