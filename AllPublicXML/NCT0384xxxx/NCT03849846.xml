  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NutriQuébec is a web-based prospective cohort study aiming to monitor and analyse the
      evolution of Québec population eating habits through annual questionnaires. The recruitment
      and retention of participants with low socioeconomic status (SES), known to be more hard to
      reach and recruit into health studies, will be major challenges in obtaining a representative
      sample of the Québec population.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the behavioural, normative and control beliefs of
      individuals from low SES regarding a hypothetical participation in the NutriQuébec study.
      Their preferences regarding recruitment methods as well as their concerns about the security,
      use and share of data will also be identified.

      Four moderator facilitated focus groups will be conducted in community centres (n=28
      participants). The focus groups will be recorded, transcribed and coded by two coders using
      NVivo.

      Four focus groups will be conducted in three community centers (n=6 to 8 participants/group;
      n=28 participants). First, all participants will read and sign the consent form. They will
      also complete a sociodemographic questionnaire. Then, the moderator will conduct the
      discussion using a semi-structured interview guide, based on the construct of the Theory of
      Planned Behaviour. The interview guide has been developed to identify the beliefs that
      determine the participants' attitudes (advantages/disadvantages), subjective norms
      (approval/disapproval of important others) and perceived behavioral control
      (facilitators/barriers) related to a hypothetical participation in the NutriQuébec study. The
      participants will also be questioned about their preferences regarding the recruitment as
      well as their concerns about the security, use and share of data. The focus groups will be
      recorded and transcribed. Two coders will perform the codification independently using NVivo
      10.
