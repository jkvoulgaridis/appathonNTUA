    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effects of task-based biofeedback training compared with
      home-based programs on sensorimotor function and quality of life for diabetic patients with
      neuropathic hands. The investigators hypothesize that the task-based biofeedback training
      might have significant effectiveness for restoration of sensory function, precision pinch
      performance, hand dexterity and life quality for patients with diabetic neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      Hand tendon gliding exercises allow both the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis
      tendons of hands to achieve the greatest range of motion. Thus, in conjunction with resistive
      exercises for diabetic hands, such exercises are considered an appropriate home-based
      training method that has positive effects on various diabetic hand problems in terms of
      regaining smooth tendon excursion, preventing joint contracture, and reducing intrinsic
      muscle tightness. Different from the biomechanical approach to deal with hand problems, a
      biofeedback system can be used to provide real-time information on improper movements during
      task-based training intended to enhance either performance quality or accuracy. This study
      aims to analyze the difference in treatment effects between a computerized evaluation and a
      re-education biofeedback system that provides interactive sensorimotor information to shape
      the optimized coordinated pinch pattern of a hand and a home-based tendon gliding exercise
      program in conjunction with resistive exercise with weekly supervision on sensorimotor
      function and quality of life for diabetic patients. The investigators hypothesize the
      task-based biofeedback training using the biofeedback training system could have significant
      effectiveness for restoration of sensory function, precision pinch performance, hand
      dexterity and life quality for patients with diabetic neuropathy.

    <measure>Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A touch-pressure threshold test with 20 nylon filaments with varying degrees of thickness is conducted. The examiner presses the filament at a 90° angle against the skin until it bows. When the patient indicates a response, the result is recorded. The filament is labeled with a numerical marking, which is a log to the base ten of the force in tenths of a milligram. The threshold value is the finest filament to which the subject correctly responds.</description>

    <description>Before the biofeedback training, the baseline pinch force detected from a pinch-holding-up activity is recorded to set the target level according to the baseline data. With the aim for improving the performance, a 94% peak force value detected at the baseline is set as the target threshold for the training. Each participant attends a 30-minute biofeedback protocol per session, two times a week for six to eight weeks. Once the pinch force value exceeds the target range, visual and auditory cues are provided to inform the subjects to modify the performance.</description>
