  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in participants with advanced breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer to
      investigate the dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ipatasertib in
      combination with rucaparib. The study consists of two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1)
      in participants with previously treated advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate
      cancer and a Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2) in participants with advanced prostate cancer who
      have had at least one line of prior therapy with second-generation androgen-receptor
      (AR)-targeted agents (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide).

      There are two parts in the study. A Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) in participants with
      previously treated advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate cancer. There will be
      a 7-day run-in period with ipatasertib alone prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. After the completion of
      the ipatasertib run-in period, participants will begin Cycle 1, Day 1 of the ipatasertib and
      rucaparib combination treatment. Each cycle has 28 days. Participants will be split into 4
      cohorts: Dose Level 1 group - 300 mg ipatasertib once daily (QD) + 400 mg rucaparib twice
      daily (BID), Dose Level 2a: 300 mg ipatasertib QD + 600 mg rucaparib BID, Dose Level 2b: 400
      mg ipatasertib QD + 400 mg rucaparib BID, Dose Level 3: 400 mg ipatasertib QD + 600 mg
      rucaparib BID

      A Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2) - The recommended dose identified in Part 1 (highest dose
      level of ipatasertib and rucaparib with an acceptable safety profile and less than one-third
      of participants experience a dose limiting toxicity) will be evaluated in participants with
      advanced prostate cancer who have had at least one line of prior therapy with
      second-generation androgen-receptor (AR)-targeted agents (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide,
      apalutamide).
