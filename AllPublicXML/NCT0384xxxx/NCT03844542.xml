      The investigators prospective, randomized adult clinical trial investigates the therapeutic
      efficacy of early therapeutic plasma exchange as adjunct treatment to standard therapy in

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients are eligible for inclusion if they have sepsis with refractory shock
             and evidence of organ failure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who are pregnant

          -  Persons who are incarcerated

          -  Acute surgical catastrophe without potential for intervention or source control

          -  Cardiac arrest with unknown neurologic status, including patients being treated with
             therapeutic hypothermia

          -  Presence of severe acute brain injury or severe dementia

          -  Cardiogenic, neurogenic, obstructive, or post-cardiotomy shock

          -  Acute pancreatitis with no established source of infection

          -  Diabetic ketoacidosis as primary pathology

               -  Note: Septic patients who develop DKA are eligible for inclusion. However,
                  patients in whom organ dysfunction and hemodynamic instability are due primarily
                  to volume depletion and acidosis from DKA should not be included.

          -  Need for mechanical circulatory support

          -  Prolonged acute illness with &gt; 24 hours of pressor needs at enrollment and/or end
             organ damage with further care deemed to be &quot;futile.&quot;

               -  NOTE: The time resets if a new inciting event leads to SAMOF.

               -  For example, if a patient has sepsis stabilized but requires operative
                  intervention for source control within the initial 24 hours of admission and
                  returns to the ICU with SAMOF, the patient is again eligible for randomization
                  for the next 24 hours.

          -  Bedbound state or poor baseline functional status with ECOG performance status score â‰¥
             3

          -  Underlying terminal illness/malignancy with &lt; 6 months life expectancy

          -  Advanced chronic liver disease/cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension

          -  Asplenia

          -  HIV with HARRT non-compliance
