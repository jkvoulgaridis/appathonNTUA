      This study is a non-randomized, open, multiple administration and dose escalation phase 1
      clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics
      Characteristics of multiple oral administration of LPM3480226 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors., determine its dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose, and initially
      observe its clinical effectiveness, and explore the metabolites in plasma after
      administration.

      The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of LPM3480226
      tablets after oral administration to patients with advanced solid tumors, and to determine
      the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LPM3480226.

      A non-randomized, open, multiple dose escalation design was used with a total of five dose
      groups. The starting dose was 50 mg and the subsequent dose was increased according to the
      protocol of 100 mg , 200 mg , 400 mg , 600mg. Starting from the low-dose group, each subject
      received only one dose of the drug, and the next dose group study could only be performed if
      the previous dose group was completed and safe tolerance was confirmed.

      Subjects were given the corresponding doses in the order，bid，28 days as a cycle, to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of multiple doses. After confirming the safety and tolerance of
      the dose group in the first administration cycle, the administration was continued for
      another cycle according to the dose, and the subjects were evaluated for the efficacy after
      the two-cycle administration, and the subjects who did not have disease progression and is
      well tolerated and the investigator believes that continued treatment can benefit, the
      patient may continue to receive the dose of the drug on a voluntary basis, with a maximum
      dose of no more than one year.
