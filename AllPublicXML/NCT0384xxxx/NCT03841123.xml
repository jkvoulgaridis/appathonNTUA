      This randomized field trial will be performed at the maternity wards of Friendly Hospitals
      Initiative in three regions of Brazil: North, Northeast and South. After delivery, mothers
      who accepted to participate in the study will be randomized into control and intervention
      groups.It will be performed a weekly block randomization to prevent the contamination of
      information among mothers of different groups in the same facility. The intervention mothers
      will be advised not to give added sugar and ultra-processed foods during the first year of
      life, including a leaflet with colored images as a reminder for mothers. The control group
      mothers will not receive the study intervention but will be have all the routine health
      assistance of the maternity. At 6 months and 12 months, mothers of both groups will be
      visited in their homes and dietary evaluation and anthropometric measurements of their babies
      will be assessed. At 12 months of age the infants will have dental examinations and
      hemoglobin concentration through a capillary blood test.

    <description>The intervention will consist of an individualized, face-to-face, 20 to 30 minute counseling session to mothers by trained health workers who will address healthy eating practices during the first two years of life. A printed, colorful and illustrated material will be used to assist mothers in appropriate food choices, mainly to avoid the introduction of sugar and ultra-processed foods. In addition, they will receive a booklet which addresses the &quot;Ten Steps of Healthy Feeding for children from Birth to Two years of life&quot;. The research team will focus on Step2: &quot;Do not give added sugar or foods with added sugar&quot;, and Step8:&quot;Do not offer ultra-processed foods as candies and soft drinks&quot;. To reinforce the intervention, mothers will receive telephone calls up to the infant reach six months.</description>
