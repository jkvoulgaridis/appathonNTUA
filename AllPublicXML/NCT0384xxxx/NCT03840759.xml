  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to acute ordinary wards in a medical center in Southern Taiwan from an
      elder-integrated outpatient department or emergency room from January 2017 to December 2017
      were included if they met the following criteria: (i) age 65 years or older, (ii) Barthel
      index score ≦60 and (iii) with at least one of the following geriatric syndromes: unsteady
      gait or easy-to-fall ( falls ≧ 2 in last 1 year), malnutrition with Mini Nutritional
      Assessment-Short Form screening score &lt; 12, urinary incontinence, pressure sores, dementia,
      delirium, depression, polypharmacy (≧8 medications), and excessive utilization of healthcare
      facilities (admission≧2, visit Emergency≧2, or visit outpatient department≧12 in one month).
      Patients were excluded if they were in a vegetative state, under palliative care or
      terminally ill and suffering from acute illness needing to be transferred to or cared for in
      the Intensive Care Unit.

      Human participant approval was obtained from the Chang Gung Medical Foundation Institutional
      Review Board before data collection. Participants were recruited from the ordinary wards by
      research assistants who screened the admission list every morning if they met the inclusion
      criteria. Then, the detail of the research was explained to the patients and families. They
      were allowed to choose to be in the control group or the intervention group. After the
      participants and or family agreed, informed consent was signed. For those who were
      cognitively impaired or suffered from dementia, informed consent was signed by their relative
      or partner. For the intervention group, a geriatric physician was consulted and
      recommendations were made by the geriatric consultant after a complete geriatric assessment.
      Besides the geriatric physician, the investigator's multidisciplinary team included a social
      worker, nutritionist and physical therapist. In the control group, the participants only
      received routine hospital care and no geriatric physician was consulted.

      Participants were recruited from the ordinary wards by research assistants who screened the
      admission list every morning if they met the inclusion criteria. Then, the detail of the
      research was explained to the patients and families. They were allowed to choose to be in the
      control group or the intervention group. After the participants and or family agreed,
      informed consent was signed. For those who were cognitively impaired or suffered from
      dementia, informed consent was signed by their relative or partner. For the intervention
      group, a geriatric physician was consulted and recommendations were made by the geriatric
      consultant after a complete CGA. The CGA includes the assessment of depression, dementia,
      physical performance of Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and nutrition using Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDC-15), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Barthel Index (BI), and Mini
      Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA®-SF) respectively. Besides the geriatric physician,
      our multidisciplinary team included a social worker, nutritionist and physical therapist. In
      the control group, the participants only received routine hospital care and no geriatric
      physician was consulted. The case manager nurse filed the participant's baseline data and
      clinical problems. After discharge, the participant's condition was assessed via telephone in
      the first, third and six months after discharge.
