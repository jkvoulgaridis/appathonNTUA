  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicentric cohort study including 166 patients with symptomatic aortic
      stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

      - The main objective is to determine whether the high residual platelet reactivity rates in
      patients undergoing TAVI is associated with the occurrence of clinical and / or subclinical
      prosthetic valve thrombosis measured by echocardiography and multi-slice computerized
      tomography
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose of the study, platelet reactivity will be measured with the commercial kit
      PLT VASP/P2Y12 at baseline, 1day and 3 months postprocedure.

      Secondary objectives include: -Determine the variability of platelet aggregation measured at
      baseline before the procedure, 1-day post-procedure and at 3-6 and 1 year follow-up.

        -  To determine whether the pro-thrombotic inflammatory response measured by the CD14 + and
           CD16 + quantification observed after TAVI is associated with the appearance of
           prosthetic thrombosis.

        -  To evaluate the Correlation of Von Willebrand factor levels and distribution of Von
           Willebrand multimers with the appearance of prosthetic thrombosis at baseline before the
           procedure, 1-day post-procedure and at 3, 6 months follow-up and 1 year.

        -  To determine whether the residual platelet reactivity rates in patients undergoing TAVI
           are associated with the occurrence of clinical events, at baseline before the procedure,
           1-day post-procedure and at 3,6 months follow-up and 1 year

        -  To evaluate the clinical factors associated with the appearance of early prosthetic
           thrombosis.
