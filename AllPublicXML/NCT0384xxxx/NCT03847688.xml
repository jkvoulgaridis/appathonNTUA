  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating illness. It affects a person's
      family and personal relationships, work, education, and life. It changes sleeping and eating
      habits and significantly impairs patients' general health. The disorder affects Veterans more
      than the general population, both as an isolated illness and in conjunction with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidality. Symptoms in a notable proportion of
      patients (~30%) do not respond to behavioral and pharmacological interventions, and new
      treatments are in great need. One such treatment, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
      has been cleared by Food and Drug Administration for treatment in MDD. TMS is effective in
      around 60% of patients with treatment-resistant MDD but is associated with significant
      financial and time burden. Further insights into the neurobiological effects of TMS and
      markers for functional recovery prediction and treatment progression are of great value.

      The goal of this proposal is to use human electrophysiology (electroencephalography,
      hereafter EEG, in particular) and machine learning to predict treatment response in
      candidates for TMS treatment and also study TMS's mechanism of action. Doing so has several
      benefits for patients, as prediction of treatment helps providers in screening out the
      patients for whom TMS is ineffective and understanding the mechanism allows us to refine and
      individualize the treatment.

      The investigators will recruit 35 patients with treatment-resistant MDD and record resting
      state EEG signal with a dense electrode array before and after a 6-week clinical course of
      TMS treatment. The investigators will use machine learning (Sparse regressions) to predict
      treatment outcome using functional connectivity (Coherence) maps derived from the EEG signal.
      The investigators also will use classifiers to track changes in functional connectivity
      through the course of treatment. Based on our preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize
      that weaker functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex (where the stimulation is
      delivered) and parietal/posterior midline sites predict better response to treatment and that
      TMS treatment will enhance these connections.

      The data collected here would be used as a seed and preliminary data for future federal (NIH
      and the VA) career development awards which will focus on the use of EEG to better understand
      brain function and neuromodulation treatments.

        Adult Veterans, of any sex, ages 18-65, with MDD will participate in the study at the
        Providence VAMC. The patients will be referred by their providers for standard
        neuromodulation treatment, as happens currently.
