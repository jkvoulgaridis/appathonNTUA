  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A dedicated pre-transition class, as proposed in this study, could help facilitate a smooth
      transition between pediatric and adult diabetes care. The innovation in this study is that
      these classes are an opportunity for the patients and their families to meet with the Adult
      Diabetes Team consisting of a diabetologist, RD and CDE, prior to the transition of care.
      Having met them would then increase the likelihood of compliance with the Adult clinic
      visits.
