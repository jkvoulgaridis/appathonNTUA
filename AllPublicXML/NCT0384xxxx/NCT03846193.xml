      This is an open label first in human Phase 1/2 multicentre study of GT005 in subjects with
      Macular Atrophy due to AMD
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, the dose response and efficacy (anatomical and
      functional visual outcomes) of two doses of GT005 administered as a single subretinal
      injection in genetically defined subjects with Macular Atrophy due to Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (AMD). Following consent, subjects will undergo a number of ophthalmic and
      clinical assessments to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study. Once eligibility is
      confirmed, subjects will be enrolled, receive treatment, and will be followed for 48 weeks.

             amblyopia [either eye]

          6. Any other significant ocular or non-ocular disease/disorder which, in the opinion of
