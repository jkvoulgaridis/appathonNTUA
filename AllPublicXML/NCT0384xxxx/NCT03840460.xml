  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several types of early pre-cancerous lesions found in the pancreas which have the
      potential to develop into pancreatic cancer. Although different patients' pancreatic cancers
      or pre-cancerous pancreatic lesions have many similarities we believe that subtle differences
      can affect how they behave and therefore influence individual patient outcomes. Many factors
      may account for the differences seen in pancreatic lesion behaviour, for example molecular
      and genetic differences (the DNA and RNA present which control how a cell grows and divides),
      differences in how the immune system responds to the lesion, differences in the environment
      immediately around the lesion in the pancreas, known as the tumour microenvironment and
      differences in the micro-organisms which colonize a particular patient, known as their
      microbiota .

      This project studies the molecular makeup of pancreatic lesions and their microenvironment at
      various stages (from pre-cancerous lesions all the way through to more advanced disease) to
      see if we can use this information to divide patients into different groups whose lesions may
      behave in similar ways. We will be trying to find out if there are molecular reasons why some
      patients respond to particular treatments when others do not, why some patients experience
      more toxicity with particular treatments and why some patients' disease behaves particularly
      aggressively when other patients' disease does not. We will also be investigating the
      particular micro-organisms colonizing individual patients to see if these impact a patient's
      outcome. Understanding what makes one person's pancreatic lesion behave differently to
      another's could lead to better treatment, where a personalized therapeutic strategy could be
      applied for every single patient.

      The main objective is to describe the incidence and distribution of tumour biomarkers, and to
      identify molecular subgroups from a multicentre series of patients who are investigated for
      and subsequently diagnosed with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or a precursor lesion or a
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour.

      The secondary objective is to determine disease control rate (CR, PR and SD &gt;24 weeks),
      duration of response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in locally
      advanced / metastatic patients or relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in
      early stage curative / pre-cursor lesion patients, associated with the identified molecular
      subtypes of PDAC pancreatic cancer and relevant anti-cancer therapies.

      To identify molecular predictors of response or toxicity to standard of care anti-cancer
      therapies in PDAC/PanNET. The study also has a number of exploratory objectives listed below:

      Depending on the number of patients assessable for each biomarker of interest and the
      prevalence of biomarker expression in the study population, exploratory endpoints of this
      study include:

        1. Evaluation of the predictive value of biomarker expression (i.e. the ability of a
           biomarker to predict responsiveness or resistance to a specific anti-cancer treatment).

        2. Evaluation of the prognostic value of biomarker expression (i.e. the ability of a
           biomarker to predict outcome regardless of a specific anti-cancer treatment).

        3. Comparison of biomarker expression among IPMN, MCN, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
           evaluation of their prognostic value.
