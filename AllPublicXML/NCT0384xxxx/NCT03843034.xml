  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases cause a decreased endometrial receptivity during the implantation window,
      most likely changing the endometrial cytokines pattern due to dysregulation of the
      inflammatory processes.Therefore, endometrial cytokine profiles will be compared in women
      with autoimmune disease and normal, fertile women.

      The collected endometrial tissue and blood samples will be examined for the cytokines
      profiling using commercially available ELISA kits.

      The sample size was calculated choosing, as primary outcome, changes in endometrial LIF
      concentration between the disease and control Group, which is our main goal. Given a type I
      error of 5%, a maximum of 21 women are needed for each Group to reach the desired power of
      80% to detect the least changes in concentrations.
