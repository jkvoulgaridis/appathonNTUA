  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective collection of pre-defined parameters on the surgical treatment of
      male erectile dysfunction using Penile Prosthesis Implants (PPIs). The data collection will
      be undertaken from multiple centres in Europe. The participation will be by open invitation
      from the European Association of Urology (EAU) Section of Genitourinary Reconstructive
      Surgeons (ESGURS) to all its members, along with other urologists undertaking these
      procedures.

      There will be no restriction on the number of patients enrolled per centre as long as they
      are consecutive. The aim is to have a long term collection of the dataset from as many
      centres as possible. An initial assessment for the robustness of the data collection and
      first clinical evaluation of the data collected will be performed 1 and 2 years after
      recruitment of the first patient by a nominated steering committee. Thereafter, the
      evaluations will be performed every 2 years until the end of Registry (10 years after the
      first patient was enrolled).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction score</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Satisfaction score is defined as the mean patient satisfaction score as indicated by the Modified Patient EDITS Questionnaire. All items on the Patient EDITS will be scored from zero (no satisfaction or dissatisfaction) to four (high satisfaction). The mean satisfaction score for each patient will be calculated. To place scores in an easily interpretable metric, each mean score will be multiplied by 25 so that EDITS scores could range from a low of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to a high of 100 extremely high treatment satisfaction).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partner Satisfaction score</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Partner Satisfaction score is defined as the mean partner satisfaction score as indicated by the Modified Partner EDITS Questionnaire. All items on the Partner EDITS will be scored from zero (no satisfaction or dissatisfaction) to four (high satisfaction). The mean satisfaction score for the partner will be calculated. To place scores in an easily interpretable metric, each mean score will be multiplied by 25 so that EDITS scores could range from a low of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to a high of 100 extremely high treatment satisfaction).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction rate</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients with an EDITS score ≥ 50 compared to the total number of patients</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partner satisfaction rate</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The number of partners with an EDITS score ≥ 50 compared to the total number of partners</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall time being satisfied with treatment since implantation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The interval from the date of regaining a patient EDITS score of 50 or more until the time of EDITS score of less than 50</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Index of Erectile Function - 5 (IIEF short form/SHIM) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The IIEF-5 score is the sum of the ordinal responses to five items; thus, the score can range from 0 to 25. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) severity can be classified into the following five categories based on IIEF-5 scores; severe (0-7), moderate (8-11), mild to moderate (12-16), mild (17-21), and no ED (22- 25). Mean IIEF-5 scores will be calculated at the indicated time points and numbers / percentages of patients in the different ED severity categories. Also change in IIEF-5 score compared to baseline will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) questions 2 and 3</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>For SEP question 2 and 3, scores are percentage of yes responses relative to number of sexual attempts/encounters. Proportions of yes responses will be treated as continuous variables. Post-operative results will also be compared to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Results of the EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire will be analyzed as described in the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L user guide. Post-operative results will also be compared to baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>at week 12, year 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>QoLSPP is a 16-item questionnaire, with 4 domains: the functional, relational, social and personal domain. Responses are structured according to a six-point Likert scale, in most cases ranging from &quot;never&quot; (0) to &quot;always&quot; (5), where higher values represent more positive responses. Individual item scores will be analyzed as well as domain scores.</description>
