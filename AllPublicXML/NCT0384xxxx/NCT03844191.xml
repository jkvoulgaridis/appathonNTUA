  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess tolerability of the weight-adjusted dose of RUC-4 (mg/kg)
      required to achieve 80% or more inhibition of the initial slope of platelet aggregation to 20
      ÂµM ADP by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) within 15 minutes of SC administration of
      RUC-4 with return toward baseline values within 4 hours in healthy volunteers and subjects on
      aspirin with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In the Dose Expansion Part, VerifyNow
      PRUTest will be used to measure platelet aggregation in addition to LTA.

      Since the goal of RUC-4 therapy is to achieve maximal antiplatelet therapy as rapidly as
      possible, first the tolerability of the weight-adjusted dose (mg/kg) that inhibits
      ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 80% or more in 5 of 6 healthy volunteers will be
      identified. A similar dose escalation will be subsequently performed in subjects with CAD who
      are taking aspirin. To facilitate administration using a single weight-adjusted (mg/kg) dose
      for a defined group of subjects weighing between 55 and 120 kg, the study will also evaluate
      the safety and biologic effect on platelet aggregation of the weight adjusted (mg/kg) dose
      when administered to subjects with weights at either end of this range.
