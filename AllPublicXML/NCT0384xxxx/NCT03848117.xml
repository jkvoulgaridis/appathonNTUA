  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a pain causing musculoskeletal disease which mainly occurs due
      to the over exertion or over use of extensors of wrist mainly ECRB and pain is felt at the
      origin of common extensor tendon. This study was focused to assess the effectiveness of
      cyriax approach and mulligan approach to improve the functional status of sub acute lateral
      epicondylitis patients through patient related tennis elbow evaluation form.

    <textblock>
      A total of 39 athletes with knee pain were recruited and randomly divided into two groups. 30
      subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were part of this trial, 15 in each group.The
      data was collected through general demographic questionnaire, PRTEE questionnaire to
      determine the level of pain and functional disability and Hand grip strength chart to measure
      grip strength while having epicondylitis.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: Cyriax Approach group and Mulligan approach group. A coin was flipped at start of data collection for the first patient to be assigned odd number and included in cyriax group. Later on odd and even numbered patients were included in specific group. Additionally, data was collected from lateral epicondylitis patients visiting the DHQ Hospital Bahawalnagar.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>For any given subject in group 1, PRTEE pain and functional disability evaluations and Hand grip strength were completed on the same day. Then each subject in 1st group completed 4 weeks of physical therapy sessions which were aimed to decrease pain, increase functional activity level, and improve hand grip strength. Each subject was evaluated for changes in symptoms on 1st week, 2nd week, 3rd week and 4th week.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cyriax approach i.e. DTF massage and Mill's manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Each patient in group I i.e. Cyriax group was given 20-minute session. Each session started in sitting position and initially deep transverse friction massage was done at lateral compartment of the elbow joint and immediately after that mill's manipulation at elbow joint with flexion at wrist joint in pronated arm position. This session was repeated three times a week for one month (Total 12 sessions/ one month).</description>

    <intervention_name>Mulligan approach i.e. Taping and MWM</intervention_name>
    <description>Each patient in group II i.e. Mulligan group was given 30 to 45-minute session. Each session started in sitting position and it included mobilization with movement which was given in such a way that initially lateral glide at elbow joint was performed and after holding it, I asked the patient to make a fist and open the fist. In this way, I repeated this procedure 36 times and after 12 repetitions, a short rest period was given. Taping was applied after mobilization around the elbow joint over extensor carpi radialis muscles. This session was repeated three times a week for one month (Total 12 sessions/ one month).</description>
