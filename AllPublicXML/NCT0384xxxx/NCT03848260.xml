  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a real-time wearable device based on the principle of magnetic force for temporary
      management of lagophthalmos, and evaluate its efficacy and safety, including synchronous
      blinks and eye closure, blurred vision, foreign body sensation over cornea or eyeball,
      burning or hot sensation over facial skin, and erythema or pruritus over eyelid, by
      performing a human trial on patients with lagophthalmos.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The wearable system includes a near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diode (SMT910, Epitex Inc,
      Kyoto, Japan) and receiver (PD15-22C TR8, Everlight Electronics Corporation, New Taipei City,
      Taiwan), a permanent electromagnetic actuator (JNP-12/12, Joint Magnetic Technology
      Corporation, Shenzhen, China), an iron sheet affixed to the paralytic upper eyelid, and a
      bio-signal acquisition module together with a power supply unit providing a wired connection
      to the NIR sensor and permanent electromagnetic actuator. The palpebral gap was measured
      before and after the wearing of the device. The efficacy of the device prototype was assessed
      in terms of synchronous blinks and eye closure. Subjective sensation and complications were
      assessed by blurred vision, foreign body sensation over cornea or eyeball, burning or hot
      sensation over facial skin, and erythema or pruritus over eyelid. After the completion of the
      study procedure, eyelid skin condition was examined.
