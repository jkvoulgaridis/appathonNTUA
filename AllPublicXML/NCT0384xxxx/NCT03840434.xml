    <textblock>
      Chronic Compartment Syndrome (CCS) is a pathology that affects more specifically subjects
      exposed to repeated movements, particularly in a professional life or sports. The diagnosis
      is difficult and often delayed.

      Currently, the reference technique is invasive. It consists of measuring by a intramuscular
      puncture (IMP) pressure in the offending compartment early after effort (usually between 1
      and 5 minutes post-exercise). A value greater than or equal to 30 mmHg in the first 5 minutes
      is used as a diagnostic criterion for CCS.

      Other less invasive techniques (scintigraphy) exist but are subject to certain discordances
      of interpretation. The advent of new assessment tools, like the MyotonPRO, pave the way for a
      non-invasive diagnostic approach.

      Patients referred for suspected chronic compartment syndrome causing will be included.

      After signing the consent, the subject will have a clinical and paraclinical examination.
      Age, sex, height, weight, side of clinical symptomatology will be collected. Medical history
      current treatments will also be noted. Once the consent is collected, the patient performs,
      according to the data of the literature and service habits a stress test aimed at triggering
      the painful symptomatology associated with post-exercise IMP and MyotonPRO measurements as
      the same time.
