  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 1358894
      in plasma when given as oral single dose together with multiple oral doses of itraconazole
      (Test, T) as compared to when given alone as oral single dose (Reference, R).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood pressure
             (BP), Pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Willingness to comply with contraception requirements. Subjects who are sexually
             active must use adequate contraception with their female partner throughout the study
             and until 1 month after the last administration of trial medication. Adequate methods
             are:

               -  Sexual abstinence or

               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening (with medical assessment
                  of the surgical success) or

               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subject's female partner or

               -  The use of condoms, if the female partner uses an adequate contraception method
                  in addition, e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal contraception (e.g.
                  implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that started at
                  least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method (e.g.
                  diaphragm with spermicide) Unprotected sexual intercourse with a female partner
                  is not allowed throughout the study and until 1 month after the last
                  administration of trial medication.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood pressure (BP), Pulse rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and assessed as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

             (ESR)≥15 millimeters/h, liver or kidney parameter above ULN, or any other laboratory
             value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be of clinical
             relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

             interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered

             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Any lifetime history of suicidal behaviour (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt,
             aborted attempt, or preparatory acts or behaviour)
