  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate an intervention delivered by community health workers for older
      adults with signs of cognitive impairment, mobility loss, and depression in the rural primary
      care setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population of the United States is aging rapidly, and the populations of Vermont (VT),
      New Hampshire (NH), and Maine (ME) are among the oldest in the nation. There is a need to
      develop and disseminate interventions to prevent functional decline in older adults, defined
      as difficulty completing daily activities independently. Cognitive impairment, depressive
      symptoms, and mobility loss are three common syndromes identified in primary care that
      contribute to functional decline in older adults. Evidence-based interventions can address
      early stages of these three conditions; however older adults in rural communities may have
      particular difficulty accessing interventions due to limited health and social services.
      Community health workers (CHWs) offer a potential strategy to address gaps in care and
      deliver interventions to vulnerable older adults in rural communities.

      The overarching goal of this study is to conduct a pilot investigation of a CHW-delivered
      intervention to slow progression of functional decline among at-risk older adults. Using
      qualitative and quantitative methods, this pilot study will: 1) Evaluate whether a
      multicomponent intervention delivered by CHWs for rural older adults at risk for functional
      decline is feasible to deliver and acceptable to older adults and their primary care teams;
      and 2) Explore the effectiveness of combined Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance (TJQMBB),
      behavioral activation (BA), and resource navigation in slowing functional decline among older
      adults with co-occurring early impairments in cognition, mood, and mobility.

      Older adults who are at high risk for functional decline will be recruited from partnering
      primary care sites (two intervention sites in VT and ME, and one comparison site in NH) based
      on results from the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV), which incorporates screening for
      cognitive impairment, depression, and falls risk, as well as provider referral and chart
      review. CHWs will be trained to deliver a 6-month intervention incorporating two
      evidence-based interventions that target cognition, depressive symptoms, and mobility (TJQMBB
      and behavioral activation), and resource navigation to address unmet social needs that may
      create barriers. Feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness will be assessed
      through a combination of qualitative interviews, standardized questionnaires, physical
      measurements, and surveys.

    <description>TJQMBB is an evidence-based, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended, group falls prevention program based in Tai Chi that has been shown to reduce falls risk, improve physical function, and improve cognition. The program is delivered in 1-hour sessions twice weekly over 24 weeks, with the first 12 weeks spent learning the basic Tai Ji Quan forms and the second 12 weeks focused on variations in practice that progressively increase physical and cognitive demands. A physical therapist at Dartmouth is an authorized TJQMBB trainer and will train the CHWs to deliver the intervention and provide remote supervision monthly.</description>

    <description>CHWs will assess participants' unmet psychosocial needs and assist them in identifying and connecting them with resources to address these needs.Types of assistance may include identifying transportation services, assisting with applications for benefits, linking participants to Meals on Wheels and other local food resources, and connecting participants to community programs for older adults. We expect that participant needs and services delivered will vary and acknowledge that this intervention component will not be standardized due to the nature of this work.</description>
