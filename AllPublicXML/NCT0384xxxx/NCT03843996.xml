  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular donor sites on the scalp for hair transplantation will be treated with studied
      products post harvest.

      A randomized side of the scalp will be treated with Stratamed, the other side with standard
      clinical practice.

      Subjects will be assessed live immediately post treatment and in 2 sessions during the
      healing phase post harvest. Subjects will also complete subject reported outcome
      questionnaires at home between study visits.

    <intervention_model_description>This Phase IV, post-marketing, single center study will be a single-blind, within subject split scalp efficacy comparison of Stratamed® and standard clinical practice, Bacitracin, post FUE. Twenty subjects desiring to undergo FUE for hair restoration will apply Stratamed® on one half of the donor area on the back of the scalp and Bacitracin on the other side at least twice a day for a week post procedure. The side of the scalp receiving each product will be randomized, and the evaluating physician will be blinded. Subjects will be evaluated, photographed, and will fill out subject reported questionnaires live at days 1 (+1) and 7 (±1) post procedure. Subjects will also fill out the subject reported questionnaires at home in between live study visits (days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).</intervention_model_description>
