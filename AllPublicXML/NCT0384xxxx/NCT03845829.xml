    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of in-situ
      laser-assisted fenestration on the left subclavian artery during the TEVAR procedure for Type
      B Aortic Dissection (TBAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, prospective study. All patients with type B aortic dissection
      (TBAD) present with the proximal tear site located approximately close to the left subclavian
      artery and a reconstruction of the left subclavian artery is necessary are included in the
      present study. During the procedure of thoracic artery endovascular repair (TEVAR), the left
      subclavian artery will be reconstructed with laser-assisted fenestration and the fenestrated
      stent will be fluency (BD company).
