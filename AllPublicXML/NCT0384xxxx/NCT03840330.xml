    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the adaptations on the functional capacity and cardiovascular in elderly
      after a physical activity program circuit training. The participants were divided into three
      groups: Circuit training based on high-intensity interval training group (HIICT), Circuit
      training at moderate intensity group (MICT) and Control group (CG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three groups of participants (circuit training based on high-intensity interval training,
      circuit training at moderate intensity and not training group) will enter the study. The
      intervention will consist of a physical exercise program in day centers.

      Intensity progression will be encouraged according to the rate of perceived exertion.
      Progression of exertion will be &quot;very hard&quot;, &quot;extremely hard&quot; and &quot;maximal exertion&quot; for HIT
      group, and &quot;light&quot;, &quot;somewhat hard&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; for group. Assessment will be undertaken at
      two-time points: baseline and after 16 weeks of exercise training.

      Assessment will include VO2 peak, functional capacity, health-related quality of life,
      cognitive state and daily physical activity.

    <description>Physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire. The PASE is designed to assess physical activity in older persons. The total PASE score was computed by multiplying the amount of time spent in each activity (hours/week) or participation (yes/no) in an activity by empirically derived item weights and summing over all activities. PASE scores for this study ranged from 0 to 756 with higher scores indicating more physical activity.</description>
