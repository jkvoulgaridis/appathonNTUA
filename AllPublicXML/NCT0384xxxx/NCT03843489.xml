  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to validate the oxygen saturation (SpO2) accuracy of
      various pulse oximetry systems and sensors (new designs and/or reprocessed) during non-motion
      conditions as compared to arterial blood samples, drawn in the normal course of patient care,
      assessed by CO-Oximetry in neonates and infants. The primary end goal is to provide
      supporting documentation for the SpO2 accuracy of these pulse oximetry systems. The secondary
      end goal is to provide data for evaluation of clinical impact of measured to calculated SaO2
      and related issues.

      FDA Guidance for pulse oximeters (March 4, 2013), section 4.1.2, In vivo testing for SpO2
      accuracy for neonates, calls for the devices to be first tested in adults during hypoxia
      tests with arterial samples compared to measured oxygen saturation. This has been previously
      completed on the devices that will be tested in this protocol. In order to verify safe
      clinical performance in the neonate, the FDA then requires testing using neonatal arterial
      samples that are collected in the normal course of care; which is the primary purpose of this
      protocol. As a secondary purpose the data will be utilized to evaluate the impact of
      calculated oxygen saturation versus measured oxygen saturation and related issues.

      Neonates/infants who will have an arterial line or sheath placed in the normal course of care
      will be included in this study. The pulse oximeter sensor must be placed on the
      Neonates/infant's foot or hand. Neonates who either have repaired PDA but are having the
      placement of the sensor on the foot (which will be arterial blood only) will be allowed as
      long as other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.

    <intervention_model_description>Hospital staff will place the pulse oximeter sensor(s) on one or both hand or feet of the neonate/infant and start the pulse oximeter data collection computer to record continuously. Each time an arterial CO-Oximeter sample is collected the data collection file will be marked by pressing the file marker key on the data collection computer. Information from each arterial CO-Oximeter sample will be written on the CRF. The arterial sample will always be measured in the reference co-oximeter. The sample may also be measured in the currently used AVOX 1000E.
This study will only use arterial blood samples that are taken in the normal course of care; the sample size of the blood draw will not be altered for this study (sample size will not be increased from the normal course of care for any portion of this study).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An oximeter is a device used to transmit radiation at a known wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation. Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by clinicians in everyday situations to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the measurement, the pulse oximeter can provide non-invasive real time information.</description>
