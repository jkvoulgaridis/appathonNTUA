  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of tDCS as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy is a novel approach but one that is
      grounded in a growing evidence-base.The primary objective of this research is to provide
      preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of tDCS as an adjunct treatment to pharmacotherapy
      for smoking cessation. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of active tDCS to the
      left DLPFC will improve the effectiveness of varenicline as reflected by higher quit rates at
      end of treatment compared to the sham group. Smoking status will be biochemically confirmed
      at various time points using expired cotinine measures. Furthermore, the investigators will
      be collecting neuroimaging (fMRI) data as well as measures of attentional bias to explore the
      neurological and physiological correlates from using adjunct tDCS and varenicline therapy.

      While varenicline on its own is the most effective medication for smoking cessation,
      long-term abstinence is still relatively poor. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of adjunct active tDCS with varenicline in treating tobacco
      dependence. This study is a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial where 50
      daily dependent treatment seeking smokers will be recruited at the Nicotine Dependence Clinic
      in Toronto, Canada. Participants will be receiving twelve weeks of varenicline treatment (1mg
      b.i.d.) and randomized 1:1 to either active tDCS (active: 20 minutes at 2 mA) or sham tDCS
      (30 seconds at 2 mA, 19.5 minutes at 0 mA), daily (M-F) for the first 2 weeks and then every
      2 weeks for the next 10 weeks. There will be 2 fMRI scans at baseline and 1 scan at
      end-of-treatment. Eye-tracking viewing tests will be conducted at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12
      and at 6 months follow up. During the 6 month follow-up, participants will be answering
      questions regarding their smoking behaviour and craving. Smoking status will be biochemically
      confirmed at each study visit using expired cotinine.
