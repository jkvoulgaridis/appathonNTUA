  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators intend to assess the feasibility of surfactant administration
      via a thin catheter using a specially adapted video laryngoscope, with a groove designed to
      allow insertion of an endovascular catheter without the use of other instruments in the oral
      cavity (forceps ect.). The laryngoscope is of Peak Medic Ltd, Netania, Israel.

      A prospective study to assess the safety and efficacy of surfactant administration via thin
      catheter using a specially adapted VNscope, originally used for endotracheal intubation and
      adapted for the administration of surfactant without the placement of an endotracheal tube.

      Once neonates present respiratory distress, the adapted scope will be used - clinical and
      outcome measures will be collected to asses the safety and efficacy of the use
