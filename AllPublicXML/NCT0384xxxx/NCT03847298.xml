  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this study was to evaluate physical fitness and physical activity levels of
      pediatric arrhythmia patients with pacemaker compared with their healthy peers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies in children with heart diseases suggest that physical activity levels are reduced
      relative to their peers, which in turn increases cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac
      rhythm problems. To the best of our knowledge, physical fitness and objectively measured
      physical activity levels of children with a pacemaker have not been studied. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate physical fitness and physical activity levels of pediatric arrhythmia
      patients with a pacemaker compared with their healthy peers.

      Investigators enrolled clinically stable pediatric patients and used the echocardiogram to
      evaluate cardiac functions of all patients. Physical fitness was assessed using the Munich
      Physical Fitness Test (MFT). The SenseWear Armband metabolic Holter device was used to record
      the physical activity level for consecutive 7 days.

    <description>The test consists of six different parameters, including balancing and bouncing (speed and coordination), accurate throw (speed and coordination), trunk flexibility, vertical jumping (power), hanging (endurance and strength), and step test (endurance, speed and coordination). After all the parameters are completed, the score of each parameter is calculated from the standardization chart according to age and sex. This total score is divided by the number of parameters and recorded as Munich total score. Physical fitness is classified according to scores as deficient (&lt;35), normal (36-45), satisfactory (46-55), good (56-65) and very good (&gt;66).</description>

    <description>Physical fitness was assessed using Munich Physical Fitness Test (MFT). The SenseWear Armband metabolic holter device was used to record the physical activity level for consecutive 7 days. The functional exercise capacity of the individuals was assessed by the six-minute walking test (6MWT) and cardiorespiratory capacity was assessed by maximal exercise test on the treadmill.</description>
