    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open label pilot clinical trial with two parallel arms aimed to
      compare the efficacy of Raltegravir (RAL) 1200mg QD vs Darunavir/Cobicistat (DRV-cb)
      800-150mg QD both in combination with alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) in patients with
      Human Inmunodefficiency Virus (HIV) infection and CD4&lt;200 cells/microL
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of two parallel arms to study the therapeutic success of 48 weeks,
      tolerability, immunological recovery, persistence of treatment, safety and results reported
      by the subject in severely immunocompromised HIV infected patients (with an initial CD4 count
      &lt;200 cells/μl) naive to antiretroviral therapy.

      Included subjects will be randomized two to one (2:1) to RAL 1200mg QD plus FTC/TAF or DRV/cb
      (800-150mg) plus FTC/TAF.

          -  HIV-1 infection.

          -  Naive to antiretroviral treatment.

          -  CD4 count at the beginning of the study &lt;200 cells/μl.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration ≥ 50 mL / min, according to the formula CKD-EPI.

          -  Grant Informed Consent in writing to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breastfeeding, pregnant or women in childbearing age who do not commit to maintain
             barrier contraceptive measures during the trial.

          -  Concomitant use of any drug with possible pharmacological interaction with the study
             drugs that it is advisable to &quot;avoid&quot; through the database for interactions at the
             University of Liverpool (www.hiv-druginteractions.org).

          -  Previous use of any antiretroviral for HIV infection.

          -  Resistance to the study drugs, or presence of any contraindication to use it. The
             inclusion in the study can be carried out before receiving the result of the
             resistance test. Once it is received, in case of presenting any mutation of resistance
             to drugs of the indicated regimen, the patient will be removed from the study and will
             be offered the best available treatment for their medical condition at that time.

          -  Therapies that include interferon, interleukin-2, cytotoxic chemotherapy or
             immunosuppressants at the entrance to the study.

          -  Current consumption of alcohol or other substances that at the discretion of the
             investigator may interfere with subject's treatment compliance.

          -  Subjects who currently participate in any other clinical trial using a research
             product, with the exception of studies in which the treatment studied has been stopped
             for more than 12 weeks.

          -  AIDS event in diagnosis of HIV infection or in the 3 months prior to the inclusion of
             the study.

          -  Suspected severe hepatopathy (grades B or C of the Child-Pugh classification), of any
             origin, according to the clinician.

          -  Any other clinical condition or previous treatment that, in the investigator's
             judgment, makes the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the
             dosage requirements.
