  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FT500 is an off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell product that can bridge innate and adaptive
      immunity, and has the potential to overcome multiple mechanisms of immune checkpoint
      inhibitor (ICI) resistance. The preclinical data provide compelling evidence supporting the
      clinical investigation of FT500 as monotherapy and in combination with ICI in subjects with
      advanced solid tumors.

    <time_frame>Day 29 and every 8 weeks thereafter through Day 366</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve PR or CR at any time on study. Tumor response will be assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST) or Response Evaluation Criteria In Lymphomas (RECIL). Only one or the other assessment criterion will be used to measure tumor response. This will depend upon whether solid tumors or lymphomas are being assessed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Diagnosis of the following, as per Regimen Cohort:

        1A. Regimen A: FT500 Monotherapy (Dose Escalation and Expansion): An advanced solid tumor
        malignancy, including lymphoma, in a subject who has failed or refused available
        FDA-approved therapies and is now a candidate for salvage therapy.

        1B. Regimen B: FT500 + ICI (Dose Escalation): An advanced solid tumor malignancy, including
        lymphomas, that has progressed on treatment with at least one ICI (ie, nivolumab,
        pembrolizumab or atezolizumab), in a subject who has also failed or refused other available
        approved therapies and is now a candidate for salvage therapy.

        1C. Regimen B: FT500 + ICI (Dose Expansion): An advanced solid tumor malignancy, including
        lymphomas, in a subject who is currently receiving nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab

             arthritis, Addison's disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma, Crohn's
             disease, ulcerative colitis), except for subjects with isolated vitiligo, atopic
