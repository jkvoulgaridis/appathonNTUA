    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRV-300 for 12 weeks
      in subjects with active ulcerative colitis.

      Subjects will receive either PRV-300 or placebo treatment. Each group will receive study drug
      over a total of 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week safety follow-up period.

      This is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study in adult subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Randomization will be
      stratified by Mayo score.

      Subjects will receive either PRV-300 or placebo treatment. Each group will receive study drug
      over a total of 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week safety follow-up period. The total duration
      of the study will be 20 weeks, excluding the screening period.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRV-300 for 12 weeks in
      subjects with active UC.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of PRV-300 for 12 weeks in subjects with
      active UC on:

        -  Pharmacodynamics: Changes in gene scores in colonic biopsies over the course of
           treatment.

        -  Pharmacokinetics: Peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) serum concentrations of PRV-300 in
           subjects with active UC.

        -  Immunogenicity: Immunogenicity of PRV-300 in subjects with active UC

        -  Endoscopic: Trends in endoscopic disease activity in subjects with active UC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be a man or woman aged 18-75 years, inclusive.

          2. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of UC at least 3 months before screening.

          3. Subject has moderately to severely active UC, defined as a Mayo score of 6 to 12,
             inclusive, at screening.

          4. Subject has a Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≥2 based on central read of the video
             sigmoidoscopy at screening.

          5. Subject must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has severe extensive colitis as evidenced by any of the following:

               1. Current hospitalization for the treatment of UC.

               2. Investigator judgment that the subject is likely to require a colectomy within 12
                  weeks of baseline.

               3. Temperature ≥37.8 ºC (oral or tympanic) and a heart rate &gt;90 bpm.

          7. History of colonic resection

          8. History of colonic mucosal high-grade dysplasia

             carcinoma in situ that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence; or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence within

             intolerance or hypersensitivity to any biologic medication or known allergies or
             clinically significant reactions to murine, chimeric, or human proteins, to monoclonal
             antibodies or antibody fragments; or a history of severe allergic reactions,
             angioedema, or anaphylaxis that might suggest risk for a reaction to a biologic agent.

         13. Subject has any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator, participation
             would not be in the best interest of the subject (eg, compromise the well-being) or
             that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.
