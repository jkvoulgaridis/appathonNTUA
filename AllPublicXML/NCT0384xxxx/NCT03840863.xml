  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people use energy drinks (EDs) regularly, but the overall health concerns are still
      unknown. There are many energy drink products that contain a mixture of caffeine and other
      energy-boosting ingredients and supplements which can affect parameters related to the heart,
      blood pressure and blood glucose. Several previous studies have shown that energy drinks may
      affect heart rhythm and blood pressure significantly. As energy drinks are sugar-sweetened
      beverages, long-term use may also affect the body's metabolism, including cholesterol, blood
      sugars, and weight.

      The purpose of this study is to learn if drinking energy drinks everyday may affect a
      person's cardiometabolic health.

    <textblock>
      The popularity of energy drinks (EDs) have increased over the last few decades due to their
      purported benefits as mental and physical performance enhancements. While caffeine is a major
      ingredient in most EDs (ranging from 80 mg to 500 mg per drink), they may also contain
      various supplements, such as guarana, taurine, ginseng, B vitamins, gluconolactone, yohimbe,
      carnitine, and bitter orange, as well as high amount of sugar (ranging from 25-50 grams). The
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cited that a daily intake of 400 mg
      caffeine (approximately 4-5 cups of coffee) in adults is generally safe and not associated
      with dangerous, negative effects. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
      Administration reported a doubling of emergency department visits involving EDs from 10,068
      visits in 2007 to 20,783 visits in 2011. Commonly reported adverse reactions include
      insomnia, nervousness, headache, tachycardia, and seizures. Currently, the health effects of
      long-term ED use remain unknown.

      This study is a proof-of-concept, prospective trial that aims to evaluate the effects of
      chronic ED consumption on cardiometabolic parameters in a healthy population. Subjects will
      consume two cans (16 oz.) of an energy drink daily for 4 weeks. The study will assess any
      changes in blood pressure (BP), electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters, blood glucose,
      cholesterol, weight, body mass index (BMI), and body fat composition before and after
      consuming EDs for 4 weeks.
