  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Populations with low socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to develop diseases across
      lifespan and are frequently underrepresented in large cohort studies. The aim of this study
      is to examine beliefs, preferences and concerns towards participating in an e-cohort
      prospective study on nutrition (NutriQuébec) among this population.

      A cross-sectional survey will be completed by 418 adults in the Province of Québec (Canada),
      including individuals with low SES (high school or less and gross annual household income &lt;
      $55,000 canadian). The survey is based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and assesses
      intention to participate in NutriQuébec as well as attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
      behavioural control. The survey also assesses preferences regarding the recruitment.

      A cross-sectional survey will be completed by 418 participants from several administrative
      regions of Québec (Canada). A special effort will be made to recruit men and women with low
      socioeconomic status (SES), but without rejecting adults from middle/high SES. First, 325
      adults from low SES (high school or less and gross annual household income &lt; $55,000
      canadian) and from several administrative regions of Québec will be identified by a survey
      firm. In addition, an e-mail mailing list from the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Food
      (INAF, Laval University) will be used to distribute the recruitment ad to complete our sample
      (n=93 from all SES).

      The survey is based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and assesses intention to participate
      in NutriQuébec as well as attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control. The
      salient beliefs underlying the determinants of individual's intention to participate in the
      NutriQuébec study most frequently cited in the focus groups (from a preliminary elicitation
      study: 2018-042 A-1/18-05-2018) were used to develop the survey questions. The survey also
      assesses the preferences regarding the recruitment. Sociodemographic questions are also
      asked.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The intention to participate to the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Intention will be calculated as the mean of three questions on a five point bipolar Likert scale. The three questions are: 1) I intend to participate in the NutriQuébec study : 1=very unlikely, 2=rather unlikely, 3=neither likely nor unlikely, 4=rather likely, 5=very likely; 2) The chances that I participate in the NutriQuébec study are : 1=very small, 2=rather small, 3=neither high nor small, 4=rather high, 5=very high; 3) I will participate in the NutriQuébec study: 1=very unlikely, 2=rather unlikely, 3=neither likely nor unlikely, 4=rather likely, 5=very likely). Thus, the mean score for intention ranges from 1 to 5, with higher values reflecting a greater likelihood for participation in the NutriQuébec study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The attitude related to a hypothetical participation in the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The attitude will be calculated as the mean of three questions on a five point bipolar Likert scale. The three questions are: 1) For me, participating in the NutriQuébec study would be...: 1=very unpleasant, 2=rather unpleasant, 3=neither pleasant nor unpleasant, 4=rather pleasant, 5=very pleasant; 2) For me, participating in the NutriQuébec study would be...: 1=very useless, 2=rather useless, 3=neither useful nor useless, 4=rather useful, 5=very useful; 3) For me, participating in the NutriQuébec study would be…: 1=very unsatisfactory, 2=rather unsatisfactory, 3=neither satisfactory nor unsatisfactory, 4=rather satisfactory, 5=very satisfactory. Thus, the mean score for attitude ranges from 1 to 5, with higher values reflecting a more positive attitude towards a participation in the NutriQuébec study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The subjective norm related to a hypothetical participation in the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective norm will be calculated as the mean of three questions on a five point bipolar Likert scale. The three questions are: 1) The people most important to me might think that I should participate in the NutriQuébec study:1=very unlikely, 2=rather unlikely, 3=neither likely nor unlikely, 4=rather likely, 5=very likely; 2) Many people I know may be interested in participating in the NutriQuébec study: 1=very unlikely, 2=rather unlikely, 3=neither likely nor unlikely, 4=rather likely, 5=very likely; 3) If I participated in the NutriQuébec study, most people who are important to me could...: 1= strongly disapprove, 2= slightly disapprove, 3=neither approve nor disapprove, 4= slightly approve, 5=strongly approve. Thus, the mean score for the subjective norm ranges from 1 to 5, with higher values representing perceptions that important others expect the participant to participating in the NutriQuébec study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The perceived behavioural control related to a hypothetical participation in the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The perceived behavioural control will be calculated by the mean of three questions on a five point bipolar Likert scale. The three questions are: 1) I feel able to participate in the NutriQuébec study: 1=very unlikely, 2=rather unlikely, 3=neither likely nor unlikely, 4=rather likely, 5=very likely; 2) I am confident that I can overcome any obstacles that may prevent me from participating in the NutriQuébec study: 1=very unlikely, 2=rather unlikely, 3=neither likely nor unlikely, 4=rather likely, 5=very likely; 3) For me, participating in the NutriQuébec study would be....: 1=very difficult, 2=rather difficult, 3=neither easy nor difficult, 4=rather easy, 5=very easy. Thus, the mean score for the perceived behavioural control ranges from 1 to 5, with higher values representing a greater perceived behavioural control towards a participation in the NutriQuébec study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The determinants to the intention to participate to the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Determinants to the intention to participate in the NutriQuébec study will be identified with a multiple linear regression using constructs that will be found significant in influencing the intention to participate in the NutriQuébec study (e.g. attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The preferences about the recruitment in the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The preferences about the recruitment in the NutriQuébec study will be assessed by a questionnaire. The question is: By which means of communication would advertising about the NutriQuébec study be most likely to capture your attention?: 1=Television, 2=Social networks (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.), 3=The Internet (other than social networks), 4=Newspapers, 5=Posters in public places (hospitals, community centres, etc.), 6=Flyers, 7=Postal mail, 8=None.</description>
