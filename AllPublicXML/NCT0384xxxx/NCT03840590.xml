      The primary aim of this study is

      - to explore the usefulness of Artificial Intelligence system in colonoscopy on adenoma
      detection rate (ADR). Other aims include to explore the data below when Artificial
      Intelligence is used.

      Mean adenomas detected per procedure, MAP Proximal Adenoma detection rate, pADR Polyp
      detection rate, PDR Proximal polyp detection rate, pPDR Mean polyps detected per procedure,
      MPP Withdrawal time, WT Cecal intubation rate, CIR Cecal intubation time, CIT

      Colorectal cancer is common in China. Most colorectal cancers happen when an adenoma becomes
      cancerous. Doctors use colonoscopy to look inside the colon and rectum and find adenomas and
      remove them. Removing adenomas is known to reduce the chances of a person developing
      colorectal cancers. The ability of colonoscopists finding adenomas varies, and there is a lot
      of researches into how to improve &quot;adenoma detection rates&quot;.

      A new AI system, called the CSK endoscopic diagnosis and treatment system has been designed
      to improve the rate of polyp detection at colonoscopy. Previous tests have shown that there
      is a significant improvement in detection of adenomas when the system is used. This study
      will randomize patients coming for colonoscopy to have their procedure performed as usual or
      as an AI-assisted colonoscopy. The investigators will record polyp and adenoma detection
      rates, duration of procedure, participant comfort levels, and complications. All patients
      referred for colonoscopy will be invited in 4 centers, recruiting a total of 800
      participants.

    <intervention_model_description>CSK endoscopic diagnosis and treatment system a new system of artificial intelligence. It is manufactured by Tianjin Yujin Limited in China. It is equipped with the endoscopic mainframe and has the access to the endoscopic video and image. When lesion-like objects appear in the real-time video, the system will alarm the examiners by sound.</intervention_model_description>
