  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the relationships and differences in PET-MRI brain imaging biomarkers
      of abnormal aging and behavioral measures in late life depression compared to healthy
      controls, and evaluates relationships and differences in the same imaging and behavioral
      measures following electroconvulsive therapy. The study tests the hypotheses that late-life
      depression will be associated with higher levels of accelerated aging and brain disease
      biomarkers, and that electroconvulsive therapy works by stimulating the reorganization of
      brain tissue.The data collected with contribute to improved knowledge about the neurobiology
      of late-life psychopathology and its treatment.

      This clinical study is a combined single-center, cohort study with a (1) cross-sectional arm
      evaluating relationships and differences in PET-MR imaging and behavioral measures in 64
      patients with late life depression (LLD) compared to 64 healthy controls, and (2) a
      longitudinal arm evaluating relationships and differences in imaging and behavioral measures
      in 20 patients receiving ECT as part of their normal clinical management. The study will
      utilise three PET tracers: (1) [11C]UCB-J, which targets the Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A
      receptor, to estimate synaptic density (2) [18F]MK-6240, which targets tau associated with
      neurofibrillary tangles, to assess the presence of tau pathology and (3) [18F]-Flutemetamol,
      which targets beta-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain, to assess the presence of cerebral
      amyloidosis. The main aim of the study is to clarify how hippocampal synaptic density, tau,
      amyloid and white matter lesions, relate to neuropsychological function, stress and ECT in
      late life depression.

        A consecutive series of hospital in-patients with late-life depression will be recruited
        from the Department of Old Age Psychiatry within the University Psychiatric Center, KU
        Leuven, Belgium. Healthy controls will be recruited from the community by researchers
        affiliated with the Department of Old Age Psychiatry Department &amp; Translational
        Neuropsychiatry using traditional means e.g. flyer. All participants will provide written
        informed consent prior to enrollment in the study in accordance with the Declaration of
        Helsinki.
