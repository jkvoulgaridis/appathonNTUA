  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is clearly the most important risk factor for AD and other dementias but, despite the
      amount of evidence supporting this fact, the exact mechanism that link ageing and AD is still
      unknown and, up to now, potential therapies for AD by targeting ageing have been poorly
      explored. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the link between ageing and AD
      by means of measuring in human blood those factors that have been found to be 'pro-youthful'
      (GDF-11, CSF2, TIMP-2, oxytocin) or 'pro-aging' (CCL2, CCL11, CCL19, Haptoglobine,
      B2-microglobuline) in experimental animal models, but have not been comprehensively studied
      in humans.

      In this proof-of-concept study these blood factors in extreme groups of age, namely young
      adults (18-25 yo) and old adults (≥70 yo) will be measured and the hypothesis of whether the
      'pro-youthful' and 'pro-ageing' blood factors change throughout age tested. In order to
      include a wider range of age, human umbilical cord blood and plasma from teenagers (which is
      already available from a previous study) will also be included.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to select the more promising blood factors and obtain data
      on the effect size of the differences that may allow us in the future to design a larger
      study.
