  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided diffuse optical tomography (DOT) has demonstrated its potential role in
      differentiating malignant and benign breast abnormalities and in predicting and monitoring
      the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response of breast cancer. This unique approach employs a
      commercial ultrasound (US) transducer and near infrared (NIR) optical imaging sensors mounted
      on a hand-held US probe. The co-registered US is used for lesion localization, and optical
      sensors are used for imaging tumor related vascularity.

    <description>-- BI-RADS scores without and then with optical data will be rendered by study radiologists. Radiologists will be blinded to the biopsy exam and pathology outcomes. Optical data including total Hemoglobin concentration will be provided by the bioengineering team. Specificity will be calculated as the proportion of subjects with a non- suspicious assessment, i.e. BIRADS 2 'benign' or BIRADS 3 'probably benign', divided by the denominator of subjects with no cancer demonstrated at biopsy. US-guided core biopsy results and subsequent surgical pathology (if present) will be entered by the study pathologist.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects â‰¥ 18 years old with ultrasound visible breast abnormalities (BI-RADS
             3*, 4A, 4B, 4C, and 5) referred for ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy or fine
             needle aspiration

             *note that while a BI-RADS 3 assessment is probably benign, a subset of patients with
             this assessment choose to undergo biopsy rather than follow up imaging).

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lesions located in the darkly pigmented nipple-areolar complex area

          -  Subjects with breast implants

          -  Abnormality in the mirror image location of the contralateral breast.

          -  Additional abnormalities in the same region of the breast that would be included in
             US-guided DOT imaging of the abnormality undergoing biopsy

          -  Previous breast irradiation of the mirror image location of the contralateral breast

          -  Lesions located at previous biopsy sites when biopsy occurred within the last six
             months.

          -  Small lesions of less than 1 cm located at skin or close to the skin

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Superficial abnormalities located entirely within (i.e. less than) 5mm of the
             overlying skin
