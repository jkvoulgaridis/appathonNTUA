  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Proprioception refers to the information's dynamic, sent to central nervous
      system by the free nerve endings and mechanoreceptors, about the biomechanics relationship
      for the joint tissue. The proprioceptive exercises show a big prophylactic action by
      musculoskeletal injuries. Among the top modalities of these exercises, it can be cited the
      Whole Body Vibration (WBV). Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate and
      compare the joint position sense, muscle electric activity and the postural sway in healthy
      individuals, before and after performing proprioceptive exercises on the vibrational platform
      or on a stable surface. Materials and Methods: 20 healthy young (24,85 + 4,27 years) were
      recruited, randomly divided into two groups, Control Group (GC) and Experimental Group (GE).
      Were realized evaluates of the proprioception by means of the joint position sense, the
      muscle electric activity of peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, vastus medialis and
      gluteus medium, and the postural sway by means of the postural sway before and after one
      assistance consisting of 4 sets of 60s with unipodal standing position on soil (GC) or on
      vibrational platform (GE).

      The individuals who composed the two groups performed the same exercise protocol, however, on
      different surfaces:

        -  Control group: stable surface.

        -  Experimental group - vibratory platform, make / model Nissan Fisio; orbital amplitude: 6
           mm; frequency: 30 Hz The exercises consisted of unipodal support on the non-dominant
           lower limb with the contralateral limb in a knee flexion near 90º. This exercise is a
           proprioceptive test that requires more than all joints and musculature of the lower
           limb, and is widely used in studies, for providing obvious clinical signs in the
           presence of dysfunctions.

      Activities were performed with the individual standing without using any type of footwear,
      remaining without support of the hands and with the upper limbs abducted to 90º with the
      fixed eye on the horizon line. Both groups performed 4 sets of 60s of sustained posture. In
      the intervals between the series there was the rest of 60s, remaining in orthostasis with
      support of the upper limbs.

    <description>The sense of joint position was achieved by means of the isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3) triggered in Proprioception mode. Then, the knee joint of each volunteer was slowly extended by the examiner, next to the equipment, at a speed of 20 ° per second, starting from an angle of 90 ° flexion, to the predetermined extension angles: 60 ° and 30 °. With vision occlusion, each volunteer was instructed to memorize the angle, within ten seconds, and then return to the same angle for three attempts.</description>

    <description>For the acquisition of electromyographic data, the 8-channel electromyograph was used. The muscles evaluated were the long fibular, the medial gastrocnemius, the vastus medialis and the gluteus medius. Sinak was added for 20 seconds.</description>

    <description>The signal for the ground reaction force was acquired by a force platform, which gave the values related to the Vertical Reaction Force of the volunteers. For this, the vertical force platform EMG System do Brasil, model BIOMEC400 was used.
During the evaluation, the subjects reproduced the unipodal support position over the non-dominant lower limb with the contralateral limb in a knee flexion near 90 ° within 20 seconds. The equipment was installed on a solid and flat base to avoid undesirable vibrations and displacement during the application of forces on the upper surface.</description>
