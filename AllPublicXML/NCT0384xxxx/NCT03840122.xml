  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of an Adductor canal block (ACB) +
      interspace between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee (IPACK) block along with
      a single intraoperative injection of a standard local anesthetic that includes Ropivacaine,
      Epinephrine, Ketorolac, Clonidine and saline to an ACB + IPACK block without the
      intraoperative injection of a standard local anesthetic in patients undergoing Robotic
      Arm-Assisted TKA (RA-TKA).

    <measure>Knee Society Score</measure>
    <time_frame>outcome measure will be taken preoperatively (4-6 weeks prior to date of surgery) and 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Society Score as recorded preoperatively and 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) postoperatively. The score is on a scale from 0-100. A higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC score</measure>
    <time_frame>outcome measure will be taken preoperatively (4-6 weeks prior to date of surgery) and 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC score as recorded preoperatively and 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) postoperatively. The score is on a scale from 0-100. In contrast to the Knee Society Score, on the WOMAC a lower value represents a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>outcome measure will be taken 24 hours postoperatively, 48 hours postoperatively, 72 hours postoperatively, 2 weeks (± 4 days) postoperatively, and 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale measures the patient's level of knee pain on a scale of zero to ten via what the patient expresses verbally. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) represents the degree of pain that the patient is experiencing at the time the measure is taken. Zero represents &quot;pain-free&quot;. A 10 would represent pain so excruciating as to warrant emergency medical assistance, or as it is described to the patient, &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;. Obviously, the lower the number, the better the outcome. There is no subscale.</description>
