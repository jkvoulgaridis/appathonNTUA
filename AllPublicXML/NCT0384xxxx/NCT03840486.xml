      The purpose of this study is to examine the ability of a nasal cannula sensor to predict
      end-tidal oxygen levels in real time.

    <textblock>
      Patients in the Emergency Department (ED) undergoing Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) are at
      risk for serious morbidity and mortality. In order to provide oxygen during the apneic
      period, it is common practice to provide pre-oxygenation prior to the start of the procedure
      with high flows of oxygen. Different methods of pre-oxygenation have been studied by taking a
      single breath end-tidal oxygen (EtO2) measurement with higher levels indicating more complete
      pre-oxygenation. However, there has not been any research examining methods of determining
      the quality of pre-oxygenation in real time. This study examines the performance of a nasal
      cannula EtO2 measurement as compared to the gold standard of single breath end-tidal oxygen
      measurements in healthy volunteers.

    <description>The degree of correlation between real time EtO2 measurements and a single breath end-tidal oxygen measurement as measured by the k correlation coefficient will be done at the end of 3 minutes. Correlation coefficients are expressed as values between +1 and -1 and is a statistical measure of the degree to which changes to the value of one variable predict change to the value of the other.</description>

    <description>The correlation of EtO2 between the nasal cannula sensor and the single breath sensor once stabilized at maximal readings as measured by the k correlation coefficient will be done at the end of 3 minutes. Correlation coefficients are expressed as values between +1 and -1 and is a statistical measure of the degree to which changes to the value of one variable predict change to the value of the other.</description>

    <description>Prior to the start of the study procedure, a nasal cannula end-tidal oxygen (EtO2) sensor will be placed on the participant's face with the non-rebreather mask (NRBM) overlying the sensor. The participants will be randomized to the order of their treatment sequence as follows: oxygen at 15 LPM for 3 minutes, at 35 LPM for 3 minutes, or at flush rate (55 LPM) for 3 minutes. The maximal reading at the end of this will be recorded, then the study subjects will be allowed to rest until their EtO2 returns to their baseline. They will then be placed back on NRBM at flush rate, allowed to rise to the maximal reading of the previous step, then do a single breath exhaled EtO2 measurement.</description>

    <description>Prior to the start of the study procedure, a nasal cannula end-tidal oxygen (EtO2) sensor will be placed on the participant's face with the non-invasive ventilator mask (NIV) overlying the sensor. Participants will be randomized to the order of their treatment sequence as follows: NIV at 50% FiO2 for 3 minutes, NIV at 75% FiO2 for 3 minutes, NIV at 100% FiO2 for 3 minutes, the maximal reading at the end of this trial will be recorded. The study subjects will be allowed to rest until their EtO2 returns to their baseline, then they will be placed back on NIV at 100% FiO2, allowed to rise to the maximal reading of the previous step, then do a single breath exhaled EtO2 measurement.</description>
