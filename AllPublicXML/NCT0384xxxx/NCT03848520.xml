  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that there are people running following a total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA).

      The objective is (1) to determine if there are people that ran/run following their TKA and
      (2), in case (1) is true, to identify some general running parameters such as duration,
      frequency, perceived barriers for running.

      Patients with a TKA and a score equal or higher than 9 on the UCLA activity scale at any time
      between 2 years prior to surgery and at present will be invited to participate in the trial
      by phone. All these patients will receive the study's information form and questionnaire by
      post with a pre-stamped envelope to return the documents.The survey was created and piloted
      internally for this study. There are 21 questions, most of them are &quot;yes or no&quot; and some
      others open questions to assess parameters such as duration of difficulties faced. The
      questionnaire is composed of three parts. The first part is interested in the preoperative
      activity (during the 2 years before surgery), the second part in the postoperative activity
      (during the 2 years after surgery) and the third part refers to the current practice. For
      each part, people are asked about specific practice parameters and modalities. Furthermore,
      we seek to determine whether there was/is a willingness to run following TKA, if patients
      receive any education/information about it and their personal attitudes towards running with
      a TKA. The anonymized data will be collected by the main author for subsequent analysis.

    <description>Due to the limited number of patients availabe the analysis will be performed through a qualitative questionnaire. It has 21 questions, most of them are &quot;yes or no&quot; choice and some other open to assess parameters such as &quot;number of runners&quot;, &quot;frequency of running&quot; (x/week), &quot;duration of running&quot; (min) and &quot;patients' attitudes towards running&quot; (adjectives reported) with a TKA. It is a patient based questionnaire to be send to each patient and returned by post.</description>
