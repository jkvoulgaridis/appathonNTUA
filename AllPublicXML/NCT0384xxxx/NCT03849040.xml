  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a deep neural artificial intelligence (AI) network
      (NeuralSeg) can learn how to assign the Canada Lymph Node Score to lymph nodes examined by
      endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration(EBUS-TBNA), using the technique of
      segmentation. Images will be created from 300 lymph nodes videos from a prospective library
      and will be used as a derivation set to develop the algorithm. An additional100 lymph node
      images will be prospectively collected to validate if NeuralSeg can correctly apply the
      score.

    <description>All patients will undergo EBUS-TBNA as per routine care, except for the one difference where the procedures will be video-recorded so that they can be used for computer analysis at a later time. Static images will be obtained from EBUS videos in order to perform segmentation. Segmentation will be conducted by both an experienced endoscopist and NeuralSeg.</description>

        Phase A does not require patient enrollment. Phase B will require prospective enrollment of
        patients to obtain the validation set of new lymph node videos. All patients who are
        scheduled to undergo an EBUS-TBNA procedure for mediastinal staging of NSCLC at St.
        Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton will be eligible to enroll in this study. There are no
        exclusion criteria. All patients will undergo EBUS-TBNA as per routine care, except for the
        one difference where the procedures will be video-recorded so that they can be used for
        computer analysis at a later time.
