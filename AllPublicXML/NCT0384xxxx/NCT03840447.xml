  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that around 35% of women
      and 29% of men are affected by chronic conditions and this percentage is clearly influenced
      by specific risk factors, such as lifestyle indicators. The high prevalence of chronic
      conditions put a large burden on national budgets. The healthcare costs of chronic conditions
      reach 6.8% of GDP in some European countries. The economic factors are also conditioning the
      individuals' lifestyles, including their concerns about health and self-care as a part of
      their way of life. the most educated patients suffering from a chronic disorder have often
      better skills to manage their conditions and therefore, show better health indicators than
      those less educated or with lowest socioeconomic status. In addition, the former are normally
      more interested in participating in community-based interventions, training programmes and
      research actions. Thus, the impact of interventions targeted to increase self-management
      skills and improve health condition of individuals with chronic diseases could be extremely
      higher in those individuals with education and socioeconomic vulnerability traits. Several
      health education programs have shown positive effects in the self-management of chronic
      disease. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme is a program based on empowering
      people with chronic diseases to manage and control their disease. This program has been used
      in several countries over the past twenty years and its effectiveness has been widely
      demonstrated. However, this programme has not been specifically offered to people in
      situations of socio-economic vulnerability. The implementation of the EFFICHRONIC project, in
      five European countries with different health systems and socio-economic contexts, will
      validate the effectiveness of this program with vulnerable people with chronic diseases.
      Indeed, the investigators believe that the benefit of interventions aimed at increasing
      self-management skills and improving the health status of people with chronic diseases could
      be greater for people with socio-economic vulnerability characteristics.

    <measure>Evaluate the efficacy of a 6-weeks self-management program on the quality of life by SF-12 between baseline and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) has two components: physical composite scores (PCS) and mental composite scores (MCS). These two components measure eight concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health (psychological distress and psychological wellbeing). PCS and MCS are computed using the scores of twelve questions and the sum of PCS and MCS range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the change in the health status change in score for : EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. EQ-5D-5L comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The subject is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the subject's health state. The EQ VAS records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (score 100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (score 0). The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the subject's own judgement.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the 6-months change in physical exercise using exercise behaviours(scales which is designed for use in evaluations of the CDSMC (Lorig et al., 1999). Exercise was assessed in terms of duration (minutes per week) of exercises performed (e.g. stretching, strengthening, bicycling, swimming, etc.)) and IPAQ comprises a set of 5 activity domains: job-related physical activity, transportation physical activity, housework, house maintenance, and caring for family, recreation, sport, and leisure-time physical activity and time spent sitting. For this evaluation, the investigator assess only the time spent sitting domain, asking the duration (hours and minutes per day) of time spend sitting on a weekday and on a weekend. The value is average for the previous 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the communication with physician between baseline and 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Communication with physician is assessed using three-item scales, with each item rated on a five-point scale (0-5) anchored by never and always.

    <measure>Evaluation of the self-efficacy (confidence in ability to deal with health problems) between baseline and 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-management is assessed using a self-efficacy -items scales on managing chronic disease. It covers several domains that are common across many chronic diseases: symptom control, role function, emotional functioning and communicating with physicians. Each item is scored from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident). Scores are summed across the six items (range 5-60), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program between baseline and 6 month</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness is assessed using QALYs (quality-adjusted life years)obtained by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system. It may be converted into a single index value. The index values are a major feature of the EQ-5D instrument, facilitating the calculation of (QALYs).
HRQol (health-related quality of life) will be obtain using the SF-12. Four types of health care utilization were assessed: visits to GP, specialists and Accident and Emergency Units and number of nights spent in hospital. The questionnaire adopts a recall period of 6 months.
Productivity Cost Questionnaire (PCQ) is a modified version of the 18 questions PCQ. The investigators collect 3 general questions: work status (number of hours per week of paid work and number of working days a week). Productivity losses measured in two separate modules: productivity losses of paid work due to absenteeism and presentism and productivity losses related to unpaid work. The questionnaire adopts a recall period of 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the change in depression with questionnaire PHQ-8. It consists of eight of the nine criteria on which the DSM-IV diagnosis of depressive disorders is based: depressed mood or irritable, decreased interest or pleasure, significant weight change (5%) or change in appetite, change in sleep, change in activity, fatigue or loss of energy, guilt/worthlessness and concentration. The subject is asked to indicate how often she/he had this problem over the last two week. Each criteria scores as &quot;0&quot; (not at all), &quot;1&quot; (several days), &quot;2&quot; (more than half of days) or &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Score is the sum of the 8 items. A score of 10 or greater is considered major depression, 20 or more is severe major depression</description>

    <description>The primary aim of the intervention is to achieve greater self-management of the chronic condition by changing the role of the passive citizen to empowerment in self-confidence and self-reliance. The intervention consists of a series of 6 workshops (with 7 to 8 activities), 2.5 hours each, which are held once a week for 6 weeks. One professional and one peer will volunteer together to lead a series of workshops. To this end, professionals and peers will be recruited and trained in the CDSMP principles.
Over 6 workshops, citizens set realistic health goals, learn to self-manage pain and discomfort, to self-manage their diet, self-manage physical activity, mood and the way the disease influences their personal relationships. The intervention is designed to actively involve citizens.</description>
