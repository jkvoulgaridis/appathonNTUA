  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project combined laboratory and ambulatory assessment (AA) methods to test decision
      making associated with alcohol impaired driving (AID). Participants will complete a
      laboratory alcohol administration session followed by 6 weeks of mobile assessment. Data from
      drinking events will be examined to test how individuals make choices about driving or not
      after consuming alcohol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Building on laboratory findings from the the PI's (McCarthy) previous work, this project is
      designed to test AID decision making in both the lab and the natural drinking environment in
      which AID decisions are made.

      Participants complete a laboratory alcohol administration session followed by six weeks of
      multi-method ambulatory assessment. The ambulatory assessment component will include
      participant report via smartphone, portable breathalizer (BACtrack), and location and
      movement data passively collected by the smartphone GPS/accelerometer. The combination of
      these methods will allow for the integration of subjective (e.g., perceived intoxication) and
      objective (e.g., BrAC, calculated drinking location) data for each drinking episode.

      Aim 1 of the project is to test laboratory measures as prospective predictors of AID and
      examine the role of event-level influences on specific AID decisions.

      Aim 2 of the proposed project is to test the potential for a novel intervention to reduce AID
      using mobile technology. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a full ambulatory
      assessment or a minimal assessment control condition. The timing of the introduction of AA
      will also be manipulated within the full ambulatory assessment condition. This design will
      allow us to test whether the introduction of ambulatory assessment produces changes in AID
      behavior, as well as whether such changes persist once ambulatory assessment is discontinued.
      Changes made to the revised application are aimed at ensuring the achievement of both study
      aims. If Aim 2 is achieved and ambulatory assessment alters AID behavior, the combination of
      the minimal assessment control condition and the full assessment condition prior to the
      introduction of ambulatory assessment has sufficient sample size and power to test Aim 1
      hypotheses.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomly assigned to 3 conditions, 2 &quot;active&quot; and one control condition. In the active conditions, participants will receive &quot;warning&quot; messages when their BAC reaches a set threshold that it is not safe for them to drive.
The two &quot;Active&quot; conditions differ in the timing of their onset of the intervention.
The control condition will not receive warning and will not report on their driving decision in the moment.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Alcohol impaired driving behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide self-reported driving behavior (yes/no driven a vehicle) after drinking alcohol during the AA portion. This assessment will be taken from their daily smartphone responses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol impaired driving behavior (retrospective)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide self-reported driving behavior (yes/no driven a vehicle) after drinking alcohol retrospectively during interview sessions. Participants will complete regular phone interview where their daily driving and drinking behavior will be assessed. The outcome measure of interest will be days when participants report driving (yes/no) after consuming alcohol.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide self-reported intentions to drive after drinking alcohol (Would you drive now? Yes/no) from daily assessments during the AA portion of the project.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived risk of driving</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report their perceived risk of driving (1 to 4 scale, &quot;Not Dangerous to Very Dangerous&quot;) given their current level of impairment during AA portion of project.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>BAC Feedback, immediate onset</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive a&quot;BAC Feedback/Warning&quot; intervention based on their assessed BAC. Participants in this arm will have a warning presented on their smartphone when they provide a breath sample that indicated their BAC has reached a set limit. The cutpoint for this warning is not disclosed but is well below the legal limit for driving. Warning will notify them that their results indicate it is not safe for them to drive.
In this condition, participants will start their 6 week AA portion of their participation immediately after their laboratory session, and will be followed for 6 weeks afterwards.
Comparisons between the two experimental conditions will allow for inferences about the onset and offset of any effects of the &quot;BAC Feedback/Warning&quot; intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the &quot;BAC Feedback/Warning&quot; intervention based on their assessed BAC during drinking events.The cutpoint for this warning is not disclosed but is well below the legal limit for driving. Warning will notify them that their results indicate it is not safe for them to drive.
In this condition, participants will be followed for 6 weeks after their laboratory session prior to starting their 6 week AA portion of their participation.

    <description>Participants will receive the &quot;No BAC Feedback/Warning&quot; intervention. Participants in this condition will complete the laboratory and interview portions of the project. However the AA portion of the project will not contain warning about their BAC (No BAC Feedback/Warning) and will ask fewer questions regarding their AID decisions.
The role of this condition is to provide a baseline comparison of AID behavior for the two active assessment conditions.</description>
