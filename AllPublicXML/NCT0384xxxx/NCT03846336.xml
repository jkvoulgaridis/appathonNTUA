      The purposes of this study is to investigate the relationship between upper extremity muscle
      function and shoulder position sense in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and which best
      projects the disability status.

      Upper extremity dysfunction is considered to be the main cause of the loss performance of
      activities of daily living and this problem was include all motor and somatosensory
      components of function. Any failure in each of these components will likely create an
      impairment in the normal function.

      One of the most important components of the somatosensory system is joint position sense, a
      sub-modality of proprioception. Position sense disorders are seen from the early stages of
      the disease and upper extremity function problems is experienced depending on position sense
      disorders in patients with MS.

      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is one of the most commonly outcome measures in
      evaluating the level of disability in MS population. Because EDSS scale emphasis on
      ambulation, so it is insensitive to upper extremity function. But the ability to use walking
      aids (e.g., canes, walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) may be affected by the UE impairment so
      shoulder position sense.

      When literature is examined, there is no study which examines the relationship between upper
      extremity muscle function and shoulder position sense in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and
      which best projects the disability status. For all these reasons, we think that shoulder
      position sense is changed both dominant and non-dominant side during flexion and abduction
      movements in mild-moderate MS patients and that these deficits are correlated with upper
      extremity function and disability level.

      This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between upper extremity muscle function
      and shoulder position sense in patients with MS and which best projects the disability
      status.

      21 PwMS and 20 healthy volunteers with matching ages and genders were included the study. A
      neurologic examination was performed using the EDSS by a neurologist.

      Upper extremity function was evaluated with 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). Shoulder position sense
      was evaluated with Dualer IQTM digital inclinometer (J-TECH medical, Salt Lake City, UK,
      USA).

    <description>Shoulder position sense was evaluated with a Dualer IQTM digital inclinometer (J-TECH medical, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).The absolute error scores (in degrees) for shoulder abduction and flexion at 30° and 60° was calculated. The difference between the target angle and the observed angle was calculated and the absolute error score was recorded by taking the average of 3 trials.</description>

    <description>Upper extremity function was evaluated with 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). The 9-HPT is a brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. It consists of moving nine pegs into one of the nine holes on a peg board, then back into an open box. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice.</description>

    <description>Shoulder position sense was evaluated with a Dualer IQTM digital inclinometer (J-TECH medical, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The absolute error scores (in degrees) for shoulder abduction and flexion at 30° and 60° was calculated. The upper extremity of the participant was positioned with the arm in the scapular plane for the abduction movement and in the sagittal plane for the flexion movement. After returning to the starting position, participants attempted to repeat the previously attained angle. Participants indicated verbally when they felt they had reached the angle and held their position. The measurement was repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 trials for each limb (non-dominant and dominant), with a 30-second rest period separating trials.</description>
