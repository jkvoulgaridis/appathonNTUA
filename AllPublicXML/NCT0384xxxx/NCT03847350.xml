  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:

      To evaluate the effects of NEBILET®(Nebivolol), used as monotherapy or in combination with
      other antihypertensive agents, in the control of BP and in the metabolic profile of patients
      with essential hypertension (with or without co-morbidities) after 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nebivolol, the third-generation beta-blocker with vasodilatory effect, potentiates nitric
      oxide by activating the synthesis of nitric oxide of vascular endothelial cells and improves
      the function of vascular endothelial cells by reducing oxidation stress. The efficacy of
      NEBILET®(Nebivolol) has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials not only as
      monotherapy but also as add-on therapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor,
      angiotensin II receptor blocker, diuretic and other anti-hypertensive agents in lowering the
      blood pressure.

      Based on previous study results mentioned above, the present study aims to observe the effect
      of NEBILET®(Nebivolol) on controlling blood pressure and metabolic profile change in Korean
      patients with hypertension under routine clinical practice.

      In addition, this study aims to identify additional benefits of NEBILET®(Nebivolol)
      administration in patients with essential hypertension under various treatment environments
      and existing co-morbidities in Korea, expected to provide detailed information about efficacy
      of blood pressure control, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism of NEBILET®(Nebivolol)
      administration in Korean patients with essential hypertension.
