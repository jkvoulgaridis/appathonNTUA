  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eBACH is a randomized intervention to determine the effects of aerobic exercise on brain
      structure and function, as well as to determine how exercise-induced training effects relate
      to cardiovascular function via related brain changes.

      Aim 1: To determine the neurobiology of exercise and cardiovascular factors: (1A) Body- to
      -Brain hypothesis: Exercise -induced changes in peripheral markers of cardiovascular health
      (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, peripheral vascular function) will precede and partly
      explain (statistically mediate) some of the exercise -induced changes in functional and
      structural features of areas defining visceral control circuits. (1B) Brain- to -Body
      hypothesis: Exercise -induced changes in functional and structural features of areas defining
      visceral control circuits precede and partly explain (statistically mediate) consequent
      changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine mediators of cardiovascular function that are under
      neural regulation, including baro-reflex sensitivity and heart rate variability. Aim 2: To
      determine the neurobiology of exercise self--reported correlates of cardiovascular function:
      (2A) Exercise will induce changes in visceral control areas engaged by functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks, and these changes will partly explain exercise- induced
      reductions in cardiovascular responsivity to challenges in daily life. (2B) Exercise will
      induce changes in visceral control areas engaged by an functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) emotion processing and regulation paradigm, and these changes will partly explain
      exercise- induced improvements in affect measured in daily life by EMA and by conventional
      self- report instruments. The public health significance of this research is that it is
      designed to more precisely define and refine neurobiological targets to improve
      cardiovascular function and health.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>150 individuals between the ages of 26 and 58 will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; Aerobic Exercise group or Physical Activity and Health Information group. The aerobic group will meet 2 times a week for 60 minutes over a 12-month period. Both groups will be asked to wear activity monitors every 6 weeks. Both groups will have fitness testing and cardiovascular assessments completed at baseline, 6 months and following the completion of the 12-month intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Neither the investigator, nor outcomes assessors will know participants' group assignment. Participants will be instructed to refrain from speaking about their group's activities when visiting the lab for 6 month and follow-up assessments.In addition, special care was taken to ensure that non-blinded laboratory staff (i.e. staff member notifying participants of their group assignments, staff monitoring the intervention) are not located in the same proximity in the laboratory, further preventing accidental unblinding.</masking_description>

    <description>Guidelines for exercise programming (ACSM, 2018) will be followed including a warm up and cool down, progressive and gradual increments in duration, and instruction regarding avoidance of physical activity related injury. The exercise group will receive moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 60 minutes per day, twice a week, for 12 months. They will also exercise on their own for 30 minutes, 1 time a week, for 12 months. This gives a total of 3 exercise sessions a week. The prescribed intensity will be based on their maximal fitness testing heart rate and then calculated per a research grade method. They will maintain a minimum heart rate from their specific calculation that will be monitored by Polar Heart Rate straps.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age - individuals aged 26-58 years old

          -  Gender &amp; Ethnicity - men and women are both eligible to participate. The eBACH study
             expects the study population to be approximately 50% women. All ethnic groups are
             eligible for the study. The eBACH study expects the study population to be
             approximately 30% minorities.

          -  Ambulation - study participants must be able to walk without pain or use of an
             assisted walking device. This will be determined during the initial phone screen.
             Ambulation will also be assessed in person as the potential subject must be able to
             complete the VO2 Max test on a treadmill.

          -  Physical Activity Level - all participants must exercise less than 100 minutes per
             week and have a VO2max percentile level less than 75 based on the ACSM Guidelines for
             Exercise Testing (10th edition).

          -  Residency - Since the intervention is 12 months in duration, all potential
             participants must reside in the Pittsburgh area and plan on residing in the area for
             at least one year after randomization. It is recommended that the study coordinator
             during the second screen assess potential participants' distance from the exercising
             sites since the study requires 2 visits per week. The further a participant is from an
             intervention site, the higher the probability they will be unable to adhere to the
             protocol. In addition, participants must have reliable transportation to complete the
             outcome measures and the intervention requirements. Questions related to these
             considerations are asked during the phone screen and should also be assessed during
             the baseline visits.

          -  Willingness to be randomized - To be eligible, all potential study participants must
             be willing to be randomized to either of the intervention arms. Individuals that
             insist on participating only if they can choose which arm they belong to should not be
             enrolled.

             pregnant via the pregnancy test at the baseline visit will be excluded from the study.
             A pregnancy test will also be given at the MRI visit and this will be repeated at
             6-months and 12-months.

                  be provided to the participant.

          -  Cancer - potential participants who have received treatment in the last 12 months for
             cancer, including radiation or chemotherapy will be excluded from the study. Although,
             if a potential participant who had non-melanoma skin cancer will be allowed to enroll
             in eBACH.

          -  Liver disease - any person who has had hepatitis B or C, liver failure or Cirrhosis
             will be excluded from the study.

             failure, have undergone dialysis, or have had a kidney transplant will not be eligible
             to participant in the eBACH study.

             any participants who work more than 12 night shifts in the last year, or participants
             who work more than one night shift per month on average. This is defined as a period
             of work in which half or more of the hours worked are between midnight and 8:00 in the
             morning.

          -  Mri incompatable

               -  Certain medical devices, implants or other metal objects in or on the body that
