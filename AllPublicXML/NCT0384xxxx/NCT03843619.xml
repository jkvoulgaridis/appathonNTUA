  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By forming the foundation of a delivery system that integrates primary care (PC) and
      rheumatology, this initiative strives to strengthen the roles of both primary care and
      rheumatology practices as they co-manage patients in a quality care delivery system.
      Importantly, it strives to fill an unmet need, the rapid evaluation by Primary Care
      providers; the appropriate and timely referral of inflammatory disease patients to a
      rheumatologist; and the implementation of early aggressive therapy in the management of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with tight control. Given the call for improved
      quality, value, and demonstration of results[1], this initiative uses the tenets of National
      Center for Quality Assurance's Patient Centered Specialty Program[1] (PCSP) and it
      successfully masters and streamlines coordination of care.

    <description>The change in CDAI score from baseline at 1 and 2 years. CDAI uses a scale of 0 - 60 where scores less than 2.8 are considered &quot;remission&quot;, 2.9 - 10.0 are &quot;low&quot; disease activity, 10.1 - 22.0 are &quot;moderate&quot; disease activity, and 22.1 or higher are &quot;high&quot; disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>One year enrollment period with two year follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>The change in RAPID3 score from baseline at 1 and 2 years. RAPID3 uses a scale of 0 - 30 where scores less than 3.1 are considered &quot;remission&quot;, 3.1 - 6.0 are &quot;low&quot; disease activity, 6.1 - 12.0 are &quot;moderate&quot; disease activity, and 12.1 or higher are &quot;high&quot; disease activity.</description>
