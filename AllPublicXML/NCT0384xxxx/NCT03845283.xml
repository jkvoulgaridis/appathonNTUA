  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac
      rehabilitation (CR) is the main treatment for heart attacks and other types of CVD. It is
      based on science, it saves money, and it is widely-available. Each session (of which there
      are a few each week for 3 months) combines supervised exercise and instruction. The goals are
      to improve overall health and reduce cardiovascular risk in individuals with established CVD.
      CR produces almost no weight loss (WL); if a person has excess weight while in CR (the
      majority of participants have overweight or obesity), losing weight could really reduce their
      risk of having another heart attack. The best treatment available for weight loss, in-person
      behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLs), produce enough WL that they improve health and
      disease risk/severity. However, in-person BWLs are too much work to be carried out in CR. A
      previous fully automated 3-month online program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), produced good WL in
      many different settings. Dr. Goldstein aims to tailor RxWL for use in CR. The study will use
      the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to test innovative eHealth/mHealth intervention
      components that might work well for people when combined with RxWL. The study will include
      160 patients (each randomized to receive 0-4 of the components). The components are: (a) a
      Fitbit with a goal-setting program; (b) a bite counting device; (c) a Web-based virtual
      reality (VR) intervention ; and (d) virtual meetings. By the 6-month follow-up, the
      investigators will know if any of those 4 components helped people lose more weight. If a
      component produced at least 2% WL, it will be studied further by being included in a new
      intervention to be tested in the next study.

    <measure>Weight Change</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-, and 6-months after initiating the program</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between initial weight and weight at the follow-up assessments. Patients will be asked to step on a scale at the assessment clinic.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Structured Weekly Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-, and 6-months after initiating the program</time_frame>
    <description>Structured MVPA minutes will be measured via a SenseWear Armband monitor (BodyMedia, Inc, Pittsburgh PA, USA). This multi-sensor monitor worn on the upper triceps wirelessly integrates motion data from a triaxial accelerometer with other sensors to estimate energy expenditure and activity intensity. Everyone will be asked to wear the armband during waking hours across the 7-day period prior to each assessment. Participants will be required to provide at least 5 days of data (including 1 weekend day), defined as â‰¥ 600 min during the hours of 7 am to 11 pm, to be included in analyses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bites</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-, and 6-months after initiating the program</time_frame>
    <description>All study participants' average number of recorded daily bites of food over 7 consecutive days will be assessed by a Bite Counter (Bite Technologies, Pendleton SC, USA) with the display inactivated. Participants' average number of daily bites will be compared from each 7-day period prior to each assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Control Practices</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-, and 6-months after initiating the program</time_frame>
    <description>The validated, widely-used Weight Control Practices Scale measures the health behaviors an individual executes to influence energy balance and is targeted by the VR program. All participants will complete this measure at each assessment point. The overall scale scores range from 0-30 where higher scores indicate that the participant is using more strategies to control their weight. The subscale scores, which assess dietary choices (score range 0-10), self-monitoring strategies (score range 0-8), physical activity (score range 0-6), and psychological coping (score range 0-7), will also be examined. Higher scores on the subscales indicate greater weight control (which is a better outcome). Subscale scores are summed to compute the total scale score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Loss Self-Efficacy: Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-, and 6-months after initiating the program</time_frame>
    <description>This is the participant's confidence in implementing BWL skills. It will be targeted by the virtual meetings and will be measured via the well-validated Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire in all participants. The scores can range from 0-180 where higher scores indicate more weight loss self-efficacy and better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Behavioral Self-Management in Cardiac Rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3-, and 6-months after initiating the program</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will complete a newly-developed self-management inventory designed specifically for cardiac rehabilitation patients. The total score can range from 54-300, with higher scores generally reflecting better self-management.</description>

    <description>An program designed to help participants gradually increase their physical activity and maintain an active lifestyle. The program encourages bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Participants in this group will receive a Fitbit Versa to help them monitor their physical activity that they will be advised to wear daily. Participants will receive brief (5-10 minute) lessons weekly for the first 3 months and monthly for the last 3 months.</description>

    <description>This program allows participants to practice behavioral weight loss skills using a virtual reality system compatible with their home device. This program helps patients practice these skills in the following artificial settings: at home, at work, at the gym, and at a party. Each participant will be asked to play through each scene at least once during their participation, though they are encouraged to use the program regularly.</description>
