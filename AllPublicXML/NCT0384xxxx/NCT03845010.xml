  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ECTOPIA trial is a randomized, multicenter, clinical trial to assess elimination of
      ventricular premature beats (VPB) with catheter ablation versus optimal anti-arrhythmic drugs
      (AAD) treatment with flecainide/verapamil or sotalol.

      The ECTOPIA trial is a randomized, multicenter, clinical trial to assess elimination of VPB
      with catheter ablation versus optimal AAD treatment with flecainide/verapamil or sotalol. Due
      to the use of different AAD (with and without beta-blocking abilities) the investigators will
      be able to explore the secondary objectives. Finally, this study will assess safety of
      ablation of non-RVOT VPBs and long-term treatment with two different AAD.
