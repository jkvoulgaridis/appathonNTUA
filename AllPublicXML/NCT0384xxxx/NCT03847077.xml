  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to assess whether using a multimedia tool would enhance patient
      education and counseling on uterine leiomyomata.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with leiomyomata confirmed on imaging who presented as a new patient to the gynecology
      clinic at a single institution were randomized to receive either standard counseling or
      multimedia counseling using the drawMD OB/GYN iPad application. Participants completed a
      pre-counseling questionnaire, received the designated method of counseling, and then
      completed a post-counseling questionnaire.

    <measure>Change in patient knowledge scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked baseline knowledge questions about fibroids prior to receiving physician counseling. Patients were randomized to iPad counseling or standard counseling groups. After the counseling session, patients answered similar knowledge questions about fibroids. The pre-counseling and post-counseling scores will be compared for each group. Generalized estimating equations were used to test whether any change in knowledge from pre-counseling to post-counseling was dependent on the participant's intervention assignment.</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction post-counseling</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed a Likert scale questionnaire (1 = Very Dissatisfied, 2 = Dissatisfied, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Satisfied, 5 = Extremely Satisfied) to evaluate satisfaction with assigned counseling method.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a Likert scale questionnaire (1 = Not at all, 2 = Somewhat, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Very Much) about their anxiety related to fibroids prior to receiving physician counseling.</description>
