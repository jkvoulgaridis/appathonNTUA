    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to investigate associations between sleep/circadian
      disturbances and psychiatric health among adolescents recruited from primary and specialty
      health clinics.

      This project will involve recruitment of 100 adolescents from primary and specialty health
      clinics. Participants will participate in 3 phases: screening/intake visit, sleep study, and
      follow-up visit.

      The 1-hour screening/intake visit will be conducted at the Duke ADHD clinic at 2608 Erwin
      Road, Pavilion East, Suite 300, Durham, NC 27705. During the screening/intake visit,
      participants and their parents will complete questionnaires regarding the adolescent's
      psychiatric health. Participants' vitals (i.e., height, weight, resting heart rate, blood
      pressure) will also be assessed and recorded.

      Eligible participants will enter the 7-day sleep study, during which they will be asked to
      wear an actigraph watch 24 hours/day, apply a EEG sleep recorder each night, and complete a
      daily sleep diary.

      Following the final night of the sleep study, participants and parents will be asked to
      return for a follow-up visit and will complete questionnaires about the participants' sleep
      over the past week.
