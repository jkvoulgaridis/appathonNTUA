  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study focuses on the re-harmonization of the kinetic chains and
      posture based on spinal muscular atrophy and global stretching while trying to test the
      effectiveness of Mézières therapy on sports subjects with low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental study was conducted on 139 young athletes of National Rhythmic Gymnastics of
      Murcia, UCAM Murcia CF and UCAM Murcia CB/EBA during a six months period in the city of
      Murcia. Precisely, the Mézières therapy was conducted in an experimental group of 69 athletes
      and in a control group with other 70 athletes with Low Back Pain. This study is developed
      through a cycle of global stretching decompensate interventions on the athletes with postural
      alterations and vertebral pain at 95% confidence level. The statistical analysis was handled
      by using the univariate general linear model with the support of SPSS statistics.

    <measure>VAS (Visual Analogic Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists in identifying the patient, on a 10 cm line, the point that best represents his pain, where 0 means no pain and 10 = worst possible pain.</description>

    <measure>Sit and Reach flexibility test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Designed to test the flexibility of lower back and hamstring muscles and is important as a result of lumbar lordosis, forward pelvic tilt and lower back pain. The score is recorded to the nearest inch/cm or inch/cm as the distance reached by the hand. For women, the lowest value is ˂ -15 cm and the highest is ˃ +30 cm. For men instead, the lowest value is ˂ -20 cm and the highest is &gt;+27 cm.</description>

    <measure>Runtastic Performance Pedometer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>- Runtastic PRO is an app aimed at recording fitness in many activities and sports. It captures all basic data: distance, average speed, speed between mile markers, altitude, pace, step between mile markers, duration, calories burned and route plotted on a map using Global Positioning System. The final result shows how many steps are made in the arc of the minute (st / 60sec).</description>

    <measure>Roland-Morris Questionnaire (CRM)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the physical disability of athletes and consists of 24 points of functional capacity of the back. The sense of progression is: the more serious the worse is the performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health status questionnaire (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists in 12 items of the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 (124) such as: physical function (2), social function (1), physical role (2), emotional role (2), mental health (2), vitality (1), body pain (1), general health (1). Meanwhile response options forms Likert-type scales that evaluate intensity or frequency are achieved.</description>
