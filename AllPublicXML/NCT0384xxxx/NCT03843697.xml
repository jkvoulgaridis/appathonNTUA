      Trial for IBD patients non-responsive to biological drugs, using medical app reminding
      patients to take their physician-prescribed medications

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with IBD who developed loss of response to anti-TNF based medications will receive a
      cell phone based app that will remind them to take the drug with an approved dosing range.

    <description>Open-label, single-center study, up to 20 adults (&gt;18) male and female with inflammatory bowel disease (chorn's disease, ulcerative colitis), unresponsive to biological drugs, will participate in a 4-week observation period during which no change in drugs is permitted. The patients will then begin 10-week treatment by taking their medications according to a semi-random schedule that is pre-set for them by the physician using the same drugs the patient is taking and only changing the dose and times of taking them each day while keeping the drugs within their therapeutic window.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of CD or UC according to validated criteria, with a Crohn's Disease Activity
             Score (CDAI) of 200-450 at inclusion.

          2. Patients on a stable dose within the last 6 weeks of any type of anti TNF agent or any
             other biological agent

          3. 5-ASA (mesalamine), and immunomodulatory, or immunosuppressive agent, and symptomatic
             relief (anti-diarrheals) for patients are allowed in a stable dose (6 weeks).

          4. Non-smoking (by declaration) for a period of at least 6 months.

          5. Females of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant (as determined by a serum

             adequate contraceptive means throughout the study.

          6. No known history of significant neurological, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory
             (asthma), endocrinological, gastrointestinal, primary hematopoietic disease, neoplasm,
             or any other clinically significant medical disorder other than Crohn's disease and
             its complications, which in the investigator's judgment contraindicate administration
             of the study medications.

          7. No history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          8. Screening tests must meet the following criteria: HGB ≥8.5 g/dL, platelets ≥ 100,000/

             bilirubin within normal limits. ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase up to 1.5 times normal
             limits.

          9. No clinically significant abnormalities in screening physical exam.

         10. Negative HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C serology tests within 2 years.

             anastomosis.

          3. Symptomatic stenosis or ileal strictures, x-ray evidence of fibrosed bowel.

          4. Patients presenting with, or with a history of persistent intestinal obstruction,

             megacolon.

          5. Patients with fistulating CD.

          6. Short bowel syndrome.

          7. Patients with a history of GI tract malignancy or IBD-associated malignant changes in
             the intestines.

          8. Patients with any clinically significant abnormality upon physical examination or in
             the clinical laboratory test values.

          9. A change in the dose of the immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drug within 6 weeks.

         10. Over-the-counter drugs, including herbal medications, and prescription drugs (other

             throughout the duration of the study

         11. Receipt of packed RBC's within 3 months prior to the first study dosing and throughout
             the study.

         12. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to first drug
             administration.

         13. Patients with an inability to communicate well with the PI and staff (i.e., language
             problem, poor mental development or impaired cerebral function).

         14. Patients with any acute medical situation (e.g. acute infection) within 48 hours of
             first dosing session, which is considered of significance by the Principal
             Investigator.

         15. Patients who will be unavailable for the duration of the trial, are likely to be
             noncompliant with the protocol, or who are felt to be unsuitable by the PI for any
