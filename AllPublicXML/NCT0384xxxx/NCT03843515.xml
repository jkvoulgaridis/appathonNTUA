      Safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant nivolumab for locally advanced resectable oral cancer,
      combined with [18F]BMS-986192 / [18F]-FDG PET imaging and immunomonitoring for response
      prediction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive treatment regimens with surgical resection and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy of
      patients with locally advanced oral cancer still result in only 50-60% cure rate, leaving a
      substantial group of patients who will develop a local recurrence or distant metastases with
      minimal curative salvage treatment options. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies
      (mAbs) has shown promise in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (r/m HNSCC). This supports the hypothesis that including treatment with anti PD-1
      mAb nivolumab could improve the outcome for patients with locally advanced oral cancer
      resulting in a higher cure rate. Response rate with nivolumab was below 20% in unselected
      patients with r/m HNSCC. Therefore, biomarkers for response are urgently needed. Tumor PD-L1
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) was shown to be related to nivolumab response but cannot be
      reliably used for patient selection. Temporal and spatial heterogeneity of tumor PD-L1
      expression (within and between tumor lesions) might be responsible for its suboptimal
      predictive value as biomarker of response. Therefore there is a need to further evaluate
      tumor PD-L1 expression as predictive biomarker, as well as exploring alternatives. Serial PET
      imaging with [18F]BMS-986192 (anti-PD-L1 tracer) and [18F]-FDG has the potential to provide
      whole body information of the patient over time, at baseline as well as on treatment and
      represents a biomarker for toxicity and efficacy. In addition, we will investigate the
      immunophenotype of the patient and tumor, as well as the presence of neoantigens and other
      potential other biomarkers such as plasma vesicle miRNAs.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced oral cancer (stage
             III/IV) which is planned for treatment with curative intent including surgical
             resection.

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          3. Be more then 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          4. Must agree to provide tissue from fresh tumor biopsy pretreatment and from the
             surgical resection material to determine the actual PD-L1 status and perform
             immunomonitoring/DNA/RNA profiling.

          5. Willing to allow up to two additional biopsies when baseline [18F]BMS-986192 PET
             /[18F]-FDG PET scans show heterogeneous and/or discrepant uptake.

          6. Have a performance status of 0-1 on the ECOG Performance Scale (Appendix 2).

          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in table 1. All screening labs should
