      In this study, investigators will evaluate the effect of Isha Kriya meditation on stress and
      burnout among perioperative healthcare providers. To do this, investigators will randomize
      healthy participants to one of two groups: one who will meditate twice daily for six weeks
      (group 1), and the other who will not meditate for first six weeks and then meditate for
      another six weeks (group 2). Investigators will then evaluate stress and burnout using
      validated electronic instruments at baseline and at six weeks for group 1 and at baseline,
      six weeks, and 12 weeks for group 2.

    <description>Isha Kriya (IK) meditation is a meditation that can be learned quickly and requires approximately 12 minutes, twice a day practice. This regimen was chosen because it excels in simplicity and is a great way to introduce meditation to beginners. It does not incorporate a spiritual or religious focus. It was developed by the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences, a nonprofit foundation located at McMinnville, Tennessee.</description>
