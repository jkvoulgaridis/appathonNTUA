  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) require dual antiplatelet
      therapy (DAPT). Preliminary assessment of the PRECISE-DAPT score is mandatory in order to
      assess the risk of bleeding while on DAPT. The score takes into consideration age, creatinine
      clearance, haemoglobin, white blood- cell count and previous spontaneous bleeding. One should
      consider, however, that some of the variables included in the PRECISE-DAPT score might change
      with time. As a consequence, the PRECISE-DAPT score should not be considered a static score
      as it might vary after the initial computation.

      It remains unknown, however, if the use of the delta PRECISE-SCORE, which reflects the change
      in score between baseline and follow-up, might help to improve the management of PCI patients
      in order to decrease the bleeding risk during follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RE-SCORE trial is a multicenter study aimed at comparing usual care of patients treated
      with PCI with a novel strategy of change of therapy during follow-up on the base of the Delta
      PRECISE-DAPT score, as assessed every 3 months in PCI patients receiving DAPT. The primary
      end-point of the study is the occurrence of bleeding, as defined according to the criteria of
      the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC). The second end-point is a composite of
      cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST), or
      BARC criteria type 2, 3 or 5 bleeding.
