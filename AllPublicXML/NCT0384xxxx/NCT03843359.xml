  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, FTIH, open-label, repeat-dose, non-randomized, multicenter, multi-country
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity and establish a
      recommended dose of GSK3745417 administered intravenously (IV) alone (Part 1) or
      co-administered (Part 2) with pembrolizumab in subjects with refractory/relapsed solid
      tumors. Each part consists of a dose escalation phase and a cohort expansion phase. In Part
      1A, escalating doses of GSK3745417 will be evaluated as guided by the
      Neuenschwander-continuous reassessment method (N-CRM) approach. In Part 2A, escalating doses
      of GSK3745417 in combination with 200 milligrams (mg) pembrolizumab will be evaluated as
      guided by the N-CRM approach. In Part 1B and 2B, subjects will receive a single dose level of
      GSK3745417 as identified based on data from Part 1, either alone or in combination with
      pembrolizumab. A total of approximately 300 subjects will be enrolled in this study,
      approximately 120 for dose escalation cohorts, and approximately 180 in the expansion
      cohorts.

             dose of study treatment and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose
             of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness
