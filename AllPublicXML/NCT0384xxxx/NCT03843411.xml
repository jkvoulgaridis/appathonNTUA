      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the change of stroke volume index(△SVI)
      induced by the rapid mini-fluid administration can predict fluid responsiveness in patients
      with pneumoperitoneum

    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid management is significant important during surgery. The current trend
      tends to use goal-directed fluid therapy in surgery. Goal-directed fluid therapy refers to
      continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters during surgery and managing more accurate
      fluid administration based on the data obtained while promoting optimal tissue perfusion.
      Define fluid responsiveness with the hemodynamic parameters as to whether the cardiac output
      can be significantly increased after administration of fluid. Therefore, the advantage of
      predicting fluid responsiveness is that it can optimize the cardiac output and tissue
      perfusion while avoiding administering unnecessary fluid to patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the change of stroke volume index(△SVI)
      induced by the rapid mini-fluid administration can predict fluid responsiveness in patients
      with pneumoperitoneum.
