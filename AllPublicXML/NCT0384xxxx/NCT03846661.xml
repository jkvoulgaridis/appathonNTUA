      The primary aim of the present study was to show how a national clinical register combined
      with other nationwide administrative registers may serve as a tool for pre- and
      post-marketing evaluation of new mesh and mesh fixation products for hernia surgery, using
      Physiomesh® versus other meshes designed for laparoscopic hernia repair as an example.

    <textblock>
      All adult (≥18 yrs) patients registered in the Danish Hernia Database (DHB) who underwent
      elective primary laparoscopic incisional hernia repair between January 1st 2010 and December
      31st 2016.

      To obtain 100% follow-up data from DHB will be combined with administrative data from the
      Danish National Patient register.

      Patients will be followed from initial hernia repair until reoperation for recurrence, death,
      emigration outside Denmark or end of follow-up (november 2017).

      Physiomesh and other mesh repairs will be propensity score matched. Each patient in the
      Physiomesh® group will be matched with two patients treated with one of the other synthetic
      meshes. The Propensity score includes age, sex, year of surgery, diagnosis of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, diagnosis of diabetes, diagnosis of obesity, Charlson
      comorbidity index and size of hernia defect

      The primary outcome: Difference in risk for a reoperation for recurrence between patients
      operated with Physiomesh® and patients operated with another synthetic mesh designed for
      laparoscopic repair.

      The secondary outcome will be rates of 30-day readmission, 30-day reoperation for
      complications (excluding hernia recurrence) as well as 30- and 90-day mortality.
