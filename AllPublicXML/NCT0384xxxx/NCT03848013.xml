      -  All participants will be divided into 2 groups : Group A &amp; Group B.

        -  Group A will be subjected to 3 consecutive sessions of Q-switched 1,064 nm Nd: YAG laser
           to one side of the face &amp; fractional co2 laser to the other side of the face with one
           month interval between sessions.

        -  Group B will be subjected also to 3 consecutive sessions of Q-switched 1,064 nm Nd: YAG
           laser to one side of the face &amp; an additional fractional co2 laser to the other side of
           the face using the above mentioned parameters with one month interval between sessions.

        -  Response to treatment will be assessed using the Melanin Index (MI) score, Melasma Area
           and Severity Index (MASI) score, spectrophotometer ( Derma catch, colorix, Neuchatel,
           Switzerland ) and a subjective self-assessment method.
