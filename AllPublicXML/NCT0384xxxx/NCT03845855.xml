    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of virtual reality treatment in addition to robotic gait
      therapy on dual task performance, balance and gait in chronic stroke patients. Half of
      participants will attend virtual reality treatment in addition to robotic gait therapy for 12
      sessions, while the other half will attend only robotic gait therapy for 12 sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following stroke, motor disorders, balance disorders, falls, gait disturbances and cognitive
      disorders are frequently seen. In stroke rehabilitation, with the use of robots and virtual
      reality systems with conventional methods, it is aimed to increase patient's motivation, to
      check if exercise is effective, to provide objective evaluation data and to support the motor
      learning process and the use of these methods in the field of neurological rehabilitation is
      increasing.

      Multi-task evaluations can be made with the virtual environments created by virtual reality
      applications and complex tasks.

      The traditional approach to stroke rehabilitation is mainly focused on balance and gait
      training under single task conditions. In everyday life, people should not only have balance
      and mobility skills, but also have the ability to perform other cognitive and motor tasks
      with these skills. Therefore, traditional approaches are not sufficient for the individual to
      return to society after a stroke.

      In this respect, this study was planned in order to examine the effects of frequently used
      virtual reality treatment in addition to robotic gait therapy on the dual task, balance and
      gait performance.

    <measure>Mini Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Mini Mental State Examination can be used to assess the mental status. Mini Mental State Examination is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30. The minimum score is 0. Getting 24 point is cut point. If a person get 24 points from examination, his/her mental status is fine. The higher scores represent better mental status.</description>

    <measure>Functional Ambulation Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. Level 0 is the minimum level and level 5 is the maximum level. Higher levels represent better function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rivermead Mobility Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Rivermead Mobility Index assesses functional mobility in gait, balance and transfers after stroke. 14-self-reported items and 1 direct observation item are calculated. Items are coded as either 0 or 1, depending on whether the patient can complete the task according to specific instructions. Items receive a score of 0 for a &quot;No&quot; response and 1 for a &quot;Yes&quot; response.A maximum of 15 points is possible; higher scores indicate better mobility performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function.</description>

    <measure>Falls Efficacy Scale - International</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale International are measures of &quot;fear of falling&quot; or, more properly, &quot;concerns about falling&quot;. Minimum 16 (no concern about falling) to maximum 64 (severe concern about falling) can be obtained.</description>

    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Funcitonal Gait Assessment is used to assess postural stability during various walking tasks. The highest score is 30/30. Higher scores represent better functional gait performance.</description>
