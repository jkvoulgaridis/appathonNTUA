  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe and evaluate the cost-effectiveness,efficacy and safety
      of PEG-rhG-CSF in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia(CIN) of cancer patients in the
      real world.1000 patients with non-myeloid malignancy who is planned to receive PEG-rhG-CSF
      for CIN prevention and 500 patients with non-myeloid malignancy who is planned to receive
      rhG-CSF for CIN prevention or treatment were prospectively recruited.The primary outcome was
      cost-effectiveness and second outcome was febrile neutropenia,the incidence and duration of
      grade IV neutropenia,chemotherapy delay,incidence of reduced dose of chemotherapy and
      relative dose intensity of chemotherapy.
