      Researchers are trying to better understand why constipation occurs and improve the tests for
      diagnosing these conditions.

      Study includes a screening visit and a study day. During the initial screening visit for this
      study, subjects will complete three (3) questionnaires about their bowel symptoms, overall
      health, and anxiety and depression. A blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to
      study the relationship between genes and certain bowel habits. Subjects will be asked to
      provide a single stool sample to look at the bacteria in the stool.

      Before the study, subjects will receive 1 to 2 Fleet's enemas to clean the rectum. After
      receiving the Fleet's enema (administered through a small plastic tube in the rectum), a swab
      attached to a small rectal catheter will be used to brush the lining of the rectum and obtain
      a stool specimen. Then, rectal and anal pressures will be measured by placing a small
      catheter (plastic tube) in the rectum, and withdrawing it slowly. Rectal sensation will be
      measured by inflating a small balloon in the rectum.

      There are 2 procedures (rectal barostat study and fecomanoflowmetry), each of which lasts
      approximately 90 minutes. During the rectal barostat study, contractions will be recorded
      with a balloon inserted into the rectum and inflated. After the barostat study is completed,
      your rectum will be filled with a small amount of paste. Two thin catheters will be inserted
      into the anus to measure pressures and electrical activity (electromyography or EMG). Then,
      you will be asked to sit on a commode, contract (squeeze) your anal muscles, blow into a
      balloon, and expel the paste into the commode.

    <description>Rectal balloon is inflated to a preload volume of 125ml. The balloon is then oscillated around baseline volume by 25mL for 20 min at a frequency of 5 counts per minute (cpm). The mean rectal pressure (cm H2O) will be calculated over the multiple oscillation cycles within the 20 minute distention segment.</description>

    <description>The sensory threshold for first sensation to defecate is measured by stepwise inflation of the balloon (0-44 mm Hg, at 4 mm Hg increments). During this assessment participants are asked to report when they have the first sensation to defecate.</description>
