    <textblock>
      Research project in which patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are examined clinically and
      with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To evaluate spinal cord (SC) grey and white matter
      changes (incl. lesions) using fast, high-resolution MRI sequences with high contrast between
      SC and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as high contrast within the SC (grey-white matter
      contrast).

      The Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort (SMSC-Study) aims to better evaluate specific Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS) phenotypes through the systematic and standardised documentation and
      acquisition of clinical course and paraclinical tests such as magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens.

      Determination of the relative contribution of SC metrics (cervical cord volume, cervical grey
      matter (GM) cord volume, cervical white matter (WM) cord volume, SC lesion load) to
      disability in MS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SC atrophy assessed by MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and after 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of the degree of SC grey and white matter atrophy in MS patients with relapsing versus progressive disease courses in comparison to matched HC. Measurement tool is a structural MRI of the brain and spinal cord at 3 Tesla. Assessment will last approx. 90 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Timed 25-foot walk test (T25-FW)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and after 1 year and after 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative mobility and leg function performance test ( in MS patients) based on a timed 25-walk. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and after 1 year and after 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Self-assessment scale which measures the impact of MS on walking. It consists of 12 questions concerning the limitations to walking due to MS during the past 2 weeks. Each item can be answered with 5 options, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 extreme limitation.</description>
