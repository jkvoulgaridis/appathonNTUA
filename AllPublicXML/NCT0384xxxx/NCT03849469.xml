      This is a Phase 1, multiple dose, ascending-dose escalation study and expansion study
      designed to define a maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose of XmAb22841 monotherapy
      and in combination with pembrolizumab; to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, and anti-tumor activity of XmAb22841 monotherapy and in combination with
      pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced solid tumors.
