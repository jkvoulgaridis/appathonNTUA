  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The color change of endodontically treated teeth is a common concern in clinical practice.
      The objective of this study will be to evaluate, in vivo, the color change (ΔE00) caused by
      endodontic treatment. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted with the objective
      of evaluating ΔE00 originated from epoxy resin (AH Plus) and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA
      Fillapex) endodontic sealers, sectioned at the cervical level and 2 mm below, in a period
      between the immediate endodontic treatment versus after 3, 6 and 12 months.

      The sample syze determined that 48 anterior teeth (incisors and canines) and posterior teeth
      (premolars) should be included in the study. The sealer and cut will be randomly determined
      at time of endodontic treatment, originating four groups (n = 12): AH Plus-Cervical, MTA
      Fillapex-Cervical, AH Plus-2mm and MTA-2mm. The endodontic access cavities will be sealed
      with resin composed of the color of the dental element. The mean, standard deviation and
      confidence interval (CI 95%) of the values of ΔE00 obtained for each sealer will be initially
      analyzed using the variable cut level (cervical or 2mm) using the T test. Indeed, the values
      of ΔE00 will be analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, where the level of the cut and the
      type of sealer will be the factors under study.
