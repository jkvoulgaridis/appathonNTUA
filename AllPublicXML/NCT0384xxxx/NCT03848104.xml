  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cephamycin related to 2nd generation cephalosporins, the use of cefoxitin has long been
      limited to antibiotic prophylaxis. Because of its spectrum (sensitive staphylococci,
      enterobacteria including ESBL, streptococci, anaerobes), its stability and its low cost, it
      could be useful in curative bone and joint infections, especially in case of infection
      polymicrobial disease in patients for whom antibiotic alternative per os is limited.
