  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is a common problem after stroke.Patients after stroke with swallow problem will
      have a nasogastric tube to be feeded. In this study , investigators have including and
      excluding criteria. Continous feeding group and intermittent feeding group had been widely
      used in enteral nutrition feeding in investigators' institution. Investigators will observe
      participants' nutrition condition and tube-feeding related complications. In continous group
      patients, participants usually are given prescribed enteral nutrient solution using nutrition
      pump in 24 hours; while in intermittent feeding group, participants will be given prescribed
      enteral nutrient solution in 4-5 times by special syringe. During the whole process,
      investigators will observe all participants' nutrition condition (body mass index, plasma
      albumin and calf girth) and tube-feeding related complications( regurgitation,
      aspiration,gastric retention, diarrhea,constipation). With all those data, the investigators
      will assess which feeding type is better.
