  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rasagiline label report the indication to wait at least 14 days between discontinuation of
      rasagiline and initiation of another MAO inhibitor. This results in a major inconvenience for
      Parkinsonian patients (PD) due to their clinical worsening. Safinamide is a reversible MAO-B
      inhibitor, characterized by a good safety profile. In clinical practice safinamide is often
      introduced instead of rasagiline following an overnight switch. The aim of this study is to
      explore the safety and tolerability of the immediate switch from rasagiline (irreversible
      MAO-B inhibitor) to safinamide, with the expectation that there will be no adverse events or
      increased risk of hypertensive crisis for patients with PD or signs of serotonin syndrome

      Objective: The aim of this study is to verify safety and tolerability of the immediate switch
      from rasagiline to safinamide trough monitoring of BP by 24-hour Holter recording. The
      primary objective of the study will be achieved if the mean BP will not increase by &gt;10 mmHg
      in the studied population.

      Methods: This is an open-label, single-centre study conducted at IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana.
      Study population included patients with idiopathic PD in the mid-late stage of the disease,
      suffering from motor fluctuation, on stable treatment with rasagiline and Levodopa (alone or
      in combination with other anti-parkinsonian medication). The protocol contemplates five
      visits during six weeks, with two 24-hour Holter recording (first in rasagiline and second in
      first-day of safinamide therapy), monitoring typical symptoms of the serotonin syndrome.
