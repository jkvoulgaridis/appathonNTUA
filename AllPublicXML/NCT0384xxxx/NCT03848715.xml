  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling evidence indicates inflammation plays a role in depression, but potential
      mechanisms linking inflammation to depression, such as dysregulated reward processing, are
      poorly understood. This study comprehensively evaluates effects of inflammation on reward
      across dimensions (e.g., anticipating versus receiving a reward) and types (e.g., money vs.
      smiling faces) in younger and older women. Characterizing how inflammation shapes the dynamic
      and multidimensional reward system, and how this may differ by age, may give insight into
      risk factors for depression and help identify critical points for intervention.

      This study will use an inflammatory challenge (i.e., endotoxin) to assess effects of
      inflammation on the behavioral response to social and non-social rewards, using tasks that
      assess reward motivation, sensitivity, and learning. Both elevated inflammation and reward
      dysregulation are associated with depression and have been shown to predict depression onset;
      understanding how inflammation alters the reward system in the laboratory setting may provide
      insight into risk factors and help identify potential areas for intervention. In this
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of low dose endotoxin in 40 adult
      premenopausal women (25-44 y), the investigators will examine effects of endotoxin on reward
      responsiveness across dimensions (i.e., motivation, sensitivity, learning) and reward types
      (e.g., social and non-social). The investigators hypothesize that as compared to placebo,
      endotoxin will 1) decrease non-social reward responses across reward dimensions; 2) decrease
      &quot;general&quot; social reward responses across reward dimensions; 3) increase &quot;close&quot; social reward
      responses across reward dimensions; 4) decrease resting eye blink rate (EBR); EBR will be
      correlated with learning and motivation for non-social reward. The second component of the
      study is to examine whether effects of endotoxin on reward differ as a function of age; in
      particular it is hypothesized that effects will be more robust in younger compared to older
      women. In order to test for age differences, this study will use data from 40 older women
      (65+ y) participating in a parallel ongoing randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier: NCT03256760). Thus, the investigation aims to: 1) Evaluate effects of
      inflammation on non-social reward as a function of age; 2) Evaluate effects of inflammation
      on general and close social reward as a function of age; 3) Examine changes in dopaminergic
      activity as a mechanism linking effects of inflammation on non-social reward processing as a
      function of age.

    <measure>Non-social (monetary) reward response (reward motivation, learning, sensitivity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-injection (approximately 2 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation for monetary reward is assessed with a 10-minute version of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT); change in the amount of hard trials chosen from baseline to post-injection is the outcome measure. Implicit reward learning and sensitivity to monetary reward is assessed with the probabilistic reward task (PRT); change in the magnitude of response bias from baseline to post-injection is the outcome measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General social reward response (reward sensitivity and motivation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-injection (approximately 2 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity to general social reward cues (i.e., response to positive emotional faces) assessed as positive attentional bias with an emotional dot probe task and positive emotion detection with a face morphing task. Outcomes are change from baseline to post-injection in attentional bias (via reaction time) and identification (via reaction time and accuracy) of positive faces. Motivation for general social reward is assessed via self-report; participants rate their desire to engage in 3 different activities, one of which is social, on a 1 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) Likert scale.; change in desire for the social activity from baseline to post-injection is the outcome variable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Close social reward response</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-injection (approximately 2 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants spend 5 minutes talking about a &quot;close other&quot; to a research assistant trained in reflective listening and provide ratings of current negative and positive emotion on visual analogue scales (0=not at all; 100=extremely) using items from the Profile of Mood States. Outcome variables are change in self-report positive emotion from pre to post-discussion, and percentage of positive and negative emotional words used during the discussion (scored with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Software).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anticipatory and Consummatory Daily Reward Response</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days (7 days pre-injection; 7 days post-injection).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicate the extent to which they enjoyed 10 activities (social, non-social, close social) on a 0-100 visual analogue scale (0= not at all; 100=extremely) at five random times during the day; change in enjoyment in each of the domains from pre to post-experimental session is the outcome for consummatory reward. From the same list of activities, participants then rate how much they are currently looking forward to each activity on the same analogue scale (0= not at all; 100=extremely); change from pre to post-experimental session is the outcome for anticipatory reward.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressed Mood Subscale of the Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Depressed Mood Subscale of the POMS is a self-reported assessment of depressed mood in which subjects rate severity of depressed mood using a visual analog scale from 1 to 5 (5 being most severe). Each timepoint is scored and analyses examine the temporal profile of change with assessment every hour</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and negative emotion regulation capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>post-injection (approximately 3 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete a 30 minute standardized emotion regulation task that includes two phases: a reactivity phase and a regulation phase, and assesses the ability to up-regulate positive emotional response to standardized images, and down-regulate negative emotional response to standardized images, both using instructed reappraisal strategies. The dependent variable is the degree to which self-reported emotion changes when reacting to versus reappraising emotion stimuli. Participants rate how negative they feel (1=not at all; 5 = extremely) and how positive they feel (1=not at all; 5 = extremely).</description>
