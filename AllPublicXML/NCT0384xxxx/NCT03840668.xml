      Portable USB-powered eyemasks provide convenience to dry eye sufferers to perform eyelid
      warming at home. Such eyemasks can be plugged into a copyrighted device developed in
      collaboration with Ngee Ann Polytechnic that tracks patients' usage. This revolutionary
      device transmits a signal to an online database whenever the device is used. Through our
      copyrighted Android/ iOS application, you or your physician can monitor the frequency of
      eyelid warming over a long period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a very common condition that can cause blurring of vision associated with reading,
      grittiness, eyelid heaviness and poor tolerance of light. Up to 80% of dry eye is due to
      blocked oil glands in the eyelids known as Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) and scientific
      studies have shown that sustained eyelid warming at 40-42Â°C for at least 8 minutes a day is
      effective to control this condition and increase the tear film layer thickness.

      Portable USB-powered eyemasks provide convenience to dry eye sufferers to perform eyelid
      warming at home. Such eyemasks can be plugged into a copyrighted device developed in
      collaboration with Ngee Ann Polytechnic that tracks patients' usage. This revolutionary
      device transmits a signal to an online database whenever the device is used. Through our
      copyrighted Android/ iOS application, you or your physician can monitor the frequency of
      eyelid warming over a long period. To further encourage eyelid warming to be performed more
      frequently, the signal can also be sent to a participating games server which hastens
      progress in the game. Thus, addiction to online games, which usually worsens symptoms of dry
      eye can now be a way to treat dry eye.
