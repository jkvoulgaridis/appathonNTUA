    <measure>Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RSBQ is a caregiver-completed questionnaire that measures the frequency of current disease characteristics (45 items); each item rated on a 3-point scale (0-2). Higher scores represent greater severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much a patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. (1 = very much improved, to 7 = very much worse.)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 45 items in the caregiver-completed Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire encompass 8 subscales:
1) general mood, 2) breathing problems, 3) hand behaviors, 4) face movements, 5) body rocking/expressionless face, 6) night-time behaviors, 7) anxiety/fear, 8) walking/standing. Higher scores represent greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Global Impressions - Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment relative to the clinician's experience with patients who have the same diagnosis, rating from 1 = normal, not at all ill, to 7 = extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>9-items Motor Behavioral Assessment (MBA-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MBA-9 was derived from the full MBA scale (37 Rett syndrome symptoms) by selecting the items deemed amenable to change and which reflect areas of meaningful clinical change. The severity of current symptoms are rated by the investigator on a 5-point numerical scale, from 0 = normal or never, to 4 = very severe or constant. Higher total scores represent greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CSHQ is a caregiver-completed sleep screening instrument designed for school-aged children, including 33 items within 8 subscales reflecting the following sleep domains:1) bedtime resistance, 2) sleep onset delay, 3) sleep duration, 4) sleep anxiety, 5) night wakings, 6) parasomnias, 7) sleep-disordered breathing, 8) daytime sleepiness. Each item is answered with 1 of 3 markers: &quot;usually&quot; for 5 or more times a week, &quot;sometimes&quot; for 2-4 times a week, and &quot;rarely&quot; for never or 1 time a week. Higher scores reflect more disturbed sleep behaviour.</description>

             participation in the trial.

          -  First or second degree relative with a history of significant ECG abnormalities, in
             the opinion of the investigator (e.g. cardiac arrest, sudden death).

             significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either

             result of the trial, or the patient's ability to participate in the trial.

          -  Any abnormalities identified following a physical examination of the patient that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the patient if she
