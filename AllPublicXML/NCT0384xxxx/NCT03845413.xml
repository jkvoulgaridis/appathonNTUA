      The overall goal of this renewal is three-fold: (1) to continue to sustain and strengthen the
      network; (2) to conduct a group randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a
      theory-based, culturally- and gender-relevant Community Health Worker intervention for
      Brazilian women &quot;light smokers&quot; that will augment the smoking cessation programs offered
      through the public health system; and (3) to expand our current Career Development and
      Research Training Program to the other two major tobacco growing states in order to develop a
      cadre of well-trained researchers who will continue to develop and implement gender-relevant
      comprehensive tobacco control strategies at all levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An understanding of women and their tobacco-related issues, as well as the need for the
      development of gender-relevant tobacco control efforts, have been highlighted as priorities
      in landmark guiding documents published in the past few years (e.g., WHO Framework Convention
      on Tobacco Control-WHO FCTC). Brazil is the second largest producer of tobacco in the world,
      and 95% of the tobacco is produced in the three Southern states (Paraná, Santa Catarina, and
      Rio Grande do Sul). Although, historically, tobacco use among women in developing countries,
      particularly Latin America, has been relatively low as compared to men, the smoking epidemic
      is rapidly spreading to women in developing countries, and these three Southern states have
      the highest prevalence of women smokers in the country. We have established a Network for
      Tobacco Control among Women in Paraná, Brazil with the purpose of establishing community and
      institutional capacity to promote gender-relevant tobacco control efforts among women through
      Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and training. The goals of the network are to
      reduce tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) among women in Paraná,
      and to develop a cadre of well-trained researchers who will continue to address comprehensive
      tobacco control strategies at multiple levels. The network conducted an epidemiological
      survey on the prevalence and factors associated with tobacco use among women across the State
      of Paraná. Based on the results, the network identified four priorities: (1) to implement
      policy changes to decrease ETS; (2) to understand the health/social issues of women in
      tobacco farming; (3) to develop and evaluate a comprehensive, culturally- and gender
      relevant, school-based smoking prevention program; and (4) to improve access and delivery of
      smoking cessation programs through the public health system with a particular focus on &quot;light
      smokers&quot; as 74.8% of women smokers in our study reported smoking 10 or less cigarettes/day.
      The network is currently addressing the first three priorities, including support for
      legislation, which resulted in Paraná having the strongest indoor tobacco ban in the country.

      The overall goal of this renewal is three-fold: (1) to continue to sustain and strengthen the
      network; (2) to conduct a group randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a
      theory-based, culturally- and gender-relevant Community Health Worker intervention for
      Brazilian women &quot;light smokers&quot; that will augment the smoking cessation programs offered
      through the public health system; and (3) to expand our current Career Development and
      Research Training Program to the other two major tobacco growing states in order to develop a
      cadre of well-trained researchers who will continue to develop and implement gender-relevant
      comprehensive tobacco control strategies at all levels.
