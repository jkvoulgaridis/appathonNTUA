      The investigators aim to evaluate the possibility of clinical application of CTC detection in
      samples or peripheral blood of breast cancer patients, so as to act as the new techniques or
      indicators of early diagnosis, therapy efficiency, or postoperative surveillance of breast
      cancer.
