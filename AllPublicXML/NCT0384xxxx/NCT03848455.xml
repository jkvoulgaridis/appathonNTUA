      The research team used meta-analytical statistical methods to integrate the results of
      different research groups on Parkinson's disease, using meta-analysis to find key genes
      related to the pathogenesis and development of Parkinson's disease, and to make small
      clinical results. The verification of the sample, the internal mechanism of the pathogenesis
      of Parkinson's disease and provide guidance and reference for subsequent experimental
      research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a relatively common degenerative disease of the central nervous
      system. As society gradually becomes aging, the number of PD patients is increasing, but its
      exact pathogenesis is still not fully understood. May be related to genetic factors,
      environmental factors, immunological abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
      stress, ageing, apoptosis and other factors; the current genetic diagnosis is in the
      ascendant, making the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease
      more In-depth, provide more basis and means for the pathogenesis and development of
      Parkinson's disease, but due to the number of individual samples, operational norms and
      platform differences, different research groups have great differences in the results of gene
      chip research on Parkinson's mechanism, resulting in the reliability is poor; In order to
      improve the credibility of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and the development of
      genetic diagnosis, the investigators use the statistical means of meta-analysis to integrate
      the results of the chip research on Parkinson's disease in different research groups and find
      synaptic correlation function may be closely related to the development of Parkinson's
      disease, PPP2CA, PPP3CB, SYNJ1, NSF, CYCS genes may be key genes in the pathogenesis of
      Parkinson's disease, and the expression of these genes is related to the pathogenesis and
      development of PD patients. the investigators will conduct a small sample validation in the
      clinic to explore the intrinsic mechanism of Parkinson's disease and follow-up experimental
      research provides guidance and reference.
