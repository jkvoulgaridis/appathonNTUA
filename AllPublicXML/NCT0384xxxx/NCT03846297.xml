  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to improve implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
      implantation decision-making processing relevance by developing a new prediction model of
      sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), including newly identified
      potential biomarkers by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetics, through a prospective
      nationwide study, multivariate analysis and modelling of an absolute risk.

      The secondary objective is to perform a medico-economic analysis of ICD implantation in order
      to define an optimal rule for ICD implantation in patients with HCM, taking into account the
      benefits of ICD, adverse effects of ICD and associated costs (cost of quality adjusted life
      years saved).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCM is a genetic disease, usually autosomal dominant, with a prevalence of about 1/500 in the
      general population. HCM represents a major cause of SCD in the young, and is the first cause
      of SCD in athletes less than 35 years of age. The only efficient prevention of SCD, apart
      from exercise restriction, is ICD.

      Given this dreadful potential outcome of HCM, the identification of patients that should
      receive an ICD is of paramount importance. However, the indications for ICD are controversial
      and very different guidelines are currently available, coming from the American society of
      Cardiology, the French Haute Autorité de Santé and from the European society of Cardiology.
      In addition, these guidelines are all based on retrospective studies and have major
      limitations. The situation faces a critical need of improvement. Thus, this study has been
      designed with the objective to propose a revision of international recommendations for
      defibrillator implantation in HCM patients.

      This prospective multicenter non-interventional single-arm study is planned to be conducted
      in 40 sites with a collection of clinical and biological data, carried out as required for
      the usual management and care of patients. No investigation will be performed specifically
      for this study except for an additional blood sample collection at baseline during routine
      outpatient care and annual interview during follow-up.

    <description>Comparisons of the C-index obtained between with the new score and with the different existing scores or algorithms of actual processing used for ICD decision-making.
C-index is a discrimination index, which will be determined after multivariate analyses and score modeling, in the case of the new score.
This evaluate of the improvement of the ability to predict major clinical events during follow-up will toward to development of a new prediction model in patients with HCM in responding the main objective of the study.
Data will be collected are: (composite end point): SCD, aborted sudden death, appropriate therapy of ICD that is a physiological equivalent of SCD.</description>

        -  Inclusion of adults with HCM, as well as teenagers 16 or older since SCD occurs
             frequently in this age group

          -  Necessary not to include specific etiologies such as amyloidosis because of a known
             different prognosis and natural history

          -  Necessary not to include patients with ICD as secondary prevention because of a
             different prognosis and a worldwide consensus on the need for ICD implantation in this
             case

          -  Necessary to include all cases whatever their date of diagnosis as the predictive
             modelling (primary objective) targets the actual population being followed up in real
             life, and will ultimately be applied on this population
