  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a 3-dose regimen of V160
      administered intramuscular (IM) in healthy Japanese male participants by cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) serostatus. There is no formal hypothesis.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 days after each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will use the vaccination report card (VRC) to document the presence of any solicited injection-site AEs (erythema, pain, swelling) that occurred in the 5 days after each vaccination. The percentage of participants with a solicited injection-site AE will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Solicited Systemic Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days after each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will use the vaccination report card (VRC) to document the presence of any solicited systemic AEs (headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain) that occurred in the 14 days after each vaccination. The percentage of participants with a solicited systemic AE will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Vaccine-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>

The percentage of participants with an SAE considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention will be reported.</description>
