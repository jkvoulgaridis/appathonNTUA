  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France is the country of Europe where the prevalence of pregnant women smokers is the highest
      (35.9% before pregnancy and in the 3rd quarter 21.8% in 2008).

      In the investigator's country, among the smokers of early pregnancy with the usual care, only
      30% manage to stop during pregnancy.

      Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a clearly identified risk factor for the course of
      pregnancy and the unborn child.

      The measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) expired in pregnancy monitoring consultation is part
      of the recommendations of the consensus conference &quot;Pregnancy and Tobacco&quot; (ANAES, October
      2004) and the parliamentary report on smoking by JL Touraine and D. Jacquat (Feb 2012).
      However, this recommendation has not entered the current practice. The research aims to
      justify the clinical relevance of this recommendation by demonstrating the positive impact of
      expired CO measurement on the rate of discontinuation during pregnancy.
