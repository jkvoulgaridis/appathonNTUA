  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a form of psychic and/or physical discomfort caused by the feeling of the
      imminence of a danger. It is a frequent perioperative manifestation of patients.
      Pharmacological premedication is currently used to avoid perioperative anxiety. However, its
      effect is now controversial and non-drug techniques have been also studied.

      The therapeutic communication aims to provide analgesia or anxiolysis to enhance the
      patient's well-being and to separate the patient from the surrounding reality through the
      suggestion of positive images with a chosen verbal and nonverbal approach. This prospective,
      monocentric, comparative, double-blind study aims to evaluate the impact of the training of
      stretcher-bearers in therapeutic communication on the anxiety of patients who go to the
      operating room for an endoscopic examination under general anaesthesia.Two groups of patients
      will be compared: In the first group patients will be accompanied to the operating room by a
      stretcher-bearer trained in therapeutic communication, in the second group patients will be
      accompanied by a stretcher bearer without this specific training.

      Anxiety is a form of psychic and/or physical discomfort caused by the feeling of the
      imminence of a danger. It is a normal reaction of adaptation and defense face to a situation
      lived as hostile. It is a frequent perioperative manifestation. Patients who need an
      intervention are indeed 20% more anxious than the general population. The occurrence of this
      anxiety can have consequences for perioperative medical care influencing morbidity and
      mortality.

      Pharmacological premedication initially prescribed in the 19th century to limit the adverse
      effects of general anesthesia is currently used to fight perioperative anxiety. However, its
      effects are now considered as controversial.

      and non-drug techniques have been studied. They have the advantage of being inexpensive and
      causing little or no adverse effects.

      Therapeutic communication can be defined as a relational technique that seeks to separate the
      patient from the surrounding reality to provide analgesia or anxiolysis through the
      suggestion of positive images with a chosen verbal and nonverbal approach.

      The knowledge of communication techniques resulting from hypnosis by the healthcare team
      could therefore optimize patient medical care in terms of analgesia and the management of
      perioperative anxiety. Therapeutic communication training in the operating room is short and
      accessible to all members of the team regardless of their rank. This is a training provided
      internally by a certified practitioner in therapeutic hypnosis, aiming to give to the
      professionals knowledge to optimize the patient support. At the hospital (Groupement des
      HÃ´pitaux de l'Institut Catholique de Lille), several stretcher bearers have been trained in
      therapeutic communication and are already applying it routinely.

      No study has yet investigated the impact of the use of therapeutic communication in the
      operating room to control the level of anxiety of patients.

      This study is prospective, monocentric, comparative, double blind. Two groups of patients
      will be compared: In the first group patients will be accompanied to the operating room by a
      stretcher-bearer trained in therapeutic communication, in the second group patients will be
      accompanied by a stretcher bearer without this specific training.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety scale: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), form A</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one (before intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is composed of 20 propositions to know how the subject feels. Each item has a score from 1 to 4 (4 being the highest degree of anxiety). The score therefore varies from 20 to 80.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one (before intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The APAIS questionnaire includes 6 questions, 2 of which evaluate the patient's anxiety about anesthesia, 2 questions estimate the anxiety about the procedure, the last 2 questions evaluate the patient's need for information about anesthesia and the procedure. Each question is rated from 1 to 5, the scale allows to calculate 4 scores (anesthetic anxiety/intervention anxiety/global and information request score). Subjects are considered anxious when they have a score higher than 11 for these 4 items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the experience of general anesthesia (EVAN-G) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>In average one day (at hospital discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>EVAN-G questionnaire includes 26 questions. Results are grouped together to define 6 &quot;dimensions&quot;: Focus of attention, Information, Privacy, Pain, Discomfort and Waiting Times. From these scores, an overall satisfaction score is calculated (average of all scores). For each of the scores: the higher the score, the higher the satisfaction.</description>
