  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLL is an incurable disease with conventional chemotherapy. In the absence of TP53
      disruption, a chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) regimen is recommended as front-line and second-line
      treatment in those patients who attained a long progression-free survival (PFS) with the
      previous regimen. Bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is one of the most widely adopted CIT
      regimens, including second-line treatment. Unfortunately, durations of remission following BR
      combination therapy tend to be short in patients with heavily pre-treated disease or who have
      already received rituximab. The incorporation of a maintenance following induction
      chemotherapy to overcome the shorter remission durations in this population is a reasonable
      option.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CD20-positive CLL that meets the iwCLL criteria (Hallek et al,
             2008).

          -  Relapsed or refractory status of disease after at least one prior chemotherapy
             regimen.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 at study entry
