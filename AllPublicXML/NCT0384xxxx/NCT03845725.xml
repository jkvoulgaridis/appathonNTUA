  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the fall and balance conditions of Parkinson's patients
      according to their urinary complaints.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive and common neurodegenerative
      disease.Frequently encountered problems in lower urinary tract complaints; Bladder
      dysfunction, such as urinary entrapment and frequent urination.Urinary incontinence in
      individuals with Parkinson's disease increases the risk of falling.

      The investigators will evaluate 80 patients who attended the Movement Disorders Outpatient
      Clinic of Ordu a University Educational Research Hospital in December 2018 and February 2019,
      and were diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. Other eligibility criteria for participants
      were having good cognitive functions (&gt;24 on Standardized Mini Mental Test) and were
      volunteers who accept to participate in the study. The investigators excluded patients that
      having orthopedic and / or neurological problem affecting walking and balance skills. The
      investigators used Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), modified Hoehn and Yahr
      Stage (H/Y), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Falls-Efficacy Scale (FES), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and
      Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSTS), ICIQ-SF and Overactive Bladder Version-8.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is used as a gold standard reference scale. Each item is scored using a 5-point scale, where 0 means an absence of symptoms and 4 represents the worst stage</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Hoehn and Yahr Stage</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of PD was determined using the Modified Hoehn and Yahr Stage, which contains five stages.
Stage 0: No signs of disease. Stage 1: Unilateral symptoms only. Stage 2: Bilateral symptoms. No impairment of balance. Stage 3: Balance impairment. Mild to moderate disease. Physically independent. Stage 4: Severe disability, but still able to walk or stand unassisted. Stage 5: Needing a wheelchair or bedridden unless assisted.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS consists of 14 items and scores range from 0 (inability to perform the task) to 4 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used to measure the perceived fear of falling. It comprises 10 questions. The score of the scale change 0-100 and the score above 70 indicates the fear of falling.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a reliable and valid measurement tool to assess functional mobility in patients with PD</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ICIQ-SF is a short, easy-to-understand and feasible questionnaire form, which demonstrates the reliability and validity of urinary incontinence and its impact on quality of life. In ICIQ-SF questionnaire, the frequency, amount, type and effects of urinary incontinence on the daily life are questioned and scoring is performed between 0-21 values.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overactive Bladder Version-8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is used for screening and diagnosis of overactive bladder. The BBS consists of 8 items. A total score of ≥8 indicates that the respondent may have an overactive bladder. The total score ranges from 0 to 40.</description>
