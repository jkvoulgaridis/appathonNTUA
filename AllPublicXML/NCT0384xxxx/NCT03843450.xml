      This culture system utilizes the special affinity difference of biomedical material coating
      for different cells to achieve the effect of isolating cancer cells from the blood sample.
      The coating of the system has the characteristic that to make the WBCs adhesion, but the
      cancer cells in the blood sample suspend in the culture medium, which achieves the effect of
      separating cancer cells from the blood. The supernatant with the cancer cells can further be
      isolated from the cultural system for related analysis and detection to achieve early
      diagnosis and screening.

        The study population will include polycythemia patients between the ages of 20 and 70. We
        just use the waste blood from patients' routine phlebotomy therapy. Also, to protect the
        vulnerable subjects, we don't recruit minors, prisoners, aborigines, pregnant women, people
        with mental disorders, students, and subordinates, etc.
