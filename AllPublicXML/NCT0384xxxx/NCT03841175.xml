  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck (HN) cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with around 800 000
      new cases and 320 000 deaths in 2015. These malignancies encompass cancers of the oral
      cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx and concern squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) 90%
      of the time. Despite aggressive treatment strategies, the five-year survival rate has only
      marginally improved in the past decade. The prognosis is strongly dependent on initial
      staging. The 5-year relative survival rate is 80,3% for patients with localized disease
      whereas it decreases to 47.2% when regional lymph node metastasis is known, and to 32.5% when
      distant metastasis is known. Hence, precise cancer staging is essential as it allows
      clinicians to select the appropriate treatment strategies and predict the prognosis of the
      patients.

      The conventional work-up (CWU) includes physical examination, endoscopy, computed tomography
      (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck to evaluate the initial
      local and regional HNSCC staging. Thoracic CT is recommended because the thorax is the most
      frequent location of remote metastasis and synchronous second cancer outside of the upper
      aerodigestive tract.

      Some authors demonstrated that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET) had a higher sensitivity and specificity for determining the extent of the disease and
      was able to detect occult second primaries. Moreover 18-FDG PET-CT allows whole body
      assessment. This is why the use of 18-FDG PET-CT has increased significantly over the last
      several years. Added to initial CWU, 18-FDG PET-CT may restage HNSCC and as a result may
      alter the clinical management.

      Pre-therapeutic 18F-FDG PET/CT is recommended by guidelines to assess remote extension of
      locally advanced HNSCC and/or to look for synchronous cancer but is not systematically
      indicated, particularly for localized disease.

      Restaging impact on prognosis and clinical management remains poorly understood.

      Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the impact of the additional information
      provided by 18F-FDG PET-CT on HNSCC initial staging and whether restaging modify prognosis
      and clinical management, whatever the CWU stage.
