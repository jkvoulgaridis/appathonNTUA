    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone work in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed). Immunotherapy with
      daratumumab may induce changes in body?s immune system and may interfere with the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      daratumumab with dexamethasone and pomalidomide may work bettering in treating patient
      compared to dexamethasone and pomalidomide alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (partial response [PR], very good partial response
      [VGPR], complete response [CR], or stringent complete response [sCR]) of daratumumab
      retreatment in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with
      relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival and overall survival associated with retreatment with
      daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To determine the toxicities associated with retreatment with daratumumab in combination
      with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) .

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and daratumumab
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2, days 1-15 of cycles 3-6, and day 1
      of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
      cycles 1-12. Cycles every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for every 3 months until
      subsequent treatment or progressive disease, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

    <description>A success will be defined as a partial response or better noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>MRD will be assessed on bone marrow aspirate in all patients achieving complete response (CR) or stringent CR (sCR). The proportion of patients who achieve MRD negative status will be estimated by the number of patients who are MRD negative divided by the total number of evaluable patients who achieve CR or sCR. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true MRD negative rate will be calculated.</description>
