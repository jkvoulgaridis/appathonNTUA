      There are so many contradictions over central lymph node dissection in unilateral
      cN0(Clinically N0) differentiated thyroid carcinoma.In order to provides a new theoretical
      basis for the operation of central lymph node in cN0(Clinically N0) differentiated thyroid
      cancer,researchers are going to complete this study to evaluate the significance of
      contralateral central lymph node dissection in unilateral cN0(Clinically N0) differentiated
      thyroid carcinoma.At the same time,it may play a certain impact on the revision of surgical
      guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer.

    <textblock>
      Being the most common thyroid malignant tumor,differentiated thyroid carcinoma often
      metastasize to the neck lymph nodes in the early stage,especially to the central lymph
      node.For management of cervical lymph nodes ,the 2015 American Thyroid Association Management
      Guidelines suggest that thyroid+Prophylactic unilateral or bilateral central lymph node
      dissection should be undertaken in the patients with cN0(Clinically N0) progression (T3, T4)
      and cN1b(Clinically N1b).Chinese guidelines recommend that, in order to avoid operative
      complications as far as possible (i.e. effective protection of the parathyroid gland and
      recurrent laryngeal nerve), lymph node dissection in the central area on the same side of the
      lesion should be performed at least.However, in 2017, the second edition of National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN) thyroid tumor guidelines believed that if lymph nodes in
      the central region were negative,preventive central region lymph node dissection was not
      recommended.In conclusion,there are so many contradictions over central lymph node dissection
      in unilateral cN0 differentiated thyroid carcinoma.However,we also can draw a conclusion that
      it may bring some benefits if bilateral central lymph node dissection were undertaken In some
      cases.According to researchers' preliminary clinical trials,it is not only that there is a
      great probability of metastasis in the ipsilateral central lymph nodes , contralateral
      metastasis is also possible,and even sometimes contralateral central lymph region metastas
      may occur without ipsilateral central lymph nodes metastasis.In order to provides a new
      theoretical basis for the operation of central lymph node in cN0 differentiated thyroid
      cancer,researchers are going to complete this study to evaluate the significance of
      contralateral central lymph node dissection in unilateral cN0 differentiated thyroid
      carcinoma.At the same time,it may play a certain impact on the revision of surgical
      guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer.
