      This study will measure Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a well-documented inflammatory biomarker that
      is increased in the acute phase of stroke, and to compare its levels after the administration
      of melatonin - a well-documented anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant - that regulates
      circadian rhythm, which helps promote sleep.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of debilitation in the first world, with few therapeutic options when
      it comes to improvement in quality of life and morbidity, besides physical and occupational
      therapy. It affects people of all nationalities, creeds, and socioeconomic classes through a
      narrow array of mechanisms. With all those mechanisms, a common outcome is shared:
      derangement of the brain parenchymal architecture. This derangement is non-selective in its
      destruction with obscuration of the blood brain barrier and the glymphatic system, and with
      bleeding as a common sequela; the oxidative stress of the hemoglobin-heme-iron compound
      causing further injury. This study will measure Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a well-documented
      inflammatory biomarker that is increased in the acute phase of stroke, and to compare its
      levels after the administration of melatonin - a well-documented anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant - that regulates circadian rhythm, which helps promote sleep. Any increased time
      spent in a restful state because of melatonin increases the clearance of waste products after
      a catastrophic event, like in stroke.
