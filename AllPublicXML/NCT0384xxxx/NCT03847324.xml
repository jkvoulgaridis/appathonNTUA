  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether adding a treatment using pain neuroscience
      education (PNE) and multimodal physiotherapy to usual care, in subjects with knee
      osteoarthritis and pain catastrophizing, who are scheduled for a total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA), is more effective than only usual care. There is a high evidence level of different
      systematic reviews, which support the efficacy of physiotherapy treatments combined with
      behavioural/educational techniques aimed to reduce pain catastrophism, pain and disability in
      other pathologies. The primary aim of that kind of interventions is to help the subjects to
      reconceptualise its own pain understanding and its role on the recovery process, as well as
      promoting an increase of activity and encourage the subject to resume its usual activity
      instead of continuing to avoid it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of TKA has increased dramatically during the last two decades, its popularity
      can be attributed to its evident success regarding pain improvement, deformity correction and
      disability reduction in knee osteoarthritis subjects. However, only a third of the patients
      report no functional problems after surgery, the 20% of then are unsatisfied with its
      functional skills and around a 20% are experiencing pain, high disability degrees and a
      significant quality of life reduction. This results cannot be fully explained by mechanical
      processes, surgical procedures or surgery variations, but it seems to be related to other
      psychological aspects. Chronic pain subjects often develop maladaptive thoughts and
      behaviours (i.e. pain catastrophism, Kinesiophobia, activity avoidance) which contribute to
      make the subject suffer physically as well as emotionally, and affect on the intensity and
      persistency of pain.

      Although many psychosocial factors have been studied, pain catastrophism has emerged as one
      of the most important predictors for persistent pain after a total knee arthroplasty, as well
      as its severity and duration, that's why it is getting more importance when it comes to study
      chronic pain in this subjects. Reducing pain catastrophism has become a key factor to
      determine the success in the rehabilitation of some maladies accompanied by pain, considering
      that its reduction has been associated with the clinical improvement of pain itself. It has
      been observed that treatments using psychological and psychosocial interventions, therapeutic
      education and coping skills training, or physical therapy and therapeutic exercise, are
      effective techniques to reduce pain catastrophism. Nevertheless, it's still necessary to
      determine whether the maladaptive pain related thoughts approach, using physical therapy and
      behavioural techniques, are able to reduce the risk of suffering postoperative chronic pain.

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks before surgery, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The spanish version of the Euro Quality of Life 5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess the health related quality of life (HRQL).(10) The EQ-5D-5L consists in two pages: the first one is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five response categories: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems.(10) A health state is composed by taking one level for each dimension, and a preference-based scoring function is used to convert the descriptive system to a summary index score (ranging from states worse than dead &lt;0 to full health 1).</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophism</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks before surgery, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish version of Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was used to asses thoughts and feelings related to pain experiences.(9) The PCS is a 13 item self-administered questionnaire composed of 3 subscales: rumination, magnification and helplessness. The PCS uses a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = all the time. Overall scores range from 0 to 52 points, the higher the score, the higher is the pain catastrophism level.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks before surgery, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Spanish version) will be used. The HADS is a 14 item self-administered questionnaire comprised of 2 subscales: depression and anxiety, both composed with 7 items. Each item use a 4-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 to 4. Overall scores range from 0 to 21 points for each subscales, and final score is presented using each subscale scores separately. The higher the score, the higher are the anxiety or depression levels.</description>

    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks before surgery, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) (Spanish version). TSK-11 is a 11 item self-administered questionnaire used to assess the pain-related fear of movement. The TSK-11 uses a 4-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 1 = totally disagree, to 4 = totally agree. Overall scores range from 11 to 44 indicating a higher degree of pain-related fear of movement when the score is higher.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks before surgery, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (Spanish version). The Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale is a 19 item self-administered questionnaire used to asses pain-related self-efficacy. It uses a visual analog scale for each item, ranging from 0 = totally uncapable to 10 = totally capable. Overall score ranges from 0 to 190. The higher the score, the higher is the subjects' self-efficacy.</description>
