    <textblock>
      Patients with known or suspected, in the opinion of an investigator, primary or metastatic
      breast cancer may be eligible for this study. Up to 30 evaluable patients will undergo study
      imaging in this protocol. The imaging procedure may include one or both of the following
      imaging sessions; 1) a 45- 60 minute dynamic scan, starting at approximately the same time as
      the injection and/or 2) a skull base to mid-thigh scan starting approximately 60 minutes post
      injection of [18F]FTT. The planned scanning protocol will be selected by an investigator and
      will be discussed with the subject prior to the imaging visit. The PET/CT scan will include
      an injection of [18F]FTT. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of [18F]FTT in breast
      cancer and compare with PARP-1 activity in tissue, when available. If patients are getting
      neoadjuvant or other systemic therapy, a second optional scan may be performed 1 day to 3
      weeks after therapy begins to evaluate whether response correlates with increase in PARP-1
      activity.response correlates with increase in PARP-1 activity.

      Patients who come to the clinical practices of the University of Pennsylvania for diagnosis
      and/or treatment of a known or suspected breast cancer and who meet the study inclusion
      criteria may be approached by study staff for recruitment into this study. Eligibility
      criteria will be checked and study personnel will provide a copy of the approved consent form
      to the potential subject. Patients will be approached initially in person, by phone or email
      about study participation. The patient will be given an opportunity to go over the consent
      form and have any questions answered by study staff or a study investigator. After discussion
      of the study procedures, risks and benefits, if the subject agrees to participate in the
      study, the [18F]FTT PET/CT will be ordered by a physician and scheduled. Subjects may cancel
      the scan appointment at any time prior to the injection of [18F]FTT with no negative impact
      to them or their medical care at UPenn. A written informed consent will be reviewed with the
      subject and signed prior to any study procedures being performed. Subjects may withdraw from
      the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the
      discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons.
      If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort will be made to contact the
      subject.

      Women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test performed within 1 day prior
      to injection of [18F]FTT.

      The baseline [18F]FTT PET/CT will take place prior to surgical resection of a primary breast
      cancer, or before starting therapy. Adverse event follow up after the PET/CT scan may occur
      by telephone or in person, depending on the subject's schedule. Follow up will take place the
      next available business day (i.e. not a weekend or a holiday). The adverse event monitoring
      period is 24 hours following [18F]FTT injection.

      An optional post-therapy [18F]FTT PET/CT may occur approximately 1 day to 3 weeks after the
      start of new therapy regimen.

      Subjects will be asked to give consent to allow for collection of pathology tissue for use in
      this research study. Archival tissue may be collected from an existing tissue sample.
      Additional tissue may be collected during a clinical biopsy or surgical procedure, if a
      procedure is scheduled as part of their clinical care or, it can be collected for research
      purposes only, if the patient has consented for this additional collection.

      Patients will be asked permission to access their medical records for follow up of their
      clinical care and treatment as part of the consent for this study.

      Long term follow up will occur by medical record review for the duration of the subject's
      cancer care until death or 15 years after enrollment.

    <description>[18F]FTT is an investigational radioactive PET drug used to see PARP-1 activity in tumors. This radioactive imaging drug is injected into the body to see how it goes into places where there is active breast cancer. Using an imaging scan called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT), the radioactive drug can be seen in the body.</description>

      Tissue will only be collected for research purpose, if there is adequate tissue available,

      of cell lines at the time of the clinical biopsy.
