    <textblock>
      Infertility is the failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for one
      year. Primary infertility refers woman who has never conceived, and secondary infertility to
      one who has had a previous pregnancy.The most frequent causes for infertility are ovulatory
      disorder or anovulation (27-30%) , tubal factor(20-22%), abnormal semen parameters(45-50%).
      Unexplained infertility refers to infertile couples in whom standard investigations,
      including tests of ovulation, tubal patency tests and semen analysis are normal. incidence
      15-17% of infertile couples. New guidelines on infertility recommend that women with
      unexplained infertility should be advised for expectant management for 2 years .If pregnancy
      is not achieved after this period In vitro fertilization Should be considered. The Fast Track
      and Standard Treatment trial demonstrated A shorter time to pregnancy and higher per cycle
      pregnancy rates for In vitro fertilization compared with treatment with oral agents or
      gonadotropins in Patients with unexplained infertility. Successful pregnancy after assisted
      reproductive technology is influenced by numerous predictors that have been investigated in
      the previous years. The central predictors of success are the sperm, oocyte quality and
      endometrial receptivity. Oocyte quality depends mainly on the age of the woman , and her
      ovarian reserve. Parameters most commonly studied are the woman's age , her antral follicle
      count , and laboratory tests including serum randomly done during the menstrual cycle levels
      at day 3 of the cycle.
