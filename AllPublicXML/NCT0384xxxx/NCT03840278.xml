      Our objective is to evaluate the function of the bihormonal configuration of the ILet bionic
      pancreas delivering dasiglucagon when compared to the insulin-only configuration of the ILet
      bionic pancreas in a home-use study in adults with type 1 diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to conduct a home-use study testing the Gen 3.2 iLet bionic pancreas system
      in the insulin-only configuration and the bihormonal configuration with dasiglucagion in 10
      adult subjects (≥ 18 years old) with type 1 diabetes in a random-order crossover study under
      real-world conditions. The study will assess the safety and reliability of both iLet
      configurations. Our primary objective is to assess whether the iLet operates as designed
      comparing the insulin-only configuration of the Gen 3.2 iLet bionic pancreas system with the
      bihormonal configuration of the device using dasiglucagon at a concentration of 4 mg/ml. Our
      secondary objective is to assess the impact of both configurations of the Gen 3.2 iLet bionic
      pancreas system on glycemic control, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction among study
      participants, their caregivers, partners, and/or family members. The study follows a
      2-treatment, 2-period crossover design, 2 and will consist of two 7-day study arms in random
      order: one bihormonal bionic pancreas arm using insulin lispro or insulin aspart and
      dasiglucagon, and one insulin-only bionic pancreas arm using insulin lispro or insulin
      aspart.

             of the participant

          5. Previous exposure to dasiglucagon (otherwise known as ZP4207)

          6. Pregnant (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the next 12

         10. History of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, or other pancreatic disease, including
             pancreatic tumor or insulinoma, or history of complete pancreatectomy

         11. Coronary artery disease that is not stable with medical management, including unstable
             angina, angina that prevents moderate exercise (e.g. exercise of intensity up to 6
             METS) despite medical management, or within the last 12 months before screening a
             history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, enzymatic lysis
             of a presumed coronary occlusion, or coronary artery bypass grafting

             sign), or prolonged QT interval (&gt; 440 ms). Other EKG findings, including stable Q
             waves, are not grounds for exclusion as long as the participant is not excluded
             according to other criteria. A reassuring evaluation by a cardiologist after an
             abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

             hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver, hemochromatosis,
             glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes significant compromise

         16. Personal history of pheochromocytoma, MEN 2A, MEN 2B, neurofibromatosis, or von
             Hippel-Lindau disease

             a.Fractionated metanephrines will be tested to rule out pheochromocytoma in patients
             with symptoms that could be related to a catecholamine secreting tumor, including
             those with: Episodic or treatment refractory (requiring 4 or more medications to
             achieve normotension) hypertension, Paroxyms of tachycardia, pallor or headache

             mm Hg despite treatment

         19. Recent history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia in the last 6
             months. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event that required assistance of another
             person due to altered consciousness, and required another person to actively
             administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. This means that the
             participant was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat
             himself/herself, was unable to verbalize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented,

             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect
             glucose regulation.

         23. Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be
             susceptible to RF interference

         24. Unable or unwilling to completely avoid acetaminophen for duration of study

             used in the study

         26. History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea or vomiting

         27. History of severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or lactose

         28. History of eating disorder within the last 2 years, such as anorexia, bulimia, or
             diabulemia or omission of insulin to manipulate weight

         29. Current or planned use of SGLT2 inhibitors (prior use more than 3 months prior to
             enrollment is acceptable; SGLT2 inhibitors should not be initiated during the trial)

         30. If using GLP1, pramlintide, or metformin must be on a stable dose for 3 months prior
             to enrollment (these agents should not be initiated during the trial)

         31. Required use of 2 or more steroid bursts in the 6 months prior to the trial

         32. History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
             hypoglycemia requiring treatment

         33. Any factors that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or clinical
             protocol chair, would interfere with the safe completion of the study, including
             medical conditions that may require hospitalization during the trial

          <description>Each sequence of the study will use the iLet Bionic Pancreas. The iLet is an autonomous infusion pump controlled by the bionic pancreas control algorithm that calculates and doses insulin and/or dasiglucagon based on glucose values received by the Dexcom G5 Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM).
Participants were randomized to either first use the bihormonal iLet bionic pancreas for 1 week followed by the insulin-only iLet bionic pancreas for 1 week or to first use the insulin-only iLet bionic pancreas for 1 week followed by the bihormonal iLet for 1 week.</description>
