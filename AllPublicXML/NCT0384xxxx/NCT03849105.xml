      tolerability, dosing schedule, and preliminary efficacy of carrier-added
      4-L-[131I]iodo-phenylalanine (131I-IPA), administered as single or repetitive injections in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), concomitantly to 2nd line external
      radiation therapy (XRT) - IPAX-1

           2nd line XRT in recurrent GBM

        2. To evaluate the feasibility of a fractionated administration of 131I-IPA

        3. To evaluate the radiation absorbed dose to tumour from 131I-IPA

        4. To confirm biodistribution and absorbed doses to whole body and organs from 131I-IPA

        5. To explore the antineoplastic effect of 131I-IPA + XRT combination therapy

        6. To explore the occurrence and frequency of pseudo-progression (PP) in response to
           131I-IPA + XRT combination therapy

        7. To explore the cognitive function before, during and after therapy
