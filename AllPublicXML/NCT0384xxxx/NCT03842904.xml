      A randomised, open label 2-way cross-over study to compare the effects of inhaled
      Beclometasone/Formoterol/Glycopyrronium (TRIMBOW) pMDI to Beclometasone/Formoterol (FOSTAIR)
      pMDI on hyperinflation and expiratory flow limitation in moderate to severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the contributions of extra-fine glycopyrronium and formoterol
      (within triple therapy) to improvements in small airway function in COPD patients. This will
      be achieved by recruiting patients with hyperinflation, and measuring improvements in
      hyperinflation and expiratory flow limitation as measurements of small airway disease.

      This study will help understand the mechanisms of action of the bronchodilators within
      BDP/FF/GB, and potentially encourage treatment of small airway disease in COPD with
      extra-fine bronchodilator treatments. This trial will be conducted in compliance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and amendments) current Good Clinical Practices and all other
      applicable laws and regulations.

             plethysmography or spirometry at screening, (V1) or baseline (V2).

             the excipients contained in any of the formulations used in the trial which may raise

             investigator's judgement.

         12. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at screening indicating a significant
             or unstable concomitant disease which may impact the efficacy of the study drug or the
             safety of the patient, according to investigator's judgement.

         13. Subjects with a history of chronic uncontrolled disease including, but not limited to,
             endocrine, active hyperthyroidism, neurological, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal,
             haematological, urological, immunological, or ophthalmic diseases that the
             Investigator believes are clinically significant.

         14. Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease: arrhythmias, angina, recent or suspected
             myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, a history of unstable, or
             uncontrolled hypertension, or has been diagnosed with hypertension in the 3 months
             prior to screening or randomisation.

             visit.

         16. Has had major surgery, (requiring general anaesthesia) in the 8 weeks prior to
             screening or prior to randomisation, or has planned surgery through the end of the
             study.

         17. Previous lung resection or lung reduction surgery.

         18. Participation in another clinical trial and received investigational drug within 30
             days (or 5 half-lives whichever is longer). N.B.: For biologic products with slow
