  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a cluster randomized study of an ICU level intervention to reduce high risk of
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in family members of ICU patients.

      Participating ICUs had restrictive visiting policies (i.e., &lt;6 hours/day) before
      randomization.

      After an observational period and a washout period, participating ICUs were randomized either
      to maintain their visiting policies or to liberalize their visiting policies (24 hours a day,
      7 days a week.)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family members of ICU patients are particularly exposed to anxiety, depressive, acute stress
      disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD).

      It is currently unknown what type of interventions/ strategies to cope with postintensive
      care syndrome family would produce the best improvement. Experts suggest that symptoms in
      family members are potentially amenable to intervention by ICU staff. One intervention to
      reduce PTSD could be a liberalization of the visiting hours. However, restrictions on
      visiting hours in the intensive care unit (ICU) are usually adopted worldwide.

    <description>Beliefs and Attitudes toward Visitation in ICU Questionnaire (BAVIQ). Beliefs and attitudes of ICU staff members were recorded at the beginning of period 1 (observation period) and at the end of period 2 (intervention period) using a questionnaire named the Beliefs and Attitudes toward Visitation in ICU Questionnaire (BAVIQ). The &quot;Beliefs&quot; questionnaire contains both positively and negatively formulated questions. To calculate an overall score for nurses 'beliefs, we recoded the responses on the negatively formulated questions. Subsequently, we computed the average score over all the belief items. A score of zero corresponded with beliefs that are strongly opposed to open visitation and a score of 4 corresponded with beliefs that are strongly in favor of open visitation.</description>
