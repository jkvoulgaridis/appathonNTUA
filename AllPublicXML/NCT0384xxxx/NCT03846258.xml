  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to determine which dialysis solution, low bicarbonate fluid (22
      mmol/L) or high bicarbonate fluid (32 mmol/L), is better in subjects with acute kidney injury
      (acute kidney failure) and metabolic acidosis that are admitted to the intensive care unit
      and require continuous renal replacement therapy (also known as continuous dialysis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial that will be conducted at Mayo Clinic in Rochester
      Minnesota. It will be based on Good Clinical Practice Standards and performed under IRB
      supervision. This will be a pragmatic clinical trial due to the nature of the intervention
      and short interval for making a clinical decision. While dialysis in general is valid in
      cases of severe AKI and metabolic acidosis, there remains uncertainty as to which replacement
      fluid to use. In one retrospective study, using high bicarbonate replacement fluid was
      associated with worse outcomes, even after accounting for several important confounders.
      While this intervention is valid in cases of severe metabolic acidosis (pH&lt;7), there has not
      been much data to support the use of either intervention in cases of any metabolic acidosis
      in general.

      While both interventions are equally valid, to our knowledge, there is no randomized clinical
      trial evaluating the difference of either intervention on outcomes. There is limited evidence
      in the literature on benefit or harm associated with either of the interventions on the
      outcomes thus generating a clinical equipoise. This pivotal study should help guide
      nephrologists and intensivists on the appropriate prescription of CRRT.
