      English Summary And Abstract

      The overall anesthetic goal for the newly transplanted kidney is to maintain intravascular
      volume and avoid decreased perfusion by maintaining main arterial blood pressure (MAP). The
      participants with end-stage renal disease(ESRD) present with electrolyte and metabolic
      abnormalities such as hyponatremia, hyperchloremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia,
      hypermagnesemia and metabolic acidosis. With fluid therapy for the participants with (CKD),
      electrolytes are potentially affected. So there is a progressive metabolic acidosis. The
      debate about the type of fluid to be used in renal transplant participants is on-going.

      Material and methods Place of research is the Department of Anesthesia and Surgical ICU,
      Urology and Nephrology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura,
      Egypt.Total duration will be assumed to conduct the search over one year. A prospective
      cohort study and sample size 50 participants aged18 to 40 years. Written informed consent
      will be obtain from the participants with chronic renal failure scheduled for living-related
      kidney transplantation surgery .

      Basal Serum major cations Na,K,Ca,Mg and Cl, Albumine and after completion of the vascular
      anastomosis.Fluid therapy volume 40ml/kg From the start of surgery until the renal vessels
      are unclamped after completion of the vascular anastomosis. and the type of fluid is
      determined by major cations values. Heart rate ,Systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood
      pressure,will be record after induction of anesthesia, every 30 minutes till at the time of
      renal artery clamping in the donor, at unclamping of the vessels , after completion of the
      vascular anastomosis and at the end of surgery.the investigator also record renal ischemia
      time.Time of onset of urine production on unclamping of the renal artery .Total urine output
      from unclamping of the renal vessels to the end of the surgery.Kidney turgidity will
      evaluated .

      All participants transfer to post-anaesthesia care unit then to ICU .Daily serum creatinine,
      creatinine clearance, a total urine output and any renal complications will be record for
      first 5 days postoperatively .

      and Nephrology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.

      Total duration assumed to conduct the search over one year.

      Preoperative management Will be that

        -  All transplantations in this study will be performed by the same surgical team. All
           undergo participants preoperative hemodialysis 24 hours before renal transplant surgery.

        -  Full medical and surgical history will be taken, and

        -  Routine laboratory investigations (eg. blood Hb, plasma proteins, coagulation studies,
           serum electrolytes, blood glucose, arterial blood gases, chest radiograph, and
           echocardiography).

        -  Basal Serum major cations Na,K,Ca,Mg and Cl, Albumine

      Intraoperative management will be

        -  On the morning of surgery intra muscular injection of Morphine 0.1mg\kg and diclofenac
           Na 0.6mg/kg. ketamine infusion by rate 0.1 mg /kg/ h

        -  Monitoring before induction of anesthesia, 5-lead electro cardio gram, pulse oximetry,
           and noninvasive arterial blood pressure are record. Central venus catheter will be
           aseptically inserted into the right internal jugular vein ,

        -  Induction of general anesthesia is with IV midazolam 0.15 mg/kg ,fentanyl 1micogram /kg,
           and sodium thiopental 5% 5mg/ kg. Endotracheal intubation is facilitated by rocuronium
           0.5 mg/kg Anesthesia is maintained by sevoflurane (MAC )minimal alveolar concentration
           (1%) with 40% O2. Minute volume is adjusted to keep end-tidal CO2approximately 35 mm Hg.

        -  Fluid therapy volume 40-50 ml/kg From the start of surgery until the renal vessels are
           unclamped after completion of the vascular anastomosis. and the type of fluid is
           determined by major cations values.

      K &gt; 4.0 ml Eq/dl the investigator use saline 0.9% K&lt;3.5ml Eq/dl us the investigator ringer
      acetate . k&gt; 5.0ml Eq/dl the investigator use glucose 25% 8gm+ 10 unite insulin in saline
      0.9%+salbutamol 200mg.

      G Na &gt;140ml Eq/dl the investigator use ringer acetate . Na &lt;135ml Eq/dl the investigator use
      saline 0.9%. and Na bicarbonate (Na H2CO3) with dose = body weight x base deficit x 0.4 x 1/2

      Cl &gt;105 ml Eg/dl the investigator use ringer acetate. Mg&lt;2ml Eq/dl investigator use Mg
      sulfate 10mg/kg infusion Ca &lt;9ml Eq/dl investigator use Ca gluconate 10% 0.25ml/kg infusion.

        -  From the start of surgery until the renal vessels are unclamped after completion of the
           vascular anastomosis. Norepinephrine will infused using infusion pump with started rate
           0.01ml/ h and will be adjusted to maintain arterial blood pressure within 25% of the
           basal value after unclamping at the end of vascular anastomosis or mane arterial blood
           pressure &lt;60 ml mercury.

        -  During vascular anastomosis, all recipients will receive 500 mg prednisolone as prepared
           by the attending nephrologist. After completing the renal vascular anastomosis,
           furosemide was given in20mg increments to enhance diuresis post vascular anastomosis

        -  Serum major cations Na,K,Ca,Mg and Cl,Albumine and arterial blood gases will be sampled.

        -  Heart rate ,Systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure,will be record after
           induction of anesthesia, every 30 minutes till at the time of renal artery clamping in
           the donor(onset of ischemia), at unclamping of the vessels after completion of the
           vascular anastomosis (end of ischemia),and at the end of surgery.

        -  The investigator also record renal ischemia time.

        -  Time of onset of urine production on unclamping of the renal artery in minute.

        -  Total urine output from unclamping of the renal vessels to the end of the surgery.

        -  Kidney turgidity will evaluated by the surgical team members, 3-point scale: score I
           (soft graft), score II (moderate turgid graft), and score III (highly turgid and firm
           graft).

      Post operative management,

        -  All participants will be assessed for the presence of tissue edema, especially in the
           conjunctiva, eyelids, face,and upper airway

        -  All participants had a routine postoperative chest radiograph to look for signs of
           pulmonary edema and to exclude pneumothorax.

        -  Daily serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and total urine output will be record for
           5 days postoperatively.

        -  the investigator also will record any renal complications in the first 5 days (e.g.,
           acute graft rejection, acute tubular necrosis, or need for hemodialysis).

      Statistical Analysis

      The calculated sample size of the study will be 23 at 5% participants level of significance
      and 80 % power, using the following formula:

      N= (Z1-α/2+Z1-β) ² σ1* σ2 / δ Z1-α/2 = 1.96 Z1-β= 0.842 σ = (Standard deviation δ = Expected
      difference to be detected between the sample and population α = Level of acceptability of a
      false positive result (level of significance=0.05) β = Level of acceptability of a false
      negative result (0.20)

      1- β= power (0.80) The sample size will be increased to 50 participants to compensate for
      drop outs or protocol failures with incomplete data and to increase the study power.
