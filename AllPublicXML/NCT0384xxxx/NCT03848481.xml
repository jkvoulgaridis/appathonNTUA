        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female child outpatients aged 5 to 30 years.

          2. Diagnosis of PWS confirmed by genetic testing and patient medical records and history.

          3. Stable pharmacologic, educational, behavioral and/or dietary interventions for 4 weeks
             prior to the study start, and for the duration of the study.

          4. Have a physical exam and laboratory results that are within the norms for PWS5.
             Presence of a parent/caregiver/guardian that is able to consent for their
             participation and complete assessments regarding the child's development and behavior
             throughout the study. Child Assent will be obtained if the subject is 7 years of age
             or older and has the mental capacity to understand and sign a written assent form
             and/or give verbal assent.

          5. Score on the Clinical Global Impression Scale Severity (CGI-S) ≥ 4 (moderate severity)
             at baseline.

          6. Score of ≥18 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) at baseline.

          7. Agree not to drive or operate machinery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exposure to any investigational agent in the 30 days prior to randomization.

          2. Prior chronic treatment with CBD, CBDV or an endo-cannabinoid treatment.

          3. Positive testing for THC or other drugs of abuse via urine testing at the screening
             visit or baseline visits upon repeat confirmation testing.

          4. Lifetime history of drug abuse including marijuana/cannabis use.

          5. A primary psychiatric diagnosis other than PWS, including bipolar disorder, psychosis,
             schizophrenia, PTSD or MDD. These patients will be excluded due to potential
             confounding results.

          6. A medical condition that severely impacts the subject's ability to participate in the
             study, interferes with the conduct of the study, confounds interpretation of study
             results or endangers the subject's well-being (including but not limited to hepatic or
             renal impairment and cardiovascular disease).

          7. Known or suspected allergy to CBDV or excipients used in the formulation (i.e.
             sesame).

          8. Renal, pancreatic, or hematologic dysfunction as evidenced by values above upper
             limits of normal for BUN/creatinine, or values twice the upper limit of normal for
             serum lipase and amylase, platelets &lt;80,000 /mcL, or WBC&lt;3.0 103 /mcL.

          9. Liver dysfunction manifested by &gt; 3 X UNL values of AST or ALT

         10. ECG abnormality at baseline screening or clinically significant postural drop in
             systolic blood pressure at screening. If the initial screening ECG shows a QTcB of
             greater than 460 msec, then 2 additional ECGs will be conducted in the same sitting, 5
             minutes apart. If not recognized at screening, then a full triplicate repeat showing
             an average QTcB of 460 msec or less to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria

         11. Female subjects who are pregnant will be excluded from the study. If a female subject
             is able to become pregnant, she will be given a serum pregnancy test before entry into
             the study. Female subjects will be informed not become pregnant while taking CBDV.
             Female subjects must tell the investigator and consult an obstetrician or
             maternal-fetal specialist if they become pregnant during the study.
