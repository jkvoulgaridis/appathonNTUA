    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center phase 1 clinical study aimed at determining the
      maximum-tolerated dose and safety of the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) and
      pracinostat (P) in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed/Refractory AML (RR-AML) is a serious medical condition where overall less than 10%
      survive beyond five years. Among RR-AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, this
      problem is magnified, and survival is measured in months. Hence, there is an urgent need for
      more efficacious and tolerable therapies for RR-AML.

      The majority of AML expresses the cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33) surface antigen.
      Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) is a recombinant, humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody
      covalently attached to the cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. GO binds to the CD33
      antigen on AML cells forming a complex which is internalized, resulting in the intracellular
      delivery of calicheamicin. Calicheamicin then binds to DNA in the minor groove, inciting DNA
      double strand breaks and triggering cell death. GO was recently FDA approved for patients
      with AML who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy, and additionally received FDA approval
      in the RR-AML setting on the basis of a modest complete response (CR) rate of 26% [95%
      confidence interval (CI) 16-40%].

      The investigators are studying whether the addition of the Histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor pracinostat to GO is safe, and effective. HDACs plays important role in
      transcription regulation and in the pathogenesis of cancer. HDAC inhibitors induces histone
      hyperacetylation, resulting in an open chromatin structure and restore transcription of
      critically silenced genes. In AML, early clinical trials using single agent Pracinostat have
      demonstrated potential activity against the disease.

      In the context of GO, the investigators hypothesize HDAC inhibition may potentially synergize
      with GO to improve response against AML. Through HDAC inhibition mediated histone unwinding,
      open chromatin could allow for increased DNA delivery of calicheamicin within AML blasts and
      increased apoptosis. Further, pre-clinical data suggests HDAC inhibition could also increase
      CD33 expression in myeloid leukemia cells, thereby allowing for increased GO binding to AML
      blasts. This is the basis for the combination of these agents.

    <description>Maximum-tolerated (MTD) dose of pracinostat in combination with fixed dose GO induction will be determined by the 3+3 design rules. If there are no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first three patients, the dose of pracinostat will be escalated to 60mg. Escalation to the next dose level will be done only after the third patient on the previous dose level has been observed for 28 days, and no DLTs were noticed. If there is 1 DLT, an additional 3 patients will be tested at same dose level. If there are ≥ 2 DLTs in three or six patients, the study will be placed on hold. If there is &lt; 2 DLTs in the first three or six patients, the dose of pracinostat will be escalated to 60mg. If there are no DLTs in the first three patients at 60mg, an additional three patients will be enrolled to ensure six patients are treated at the MTD.</description>

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice two effective methods of
                  contraception from the time of signing of the informed consent form through three
                  months after the last dose of study drug, AND

               -  Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention

             to one of the following:

               -  Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period
                  and through 90 days after the last study drug dose, OR
