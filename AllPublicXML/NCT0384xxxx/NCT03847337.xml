  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are trying to find new ways to screen for autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) in young children. The investigators want to see if people like pediatricians
      can screen children for ASD while a psychologist watches on a monitor. The investigators are
      testing two screening tools. The investigators want to see if they are good at identifying
      children with ASD and children without ASD. The investigators hope this research will make it
      easier for families to get answers when there are concerns for ASD.

      The investigators will evaluate and compare two telemedicine assessment tools (TELE-STAT and
      TELE-ASD-PEDS) that could allow parents or naive providers in remote locations to complete an
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) risk assessment via telemedicine consultation via an expert
      psychologist. These tools will be low cost, compliant with privacy rules, easily deployed in
      community practice settings, and explicitly designed to work within paradigms that may be
      pragmatically and financially viable for systems of care housing remote clinicians. These
      telemedicine tools could provide methodologies wherein children could be rapidly linked to
      and appropriately assessed by ASD experts within practice locations where the children are
      currently receiving care. In turn, these children, who without such assessment may wait
      months or over a year in many circumstances to access assessments and interventions, may be
      able to receive appropriate ASD assessments within days or weeks of screening/surveillance
      concerns within practice settings where the children are already accessing and familiar with
      (i.e., minimizing loss to referral and follow-up)
