  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the accuracy, efficacy, and durability of
      the OpSens Medical OptoWire Deux pressure wire in the assessment of angiographically
      intermediate proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenoses in clinical
      practice.

      This study is designed as a prospective, observational in nature, multi-center, single-arm,
      clinical registry to estimate the ischemic burden of angiographically intermediate proximal
      LAD stenosis in clinical practice using the OpSens Medical OptoWire Deux FFR system. Subjects
      with stable angina or unstable angina who are found to have an intermediate proximal LAD
      stenosis on coronary angiography with anatomy amenable to PCI and underwent physiological
      lesion assessment with the OptoWire Deux pressure wire and OCT as part of their routine
      procedures using standard of care techniques will be enrolled. Patients meeting enrollment
      criteria will be offered the opportunity to enroll in this observational registry
      post-procedure. All patients enrolled in this study are expected to be evaluated and treated
      using a standard of care technique. This study will enroll a total of 60 patients at Columbia
      University Medical Center and St. Francis Hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, &gt;18 years of age.

          -  Patients with stable angina, unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial
             infarction (if the LAD lesion is the non-culprit lesion) and in whom an intermediate
             proximal LAD de novo stenosis (30-80%) with TIMI flow 3 has been identified on
             angiography. Note: Patients with multi-vessel disease can be enrolled.

          -  Patients have had fractional flow reserve (FFR) and optical coherence tomography (OCT)
             of the LAD with the OpSens FFR system as part of their routine evaluation as standard
             of care procedure.

          -  Provides written, informed consent and HIPAA consent to use the data in a clinical
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (General exclusion criteria)

          -  Patients presented with NSTEMI with the LAD involved as the culprit lesion

          -  Any ST-elevation myocardial infarction within the past 30 days.

          -  Hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressor or mechanical circulatory support.

          -  Prior heart transplant.

          -  Known left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%.

          -  LAD supplying akinetic or severely hypokinetic territories if already known based on
             prior imaging.

          -  Patient is enrolled in another clinical study that may impact the results of this
             study.

          -  FFR not acquired per instructions for the OpSens Wire.

          -  LAD Lesion not assessed with OCT.

        (Angiographic exclusion criteria)

          -  Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 2 or lower at baseline angiography.

          -  Target lesion involves left main (stenosis &gt;50%).

          -  Previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent in LAD or left main
             trunk.

          -  Presence of chronic total occlusion in any vessel.

          -  Presence of a side branch≥2.75 mm with ≥70% stenosis in the LAD.

          -  Bifurcation lesion that resulted in the stent implantation of a side branch.
