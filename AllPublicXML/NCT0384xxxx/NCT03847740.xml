    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare, during general anesthesia using neuromuscular blocking
      agent, the feasibility of a new mechanographic device (ITF handle and Visual ITF software)
      with a standard acceleromyographic device (TOF Watch SX) and also to assess its safety during
      the first 24 hours after surgery.

      The two devices will be studied simultaneously in each patient.

    <description>Delay of the gear ratio from train of four to 25; 75 and 90%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>When the TOF ratio will be greater than 0.9 on the TOF Watch side, the degree of residual paralysis will be assessed on the ITF side using 100 Hz tetanus stimulation repeated 5 times at 2 minutes interval</measure>

    <description>The response of theses tetanus stimulations will be compared with the one observed before myorelaxant administration but after induction of anesthesia</description>
