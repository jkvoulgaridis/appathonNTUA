    <textblock>
      This is a real life observational longitudinal study aiming to identify autoimmune
      manifestations in patients treated with &quot;checkpoint inhibitors&quot; in mono or combo therapy in
      real life.

      The study is based on patients reported experience validated by physician, recruited in
      cancer centers in France with another data collection from a French healthcare data claims
      database and a biological collection.
