      Prospective, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study to compare visual
      acuity outcomes to data obtained in a similar study by the same principal investigator on the

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study, whereby
      patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have mono- or bilateral implantation of
      trifocal toric intraocular lenses POD FT. The study is aimed to compare visual acuity
      outcomes the FineVision POD FT IOL to data obtained in a similar study by the same principal
      investigator on the trifocal FineVision POD F IOL (study no. PHY1802, ClinicalTrials.gov ID:
      NCT03688425), whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral
      implantation of trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted with the
      FineVision POD FT IOL in both eyes or, in case the corneal astigmatism in one of the two eyes
      of the same patient is too small to implant a toric lens, the FineVision POD F IOL will be
      implanted in this eye (both lenses: PhysIOL, Liège, Belgium).

      The devices under investigation (FineVision POD FT and POD F) are trifocal glistening-free
      acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL sa/nv.
      The main difference between the lenses is that that the POD FT IOL is the toric version of
      the POD F IOL. The IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients
      suffering from cataract development.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 11 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 8 postoperative) over a period of 24 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the 6 months follow up visit and secondary
      endpoint data will be collected at the 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 month, 6, 12 and 24 months
      postoperative visits. Data analyses will be done after the last patient finished the final
      examination to support the study publication plan

    <description>Photopic and mesopic pupil diameters are measured with a precision of at least +/-0.5 mm. For the photopic pupil diameters, eye illumination should be identical to that used for photopic contrast sensitivity testing. For the mesopic pupil diameters, eye illumination should be identical to that used for mesopic contrast sensitivity testing. It is required that pupil measurements be made with an infrared pupillometer / CCD camera. Pupil measurements should only be made after the eye has had time to fully adapt to the testing conditions (at least 10 minutes).

The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined.

    <description>This examination shall only be performed in eyes implanted with POD FT lenses. To determine the rotational stability of the toric lenses after implantation, the actual IOL orientation has to be recorded as the intended surgical position during surgery using a photograph through the surgery microscope or other technique in order to document the rotational position of the IOL. Additional orientations are measured and recorded at the follow up visits by taking retroilluminated photographs in mydriasis using the slit lamp.
To determine the rotational stability it is important that the IOL axis marks of the toric IOL are visible as well concurrent structures of the eye (in the same image) that are fixed and stable. Preferred fixed structures are limbal vessels. The pupil is dilated if necessary to visualize the IOL axis marks.</description>
