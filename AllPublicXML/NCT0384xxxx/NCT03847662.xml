  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This repeated measures, cluster randomized, cohort trial design was carried out in three
      provinces in the northern mountainous area of Vietnam. Communes here were randomly selected
      for community based interventions with local production complimentary foods and marketing and
      distribution of fortified complimentary foods.

      In rural northern Vietnam, childhood stunting rates are high. In LÃ o Cai province, female
      subsistence farmers grow crops, but face barriers sending produce to markets. The present
      intervention purchases local crops from local women subsistence farmers which are processed
      in local small-scale food processing facilities to produce instant fortified complementary
      foods for weaning.

      Methods: A repeated measures survey was conducted from October to November 2016, with
      Caregiver-Child(&lt;2y) pairs (n=800) in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Ha Giang.
      Anthropometric data of mother/child dyads was assessed and logistic regression analysis of
      stunted and underweight children explored associated factors. These included: core infant and
      young child feeding practices indicators, food insecurity, antenatal care check-ups, core
      water/sanitation, anemia and hygiene indicators.

      This project leveraged the experience of the National Institute of Nutrition of Vietnam to
      ensure HACCP standards during manufacture. Locally grown rice was combined with a Zn/Fe
      premix before extrusion and hammer-milling. Local vegetables such as: &quot;Sweet leaf&quot; (Sauropus
      androgynous), pumpkin, Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) and carrots were made into
      complimentary foods and sold locally.

    <description>Nine communes were randomly selected with the cluster inclusion criteria as having high levels of; agricultural production, childhood under-nutrition and food security. This was carried out in the three rural mountainous provinces of Lao Cai, Lai Chau, and Ha Giang. In each of these provinces, one district and three subsequent communes were selected, for a total of 9 communes. The districts of Bat Xat, Tam Duong, and Vi Xuyen were selected in Lao Cai, Lai Chau and Ha Giang province respectively. This second stage district sampling selected sites with similar characteristic of population density, area, number of women of reproductive age(15-35y), percentage of children(&lt;2y), income primarily from agricultural production, poverty and climate data.
Changes were observed on food security and nutritional status with exposure to community based self reported purchasing local agricultural products and access to locally produced fortified complimentary foods.</description>

        Perspective participants from these 9 communes, were invited to participate based on the
        inclusion criteria of the project and randomization lists will be made from the lists of
        children (&lt; 2y) from the commune health centers. From these lists, 800 children will be
        randomly selected and categorized by age into different groups: 100 infants of 0-5 months,
        400 infants of 6-12 months, and 200 children of 12-23 months will be selected.

        A initial cross-sectional Baseline survey with a was conducted from October to November
        2016, with Caregiver-Child(&lt;2y) pairs (n=799) in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Ha
        Giang.
