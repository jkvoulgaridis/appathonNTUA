  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are: (1) to determine the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle
      co-activation ratio of level walking and stair negotiation under three different conditions
      (shoes only, shoes embedded 3D printed insoles, and shoes embedded 5-degree lateral wedges),
      (2) to build a detailed patient-specific knee model via MR images and musculoskeletal model,
      then, evaluate the compressive forces acting on the medial aspect of the knee during level
      walking and stair negotiation.

      This study is a cross-sectional study with patients serving as their own control. The
      investigators will recruit 20 patients with knee osteoarthritis. Using motion capture system,
      force plates, wireless EMG to capture the motion data of patients during walking and stair
      negotiation in each condition.
