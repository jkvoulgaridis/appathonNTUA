  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will undertake a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial to implement and
      evaluate a proactive model of care (SMARTCare) during active cancer treatment that
      incorporates self-management support (SMS). Patients allocated to the control arm will
      receive care from ambulatory clinic nurses trained in SMS. Patients allocated to the
      intervention arm will will receive care from ambulatory clinic nurses trained in SMS, in
      addition to being given access to a web-based, self-management education program and
      nurse-led health coaching during the first four months following the first systemic therapy
      administration.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-management describes patient's behaviours and skills to manage the physical and
      psychosocial impact of their illness. Empirical evidence shows that patient activation in
      self-management results in improved disease control and quality of life (QOL), and lower
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations (ED+H) and costs in other chronic
      conditions. Previous research conducted by the investigators of this study has shown that the
      quality of SMS in ambulatory care was poor and patients felt unprepared to manage
      treatment-related toxicities. Building on previous work, this study will evaluate a
      multi-faceted proactive model of care that includes: (1) training in self-management support
      (SMS) strategies for ambulatory nursing staff; (2) a web-based self-management education
      program for patients; and (3) provision of proactive, nurse-led health coaching during the
      first four months following the first systemic therapy administration. Using a
      computer-generated permuted blocks randomization scheme (permuted blocks of random size)
      stratified by cancer type and centre, 160 evaluable patients will be enrolled across the
      three participating regional cancer centres. 80 patients will be randomized to the
      intervention arm and 80 to the control arm. The primary objective of this study is to compare
      the feasibility and acceptability of the SMARTCare intervention to the active comparator
      (control arm). The secondary objectives are to: (1) assess the effect of the intervention on
      symptom control, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, patient activation
      and self-efficacy; (2) evaluate the effect of the intervention on service outcomes: ED+H and
      resource utilization; and (3) evaluate implementation outcomes: fidelity, adherence and
      adoption. In addition, patients randomized to the intervention arm will be asked to
      participate in a sub-study interview at the end of the study to gain further knowledge about
      the SMARTCare intervention components from the patient's perspective.

    <time_frame>Assessed at 4-6 months post first dose +/- 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the intervention to patients will be evaluated using the Intervention Acceptability Questionnaire that has been developed for the study. The 3-section questionnaire (I-Can-Manage Cancer Modules; Health Coaching Calls; Overall Acceptability) asks patients to rate agreement statements from &quot;Disagree Strongly&quot; to &quot;Agree Strongly&quot;. Individual scores for each statement in each section will be recorded.
Audio recorded end of study qualitative interviews (approximately 30 minutes) will be conducted by a member of the study steering committee. The interviewer will follow a SMARTCare Patient Interview Guide. The guide consists of open-ended questions focusing on: (1) access, use, content and utility of the I-Can-Manage Cancer Modules; (2) logistics/timing/dose, content and utility of Health Coaching; and (3) General Comments. Interview transcripts will be analyzed in NVIVO to identify common themes.</description>
