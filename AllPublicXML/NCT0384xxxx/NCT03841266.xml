  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients with early breast cancer were enrolled according to the inclusion
      criteria. Baseline characteristics were recorded from medical record system. Recurrence score
      were obtained by 21-gene detection kits from different biological companies. Relationship
      between recurrence score and the prognosis was explored. Meanwhile, the investigators
      analyzed the consistency of the results obtained from various 21-gene test kits and
      immunohistochemistry detection.
