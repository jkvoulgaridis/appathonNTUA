    <textblock>
      Cheer leading is a rapidly growing international sport known for its acrobatic skills and
      dangerous stunts. The sport presents ample risk for physical trauma, and it is common for
      athletes to miss extensive time from cheer leading due to injury. The goal of this study is
      to the see whether the investigators can reduce injury risk among cheer leading athletes by
      teaching them stress-coping skills to help them relax and reduce their sport-related stress.
      There exists a link between high levels of stress and increased rates of injury among
      athletes. When individuals become stressed during athletic events such as competitions or
      strenuous training, symptoms including muscle tension and narrowed attention often accompany
      the stress response, increasing injury risk and reducing performance quality. In this study,
      half of Western University's coed cheer leading team will participate in a six-session stress
      management intervention to teach them relevant psychological stress-coping skills. Such
      skills include relaxation breathing techniques, visualization exercises, stoppage of negative
      thoughts, and development of self-efficacy statements. The other half of the team will
      receive a placebo &quot;sport nutrition&quot; program. The sessions of both the control program and the
      stress-management intervention will be administered over the most intensive period of the
      cheer leading season, from September to November of 2019. The investigators predict that the
      intervention group athletes will report less cheer leading time missed due to injury, report
      less sport-related stress, and make fewer errors at their cheer leading championship than
      their teammates in the placebo group. This is the first study to administer a psychological
      injury-prevention intervention to cheerleaders.

      Background Information: Cheer leading is a growing, highly competitive, and potentially
      stressful sport, with 3.5 million athletes practicing worldwide. The sport presents many
      risks, as it was responsible for more catastrophic injuries among female high school and
      college athletes than any other sport between 1982 and 2016 in the U.S. In Canada, there were
      1496 cheer leading injuries requiring hospitalization from 1990 to 2010. According to the
      Williams and Andersen stress model, athletes with certain personality dispositions (e.g. high
      competitive anxiety), fewer coping resources (e.g. social support, stress management) and an
      extensive history of life stressors are prone to appraising athletic situations as being
      stressful, resulting in an exaggerated stress response. The stress response is particularly
      likely to manifest itself during instances in which an athlete perceives a high demand to
      succeed, but feels they possess inadequate resources to do so. These situations often lead to
      a variety of symptoms, including poorer performance quality, generalized muscle tension
      (physiological), and heightened distractibility (attentional), culminating in a greater
      likelihood of injury among athletes. Objectives: The goal of this study will be to administer
      a psychological-based intervention to improve the stress-coping skills of competitive
      cheerleaders, acting to minimize their competitive anxiety, maintain their performance
      quality, and reduce their risk of injury during the span of a season. Hypothesis:
      Cheerleaders who complete a psychological-based stress-coping intervention will report lower
      competitive anxiety, demonstrate superior performance, and report less time lost from cheer
      leading due to injury compared to a control group of teammates receiving a placebo program.
      Theoretical Approach: The psychological intervention will be based on the Stress Inoculation
      Technique (SIT), with the objective of restructuring athletes' coping skills in order to
      improve their management of stress (i.e. competitive anxiety). During the first phase of SIT,
      athletes will bring up narrative accounts of stressful athletic situations, identifying
      previously insufficient coping techniques as well as potential coping strengths.
      Self-monitoring strategies will be introduced to help athletes become more aware of the ways
      that they inadvertently build up stress reactions. During the second SIT phase, athletes will
      be taught coping skills such as muscle relaxation, use of self-efficacy (confidence)
      statements, cognitive re-framing of stressful situations, and emotion regulation techniques,
      which they will then apply to their personal cheer leading experiences. These skills will be
      further rehearsed through positive mental imagery and practice to ensure their effectiveness.
      In the final SIT stage, athletes will be encouraged to apply their new coping skills to
      incrementally more demanding cheer leading situations while utilizing stress management
      techniques. Athletes will be further reminded to take credit for their improvement,
      instilling a lasting sense of self-efficacy. The SIT intervention will teach athletes an
      array of anxiety management skills in order to help them develop effective stress-coping
      strategies during important cheer leading events. Participants will maintain an in-person
      correspondence with the researcher throughout to ensure a properly personalized and
      collaborative intervention experience. Methods: The intervention period will reach from
      September 2019 to December 2019, as this is the busiest and most competitive part of the
      cheer leading season. Half of Western University's 30-40 athlete co-ed cheer leading team
      will be randomized to complete a six session &quot;sport nutrition&quot; program as a control, while
      the other half will be randomized to complete a six session bi-weekly SIT program. Since the
      intervention and control groups will come from the same team, all participants will share
      identical practice and competition schedules, ensuring each group is exposed to the same
      athletic situations. As such, differences in group outcomes will most likely be due to the
      type of intervention they received. To measure performance quality, total scoring deductions
      caused by the athletes in each group during Western's two runs at the 2019 PCA college cheer
      leading championship will be compared. Fewer deductions indicate fewer errors (bobbles,
      drops, falls, etc.) and reflect superior performance. Impact: The current study will be the
      first to develop and implement a psychological-based intervention tailored to cheerleaders
      with the goal of improving these athletes' stress-coping abilities. If successful, this
      intervention is highly scalable and can be used by athletes where stress and injury are
      salient features of their sport, and where individual performance is highly scrutinized.

    <description>The amount of anxiety and stress participants report feeling as a result of the demands of training and competing for their cheerleading team. This outcome will be measured based on each participant's score on the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2). Each participant's post-test score on this measure will be compared to the participant's baseline score. There are fifteen questions, with five questions per subscale: somatic symptoms, concentration disruption, and worry. Each question asks participants how often they experience worry, concentration disruption, or somatic symptoms, with a low score of 1 indicating &quot;not at all&quot; and a high score of 4 indicating &quot;very much&quot;. Total score on the questionnaire ranges from 15 to 60. A low total score indicates lower sports anxiety, and a higher scores indicates intense feelings of worry, disruption of concentration, and somatic symptoms.</description>
