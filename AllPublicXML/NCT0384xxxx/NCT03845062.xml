  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) in the management of obstructive sleep apnea
      hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is not precisely defined for children. The primary objective of
      this study was to describe the consequences of DISE in the therapeutic management for
      children with OSAHS. The secondary objectives were to analyze the correlation between the
      number of obstructive sites found during DISE, the value of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and
      the type of OSAHS.

    <textblock>
      Retrospective single center study of 31 children (mean age: 5.5 Â± 2.6 years) who benefited
      from DISE between 2015 and 2018 in the management of OSAHS. Modification of therapeutic
      management was noted. A correlation between the number of obstructive sites and the IAH on
      the one hand, and between the number of obstructive sites and the type of SAHOS on the other
      hand, was sought.
