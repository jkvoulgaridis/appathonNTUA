  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DHA is important for the development of brain and retina in newborns. Considering that
      exclusive breast feeding for at least 4 ~6 months are globally recommended, plus it is well
      known that nutrient requirement is determined by both genetic and environmental (including
      diet) factors, this clinical study sought to investigate how the DHA levels in maternal milk
      is modulated by genetic variants and dietary n-3 LCPUFA intake. To recruit subjects (n=193),
      the inclusion criteria are Han Chinese women just having delivered full-term baby, 20-40
      years old, healthy, and willing to breast feed their baby for at least 2 months. Written
      informed consent will be obtained from participants. Personal information (or covariates)
      such as height, weight (before getting pregnancy and delivery, respectively), age, parity,
      education, smoking, alcohol drinking, gender of babyâ€¦etc, and DNA from oral swab will be
      collected. Breast milk and dietary data will be collected at the end of the 1st and 2nd month
      of postpartum period. Considering Han Chinese women usually have special postpartum diets and
      care during puerperium, therefore, collection of breast milk and dietary information will be
      repeated at the 2nd month. The fatty acid composition in milk will be analyzed by gas
      chromatography. Using food frequency questionnaire, intake of n-3 LCPUFA from foods + fish
      oil supplements will be calculated. Subjects will be instructed to give a 3-days food record
      as well. We foresee results of this study might contribute to public health care as
      nutritionists/dietitians will be able to target the vulnerable subjects, who are dietary
      dependent for DHA, for dedications in nutrition consults or customized dietary guidance.
      Moreover, these information are valuable in making policy regarding dietary recommendation in
      Taiwan.
