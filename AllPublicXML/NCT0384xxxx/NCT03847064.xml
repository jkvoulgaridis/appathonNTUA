      It is a retrospective study at a tertiary care hospital. All cases of lower limb deformity
      whose correction was done with fixator assisted IM nailing from 2010 till 2017 were analyzed.
      Pre Op x-rays and post op x rays will be analyzed for Mechanical Axis Deviation (MAD),
      anatomical Lateral Distal Femoral Angle (aLDFA), mechanical Lateral Distal Femoral Angle
      (mLDFA) and Medial Proximal Tibial Angle (MPTA), post-operative activity and functional
      status of the patients. Data will be analyzed using SPSS
