  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate if PRO-based follow-up is at least as
      effective as usual outpatient follow-up in managing decline in renal function and maintaining
      patients' quality of life. Furthermore, we intend to characterize the target patient group
      that is suitable for PRO-based follow up in a group of patients suffering from renal
      insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial investigates the use of Patient-reported Outcome (PRO)
      follow-up among patients with chronic kidney disease. Usual outpatient follow-up visits will
      be replaced with diagnosis-specific electronic questionnaires filled in by the patient at
      home. Participants in the PRO-based follow up will complete a disease specific questionnaire
      every 3 months. Patients with an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 40mL/min are
      randomized into three groups of follow-up

        1. PRO-based follow-up (The clinicians use the PRO data to decide whether a patient needs a
           visit or not)

        2. PRO-based telephone consultations (The clinician use the PRO-data to support the
           communication with the patient)

        3. Usual outpatient follow-up visits (Patients are seen in the outpatient clinic)

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect on the clinical outcomes, the utilisation of
      resources, and patient-reported outcome in three types of follow-up in a non-inferiority
      randomised controlled trial.

    <description>Patients will receive a questionnaire every 3 months. The PRO questionnaire is used as decision aid together with other available clinical data to decide whether the patient needs a visit or not. Hence, patients only visit the outpatient clinic if there is a clinical need or a patient's wish. The actual response for each questionnaire automatically results in a colour code (green, yellow or red). A red or yellow response indicates that the patient needs to be contacted. A green colour indicates no need for a visit. Based on an overview of the questionnaire and the patient's blood samples a physician decides whether this patient should have a telephone consultation or the patient needs to be seen in the clinic.</description>
