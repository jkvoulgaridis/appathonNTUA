  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited agents are optional after standard first and second line treatment for mCRC. Only
      Regorafenib and Fruquintinib are approved in China. PFS of these targeted drugs are not very
      long. Pemetrexed has shown significant efficacy in advanced lung cancer regarding PFS and OS
      with controllable toxicity. S-1 has been used in colorectal cancer with promising outcomes.
      Bevacizumab is also an important monoclonal antibody which could make benefits in treated
      patients. This study is aimed to explore the efficacy, safety in advanced colorectal cancer
      failed to standard therapy in Chinese population.
