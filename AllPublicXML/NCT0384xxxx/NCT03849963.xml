  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to develop hyperpolarized [13C]-labeled pyruvate as potential imaging
      probes to assess two essential in vivo processes in cerebral metabolism: oxidative metabolism
      and synthesis of a neurotransmitter.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will perform a pilot study to test the translational feasibility by evaluating
      sensitivity and repeatability of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate in
      healthy human subjects (n =10 each). Each subject will be imaged twice using the same
      hyperpolarized substrate with an interval (&lt;45min) between the injections to evaluate
      repeatability. Finally, eight subjects will be imaged with both hyperpolarized
      [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate for comparison.
