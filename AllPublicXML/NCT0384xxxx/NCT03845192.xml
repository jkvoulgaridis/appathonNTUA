    <textblock>
      In infants less than two years old the new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) will be measured during
      general anaesthesia. It will evaluated if and how ORI-monitoring gives earlier warning of
      hypoxaemia than conventional oxygen saturation measurement.

    <textblock>
      The Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is a new development in multiple wavelength pulse oximetry,
      reflecting the arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) continuously and non-invasively by an
      index. In contrast to established standard oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements, ORI detects
      a drop of PaO2 until the threshold of 100 mmHg. During anaesthesia induction-associated
      apnoeic periods ORI may detect a drop of PaO2 early enough for the anaesthesiologist to
      interrupt the intubation procedure and re-start oxygenation. In contrast, due to the flat
      upper part of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, SpO2 stays at values above 90% until
      PaO2 falls below 60mmHg. At this point, SpO2 drops rapidly and a pro- longed hypoxic dip is
      the consequence. To avoid this potentially harmful hypoxic dip, continuous monitoring of PaO2
      using ORI would be advantageous during anaesthesia induction phase.

      This clinical study aims to evaluate the time benefit between alarm of hypoxaemia by the
      ORI-monitoring and the start of the dropping of oxygen saturation. Pre-set and pre-described
      ORI-alarms will be checked for their utility and a new ORI-alarm will be defined that is
      potentially more useful. As secondary endpoints the study examines the correlation of ORI
      with PO2, the influence of patient or measurement characteristics on the correlation of ORI
      with PO2 and the influence of the measurement site on ORI-measurement.
