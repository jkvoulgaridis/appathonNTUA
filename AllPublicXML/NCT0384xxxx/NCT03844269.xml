      This study is a single arm, open-label, pilot study to assess midline frontal theta (MFT)
      power as measured by stimulus-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) before and after treatment
      with AKL-T01 for improving attention in pediatric participants ages 8-12 years old with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      All participants enrolled in this study will not be taking medications for attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including stimulants, for the duration of the study.
      Participants who are taking ADHD medications prior to Day 0 must have been stable off of
      medications for at least 30 days per parent report, or washout of medications at a Screening
      visit 3 - 7 days prior to Day 0.

      At Baseline / Day 0, all eligible participants will complete both resting-state
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and a perceptual discrimination task (PDT)-locked EEG.

      All participants will then play AKL-T01 for approximately 25 minutes per day, 5 days per
      week, for 4 weeks at home.

      At Follow-up / Day 28, participants will repeat both resting-state and PDT-locked EEG.

    <description>AKL-T01 digital treatment is a state-of-the-art mobile video game-like platform, which deploys modern videogame graphics, engaging reward loops, and real-time adaptive mechanics to dynamically personalize difficulty based on the user's ability. AKL-T01 multitasking treatment employs perceptual discrimination attention/memory task as well as a continuous motor &quot;driving&quot; task. Performance on these tasks are assessed in isolation and when performed together to calculate a performance index for each individual user. A personalized multitask treatment regimen is automatically configured and delivered to the user and is optimized adaptively to increase multitask performance. As players proceed through the treatment periodic recalibration occurs to maintain an optimal difficulty level.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis at
             screening/baseline visit based on Diagnostic Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-V) criteria and established via the
             Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID)
             administered by a trained clinician either in person or via teleconference

          -  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 5th Edition (WISC-V), Full Scale Intelligence
             Quotient ≥ 70

          -  Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale: Must score a 2 or 3 on at least 6
             items 1-9 AND must score a 4 on at least 2, or 5 on at least 1, of items 48-54
             (performance questions).

          -  Consistently off stimulant medication for ≥ 1 week. OR currently on stimulant
             medication and agree to stop taking the medication for a 1 week prior to the baseline
             visit and off through duration of training and post-training assessment (note:
             participants will only be allowed to washout of stimulant medication if in the opinion
             of the investigator they are currently inadequately managed on their medication and it
             is appropriate to stop taking their medication for the duration of the trial)

          -  Consistently off Psychotropic drug for ≥ 1 month

          -  Consistently off non-stimulant medication for ADHD (e.g. atomoxetine, clonidine,

             the Investigator may confound study data/assessments. (Participants with clinical
             history of learning disorders will be allowed to participate as long as the disorder
             does not impact their ability to participate based on PI judgement).

             therapy consistently for more than 4 weeks may participate if their routine is
             unchanged throughout the study.

          -  Motor condition (e.g. physical deformity of the hands/arms) that prevents game playing
             as reported by the parent or observed by the Investigator.

          -  Recent history or suspicion (within the past 6 months) of substance abuse or
             dependence.

          -  History of seizures (excluding febrile seizures).

          -  Participation in a clinical trial within 90 days prior to screening.
