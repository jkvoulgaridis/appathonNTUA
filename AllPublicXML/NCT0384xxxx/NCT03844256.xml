      nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy in adult (&gt;18 years)

      Immunotherapy combined with chemoradiation for localized bladder cancer may exhibit improved
      efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile.

      The aim of this phase 1b/2, two stage, open label study of MMC/Capecitabine ChRT combined
      with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy stuy is: to assess
      the feasibility and safety, the disease free survival (DFS) and disease free survival rate
      (DFS-rate) of the addition of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab to MMC/capecitabine chemoradiation
      of the bladder.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be treated with radiation therapy over 4 weeks and receive MMC IV on day1 of radiation therapy and capecitabine on each day of radiation therapy as radiosensitizers.
Phase-1b: enrollment of maximum of 30 patients with a maximum of 10 patients per treatment regimen, in order to determine optimal regimen based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT).
Regimen-A: immunotherapy (w1-12) consists of nivolumab 480mg (fixed dose), on day(d)1, d29 and d57.
Regimen-B: immunotherapy (w1-12) consists of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg together with Nivolumab 3mg/kg on d1, d22, d43 and d65.
Regimen-C: immunotherapy (w1-12) consists of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg on d1, d22, d43 and d65.
All study participants can opt for an additional 10 administrations of nivolumab 480mg fixed dose at intervals of 4 weeks, from week 13 to week 52.
Phase-2: enrollment of an additional 20 subjects at the regimen determined to be optimal in the phase-1b part.</intervention_model_description>
