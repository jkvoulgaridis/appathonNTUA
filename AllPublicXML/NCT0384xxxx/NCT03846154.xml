  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children living at the landfills of Bujumbura are often exposed to maltreatment, including
      emotional neglect and physical abuse, and traumatic experiences. Furthermore, they grow up in
      severe poverty. Addressing trauma-related mental health issues and aggressive behaviour by
      Narrative Exposure Therapy (FORNET), familial communication by family visits, interaction
      difficulties of children by a group intervention, poverty by financial support and economic
      training for mothers, medical problems by medical assistance, legal conflicts by legal
      advice, and providing access to school, we aimed at reintegrating those children within the
      Burundian school system and improving familial relationships.

      The investigators want to provide evidence, that mental health interventions are an integral
      part of assisting children and families affected by poverty and violence.
