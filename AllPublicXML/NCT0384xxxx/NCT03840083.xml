  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific objective of this proposed research is to understand whether deficits in
      sleep-dependent memory changes reflect age-related changes in sleep, memory, or both. The
      central hypothesis is that changes in both memory and sleep contribute to age-related changes
      in sleep-dependent memory processing. To this end, the investigators will investigate changes
      in learning following intervals of sleep (overnight and nap) and wake in young and older
      adults.

      Exp 1: Using neuroimaging, the investigators will consider whether differences in brain areas
      engaged during memory encoding contribute to age-related changes in sleep-dependent memory
      consolidation for a word-pair learning task.

      Exp 2: The investigators will examine the rate of memory decay between encoding and sleep
      using two probes of declarative memory (word-pair learning and visuo-spatial learning).

      Exp 3: The investigators will provide additional opportunity for encoding of the word-pair
      and visuo-spatial learning tasks.

      Exp 4: Using neuroimaging, the investigators will examine neural engagement during encoding
      and performance following intervals of sleep and wake.

      Exp 5: The investigators will examine the rate of decay of motor sequence learning.

      Exp 6: The investigators will examine whether enhanced training ('overtraining') improves
      sleep-dependent memory consolidation for older adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-75 yrs

          -  Healthy sleeper

          -  No diagnosed sleep or neurodegenerative disorder

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past diagnosis of any sleep disorder or evidence of a sleep disorder as assessed by
             self-reported sleep quality assessments, a standardized diagnostic interview, and an
             acclimation night of polysomnography. Using acclimation-night polysomnography,
             participants will be excluded with an Apnea-Hypopnea Index &gt;15; a Period-Limb Movement
             in Sleep index of &gt;15/hr; sleep-onset latency &gt; 45 min (indicative of insomnia); or
             sleep efficiency &lt; 80% (see Edinger et al., Sleep, 2004). In cases in which questions
             arise regarding a participants' inclusion or sleep records, a practicing neurologist
             board-certified in sleep medicine will review the documentation.

          2. Past diagnosis neurological illness or head injury

          3. Reported average sleep per night &lt; 5 or &gt; 9 hrs

          4. Current employment involving shift work or an inability to keep a regular sleep
             schedule during the week prior to testing

          5. Current use of psychotropic, recreational drugs, or sleep-altering medications (sleep
             medications, cold medicines within the past week, clonidine, sympathomimetic
             stimulants)

          6. Daily caffeine intake of &gt; 4 cups (coffee, tea, colas)

          7. Weekly alcohol intake of &gt; 10 cups

          8. Pregnancy or &lt; 12 months post-partum

          9. History of bipolar disorder, mania, or current evidence of depression as measured by
             Beck Depression Inventory score &gt; 25

         10. Abnormal sleep (e.g., shift work, travel across &gt;2 time zones within the past 3
             months).

         11. Diagnosis of any Axis I disorder, neurological illness or head injury (according to
             Demographic and Health History form);

         12. Score indicative of cognitive dysfunction (subtest scores &lt; 40)

         13. Beck Depression Scale score indicative of depression (&gt; 19).

        Additionally, individuals will be excluded from magnetic resonance imaging studies (Exps 1,
        4) for:

          1. Left handed or ambidextrous

          2. Claustrophobia

          3. Presence of metal (thoroughly screened via questionnaire and metal detector)

          4. Pregnancy
