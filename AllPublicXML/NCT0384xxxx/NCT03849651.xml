  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients less than or equal to 21 years old with high-risk hematologic malignancies who would
      likely benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients with a
      suitable HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor identified will be eligible for participation
      ONLY if the donor is not available in the necessary time.

      The purpose of the study is to learn more about the effects (good and bad) of transplanting
      blood cells donated by a family member, and that have been modified in a laboratory to remove
      the type of T cells known to cause graft-vs.-host disease, to children and young adults with
      a high risk cancer that is in remission but is at high risk of relapse. This study will give
      donor cells that have been TCRαβ-depleted. The TCR (T-cell receptor) is a molecule that is
      found only on T cells. These T-cell receptors are made up of two proteins that are linked
      together. About 95% of all T-cells have a TCR that is composed of an alpha protein linked to
      a beta protein, and these will be removed. This leaves only the T cells that have a TCR made
      up of a gamma protein linked to a delta protein. This donor cell infusion will be followed by
      an additional infusion of donor memory cells (CD45RA-depleted) after donor cell engraftment.

      This study will be testing the safety and effects of the chemotherapy and the donor blood
      cell infusions on the transplant recipient's disease and overall survival.

    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT), who lack an available suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      matched related/sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD), will receive a
      TCRαβ-depleted haploidentical donor HCT with additional memory cell DLI. One course of
      blinatumomab will be empirically added for patients with CD19+ malignancy.

      Primary Objectives

        -  Determine the maximum effective dose for prophylactic CD45RA-depleted DLI when given in
           the early post-engraftment period.

        -  Assess the efficacy of TCRαβ-depleted progenitor cell graft with additional memory
           T-cell DLI, plus selected use of blinatumomab, in haploidentical donor hematopoietic
           cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies as measured by 1 year EFS (events =
           relapse, death)

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Assess the safety and feasibility of the addition of blinatumomab in the early post-
           engraftment period in patients with CD19+ malignancy

        -  Estimate the incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, malignant
           relapse,event-free survival per disease subgroups (e.g. ALL vs AML), and overall
           survival at one-year post-transplantation.

        -  Estimate incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).

        -  Estimate the rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) in the first 100 days after
           transplantation.

        -  To measure and describe the pharmacokinetics of rabbit ATG in HCT recipients on this
           study.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative
           lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis, V-beta
           spectratyping, and lymphocyte phenotype and function.

        -  Describe the use of additional CD45RA-depleted DLI for recipients who have severe viral
           infections, disease recurrence or progression, or poor immune reconstitution. Assess and
           record efficacy of CD45RA-depleted DLI for these conditions, and all adverse events that
           are related to CD45RA-depleted DLI.

      Blinatumomab will be given to patients with a history of CD19+ malignancy as determined by
      St. Jude hematopathologist review of current and historical specimens and reports.
      Blinatumomab dosing will begin no sooner than 1 week after CD45RA-depleted DLI and no later
      than Day +90. There must be no acute GVHD or it must be quiescent. ALT must be less than 5x
      ULN, bili less than or equal to 1.5x ULN, and creatinine less than or equal to 1.5x ULN.

      If more than one family member donor is suitable, then donor selection will be based on
      several factors including: degree of KIR mismatching, donor-recipient matching of CMV
      serology, donor-recipient red blood cell compatibility, degree of HLA matching, size of the
      potential donor, previous use as a donor, presence of donor-specific antibody, and overall
      health and availability of the potential donor.

      A G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell product (identified as HPC,A) is the
      preferred progenitor cell graft source. Our desired target goal will be 5 x 10^6 CD34+
      cells/kg. This number of cells will be necessary to provide an adequate graft, following the
      various ex vivo manipulations, for prompt reconstitution. More than one collection may be
      needed to achieve this goal. Donors will undergo a standard hematopoietic progenitor cell
      mobilization regimen consisting of 5 days of GSF given subcutaneously at 10
      micrograms/kilogram. The graft will be collected by leukapheresis on day 5 (and 6 if needed)
      of G-CSF. The HPC product will typically be collected and infused fresh, however there may be
      patients or logistical situations that require the HPC product to be collected early,
      processed, and stored frozen.
