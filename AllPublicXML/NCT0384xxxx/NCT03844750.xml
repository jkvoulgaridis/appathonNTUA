      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works after chemotherapy and before liver
      surgery in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      pembrolizumab after chemotherapy and before liver surgery may work better in treating
      patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the change in the populations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs)
      induced by neoadjuvant pembrolizumab following leucovorin calcium (calcium folinate),
      5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety/toxicity profile of pembrolizumab following FOLFOX in the
      preoperative setting for patients with CRC with resectable hepatic metastases.

      II. To estimate the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab following FOLFOX in
      patients with CRC with resectable hepatic metastases.

      III. Pathologic response in resected tumor. IV. Objective response rate (ORR) by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      V. Landmark progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab following FOLFOX on PD-L1 expression
      in tumor cells and TIICs, in patients with metastatic (m)CRC.

      II. To determine the change in T cell repertoire within the tumor and blood induced by
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab following FOLFOX in patients with metastatic CRC.

      III. To explore molecular profiles to identify potentially predictive biomarkers for patients
      with metastatic CRC treated with immunotherapy (including but not limited to microsatellite
      instability (MSI) testing).

      IV. To correlate change in TIICs, PDL-1 expression, and T cell repertoires as well as
      molecular profiles with response/resistance and toxicity.

      V. To establish human immune system patient-derived xenografts (HIS PDX) models from
      pre-treatment liver biopsy specimens and to correlate treatment effects in HIS PDX and
      corresponding patients.

      VI. To correlate contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging metrics, such as
      quantitative enhancement characteristics, with change in TIICs in patients with CRC liver
      metastases treated with pembrolizumab preceded by FOLFOX.

      VII. To identify immune response messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression analysis to
      derive signatures associated with tumor response.

      VIII. To identify genomic mutations and gene copy aberrations associated with response and
      resistance to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive between 4 and 8 FOLFOX treatments, based on the treating physician's
      opinion. Approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of FOLFOX, patients receive pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. About 2 weeks later, patients undergo hepatic
      resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 90 days
      for 1 year.

                  previous therapies to =&lt; grade 1 or baseline. Patients with grade 2 neuropathy or
                  alopecia are eligible. If a patient received major surgery, they must have
                  recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention
                  prior to starting study treatment.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are radiologically stable (i.e., without evidence of progression by imaging for
             at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging [repeat imaging should be performed during the
             study screening]), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient?s
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
             Anticoagulation that cannot be safely held to perform the liver biopsy is an example
             of a contraindication to participation.

          -  Has received any prior immunotherapy including anti?PD-1, anti?PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 or
             with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g.
             CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).

          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (&gt;= grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or to any of
             pembrolizumab?s excipients.

             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacille
             Calmette?Gu?rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine.

               -  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu
                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist)
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Has inferior vena cava/cardiac involvement based on imaging.

          -  Has had encephalopathy in the last 6 months. Those patients on rifaximin or lactulose
