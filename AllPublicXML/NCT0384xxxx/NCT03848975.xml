  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the benefit of simulator training for learning
      external cephalic version (ECV) or vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (hereafter vacuum
      extraction [VE]) for obstetrics-gynecology residents.

      The primary outcome of this randomized control trial is to evaluate the impact of simulation
      training on the success of ECV and VE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usually, the training of obstetrical maneuvers are done &quot;one the job&quot; according to the
      situations encountered in the clinical practice during postgraduate training. This has some
      disadvantages like inequality of exposure to these situations, inadequate learning
      environment (emergencies, impossibility to repeat the maneuver, etc.) and risk complications
      related to the learner'slack of experience. To evaluate the benefit for learning external
      cephalic version (ECV) or vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (hereafter vacuum extraction
      [VE]), the investigators are conducting a multicentric randomized control trial composed by
      two parallel studies. Each group will represent the control group in relation to the maneuver
      to which it will not be trained.

      The objectives of the first one is to evaluate the impact of simulation training on the
      success of ECV, the complication rate, as well as the patient's and learner's satisfaction.
      The objectives of the second one is to evaluate the impact of simulation training on the
      success of VE, the complication rate, as well as the patient's and learner's satisfaction.

      The overall goal is to evaluate the effects on clinically relevant outcomes of the teaching
      by simulation in obstetrics. If simulation training improves the success rate of these
      maneuvers and the satisfaction of the patient and the learner, simulation learning will be
      included in a formal and systematic way during postgraduate training in obstetrics.

      The subjects are the resident doctors or consultants who have had no or few prior simulation
      training (maximum 1 session) and little clinical experience of the maneuver evaluated
      (maximum of 19 of each maneuver).

    <intervention_model_description>For the intervention (trained) group, training sessions will be conducted over six months. The control group will learn obstetric maneuver during daily clinical practice in the delivery room under supervision (usual resident training without simulation sessions). The groups will &quot;cross-over&quot; for the next 6 months.
After six months the success rate and secondary outcomes will be analyzed. The comparison will be, first, between the intervention (trained) group and the control group and, second, for each subject, between its success rate reported before and its success rate after the observation period.
Some aspects of our study design can be those of a cross over trial, or a stepped wedge design : the participants will have intervention ECV followed, after 6 months, by intervention VE, or intervention VE followed, after 6 months, by intervention ECV. However as some aspects are not those of the above designs, the investigators believe that the best category is a parallel trial.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The person who generate the randomization list and prepare the envelopes will not be involved later in the study. The subject of this study necessarily involves the fact that the participants know the group to which they are assigned. They will be asked to avoid to reveal their allocation to the other care providers (midwives and other colleagues) involved in the care of the patients delivering under their supervision. The investigator responsible for collecting and coding the data will not know to which group belongs the person being evaluated. In some cases, the midwife in charge of the patient will collect the data. She will not know to which group belongs to the person being evaluated. The patient will not know to which group belongs the doctor practicing the obstetric maneuver. However the study taking place within a hospital, it can not be excluded that a care provider or an outcome assessor learns informally the allocation of one or more participants, despite these precautions.</masking_description>

    <description>The success rate of the procedure is defined as birth after vacuum-assisted delivery without release of the Kiwi cup. The cup's release is considered when total and involuntary loss of vacuum occurs, resulting in a loss of contact with the head. If the patient gives birth spontaneously after a vacuum release or if there is a change of instrumentation (following a release or not), it is a failure in the context of this study.
