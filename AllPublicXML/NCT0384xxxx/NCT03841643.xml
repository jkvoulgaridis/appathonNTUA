      Background Cranial reconstruction after monocortical bonegraft harvesting remains a clinical
      challenge for the maxillofacial surgeon. At present, there is no gold standard technique
      advised. Patient-specific implants are gaining terrain in the field of craniofacial
      reconstruction. Comparative studies on differences in success rates between different
      biomaterials for application in craniofacial surgery are lacking.

      Aims The primary objective is to evaluate, in terms of cosmetic result, the postoperative
      successful outcome of patient-standardized implants for cranial reconstruction after
      bonegraft harvesting for jaw augmentation of patients with severely atrophic jaw.

      Design Patients considered eligible for cranial bone-augmentation of the severely atrophic
      jaw, that provide their consent for participation in the trial, will be randomized at
      recruitment into either the patient-specific implant (P) or cement (C) group. In the P group,
      the cranial bone defect will be reconstructed with a patient-specific implant (KLS Martin,
      Tuttlingen, Germany). In the C group, the cranial bone defect will be reconstructed with
      HydrosetTM (Stryker, New Jersey, USA), calcium phosphate cement, according to the current
      standard practice at the department.

      Parameters representing ease of application of the biomaterial , postoperative complication
      rate, cosmetic and functional outcome will be measured at fixed time-points during surgery
      and postoperative follow-up. A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of both the donor
      (cranium) and receptor site (jaw) will be taken preoperatively, within 10 days postop, and 6
      months post-operatively to measure biomaterial positioning.

      Conclusions Systematic reviews demonstrate the need for randomized prospective studies
      regarding implantable biomaterials used in facial reconstructive surgery. We hypothesize that
      patient-specific implants provide more user-friendly alternatives to the standard care, with
      better cosmetic results.
