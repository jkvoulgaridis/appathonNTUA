  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin has many disadvantages for mothers with GDM including the need to give injections,
      frequent daily testing for monitoring, and risks of hypoglycemia, increase in appetite,
      weight gain and high cost. Metformin, an oral biguanide, may be a more logical alternative to
      insulin for women with GDM who are unable to cope with the increasing insulin resistance of
      pregnancy.

      This study aim to compare maternal weight gain during pregnancy in women with gestational
      diabetes, treated by insulin versus metformin.

    <description>This includes women with GDM allocated to receive insulin treatment. Starting dose will be 30unit (20 unit intermediate dose + 10 unit rapid acting insulin) in the morning and before breakfast). In the 2nd trimester, we will start with half of the previous dose and if post dinner glucose level remain elevated additional injection of rapid acting insulin will be given just prior to dinner. If fasting glucose is elevated, intermediate acting insulin can be given along with the dinner dose of rapid acting insulin.</description>

They will receive an initial metformin dose of 500 mg once or twice daily (according to initial blood glucose level) with food and increased 500 mg every one or two weeks toward targets or up to a maximum daily dose of 2500 mg divided doses with each meal.</description>
