  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if/how an experimentally applied muscle pain/soreness, lasting for
      some days may affect brain activity, balance, movement patterns, muscle function and pain
      sensitivity in a healthy population
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All included healthy volunteers will participate in test-sessions on 4 separate days over
      approximately 2 weeks.

      During the study participants will be randomised into and either a control group (injection
      of isotonic saline into a neck muscle) or neck pain group (injection of Nerve Growth Factor
      (NGF) into a neck muscle).

      Alle participants tested with regards to:

      Brain activity related to neck muscles will be estimated using TMS Balance will be tested
      using a force place Body movements will be recorded using 3D tracking Muscle activity will be
      estimated using electromyography (EMG)

    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire. 13 items that can be answered with a Likert scale (0 = not at all, 1 = to a slight degree, 2= to a moderate degree, 3 = to a great degree, 4 = all the time).
The PCS is scored by summing responses to all 13 items with scores ranging from 0 - 52.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>BFI questionnaire investigates five general traits personality: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. The BFI consists of 44 items that are answered on a 5 point Likert scale (1=Disagree strongly, 2=Disagree a little, 3=Neither agree or disagree, 4=Agree a little, 5=Agree strongly). This is not good/bad score in this questionnaire as it only assess personality traits.</description>
