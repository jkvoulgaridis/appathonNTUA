  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to encourage parents to read Arabic books to their children from an
      early age and by extension children will be more likely to read Arabic books and ultimately
      improve their Arabic literacy.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that an adapted &quot;Reach Out and Read&quot; program will result in
      an increase in the proportion of parents reading Arabic books to their children after the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early reading for toddlers has been linked to a better grasp of the fundamentals of language
      as they approach school age, as reading exposes the child to rich language and diverse
      content. Reach Out and Read program (ROR) is an American non-profit organization that
      advocates for childhood literacy.

      In this study the investigators aim to implement an adapted version of the &quot;Reach Out and
      Read&quot; program and to encourage parents to read Arabic books to their children in order for
      this to become a daily habit. The goal of this study is to see an increase in the proportion
      of parents who read Arabic books to their children and by extension children will grow up
      loving to read Arabic books and ultimately may have improved Arabic literacy.

    <description>The research assistant introduces the adapted 'Reach out and Read&quot; program and informs participants about the benefits of reading to children at an early age. A 4:50 minutes video clip would be shown during the initial visit. This video discusses the benefits of reading displaying practical tips for parents; it includes tips on how to read, pointing at the words.
A schematic pamphlet highlighting the importance of reading Arabic to children and the impact of such reading on children's brain development, vocabulary acquisition and behavior in addition to the impact on the parent child bond and relationship is given to the parents.
After each visit participants will receive an age appropriate book for their child.
Focus groups will be conducted by a qualitative researcher</description>
