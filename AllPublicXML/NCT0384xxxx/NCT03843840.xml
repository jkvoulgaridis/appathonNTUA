  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is the evaluation of a combined coaxial optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) system to image retina/choroid and to evaluate if post processing of the
      data can give us insights into property of the tissue imaged.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histology studies have shown that many disorders of the retina and choroid such as
      age-related macular degeneration is associated with a build up abnormal deposits, in the
      retina or subretinal space. Being able to detect subtle changes in retina and choroidal
      structure is crucial for better understanding and monitoring of this potentially blinding
      condition. This study aims to commercially available SpectralisÂ® OCT-system with a central
      wavelength of 880nm explore the ability of a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO)
      for OCT imaging utilising a modified by the addition of a longer wavelength OCT (1075nm , a
      wavelength deployed on other commercially available OCT scanners). Other commercially
      available OCT scanners used longer wavelengths to allow deeper penetration and enhanced
      visualisation of subretinal tissue but less inner retinal detail. Combing both wavelengths
      could have the advantage of allowing optimum viualisation of inner and subretinal structures.
      The ability of the systems to acquire repeatable and good quality images of retinal and
      choroidal structural detail at matching location and compare the results from the two
      instruments will be evaluated. In addition processing of the images reflectivity with two
      different wavelength should give us insight into the nature of any abnormal material.
