  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of red furu (Chinese fermented
      soybean product) consumption on serum vitamin B12, Homocysteine concentration and other
      cardio-metabolic risk factors in healthy young volunteers.

      The study will apply the parallel study method and participants will be randomized into two
      groups. In the randomized controlled clinical trial, twenty-three healthy young volunteers
      (11 females and 12 males, aged 19-39 years) were recruited from Zhejiang University, China.
      They were randomly assigned to two groups of either red furu (n=11, 5 females and 6 males) or
      tofu (n=12, 6 females and 6 males). Volunteers consumed a provided meal, either 50 g of red
      furu or tofu with two slices of bread for 1 day breakfast meal. Volunteers also recorded
      their normal dietary intake during the 3 days trial period using provided self-report food
      diary. Fasting blood sample was drawn at 0h, 24h and 72h. Serum VB12, Hcy and other
      cardio-metabolic risk factors were measured by standard methods.

      Test Meals:

      Red Furu Group: 50 g of red furu with 2 slices of bread. Tofu Group: 50 g of plain tofu eaten
      with 2 slices of bread. Volunteers will refrain from consumption of fermented products 1 week
      prior to the study. Thereafter subject feed on control diet and intervention diet for 1 day.
      Volunteers' normal diets and test meals will be recorded on a self-administered
      questionnaire, followed by testing serum vitamin B12, Homocysteine and other biochemical
      parameters.

      5-10 mL blood will be collected per session. Blood will be collected: 3 times
      (0h-24h-72h).Participants will be asked to fast for 10-12 hours prior to the blood draw.
