  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, representing at least 75% of all
      primary malignant brain tumors. Histopathologically, gliomas are classified into different
      subgroups including astrocytomas (60-70%), oligodendrogliomas (10-30%), ependymomas (&lt;10%)
      and mixed gliomas (i.e. oligoastrocytomas) depending on the cell type from which they
      originate. The World Health Organization currently classifies gliomas based on
      histopathological analysis in which the presence (or absence) and the degree of specific
      histopathological features determines the grade of malignancy. Grade I (pilocytic
      astrocytoma) and grade II (diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma,
      and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) are termed low-grade gliomas (LGGs), whereas grade III
      (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) and
      grade IV (glioblastoma) represent high-grade gliomas (HGGs).

      Given the incurable nature of gliomas, the maintenance or improvement of the patient's
      quality of life are extremely important. The benefits of multimodal treatment strategies, in
      terms of prolonged survival or delay of progression, have to be carefully balanced against
      the side effects of the treatment, which may adversely influence patient's functioning and
      well-being during his/her remaining life span.

      Measuring a brain tumor patients functioning and well-being goes far beyond assessing
      (progression-free) survival or tumor response to treatment on imaging. A more integrated way
      to measure patients functioning and well-being is the assessment of a patient's
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). HRQOL is defined as a personal self-assessed ability
      to function in the physical, psychological, emotional, and social domains of day-to-day life.

      The main goal of this study is to perform a large-scale, prospective and long-term analysis
      of the HRQOL in patients diagnosed with glioma.

      Aims of the study

      The main goal of this study is to perform a large-scale, prospective and long-term analysis
      of the HRQOL in patients diagnosed with glioma and to set up a database which contains
      general patient characteristics, tumor information, treatment strategy and follow-up data of
      each included patient. This large-scale database will allow us to investigate several
      relevant research questions in a well-documented group of glioma patients.

      Methodology

      HRQOL is a multidimensional concept covering physical, psychological and social domains as
      well as symptoms induced by the disease and the treatment. Currently there is no single gold
      standard tool to measure HRQOL, and several valid measures of HRQOL in brain tumor patients
      are available. In this study we will use the EQ-5D questionnaire to report patient's HRQOL.
      The EQ-5D is widely used and has been validated in many different patient populations. It has
      been designed so that patients can describe the extent to which they have a problem in each
      of the five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and
      anxiety/depression The timing of the HRQOL questionnaires will depend on whether a patient
      will be diagnosed with either a LGG or a HGG. Moreover, as the current treatment strategies
      for LGG patients and for relapsed HGG patients are highly variable, we scheduled the HRQOL
      measurements not in function of the treatment, but rather in function of the classical,
      standard-of-care patient follow-up (either 3 or 6 monthly).

      Missing data

      When there are missing data for some patients, the question arises as to whether patients
      with missing data differ from those who returned completed forms. As a consequence, missing
      data presents problems in the analysis and the interpretation of the results. Hence, the
      amount of missing data should be minimized. A regular check on missing data will be performed
      by the CTA. In case the HRQOL form was not completed by the included patient, the patient
      will be contacted by phone or e-mail and he/she will be asked to provide an answer to the
      different questions of the HRQOL questionnaire in order to avoid missing data. In case the
      patient is unable to complete the HRQOL questionnaire, the CTA will report the reason for
      non-completion in the database.
