  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication-assisted treatment, including buprenorphine, is a first-line treatment for opioid
      use disorders; however, despite its many advantages, nearly 50% of patients are unable to
      achieve stabilization and long-term recovery. The proposed study will test whether a
      computer- and text message-delivered intervention can promote engagement in and adherence to
      buprenorphine among persons actively seeking outpatient medication-assisted treatment. This
      digital health intervention has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and prevent
      future overdose in a high-risk segment of the population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The state of Rhode Island has been especially impacted by the opioid epidemic with rates of
      overdose rising by 90% from 2011 to 2016. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the use of
      pharmacotherapy in combination with behavioral therapies, is associated with significant
      reductions in illicit opioid use. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, is one
      pharmacological option for MAT that is growing in popularity because of its more flexible
      administration through office-based programs. Despite its many advantages, nearly half of
      participants are unsuccessful in achieving buprenorphine stabilization. Distress tolerance
      (DT), defined as the perceived or actual ability to handle aversive physical or emotional
      states, is a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor implicated in the development and
      maintenance of substance use. Targeting DT during substance use treatment may improve
      outcomes by promoting the ability to persist in goal directed activity (e.g., abstinence)
      even when experiencing physical or emotional distress. Personalized feedback interventions
      (PFI) represent a promising method to effectively motivate engagement in and adherence to
      buprenorphine treatment. These interventions are generally brief, individually tailored, and
      have the potential to be delivered via mobile platforms (e.g., computers, text message). Dr.
      Langdon's long-term career goal is to conduct clinical translational research focused on the
      development and evaluation of novel digital health interventions to enhance engagement in and
      adherence to MAT. The integrated training and research plans proposed in this application
      will provide Dr. Langdon with advanced training in the following domains: 1) treatment
      development; 2) digital health interventions; 3) clinical trial methodology; and 4) general
      professional development. These training objectives will be achieved through a combination of
      didactic and applied activities, utilization of CTR service cores, as well as the application
      of these skills in a Stage 1 pilot behavioral treatment development trial. Specific aims of
      this research study include (1) the development, through formative evaluation, of an
      interactive computer- and text message-delivered PFI, that incorporates DT skills training,
      for persons actively seeking outpatient MAT (PFI-DT); and (2) pilot testing the feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PFI-DT for increasing motivation, abstinence,
      adherence, and retention to treatment compared to a health education comparison condition.
      This work has the potential to address a Rhode Island Department of Health priority area -
      opioid use and overdose.

    <description>The Distress Tolerance Scale is a 15-item self-report measure in which respondents indicate, on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree), the extent to which they can experience and withstand distressing psychological states. Higher total scores reflect greater ability to tolerate distress. The total score is computed as a mean, with a possible range of 1-5.</description>
