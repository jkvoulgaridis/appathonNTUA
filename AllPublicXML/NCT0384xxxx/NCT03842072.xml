  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) represents one of the most commonly
      performed spinal operations internationally, often in the context of symptomatic
      radiculopathy or myelopathy secondary to cervical degenerative disease. Approximately half of
      surgeons continue to prescribe a period of post-operative bracing with a cervical collar.
      However, there is currently no high quality evidence available to support the routine use of
      post-operative bracing after ACDF; further, braces are expensive and have been associated
      with a variety of local complications. In summary, the current lack of evidence, and lack of
      consensus amongst surgeons, regarding best practices in the use of post-operative bracing
      after ACDF, places the surgeon and the patient in a precarious position.

      Our randomized trial comparing the impact of 6 weeks of post-operative bracing with a rigid
      cervical collar vs. no post-operative bracing, on a variety of clinical and radiological
      outcomes, for adult patients with cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy undergoing single
      or multi-level ACDF.

          3. deemed appropriate by the attending surgeon involved for a one, two or three level
             plated ACDF or a one-level ACDF with a standalone interbody cage; and

          4. able to cooperate in the completion of all study consents, forms and documents. 5.
             Participants who are able to speak, read and write at an elementary school level

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. those with previous cervical surgery;

          2. those undergoing single or multi-level plated ACDF for a diagnosis related to
             malignancy, infection or trauma;

          3. those undergoing a single or multi-level plated ACDF augmented with a posterior
             cervical fusion or posterior cervical decompression and fusion;
