      Background Three-dimensional (3D) imaging and subsequent 3D virtual treatment planning are
      becoming state of the art in orthognathic surgery. However, current available software is
      still too time-consuming. KLS Martin (Tuttlingen, Germany) has currently completed the
      preclinical and the single surgeon (GS) closed beta-phase of their novel 3D virtual planning
      software, IPS (Individual Patient Solutions) CaseDesigner (IPSCD).

      Objectives The investigators aim to test pre-release versions of the IPSCD software under
      real-world working conditions in strictly selected university, general and private hospital
      settings. In specific, they aim to demonstrate that the IPSCD will ensure a significant
      reduction in treatment planning time.

      Study design closed beta-phase; international, multi-centric, prospective study Patients
      presenting at the division of maxillofacial surgery at the different hospital centers, for an
      orthognathic-related problem will receive a complete routine work-up, including a cone-beam
      CT (CBCT) according to the IPSCD protocol. The same surgeon and/or orthodontist will run all
      the virtual planning steps with the novel software. Timing of the eight major steps will be
      measured with a digital chronometer.

      One hundred and eight patient cases will be planned with the IPSCD software in the
      participating centers over a period of three months, in the order of respectively one, three
      and five cases per month per participating center.

      Investigators will register anonymized patient demographics (age, gender, clinical diagnosis,
      type of surgery), and provide feedback regarding the required time to complete the different
      surgical planning steps, regarding the number of failed alignments, and the occurrence of
      software bugs. Intergroup comparison of virtual planning time between the different centers
      will be analyzed. In addition, the learning effect will be examined through comparison of the
      different cases planned by the same surgeon and/or orthodontist, or in comparison to the
      initial beta-testing phase results by GS.
