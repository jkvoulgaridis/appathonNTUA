  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the current study is to determine if participating in a therapy dog activity is
      associated with changes in perceived stress, mood, and job satisfaction and commitment. A
      secondary goal is to explore a potential dose effect of multiple treatments as well as
      control for novelty effect.

      This study will be conducted at Aetna Headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut. A pre-post
      repeated measures design will be used to compare study participant outcomes between a
      treatment (therapy dog activity) and comparison (low impact physical activity) condition.
      Outcome variables of interest are perceived stress measured by a stress visual analog scale
      (SVAS), mood measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and job satisfaction
      and commitment measured by an investigator-developed Job Satisfaction Survey (consisting of a
      combination of existing validated scales). Pet ownership, attitudes toward dogs measured by
      the Dog Attitude Scale, and trait stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, will be
      assessed as moderating variables.
