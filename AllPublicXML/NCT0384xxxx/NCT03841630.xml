  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the side effects related to LY3437943 given as a
      single injection under the skin to healthy participants. Blood tests will be performed to
      check how much LY3437943 gets into the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of
      it. Each enrolled participant will receive a single dose of LY3437943 or placebo. The study
      will last up to approximately 71 days for each participant, including screening.
