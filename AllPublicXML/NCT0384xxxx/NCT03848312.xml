  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is the most expensive medical condition in the US and increases in prevalence with
      age. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of
      dementia. Mild cognitive impairment is a transitional stage between normal cognitive aging
      and Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia, and is indicative of higher risk for
      dementia. In addition to the obvious health and quality-of-life ramifications of dementia,
      there are high direct (e.g., subsidizing residential care needs) and indirect (e.g., lost
      productivity of family caregivers) economic costs. Implementing interventions to prevent MCI
      and dementia among older adults is of critical importance to health and maintained
      quality-of-life for millions of Americans. Recent data analyses from the Advanced Cognitive
      Training in Vital Elderly study (ACTIVE) indicate that a specific cognitive intervention,
      speed of processing training (SPT), significantly delays the incidence of cognitive
      impairment across 10 years. The primary contribution of the proposed research will be the
      determination of whether this cognitive training technique successfully delays the onset of
      clinically defined MCI or dementia across three years.

      Preventing Alzheimer's Disease with Cognitive Training: The PACT Trial

      The primary objective is to establish the feasibility of the proposed field trial including
      meeting participant enrollment goals. The feasibility of the field trial will be established
      by identifying enrollment sites, hiring and training staff in study protocols and standard
      operating procedures, developing marketing tools, and initiating recruitment. The enrollment
      goal is to accrue 1600 participants within 1 year of starting data collection.

      The secondary objective is to ascertain participants' willingness to enroll in a longitudinal
      clinical trial and to subsequently complete a multispecialty clinical diagnostic evaluation,
      psychometric testing, MRI, PET scan, and genetic testing. Participants' willingness to allow
      access to medicare records will also be determined.

      If the trial is funded and extended into a longitudinal study, the primary goal of the
      subsequent trial will be to ascertain the effectiveness of cognitive speed of processing
      training (SPT) to reduce the incidence of MCI or dementia.

      Design and Outcomes: A pilot randomized clinical trial among 1600 adults 65 years of age and
      older will be completed in order to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a larger trial
      designed to test the effectiveness of computerized cognitive speed of processing training
      (SPT) to reduce incidence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia.

      Participants will be screened with an inclusion/exclusion questionnaire and those potentially
      eligible will complete brief memory screening, depression screening, and other
      questionnaires. Those eligible will be randomized to either cognitive speed of processing
      training (SPT) or an active control condition (computer games) and will complete at least
      three in-person, supervised training sessions. Additional exercises will be completed at-home
      over the next 3 to 5 months followed by booster sessions 1- and 2-years later. Participants'
      willingness to enroll in a longitudinal trial and to subsequently complete a multispecialty
      clinical diagnostic evaluation, MRI, psychometric testing, PET scan, genetic testing, and to
      allow access to Medicare records will be assessed.

      Participants will initially complete 25 sessions of training and will complete an additional
      10 sessions of booster training 1- and 2- years later. Participants will first be instructed
      to complete 2-3 sessions of training per week until 25 sessions are completed. At 1- year and
      again at 2-years, participants will be instructed to complete an additional 10 sessions of
      training.

      Sample Size and Population: Adults 65 years of age and older (N=1600) will be randomly
      assigned to SPT (n=800) or the control condition (n=800).

The goal is for &lt;=85% of the sample to have education levels of high school or more and &gt;=15% of the sample with education levels less than high school.</description>
