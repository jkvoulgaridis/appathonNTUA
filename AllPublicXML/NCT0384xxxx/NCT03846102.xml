    <textblock>
      Appropriate management of analgesia for proximal femoral fractures is a common problem in the
      emergency department (ED). Side effects from morphine usage such as nausea, vomiting,
      respiratory depression, sedation, and obstipation are especially pronounced in elderly.
      Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block (FICB) holds promise as a simple and safe, and effective
      alternative method to reduce pain. Local anaesthetic injected in the anatomic space
      underlying the fascia iliaca, spreads to block the nerves traversing it. This regional
      anaesthesia includes the femoral nerve. Previous studies in the ED showed promise but lacked
      blinding, involved low numbers of subjects, or did not use ultrasound localisation of the
      injection site. The latter is becoming common practice. In this randomised placebo controlled
      trial the FICB with ultrasound localisation of injection of levobupivacaïne will be compared
      to the FICB with placebo. It aims to prove that less morphine is used in the intervention
      group. Other research parameters are pain scores and minor adverse events related to morphine
      use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal femoral fractures are common in the ED. A major challenge in such subjects is pain
      management. Suboptimal pain control is associated with stress, a prolonged hospital stay and
      delirium. Pain or fear of pain can limit early mobilisation, an important goal in treatment.
      Therefore early pain management is essential. Standard analgesic care consists of
      acetaminophen, opiates and/or Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's). Opiates can
      cause respiratory depression, constipation, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. Especially
      elderly patients are at risk for these side effects Regional nerve blocks are increasingly
      being adopted as an alternative pain management to systemic analgesia in the ED. One of such
      is the Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block (FICB). This is safe and simple to perform. Results
      from studies, despite lacking ultrasound guidance are promising. No permanent disability
      resulted from the few minor complications that have been reported. These include bladder
      perforation, pneumoretroperitoneum and neuropathy of the femoral nerve. Furthermore no
      additional treatment was necessary. Ultrasound prevents occurrence of such complications.

      The studies that have compared this specific block to standard analgesia have shown that
      regional anaesthesia may be superior. However these studies have low inclusion numbers and
      lack of randomisation and/or blinding.. Literature up until now has used the numerical rating
      scale (NRS) as a primary outcome. Although the NRS is a very trustworthy method of measuring
      pain, the score is a subjective outcome Morphine consumption on the other hand is more
      objective.

      The FICB involves the anatomic space situated at the level of the groin in which important
      nerves that supply the hip joint lie. Anteriorly the space is covered by the iliac fascia. It
      is therefore known as the fascia iliaca compartment. By introducing a large volume of local
      anaesthetic solutions, the femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous and to a lesser extent the
      obturator nerve are anesthetized. Solutions can spread easily within the compartment.
      Therefore a safe position injection site can be chosen, minimizing the risk of intravascular
      injection and nerve damage. The classic position for injection is about 3 centimetres lateral
      from the femoral nerve. In the original FICB the injection site is determined by using
      landmarks. The fascia iliaca compartment is then approached by introducing a blunt needle,
      which enables the physician to feel a 'pop' twice. The first pop is felt when the fascia lata
      is pierced, the second when the fascia iliaca is passed.

      Most ED's nowadays have access to ultrasound. When used for FICB placement, the local
      anaesthetic solution is visualized as it is introduced into the space. Therefore a higher
      chance of successful placement of agent and a lower risk of complications can be expected. So
      far no large double blind randomised placebo controlled trials have evaluated morphine use in
      ultrasound guided placement of local anaesthetic agents with FICB in the ED. This study is
      designed as such. Total morphine use will be taken as the primary outcome, administered in
      the form of patient controlled analgesia (PCA).

    <masking_description>Syringes with either placebo or levobupivacaïne will be prepared under aseptic conditions and blinded by the hospital pharmacy. A supply of at least six syringe packs will be kept in the emergency department. Each pack will contain three different doses of either levobupivacain or placebo, of which one will be used according to the weight of the patient. When medication is used, the nurse, physician or researcher will inform the pharmacy, so new medication can be prepared. The hospital pharmacy will keep track of randomisation and register the allocation to either treatment or placebo. Allocation will remain blinded until all patients are included and all data is included.</masking_description>

    <description>Pain scores will be reported with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The NRS is a 11 point scale that is used in the hospital pain protocol. 0 equals to no pain at all, 10 is the worst pain one can imagine. It is regarded as a reliable instrument for pain assessment in patients. Patients will be asked to keep track of their pain score at different time points, starting after FICB placement. They will be asked to report their pain score hourly until 22.00h and from 7.00h the next day. The pain scores will be measured with a dedicated android application, with which patients are asked to self-report their hourly pain scores. When patients are asleep no NRS will be recorded, unless they are awake. Also nurses will report pain scores following their normal rounds when changing shifts. A sleeping patient will be regarded as having a low pain score.</description>
