  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single arm, open label, two-part study that will assess safety,
      tolerability and clinical activity of GSK2857916 given in combination with a programmed cell
      death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in subjects with RRMM. This study will enroll adult
      subjects with RRMM, who have undergone stem cell transplant or who are considered transplant
      ineligible. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of GSK2857916 in combination with 200 milligrams (mg) pembrolizumab to
      establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The following dose levels of GSK2857916 are
      planned to be studied: 2.5 milligrams per kilograms (mg/kg) (dose level [DL] 1) and 3.4 mg/kg
      (DL2). Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort. Once the RP2D has been identified, an expansion
      cohort will open for enrolment to confirm the safety profile and to evaluate the clinical
      activity of the combination. Up to 40 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this two-part
      study (up to 12 in Part 1, and 28 in Part 2).
