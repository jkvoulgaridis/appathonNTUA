  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled phase I clinical study on MBS301 in treatment of patients with HER2
      positive recurrent or metastatic malignant solid tumors who have progressed despite standard
      therapy or are intolerant of standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy exists. The
      study will include a dose escalation period followed by an expansion period.
