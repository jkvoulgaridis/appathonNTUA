    <textblock>
      In a multicenter randomized controlled trial the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of
      the novel heart rate meter NeoBeat on ventilation performance and short-term outcomes
      compared to standard care in newborns in need of positive pressure ventilation to initiate
      spontaneous breathing after birth.

    <textblock>
      Heart rate assessment immediately after birth in newborn infants is the most important
      clinical indicator to evaluate the status of a newborn, and critical to the correct guidance
      of resuscitation efforts.

      One of the knowledge gaps identified by the International Liason Committee on Resuscitation
      (ILCOR) is how best to assess ventilation during newborn resuscitation, and improved
      technology for rapid application of ECG.

      Laerdal Medical has developed a novel heart rate meter, NeoBeat, implementing ECG
      dry-electrodes in a snug-fit abdomen-shaped buckle for for rapid application on the newborn.

      In a multicenter randomized controlled trial the investigators will study the efficacy of
      NeoBeat on ventilation performance and short-term outcomes compared to standard care in
      newborns in need of positive pressure ventilation to initiate spontaneous respiration after
      birth.

    <description>NeoBeat will be placed on all newborns immediately after birth to assess the heartrate for at least 5 minutes, or longer if the newborn needs resuscitation. Intervention subjects will have a visible display of the heart rate on the NeoBeat, to guide healthcare providers in further management of the newborn.</description>

    <description>NeoBeat will be placed on the newborn to collect information on heart rate, but heart rate is not displayed to the healthcare providers. If the newborn is in need of resuscitation to initiate spontaneous respiration, the baby will be transferred to the resuscitation bay. According to recommendations the heart rate should be assessed and positive pressure ventilation initiated within one minute of life. Standard care is to assess heart rate by conventional ECG and/or pulse oximetry, alternatively auscultation of the heart.</description>

    <intervention_name>NeoBeat with a visible display</intervention_name>
    <description>NeoBeat (Laerdal Medical) is a CE approved novel heart rate meter, able to detect heart rate in newborns within seconds of birth. The NeoBeat uses ECG dry-electrodes in a snug-fit abdomen-shaped buckle for rapid application around the newborn`s abdomen or thorax. It allows healthcare providers to reliably assess heart rate of the newborn immediately after birth and continuously during resuscitation.</description>
