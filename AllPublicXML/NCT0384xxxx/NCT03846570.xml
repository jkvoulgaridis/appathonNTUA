      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing formoterol-beclometason 12/200
      mcg BID versus placebo to evaluate the clinical effect on coughing in patients with
      non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis, native to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy
      and no history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the management of non-CF bronchiectasis, bronchodilator treatment (LABA)and use of inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) is still a matter of debate. Previous studies have claimed beneficial
      effects of ICS (with or without bronchodilator), such as improvement of the HRQL, a reduction
      in daily sputum volume and/or exacerbation frequency. However, in all previous studies there
      was no clear exclusion of patients with asthma or COPD, or no use of placebo. The current
      study will be the first study evaluating the effect of ICS/LABA treatment in non-CF
      bronchiectasis excluding patients with asthma and COPD.

      This is a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing
      Formoterol-beclomethasone 12/200 mcg BID versus placebo to evaluate the reduction in cough
      measured by the Leicester cough questionnaire. Secondary objectives are the improvement of
      health-related quality of life and symptoms, reduction in sputum production, pulmonary
      function (FEV1) and the frequency of exacerbation. Furthemore, we will assess the
      inflammatory response in serum and sputum.

      After a wash-out period of 1 month, eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment with
      formoterol-beclomethasone or matching placebo. All subjects will be treated with the regimen
      of medication for 3 months. An end-of-study (EOS) visit will be performed after completion of
      the follow-up period.

    <description>Mean Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcome Quality of Life Questionnaire for Bronchiectasis (QoL-B) Respiratory Symptoms Domain Score (measured at baseline and 3 months).
The QoL-B was a disease-specific questionnaire developed for non-Cystic fibrosis Bronchiectasis. It covers 8 dimensions: physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, vitality, treatment burden, health perceptions, and respiratory symptoms. Each dimension was scored separately on a scale of 0 to 100, and higher scores represent better outcomes. For this outcome measure, the respiratory symptoms domain score was reported.</description>
