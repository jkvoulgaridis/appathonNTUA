    <textblock>
      Hypothesis The initial use of ultrasound guidance when indicated for difficult peripheral IV
      access will reduce the number of attempts required to achieve successful peripheral IV
      insertion and improve patient care and satisfaction.

      Study objective The purpose of this research study is to compare 2 established peripheral IV
      insertion techniques (traditional vs ultrasound guided) in order to develop an algorithmic
      approach to peripheral IV insertion. Patient characteristics, medical history and
      co-morbidities, in addition to a pre-insertion physical exam vein assessment, will allow for
      the introduction of a vein classification system and a difficult IV insertion algorithm.
      Selecting the optimal modality for initial IV insertion will decrease the total number of
      attempts, facilitate appropriate gauge and location of IV insertion, avoid central line
      placement, decrease IV insertion pain scores and improve patient satisfaction. Currently,
      ultrasound guided peripheral IV insertion is performed by the IV team at Cedars-Sinai Medical
      Center or a trained anesthesia provider as a rescue technique after multiple failed attempts
      by traditional technique. Secondary to the constraints of both trained providers and
      equipment resources, the cohort of difficult IV insertion patients are subjected to multiple
      traditional IV insertion attempts prior to escalation to ultrasound guidance and
      occasionally, unnecessary central line placements indicated by only poor intravenous access.

      Primary end point: Grade 2A vein classification cohort 2nd IV insertion attempt success rate
      comparison of traditional vs ultrasound guided technique, IV insertion pain scores, Patient
      satisfaction Secondary end points: Grade 2B and grade 3 vein classification ultrasound guided
      IV insertion success rate. Grade 1 and 2a vein classification 1st attempt IV insertion
      success rate. Grade 1 visualization 2nd attempt IV insertion success rate comparison of
      traditional vs ultrasound guided technique. Difficult IV insertion risk factors and
      associations, IV gauge and location, central line placement because of inadequate peripheral
      IV access
