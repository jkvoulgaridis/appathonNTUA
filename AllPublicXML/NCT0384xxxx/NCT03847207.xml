      A Phase 1, first in human, three-part, single centre study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of single ascending subcutaneous doses of HTL0030310 in healthy
      subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, three part study with the objective to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending subcutaneous doses of
      HTL0030310 in healthy subjects. Part 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised
      study assessing single ascending doses of HTL0030310. Part 2 is a site-blind (sponsor
      unblinded), placebo-controlled, part-randomised, fixed-sequence, single-dose, 4-period study
      assessing the PD of a positive control, pasireotide, following administration of challenge
      agents. Part 3 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, part-randomised, fixed-sequence,
      single-dose, HTL0030310 proof of pharmacological effect study, where PD effects of HTL0030310
      will be investigated following administration of challenge agents. The challenge agents
      administered in this study will be: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), Growth
      hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) combined with
      desmopressin.
