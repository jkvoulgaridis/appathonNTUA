  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to compare ESD procedural time and cost facilitated
      with a dual balloon accessory device versus ESD procedures performed without the accessory
      device. Study is designed to detect if the double balloon interventional platform helps to
      perform removal of benign complex colonic lesions safer and in more efficient way.

      This is a prospective, post-market, randomized clinical trial comparing colonic ESD
      procedures utilizing the DiLumen™ Endolumenal Interventional Platform to colonic ESD
      procedures that are performed without use the DiLumen™ device.

      The study participants will be randomly assigned to study group and control group The
      treatment group will consist of up to 100 subjects treated with the DiLumen™ device. The
      control group will consist of up to 100 subjects treated without DiLumen™ device. Assessments
      will include procedure timepoints, anesthesia use, polyp location and classification,
      over-all cost assessment, and general complications.

      The primary outcome will be analyzed using parametric statistics to compare the means of the
      study and control groups. P-values and confidence intervals will be reported. Descriptive and
      summary statistics will also be employed. Secondary outcomes will be summarized with
      descriptive statistics.
