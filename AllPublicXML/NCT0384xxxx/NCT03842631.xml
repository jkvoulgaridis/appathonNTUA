  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Timolol Maleate treatment
      for different depth of infantile hemangioma based on B-ultrasonography. Based on the depth of
      hemangioma, patients will be proactively allocated to two groups. And then, all patients in
      both groups will receive topical timolol treatment in the same protocol and dosage.

      Primary: Describe the efficacy of 0.5% topical timolol maleate drops in different depth of
      infantile hemangioma as assessed through IB-ultrasound.

        Patients with infantile hemangiomas presented to the outpatient clinic of Shanghai Ninth
        People's Hospital would be considered for enrolment in the study. The diagnosis of
        proliferating infantile hemangioma is based on medical history and B-ultrasonography.
