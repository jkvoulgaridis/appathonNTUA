  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is the agent of choice for induction and maintenance of day care anesthesia in
      children and has a wide acceptance among pediatric anesthesiologists.

      Emergence agitation (EA) is a frequent postoperative complication in pediatric patients
      receiving inhalational anesthetics with a rapid recovery, e.g. sevoflurane Magnesium sulfate
      is a non anesthetic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, Regional anesthetic techniques
      have major two benefits which are lowering anesthetic requirements intraoperatively and
      providing adequate postoperative pain relief.

      Magnesium sulfate is an adjuvant that alters the perception and duration of pain by serving
      as an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors. Caudal injection of bupivacaine
      with magnesium sulfate in pediatric patients after inguinoscrotal operations provided
      adequate postoperative analgesia without producing many side effects. Caudal block with local
      anesthetic with or without adjuvants may prevent emergence agitation with effective
      postoperative pain management.

        -  So the aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of caudal versus intravenous
           magnesium sulfate infusions in controlling emergence agitations after inhalational
           sevoflurane anesthesia in children who will undergo lower abdominal surgeries.

      Participants and methods

      All participants will receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg dialed in 10 cm
      saline.

      The participants will be divided to 3 groups

        1. Bupivacaine group (B group) (group 1) N = 31 :-

        2. Magnesium sulfate caudal group (MC group) (group 2) N = 31 :-

        3. Magnesium sulfate I.V group (MV group) (group 3) N = 31 :-

      Postoperative assessment in the ( PACU):-

        -  The oxygen saturation (SO2), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) are
           monitored by the observer blinded to group allocation on admission and 10 mins till
           discharge (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60mints, time of discharge) from the PACU.

        -  Emergence agitations (Pediatric anesthesia emergency delirium scale (PAED) The presence
           of Emergence agitation and its severity will be measured using (PAED).

      The presence of Pain and its severity will be measured using FLACC scale.

        -  Time of first postoperative administration of fentanyl in mints

        -  Modified Aldrete score :- The discharge from the PACU will be measured using Modified
           Aldrete score.

      Participants and methods All participants will receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25%
      1mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline.

      The participants will be divided to 3 groups

        1. Bupivacaine group (B group) (group 1) N = 31 :- The participants will receive caudal
           block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline.

           + I.V injection of 10 cm saline over 10 mins then, followed by I.V infusion 50 cm saline
           with rate 10-20 ml/h according to child weight.

        2. Magnesium sulfate caudal group (MC group) (group 2) N = 31 :- The participants will
           receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg plus Magnesium sulfate 50 mg diluted
           in 10 cm saline.

             -  I.V injection of 10 cm saline over 10 mins then, followed by I.V infusion of 50 cm
                saline with rate 10-20 ml/h according to child weight.

        3. Magnesium sulfate I.V group (MV group) (group 3) N = 31 :- The participants will receive
           caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline.

           + I.V injection of Magnesium sulfate 30mg/kg diluted in 10 cm saline over 10 mins then,
           followed by I.V infusion one ampule of Magnesium sulfate 500mg diluted in 50 cm saline
           with rate 10 mg/kg/h.

           Standard monitoring is used during anesthesia and surgery include :-
           electrocardiography, non-invasive arterial pressure, arterial oxygen saturation using
           pulse oximeter and end-tidal concentrations are measured using capnography.

           An intravenous line is secured before induction of anesthesia, all participants will
           receive a standardized rapid sequence induction of anesthesia and oxygen administration
           for 3 minutes. Anesthesia is induced with Inhalation of 8% sevoflurane without use of
           muscle relaxant, cricoid pressure is applied and the trachea intubated with a
           suitable-size endotracheal tube. Maintained end-tidal sevoflurane concentration will be
           between 2.5-3.5 and will be titrated. The participants will breath spontaneously during
           surgery and tidal volume will be adjusted to maintain normocarbia. I.V injection of 0.2
           mg/kg dexamethasone after induction as a prophylaxis of post-operative nausea and
           vomiting of Mg sulfate. Caudal block will be performed to participants before surgical
           incision with 1 of 2 investigators using the following technique :- The Participants are
           placed in left lateral position after induction of general anesthesia. The back of the
           participant including the sacral hiatus are carefully sterilized with an antiseptic
           solution and sterile drapes will be placed around the injection site. The technique will
           be done by introducing a 23-gauge hypodermic needle perpendicular to the sacrococcygeal
           membrane with the bevel in the direction of the long fibers of the membrane. The needle
           will be inserted until there is release of impedance as it pierced the sacrococcygeal
           membrane. Then, it is directed upwards so that it make an angle of 20-30° with the skin
           about 2 mm so that the whole bevel will be inside the sacral canal. The injection will
           be made over a period of about 60 s and then a small elastoplast dressing is placed over
           the injection site and the participant will be placed supine. Intraoperative analgesic
           supplement will not be given.

           Caudal block will be failed if HR &amp;/or MAP increased 10 more than the previous basal
           value of beginning of surgery.participants will be fasting 4-6 hours for solid foods and
           2 hours for clear fluids. Balanced fluid therapy containing Na Cl, glucose, K and Ca
           will be infused according to body weight as follows :1st 10 kg 4 ml/kg/hour, 2nd 10 kg 2
           ml/kg/hour and 1 ml//hour for every 1 kg.

           Then, anesthetic gas discontinued and replaced O2 100%. At the end of the operation the
           trachea is extubated, The participants will be transferred to the postanesthesia care
           unit (PACU).

      quantitative data will be presented in the form of mean and standard Deviation. One-way ANOVA
      test will be used to compare between quantitative data of the three groups. Paired t-test
      will be used to study between two values in the same group. Pain score, sedation score will
      be represented by median and range and will be analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test to compare
      between the three groups. Mann-Whitney test will be used for comparison between 2 groups
      separately. Significance will be considered when P-value is less than 0.05

      Sample size The primary outcomes was the incidence of emergence agitation. A previous study
      on the effect of magnesium sulfate infusion on the incidence and severity of emergence
      agitation in children under going adenotonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia reported a
      72% incidence of emergence agitation. (14). We presumed that a clinically significant
      difference would be 50% between the incidence of agitation in the intervention and control
      groups. With a power of 85% (a = 0.05, two-tailed), the sample size was calculated to be 93
      patients (31 in each group). The sample size was calculated using Power Analysis and Sample
      Size 12 software (NCSS, Kay seville, ut USA).
