      REPAIR-ALS is a single-center open label pilot, sequential group, investigator and patient
      blinded study to assess the CNS metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS) within twelve (12) months of Screening. The primary endpoint is the ratio of
      the oxidized to reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+:NADH) measured
      non-invasively by 31phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS).

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center open label pilot, sequential group, investigator blinded study of the
      CNS metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients
      who have been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis within twelve months of Screening.
      The Sponsor will select a starting treatment dose of CNM-Au8 for the initial treatment.
      Investigators and patients will be blinded to each cohort's study dose. Upon completion of
      the first treatment cohort, the Sponsor will select a single dose or two different doses for
      the subsequent second cohort from a pre-specified dosing selection plan based on the
      evaluation of the 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) changes versus baseline in
      the first cohort. Up to a total of two treatment cohorts may be studied (n=12
      patients/cohort, total n=24 patients). All patients will receive daily oral treatment over
      twelve consecutive weeks during each cohort's Treatment Period.

      There will be three study periods per treatment cohort:

      A four-week screening period (Screening Period); A twelve-week treatment period (Treatment
      Period); A four-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment).

      The primary study outcome, CNS metabolic changes, will be assessed based upon each patient's
      Week 12 study visit versus the pre-treatment baseline. The primary endpoint is the brain
      metabolic effects of treatment with CNM-Au8 as assessed by an improvement of 31P-MRS
      assessment of Brain Tissue Cellular Redox Potential defined by the measured tissue ratio of
      NAD+:NADH concentrations following 12 weeks of once daily treatment.
