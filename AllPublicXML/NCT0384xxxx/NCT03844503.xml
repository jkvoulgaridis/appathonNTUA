    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if resistant starch reduces the 2 hour
      glycemic response as measured by positive incremental area under the blood glucose response
      curve (Positive iAUC- ignores area below fasting). Secondary endpoints include insulin iAUC,
      glucose and insulin net incremental AUC (net iAUC), time point of peak rise (T max) of
      glucose and insulin, and glucose and insulin concentrations at each time point (C max).

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center randomized, single-blinded, cross-over design study to allow for
      three acute evaluations of 2 hr postprandial glucose in response to 3 cereal bars containing
      different amounts of resistant starch. The study will evaluate acute glucose and insulin
      response in healthy men and women aged 20-45 years.

      The trial will initiate with record collection to assess background general health (screening
      visit) and dietary intake followed by counseling to follow a relatively low polyphenolic
      beverages/foods diet, and high fiber containing food (particularly fermentable) which will
      commence at least 3 days before randomization (washout) and continue for the duration of the
      study. After 3-day washout period, subjects will be randomized to treatment order within
      Phase (Treatment cereal bars A, B, C). Glucose and insulin responses following the
      consumption of cereal bars will be determined by blood collections via venous catheter. Blood
      samples (3 ml of blood) will be collected at -5 min (before the cereal bar consumption) and
      15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after consuming bars for assessment in changes in glucose and
      insulin concentrations in the plasma. The primary endpoint is glucose positive incremental
      area under the curve (positive iAUC- ignores area below fasting) among the three tests bars.
      Secondary endpoints are glucose peak, insulin positive iAUC and peak and glucose and insulin
      net incremental AUC (net iAUC). Adverse events also will be collected and frequency
      tabulated.
