  <brief_title>A Study to Test How Different Doses of BI 685509 Are Tolerated in Patients With Liver Problems</brief_title>
  <official_title>Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Rising Oral Doses of BI 685509 Over 28 Days in Patients With Mild and Moderate Hepatic Impairment and of Single Oral BI 685509 Dose Compared to Healthy Volunteers</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is the evaluation of safety and tolerability in patients
      with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification A and B]
      over different dose regimes of BI 685509 compared to placebo. A secondary objective is to
      investigate pharmacokinetics of different doses of BI 685509 in patients with mild to
      moderate hepatic impairment (CTP A and CTP B). In addition, another secondary objective is to
      compare safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in patients with mild to moderate hepatic
      impairment (CTP A and CTP B) of single BI 685509 dose to individually matched healthy
      volunteers

        Key Inclusion Criteria for all trial participants:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at screening

          -  Male subjects with partners of child-bearing potential must be willing to use condoms
             from the time of the first intake of study drug until completion of follow-up

          -  Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) ≥ 85 mmHg at screening visit

        Key inclusion for Patient Groups 1 and 2

          -  If on treatment with non-selective beta blockers (NSBB), stable dose since ≥ 8 weeks
             prior to screening, with no planned dose change of the therapy during study conduct.
             All other medications stable 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Patient Group 1: Patients with CTP A and portal hypertension (defined as liver
             stiffness &gt;15 kPa during screening) and without a previous decompensation event
             [ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, or jaundice (except Gilbert's disease
             or hemolysis when bilirubin will be almost exclusively indirect hyperbilirubinemia)].
             Self-limited and resolved historical events of decompensation like ascites or
             encephalopathy are allowed if they have occurred at least 6 weeks prior to screening
             and do not require continued therapeutic intervention at the time of screening.

          -  Patient Group 2: Patients with CTP B (with liver stiffness &gt;15 kPa during screening)

        Key inclusion for Healthy Volunteer group

          -  Subjects who are healthy, according to the investigator's assessment, individually
             matched to a participant among Patient Groups 1 and 2 according to the following
             criteria: age within ± 5 years, body weight within ± 15%, and gender

          -  Further inclusion criteria apply

        Key exclusion for all trial participants

          -  Ongoing chronic alcohol or drug use, which in the investigator's opinion, makes the
             patient an unreliable trial participant or unlikely to complete the trial.

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts based on
             the investigator´s judgment

        Key exclusion for Patient Groups

          -  Patient Group 2: treatment-refractory ascites

          -  Patient Group 2: recent decompensation event (refractory ascites, recurrent variceal
             hemorrhage, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or
             hepatorenal syndrome) within 6 weeks of screening

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
