      The objective of the current study is to compare the effects of bowel recipe with psyllium on
      symptoms associated with constipation.

    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the urogynecology clinics at Parkland Health and Hospital System and
      UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas from July 2003 to July 2005 were screened for
      symptoms of constipation. Subjects were randomized to a 6-week course of either psyllium
      (Konsyl, Konsyl Pharmaceuticals, Easton, MD) or a special bowel recipe. The bowel recipe was
      a modification of that used by Behm and consisted of 1 cup of unprocessed wheat bran, 1 cup
      of applesauce, and 1/4 cup of prune juice. A validated constipation scoring questionnaire12
      was administered to participants at the beginning and at the end of the six-week study
      period. During the six-week trial patients also kept a bowel diary recording characteristics
      of each bowel movement.

    <description>A validated constipation scoring questionnaire was administered to participants at the beginning and at the end of the 6-week study period. Previous studies have shown that dietary modifications can result in significant improvement in constipa- tion scores and symptom relief as early as 2 to 6 weeks. The questionnaire consisted of 8 variables: (i) frequency of bowel movements, (ii) painful evacuation, (iii) incomplete evacuation, (iv) abdominal pain, (v) length of time per attempt, (vi) assis- tance with defecation, (vii) unsuccessful attempts at evacuation per 24 hours, and (viii) duration of constipation. Each variable was scored on a range of 0 to 4 (except for ''assistance for defecation,'' which was scored from 0 to 2), and a cumulative score was determined. A global score of 0 is generally considered normal, and a maximum score of 30 indicates severe con- stipation.</description>
