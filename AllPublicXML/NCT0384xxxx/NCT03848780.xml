  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomies are considered as operations of high bleeding risk. The history of massive
      hemorrhage in liver surgery led to the emergence of techniques to control excessive blood
      loss. These techniques temporarily occlude the blood vessels that supply liver (the Pringle
      Maneuver) limiting subsequent losses. However, this leads to the ischemia - reperfusion
      injury impairing liver function. Research points to methods targeting on tempering
      reperfusion pathophysiology. Volatile anesthetics have been used for pharmacological
      preconditioning and proved to protect against organ damage. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the potential beneficial effect of desflurane on ischemia-reperfusion injury of
      the liver. Patients presenting for elective hepatectomy were randomized equally into two
      groups. The Control Group received no pharmacological preconditioning and the Desflurane
      Group received pharmacological preconditioning with Desflurane before induction of ischemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomies are characterized by an elevated risk of severe hemorrhage. The high vascular
      supply of the liver has historically troubled surgeons who resolved to techniques to control
      excessive blood loss. The Pringle Maneuver commonly employed in liver surgery is a temporary
      method to occlude the vascular supply of the liver. As a result, ischemia is developed and a
      pathophysiologic cascade is initiated. Upon the resolution of ischemia, reperfusion occurs
      which is linked to further damage and the ischemia-reperfusion injury is developed. Ischemia
      and reperfusion lead to activation of the innate immune response, which interacts with the
      adaptive immune response. Result of this interaction is the production of inflammatory
      cytokines, chemokines, complement products, and the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of
      injury. Previous studies have shown that animal's livers suffered from ischemia-reperfusion
      injury had increased neutrophil infiltration and pharmacological agents attenuating
      neutrophil's activity improved hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI). Preconditioning
      refers to the exposure of an organ to short intervals of ischemia which has been shown to
      mitigate the aforementioned ischemia-reperfusion injury. Preconditioning can be
      pharmacological and volatile anesthetics have been successfully used in preconditioning
      models. Sevoflurane have been proved beneficial for a series of hepatectomies in limiting
      transaminase levels postoperatively. However, sevoflurane by virtue can be hepatotoxic
      through Compound A production, elevated free calcium and reactive oxide species activation.
      On the other hand, desflurane undergoes minimum liver metabolism. In liver
      ischemia-reperfusion models, desflurane preconditioning led to decreased cell death and
      inflammatory cytokines inhibition.

      The goal of the investigator's study was to investigate the effect of desflurane
      preconditioning in patients undergoing elective hepatectomy of at least two segments.
      Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive pharmacological preconditioning (Desflurane Group,
      Group D) or not (Control Group, Group C). The surgeon and the Intensive Care Unit were
      blinded as to the intervention. Anesthetic management was the same for all patients. For
      GroupD thirty minutes before the initiation of ischemia desflurane was delivered and propofol
      was stopped for the same interval.

The comparative CT method also referred to as the 2-ΔΔCT method was used to calculate the fold change and then convert it to percentage. Their presence has been linked to hepatic cellular injury so increased levels represent worse injury.</description>

    <description>The levels of Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinase 1 and Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinase 2 as evaluated by the relative gene expression using RT-PCR. The comparative CT method also referred to as the 2-ΔΔCT method was used to calculate the fold change and then convert it to percentage. Their inhibitory effect on Matrix Metalloproteinases has been associated with a limitation of cellular injury. Thus, the higher the levels of Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinases the greater their protective activity.</description>

    <description>Hematoxylin Eosin, Gomori and Μasson staining were used. With Hematoxylin Eosin staining the degree of steatosis was assessed while Gomori and Masson staining was used to determine the level of fibrosis.
Steatosis was characterized (x100 magnification) as mild (10%-30%), moderate (30%-60%), severe (&gt;60%) according to the presence of fat droplets in hepatic cells.
Fibrosis was also graded based on the METAVIR score as absent - F0, portal fibrosis without septa - F1, portal fibrosis with rare septa - F2, numerous septa - F3 and cirrhosis - F4.</description>

    <description>Thirty minutes before initiation of ischemia the surgeon was instructed to notify the anesthesiologist. At this single time point, propofol infusion was stopped and substituted with the volatile anesthetic desflurane to achieve a Minimum Alveolar Concentration of 1. The procedure included a 5-minute induction of desflurane, a 20-minute preconditioning and a 5-minute washout period when propofol was reintroduced and desflurane stopped.</description>
