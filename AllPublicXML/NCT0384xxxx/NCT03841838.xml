  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many adults in the United States regularly consumer energy drinks. Currently, the safety of
      energy drinks is still questionable and there are many reports associating energy drinks with
      adverse events including hospitalizations and deaths. Previous research shows that energy
      drink can affect heart rhythm and elevate blood pressure. However, these studies use a higher
      volume (32 ounces) of energy drinks than those available in the market (24 ounces). The
      purpose of this study is to study if 24-ounce energy drinks can significantly affect heart
      rhythm and elevate blood pressure when compared to a placebo.

      The study is a randomized, double blind, controlled, crossover study comparing the effect of
      energy drinks and placebo on cardiovascular parameters including heart rhythm and blood
      pressure.

      Subjects who contact the PI for interest in study participation will be scheduled a time to
      study facility for initial evaluation on eligibility criteria. At initial evaluation,
      participants will be informed about the study details, presented with Informed Consent
      Document (ICD), and be asked to sign the appropriate forms voluntarily if they decide to
      participate. Once consented, participants will be asked a series of questions and screened
      for blood pressure and heart rhythm parameters to determine eligibility to enroll. If patient
      is eligible to enroll, they will be allocated a randomized identification number.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to consume either two-12 oz bottles of energy drink
      and two-12 oz bottles of control drink on 2 separate days. The study will occur over
      approximately 8 days with each session taking about 5 hours per day. Each session will have 6
      days between each other.

      Participants will be expected to refrain from any products containing caffeine or alcohol 48
      hours and fast 10 hours before each study visit. At the beginning of each study visit,
      baseline measurements of ECG, blood pressures, and heart rate will be obtained prior to
      consuming study drinks. Repeat measurements will be obtained every 60 minutes after
      consumption over 4 hours.
