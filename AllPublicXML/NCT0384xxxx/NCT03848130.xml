  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative, progressive and wide spread disease, which may
      lead the patient to severe outcomes e.g. pain, loss of joint motion, inflexibility,
      disability and decreases the quality of life (QOL). As it affects the adults of older age,
      therefore should be emphasized.Effectiveness of Mulligan knee taping, lateral wedge insoles
      and traditional physical therapy(Ultrasound therapy with stretching and strengthening
      exercises) with home exercises as baseline treatment were assessed through RAPA and complete
      KOOS questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with medial compartment 3rd grade knee osteoarthritis were recruited
      and randomly divided into three groups, 20 in each group.The data was collected through
      general demographic questionnaire, rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA) to determine
      physical activity level and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) to determine
      the level of pain severity, stiffness, functional activities, recreational activities and
      Quality of life for enhancing functional independence while having osteoarthritis. For
      between-group analysis, one way ANOVA was used and for within-group analysis longitudinal
      repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was
      used.

    <description>Knee osteoarthritis patients were assessed by general demographic questionnaire, rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA) to determine physical activity level and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) to determine the level of pain severity,stiffness, functional activities, recreational activities and Quality of life for enhancing functional independence and were assigned into knee taping group.Each subject in first group completed 4 weeks of physical therapy sessions which were aimed to decrease pain and stiffness, increase functional activity level, and improve quality of life. Each subject was evaluated for changes in symptoms on, 1st week, 2nd week, 3rd week and 4th week.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mulligan Knee Taping with Home Exercises</intervention_name>
    <description>Each patient in group I i.e. taping group with home exercises was given 40 minutes session. Each session started in sitting or lying position with leg extended and mulligan tape was used. Taping was started in the middle of patella, at the level of superior aspect of patella and pulled the tape medially and fixed the tape at medial border. This tilts the lateral border of patella away from femur and produced skin wrinkling. Besides this, home exercises such as quads isometrics and self stretchings &amp; ROMs were also guided. This session was repeated three times a week for one month (Total 12 sessions/ one month).</description>

    <description>Each patient in group II i.e. lateral wedge insole with home exercises group was given 20-minute session. In each session, Lateral wedge insoles of 7mm made of silicon or ledos material were advised and home exercises in the same way. This session was repeated once a month but evaluations were obtained after a complete week for one month. (Total 4 sessions/one month)</description>

    <description>Each patient in group III i.e. traditional physiotherapy with home exercises group was given 40 to 45-minute session. Each session started in lying position. In each session, therapeutic ultrasound with 1.5MHz frequency and continuous mode for 7 minute was given. Then passive stretchings of the following muscle groups was done; calf, hamstring, quadriceps, hip flexors and hip adductors &amp; abductors and followed by strengthening exercises manually and with quadriceps bench. Home exercises were guided in the same way. This session was repeated 3 to 4 times a month. (Total 12 to 16 sessions/ one month)</description>
