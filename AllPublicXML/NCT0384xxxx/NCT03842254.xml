    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of erythropoietin on the number and function of regulatory T
      cells in adults with autoimmune hepatitis. Participants will receive a single dose of
      erythropoietin, and then the investigators will collect blood at different time points for
      analysis of regulatory T cell number and function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is data from the laboratory that erythropoietin helps stimulate regulatory T cells, a
      type of immune cell which is thought to combat autoimmunity, but this study will look at
      whether it does the same thing in adults with autoimmune hepatitis.
