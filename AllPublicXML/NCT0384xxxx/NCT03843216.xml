      This study evaluates in a prospectively collected multicenter cohort the existence,

    <textblock>
      Since an evidence-based personalised conservative approach (EBPCA) to Adolescent Idiopathic
      Scoliosis has never been checked, the investigators studied a prospectively collected
      multicenter cohort with the aim to verify in the different clinical situations 1) the
      existence, characteristics and determinants of EBPCA; 2) the obtained results and their
      determinant; 3) the rate of over- and under-treatment and their determinants. These results
      are expected to check the actual evidence in everyday clinic, to provide a benchmark for
      future studies, and to inform guidelines producers and consequently health policy in high
      income countries, but also and particularly in low-middle income countries where surgery is
      difficult due to the high costs, and missing competences and structures.

             facilities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous bracing;

          -  absence of x-rays in the 3 months before/after the start and the end of
