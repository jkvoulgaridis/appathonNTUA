  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that end tidal oxygen (ETO2) monitoring can be useful to determine
      the adequacy of preoxygenation. No study has assessed the correlation between ETO2 values
      obtained during preoxygenation to predict the PaO2 in patients undergoing RSI in the ED. Our
      objective was to determine whether a novel equation using the ETO2 at the end of
      preoxygenation could reliably estimate the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) in
      critically-ill ED patients undergoing RSI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) is the preferred and most commonly-used method of definitive
      airway management among critically ill emergency department (ED) patients requiring
      intubation. Adequate preoxygenation is intended to prolong the safe apnoeic period. Optimal
      preoxygenation for ED patient undergoing RSI is best described as a two-part process of
      denitrogenation of the functional residual capacity (FRC) and the formation of an oxygen
      reservoir within the alveoli. End-tidal O2 (EtO2) has been shown to be a reliable surrogate
      marker for denitrogenation. Most of the literature supporting EtO2 as an adequate maker of
      adequate preoxygenation has been conducted in the operating room setting. This population
      varies significantly from the population requiring endotracheal intubation in the ED. Our
      study aim was to show that the use of a gas analyzer measuring the fraction of inspired
      oxygen (FiO2) and EtO2 during the preoxygenation phase of ED RSI can reliably predict the
      minimal PaO2 at the end of the ED preoxygenation period.
