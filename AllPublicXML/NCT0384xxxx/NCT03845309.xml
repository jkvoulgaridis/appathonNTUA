      This study recruited patients diagnosed with heart failure by cardiologists and cardiac
      outpatients whose cardiac functions were graded from 1 to 4 according to the New York Heart
      Association as the study participants. The participants were provided active nutrition
      intervention including diet optimization,specific recommendations and nutritional supplement
      prescriptions in cases in which nutritional goals were not reached.In addition, this study
      offered advice by referencing lifestyle change advice provided by the American Heart
      Association for patients with heart failure.

      The Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form was used to assess malnutrition indicator values.
      The participant water, nutrient (i.e., carbohydrates, protein, and fat), and calorie intake
      data were collected using their recollection of their dietary intake and food intake
      frequency over a 24-hour dietary recall. The amount of fluid and sodium administered was
      provided according to the cardiac function grades indicated by the New York Heart
      Association.In addition, dietary assessments and nutritional advice were offered on the basis
      of the patients' conditions (i.e., age, activity, and comorbidity).

      Finally, instrumental activities of daily living, EQ-5D (an instrument for measuring quality
      of life), grip performance, and 6-minute walk test data were utilized to analyze the changes
      in the participants before and after intervention, identifying the correlation between using
      nutrition education as an intervention measure and improvement in the participants'
      nutritional status, quality of life, and self-care behavior.

      Malnutrition may be caused by decreased nutrient intake or absorption, inflammation, or other
      disease-related mechanisms. Malnutrition resulting from disease or injury may be caused by
      decreased food intake or varying degrees of acute or chronic inflammation, which alters body
      composit ion and prompts a decline in biological functions. The effects of decreased food
      intake induced by an inflammatory reaction are related to the malnourishment resulted from
      anorexia, changes in metabolism, increased resting energy expenditure, and increased muscle
      catabolism. Changes in body composition are characterized by a decrease in any muscle mass
      marker (excluding fat mass, muscle mass index, or body cell mass). Therefore, malnutrition is
      associated with clinical results of clinical malfunction.

      The primary objectives of heart failure treatment include preventing the need for
      hospitalization, increasing the survival rate, and improving health status. Patient symptoms,
      bodily functions, and health status are also referred to as health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL). The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is used to assess the quality of life of patients undergoing
      cardiac rehabilitation. This assessment uses 5 aspects, namely mobility, self-care, usual
      activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, to assess patient health status.

      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold standard method for evaluating the motor
      ability of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), yet is not extensively used. A more
      commonly used and simpler method is the 6-minute walk test, which measures the distance
      traveled by walking for 6 minutes. Changes in this value correlate to quality of life. This
      test is used to investigate the ability to perform daily activities and intensity of exercise
      in patients with mild to moderate CHF.

      Muscle strength is a key indicator for assessing patients with sarcopenia because decreased
      muscle strength is considered a crucial element in diagnosing muscle reduction. For
      circumstances in which muscle mass is difficult to assess, muscle strength, such as handgrip
      strength, can serve as a standard assessment of muscle functions.

      Exercise training is considered a valid method for stabilizing patients with heart failure.
      One study reported that the self-management intervention of a patient with heart failure
      notably decreased the occurrence of hospitalization and hospital readmission related to heart
      failure as well as all-cause mortality.

      The present study determines the effectiveness of nutrition intervention in routine medical
      treatment for improving the nutrition and quality of care among patients with heart failure.

      This study does not involve drugs, medical technology, or medical equipment.

    <description>Assess malnutrition indicator values. Nutrition status evaluated by the MNA correlates with energy and nutrient intakes as well as anthropometrics, hematologic, and biological nutrition parameters.
MNA has 4 sections: anthropometrics (BMI, weight loss, arm and calf circumference), general assessment (lifestyle, medication, mobility, presence of depression or dementia), dietary assessment (number of meals, food and fluid intake, autonomy of feeding), and subjective assessment (self-perception of health and nutrition).
The maximum score for the MNA-SF is 14, with scores ≥12 indicating satisfactory nutrition status and ≤11 indicating a risk of malnutrition.</description>

    <description>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Heath-related quality of life. IADL Scale was developed to assess more complex activities (termed &quot;instrumental activities of daily living&quot;) necessary for functioning in community settings (e.g., shopping, cooking, managing finances). The capacity to handle these complex functions normally is lost before basic &quot;activities of daily living&quot; (e.g., eating, bathing, toileting) which are measured by ADL scales. Therefore, assessing IADLS may identify incipient decline in older adults or other individuals who are otherwise capable and healthy.
It contains 8 items that are rated with a summary score from 0 (low functioning) to 8 (high functioning).
This scale can be administered through an interview or by a written questionnaire.</description>
