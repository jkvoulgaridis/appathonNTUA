  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study were to compare blood pressure responses of the same target heart
      rate on different exercise modes in patients with coronary artery diseases (CAD) and to
      compare the effects of blood pressure responses after exercise training.

      The investigators will recruit 30 subjects with CAD who are referred to phase II
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation exercise training. The subjects performed the treadmill or
      stationary bicycle exercise randomly.

      Considering cardiopulmonary rehabilitation intensity is often setting by heart rate
      clinically, and only few study focused on exercise responses patients with CAD, the purposes
      of this study were to compare blood pressure responses of the same target heart rate on
      different exercise modes in patients with CAD and to compare the effects of blood pressure
      responses after exercise training.

      This is a crossover trial study. The investigators will recruit 30 subjects with CAD who are
      referred to phase II cardiopulmonary rehabilitation exercise training. After at least 3 times
      of familiar with the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation training machine, the subjects performed
      the treadmill or stationary bicycle and exercise to personalized target heart rate for 10
      minutes, take a rest until the heart rate recover to the resting heart rate, and then
      repeated the exercise in another exercise mode. The test order will be random. After at least
      12 times of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation training, the test will be performed again.
