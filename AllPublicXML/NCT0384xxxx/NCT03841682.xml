  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimorbidity (i.e., the coexistence of 2 or more chronic conditions in an individual) is
      increasingly recognized as a pressing public health problem. Effective interventions
      targeting coexisting depression and obesity are critical given the high prevalence and
      worsened outcomes for patients with both conditions.

      ENGAGE-2 is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The objective is to investigate the
      outcomes and mechanisms of an integrated depression and obesity intervention that combines
      collaborative stepped depression treatment and evidence-based behavioral weight loss
      treatment. The Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight-2 (I-CARE2) intervention
      synergistically integrates 2 proven national programs: the Program to Encourage Active and
      Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression care and the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program
      for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction.

      In Phase 1 of the ENGAGE project, investigators developed a new protocol to quantify
      activation and connectivity of the Affective, Cognitive Control, and Default Mode brain
      circuits from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among 108 depressed obese
      patients. Investigators implement the same fMRI protocol in this second phase of the project
      to examine the mechanistic role of these brain circuits as potential neural targets in
      treatment engagement and response in the I-CARE2 intervention. A new sample of 105 depressed
      obese patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the I-CARE2 intervention (n=70) or
      usual care (n=35). Study assessments occur at 0 (baseline), 2 and 6 months. Investigators
      hypothesize that 1 or more of the neural targets under study will moderate (baseline state)
      and/or mediate (change at follow-up) the effect of the I-CARE2 intervention versus usual care
      on health behaviors (problem-solving ability, dietary intakes, physical activity) and
      clinical outcomes (weight loss, depression, anxiety).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study are adult patients with comorbid depression and obesity from
      outpatient clinics in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System (UI
      Health). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive intervention or usual care
      control.

      The I-CARE2 intervention synergistically integrates the PEARLS program for depression care
      the GLB program for weight loss. The PEARLS program provides problem-solving therapy (PST) as
      first-line for treating depression, with as-needed antidepressant medication intensification.
      Adapted from the original Diabetes Prevention Program, the GLB program promotes healthy
      lifestyle change for weight loss and increased physical activity. For combination treatment,
      the I-CARE2 intervention provides 9 individual counseling sessions (4 weekly, 2 biweekly, and
      then 3 monthly; 1 hour each) and participant self-study materials (GLB videos, handouts,
      weight and activity tracking) over 6 months.

      In response to the funding mechanism for this project, the specific aim of the ENGAGE-2 pilot
      study is to test the degree to which engaging the validated self-regulation target(s)
      produces desired behavior change important for weight management and mood.

    <description>Perceived stress is measured using Perceived stress scale (PSS). PSS measures the perception of stress (i.e., the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful).

    <description>Disability is measured using Sheehan Disability Scale. The Sheehan Disability Scale is a validated questionnaire that measures functional disability and is sensitive to treatment effects in clinical trials. Patients rate the extent to which their symptoms impair work/school, social, and family life on a visual analog scale from0 to 10 and answer the number of days when their symptoms cause them to miss work/school and be unproductive at work/school.</description>

    <measure>Generic health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Generic health related quality of life is measured using SF-8 Health Survey. The SF-8 is an 8-item version of the SF-36 that measures overall health-related quality of life. Physical and mental health composite scores are computed using the scores of 8 questions and range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the lowest level of health and 100 indicating the highest level of health. Correlation between the SF-8 and the SF-36 is 0.825 for physical health component and 0.881 for mental health component.</description>
