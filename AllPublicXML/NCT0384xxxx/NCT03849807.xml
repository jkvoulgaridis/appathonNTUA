  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date the effects of chiropractic care on behavior and neurological function in children
      diagnosed with ADHD has not been investigated thoroughly and is limited mostly to case
      studies and retrospective case reviews. Our research group recently completed a pilot study
      that investigated the effects of a single session of chiropractic care on oculomotor function
      and reading ability in children with ADHD. The findings of this study suggested that
      chiropractic care may have a role in improving oculomotor control and reading ability in this
      population group. This proposed study is the next step in this program of research and is a
      pilot clinical trial that will investigate whether 4 weeks of chiropractic care influences
      behavior, neurological function, or quality of life in children with ADHD.

    <textblock>
      ADHD is a disorder that may affect an individual's academic performance, social interactions,
      and interpersonal relationships amongst others. It is characterized by impulsiveness,
      hyperactivity, and inattention. It was previously thought that children overcome ADHD as they
      grow up, however, recent studies suggest that 30-60% of affected individuals continue to show
      significant symptoms of the disorder as adults and have associated difficulties such as lower
      educational and employment achievement. Conventional therapeutic approaches that are used
      with individuals with ADHD generally involve pharmaceutical interventions and behavioral
      therapies such as counseling and behavioral modification. However, little is known about the
      long term effectiveness of these treatment approaches which are also known to involve
      significant risks and complications.

      ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with significant alterations in
      brain development and function. These include changes in fronto-striatal pathways that can
      lead to difficulties with &quot;top-down&quot; control. It is also likely that connections in the
      parietal lobe and cerebellum are involved. These neurological changes are associated with a
      number of alterations to sensory filtering, sensorimotor gating, and sensorimotor control.
      This lends itself to a potential role for chiropractors in caring for children with ADHD
      because chiropractic care has been shown to alter a number of aspects of sensorimotor
      function.

      Chiropractic is based on the theory that spinal adjustments applied to areas of spinal
      dysfunction, known as vertebral subluxations, can improve the function of the nervous system.
      Our research group has been testing this theory for the last 15 years. We have hypothesized
      that the articular dysfunction component of the vertebral subluxation results in altered
      afferent input to the central nervous system (CNS) that modifies the way in which the CNS
      processes and integrates all subsequent sensory input. This processing (i.e. sensorimotor
      integration), is a CNS function that appears most vulnerable to altered inputs. Recent
      studies have shown that chiropractic care alters sensorimotor filtering, cortical and
      cerebellar motor processing, and multisensory processing, all of which may be important in
      the neurodevelopment of ADHD. Given the nature of the neurological changes associated with
      ADHD and the growing body of evidence that suggests that chiropractic care may influence
      neurological function, it is possible that chiropractors may play a role in enhancing the
      neurological function of individuals with ADHD.

    <masking_description>Successful blinding of patients or practitioners in a trial involving a physical intervention such as chiropractic care is virtually impossible.18 This is due to the manual nature of the interventions and the challenges associated with providing appropriate sham procedures.18, 19 However, participants in this trial are highly likely to be naïve to chiropractic care so it is possible they will remain unaware of whether they are in the chiropractic or control group. Some study personnel will be aware of the allocated arm as they will be responsible for logistical aspects of the trial. However, the research specialist collecting and analyzing data during the trial will be blinded to group allocation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Vanderbilt Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Diagnostic Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,4th week, 8th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes From Baseline, The Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADRS) is a psychological assessment tool for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms and their effects on behavior and academic performance in children. It have two components: symptom assessment and impairment in performance. To meet criteria for ADHD diagnoses, one must have 6 positive responses to either the core 9 inattentive symptoms or core 9 hyperactive symptoms, or both. the respondent to rate the frequency of a child's behaviors on a 0-3 scale as follows: 0: &quot;never&quot;; 1: &quot;occasionally&quot;; 2: &quot;often&quot;; 3: &quot;very often&quot;.
to rate the child's performance in school and his or her interactions with others on a 1-5 scale, with 1-2 meaning &quot;above average&quot;, 3 meaning &quot;average&quot;, and 4-5 meaning &quot;problematic&quot;. To meet criteria for ADHD, there must be at least one score for the performance set that is either a 4 or 5, as these scores indicate impairment in performance.</description>

Subscale scores on the SNAP-IV are calculated by summing the scores on the items in the subset and dividing by the number of items in the subset.</description>
