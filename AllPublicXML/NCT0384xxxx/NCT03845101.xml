  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Social Anxiety Disorder has high lifetime prevalence, early onset and long
      duration or chronicity. Exposure therapy is considered as one of the most effective element
      in cognitive behavioural therapy but in vivo exposure can be difficult to access and control,
      and is sometimes rejected by patients because they consider it too aversive. The use of
      virtual reality allows exposure to challenging situations in an immersive, but also
      protected, flexible and controlled environment.

      Aim The aim of the SO REAL-trial is to investigate the effect of cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT-In Vivo Exposure) versus cognitive behavioural therapy augmented with virtual
      reality exposure (CBT-Virtual Exposure) for patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.

      Methods The design is an investigator initiated randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel group
      and superiority designed clinical trial. From the psychotherapeutic outpatient clinics at
      Mental Health Centre Copenhagen, 302 patients, diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, will
      be included. All patients will be offered a manual-based 14 week cognitive behavioural
      treatment program, including 8 sessions with exposure therapy. Patients will be centrally
      randomised with concealed allocation sequence to cognitive behavioural therapy augmented with
      virtual reality exposure or cognitive behavioural therapy.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline, post treatment and at one-year follow-up by
      independent researchers blinded for treatment condition. The primary outcome will be social
      anxiety measured with Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Secondary outcome measures will include
      depression, social functioning, and patient satisfaction. Exploratory outcomes will be
      substance and alcohol use, working alliance, quality of life.

      Perspectives The SO REAL trial will be the hitherto largest trial investigating the use of
      virtual reality as augmentation of cognitive behavioural therapy and the results may guide
      future clinical treatment

    <description>The total score on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) measured pre treatment, post treatment and at one year follow up. LSAS assesses a range of situations typically feared by individuals with social anxiety. It has 24 items, divided into subscales of performance anxiety and social situations. It has acceptable psychometric properties. The score ranges from 0 to 144. Higher score is worse.</description>

    <description>The patients receiving the in VR exposure will be immersed using an Oculus Go head-mounted display enabling viewing of 360° live recorded VR environments. Five exposure scenarios have been developed based on general themes of the LSAS, patient feedback and clinical experience from a therapist panel. The five scenarios are as follows: 1) standing in line in a supermarket; 2) attending a party; 3) attending a formal meeting and giving a presentation; 4) small talking/debating in a canteen; and 5) entering an auditorium. Each scenario has four to six scenes of increasing difficulty as well as a neutral scene developed to familiarize patients with the VR setting and deescalating the anxiety response. The order of the scenarios viewed in these five sessions will be chosen by therapists based on the needs of the group. The last two VR exposure sessions are devoted to individual work with one or two previously explored virtual environments closest to the patient's difficulties.</description>

    <description>The therapeutic intervention is manual-based cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT) adapted from the approach of Turk, C., L., Heimberg, R.G. &amp; Magee, L. (2008). The treatment will consist of a total of 14 weekly two-hour group sessions performed in accordance with the manual to ensure a uniform and equal treatment for every patient throughout the study. Every session will be led by two trained clinical psychologists with practical experience in CBT and in vivo exposure.</description>
