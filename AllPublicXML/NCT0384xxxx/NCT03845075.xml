    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single- center study followed by an open-label
      extension period.

      • The study will have two parts:

        -  Part 1: 24 weeks double-blind treatment, followed by

        -  Part 2: 24 weeks open-label extension - all subjects still participating at the end of
           Part 1 will be given an option to continue for additional 24 weeks on the active drug if
           evaluated eligible by the Investigator
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 - the double-blind part: The active medication arm will be given co-administration of
      0.5 mg tesofensine/50 mg metoprolol daily for 24 weeks. The placebo arm will receive matching
      placebo tablets.

      Part 2 - the open-label extension part: All active participants at the end of the
      double-blind part will be given the active medication 0.5 mg tesofensine/50 mg metoprolol
      daily for 24 weeks.

Full name of the scale: composite satiety score (CSS), sometimes referred to as &quot;appetite suppression score&quot;. Range of values is 0-100; lower the value, hungrier a person is. CSS = (satiety + fullness + [100 − hunger] + [100 − prospective food consumption]) / 4. The four variables included are measured by visual analog scales (0-100 mm)</description>
