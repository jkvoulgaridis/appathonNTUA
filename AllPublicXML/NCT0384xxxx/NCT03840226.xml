  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium supplementation could improve cardiac performance. Patients with chronic heart
      failure (CHF) are magnesium deficient and we hypothesized that 1 year supplementation of oral
      magnesium comparted to placebo will improve exercise duration time and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium supplementation improves myocardial metabolism, inhibits calcium accumulation and
      myocardial cell death; it improves vascular tone, peripheral vascular resistance, afterload
      and cardiac output, reduces cardiac arrhythmias and improves lipid metabolism. Magnesium also
      reduces vulnerability to oxygen-derived free radicals, improves human endothelial function
      and inhibits platelet function. Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are magnesium
      deficient. The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the use of
      diuretics are associated with depletion of potassium and magnesium in CHF. Magnesium
      deficiency stimulates aldosterone production and secretion, while magnesium infusion
      decreases aldosterone production production by inhibiting cellular calcium influx.
      Adamopoulos et al recently found that CHF in patients [mainly New York Heart Association
      (NYHA) II-II] with low serum magnesium â‰¤ 2 mEq/L was associated with increased cardiovascular
      mortality (but had no association with cardiovascular hospitalization) compared to those with
      serum magnesium &gt; 2 mEq/L in a long-term follow-up of 36 months, suggesting that most of
      these deaths were likely sudden (arrhythmic) in nature.

      Furthermore, Stepura and Martynow demonstrated that oral magnesium orotate used as adjuvant
      therapy in severe NYHA IV CHF patients increased 1-year survival rate and improved clinical
      symptoms and patient's quality of life compared to placebo. The investigators hypothesized
      that 1-year supplementation of oral magnesium compared to placebo to CHF patients will
      improve exercise duration time and quality of life.

    <intervention_model_description>The aim of the study is to test The impact of magnum versus placebo, on six-minute and clinical outcomes of patients with CHF (level 2-4).
The Primary endpoints are:
Improvement in Six-Minute walk test.
Improvement in clinical outcomes: death, CHF hospitalization, revascularization etc.
To test the hypothesis that the six-minute results between the two study groups are different, with significance level of 5% and power of at least 80%, we use the t-test. Based on Monica et al (2001), the mean six-minute results among these patients is 218 with SD=28. for an expected difference of at least 10 meter, we need a sample size of 125 patients in each group.</intervention_model_description>
