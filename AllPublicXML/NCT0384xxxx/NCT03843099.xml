  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test two strategies for weight loss. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two 4-week weight loss programs: (1) a behavioral weight loss program
      that involves recording weekly weight, physical activity, and caloric intake plus daily
      exercises in which information about a healthy lifestyle is reviewed or (2) a behavioral
      weight loss program that involves recording weekly weight, physical activity, and caloric
      intake plus daily exercises in which descriptions of positive future events are reviewed.
      Throughout the study, participants will complete assessments that examine the effects of the
      interventions on delay discounting, physical activity, weight, and other important health and
      psychosocial outcomes.
