  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects being treated with durvalumab has on
      cancer.

      The researchers doing this study also want to evaluate if prednisone (a type of steroid),
      when given together with durvalumab, can reduce any side effects.

    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy
      drug and not a chemotherapy drug. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune
      system (PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction) to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune
      response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.
      Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 6000
      people. This drug seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than
      standard treatment alone or if people can be re-treated with durvalumab after previous side
      effects

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumour, that is
             advanced/ metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for which no curative therapy
             exists.

          -  Patients must live within Canada and have received durvalumab alone, or durvalumab in
             combination with tremelimumab, with or without chemotherapy/targeted therapy,
             initially on a CCTG study. Patients who have received durvalumab +/- tremelimumab but
             not on CCTG trials, or who have received other anti PD-1/PD-L1 agents +/- anti CTLA
             agents MAY be considered eligible by CCTG providing full details of prior therapy,
             toxicity and management are available. Consult CCTG for further details.

          -  Patients must have previously discontinued immunotherapy due to an irAE.

          -  Immune related adverse event must have resolved to ≤ grade 1 or baseline and patient
             must have completed corticosteroid therapy at least 28 days prior to registration in
             this current study.

          -  Complete response, partial response or prolonged stable disease (SD ≥ 24 weeks) to
             initial immunotherapy. Patients that received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant/consolidation
             immunotherapy are eligible providing there has been at least a 6 month treatment free
             interval prior to enrollment and patient has received at least one standard of care
             chemotherapy regimen in the palliative setting (consult CCTG if not indicated or

             discontinuation, patients must have provided informed consent for the release of the
             block. All patients must have provided informed consent for correlative studies. If
             patients from non-CCTG trials or commercial use are eventually enrolled, tumour
             material is also required if available, preferably from tissue collected after
             immunotherapy discontinuation.

                  of immunotherapy for irAE.

               -  Patients may have received other prior therapies such as tyrosine kinase
                  inhibitors or other targeted agents, following discontinuation of immunotherapy
                  for irAE.

               -  Patients may not have received subsequent immune check point inhibitors
                  (anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4) following discontinuation of immunotherapy for

          -  Patients must have recovered from all reversible toxicity related to prior
             chemotherapy or systemic therapy (unless grade 1, irreversible, or considered by

          -  Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have
             elapsed between any major surgery and date of enrollment, and that wound healing has
             occurred.

          -  Any immune-related adverse event that required biologic agents such as infliximab, or
             mycophenolate motefil to manage.

          -  Documented progressive disease (PD) while on initial immunotherapy. Exception:
             patients who had iUPD but continued on immunotherapy, and did not have documented iCPD
