  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2 (erbB-2/neu) is a member of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family. ERBB2 gene which
      encodes human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) is a major proliferative driver activating
      downstream signaling through PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK. HER2 overexpression or gene amplification
      is associated with sensitivity to trastuzumab and lapatinib in breast cancer. Among actual
      lung cancer biomarker, HER2 remains apart. HER2 involvement is known for a long time but
      clinical research has been stopped for many years since the first clinical trials in
      unselected patients were negative. Recently trastuzumab + pertuzumab + docetaxel has been
      tested for first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA trial).
      Analysis of the primary end point showed that patients who received pertuzumab, trastuzumab,
      and docetaxel (pertuzumab group) had a significantly longer median progression-free survival,
      as assessed by independent reviewers an did those who received placebo, trastuzumab, and
      docetaxel (control group) (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.62). There is thus a
      strong rational for treating HER2 mutated lung cancer patient with these drugs.

         12. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months

         13. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

             Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
             including any female who has undergone:

               -  Hysterectomy.

               -  Bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy).

               -  Bilateral tubal ligation.

               -  Or who is post-menopausal:

               -  Patients not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total
                  cessation of menses for ≥1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in
                  questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an
                  estradiol value &lt;40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L).

               -  Patients must discontinue HRT prior to study enrolment due to the potential for
                  inhibition of cytochrome enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins. For
                  most forms of HRT, at least 2 4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT
                  and determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the
                  type and dosage of HRT. If a female subject is determined not to be
                  post-menopausal, they must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately
                  below.

             Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to
             the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception during the study
             and for at least 7 months after the last dose of investigational product.
             Contraceptive methods acceptable to IFCT, when used consistently and in accordance
             with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow:

               -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

               -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is
                  the sole sexual partner for that female.

               -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to
                  investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 7 months
                  after the last dose of investigational product.

               -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository or
                  film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

             Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions.

         14. Female patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose
             of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for
             15 days following the last dose of study drug.

         15. A male with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and
             participate in the study if he uses a barrier method of contraception or abstinence
             during the study and for at least 7 months after the last dose of investigational
             product.

         16. Patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a
             beneficiary of social security insurance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of cancer except cancer dating from over two years ago and considered to be
             cured, appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin

             discontinuation of TKIs).

          3. Patients with concomitant EGFR, ALK, ROS1, MET, BRAF and KRAS mutation. Other

             weeks are eligible.

          8. Carcinomatous meningitis

             uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) or other significant
             clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it undesirable for the patient to
             participate in the study.

         12. Evidence of active pneumonitis during screening

         13. Current unstable ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment, history of symptomatic
             congestive heart failure (CHF; New York Heart Association [NYHA] Classes II−IV) and
