  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RESCUE-RACER is jointly sponsored by the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

      The RESCUE-RACER programme evaluates motorsports competitors at baseline (CArBON) and
      post-injury (CARS). The CArBON study (Competitor Assessment at Baseline; Ocular,
      Neuroscientific) collects a battery of neuroscientific data in a baseline assessment. The
      CARS study (Concussion Assessment and Return to motorSport), repeats the CArBON battery
      throughout the recovery period in competitors who sustain a potentially concussive event
      during motorsport.

      The primary outcome of the RESCUE-RACER programme is to establish the natural history of
      concussive symptoms and signs in motorsport competitors using a comprehensive neuroscientific
      battery. The standard clinical assessment of concussive symptoms will be correlated with
      objective clinical scoring, in addition to neurocognitive and neuropsychological assessments.
      Advanced brain imaging with MRI will be used to further characterize head injuries in
      motorsport. Finally, salivary biomarkers will be collected to monitor the measurable
      biological effects of a potentially concussive event immediately following injury and through
      recuperation in the recovery period.

      The secondary outcome is investigation of a novel diagnostic tool for concussion, in the form
      of a 3D head-mounted display and eye tracking system capable of assessing ocular, vestibular
      and reaction time (OVRT) functions (the I-PAS device, now re-named Dx 100).

      The results of RESCUE-RACER will form an evidence base for medical decision-making track side
      after a potentially-concussive incident and will advise on clinic management of motorsports
      concussion, including the important 'return-to-race' decision.

    <description>Change in neuropsychological performance from baseline to follow-up, as measured by CANTAB Connect Research, the world's most validated, precise and reliable research software (please see http://www.cambridgecognition.com/products/cognitive-research/).
This previously-validated assessment software consists of the following sections:

    <time_frame>Baseline (CArBON assessments) to 1-3 weeks after concussion (CARS assessments)</time_frame>
    <description>The applicability of OVRT assessment as a diagnostic tool for motorsport concussion will be investigated by correlating changes in OVRT performance at baseline to OVRT performance following a clinical diagnosis of concussion or participation in motorsport activity. The assessment will be conducted with a portable head-mounted 3D display (please see http://neurolign.com/our-technology/, previously https://www.neuro-kinetics.com/products/).
Alteration in OVRT performance will be measured using:
Ocular tests - saccades (vertical, horizontal, predictive, self-paced, memory-guided and anti-), smooth pursuit, optokinetic reflex, vergence, light reflex
Vestibular tests - subjective visual vertical
Reaction time assessments - auditory, visual
The I-PAS/Dx100 training manual is available on request (publication of further assessment details is subject to patents and/or copyright).</description>

    <description>The RESCUE-RACER programme is formed of two studies; baseline (CArBON) and one post-injury (CARS). At baseline the larger CArBON study involves completion of a thorough single baseline neuroscientific assessment of healthy motorsport competitors including clinical, neuropsychological, neurocognitive, biomarker and vestibulo-ocular assessments, in addition to MRI of the brain.</description>

    <arm_group_label>CARS (exposure to a potentially concussive event)</arm_group_label>
    <description>The RESCUE-RACER programme has a single post-injury study; after involvement in a potentially concussive event sustained during motorsport, CARS serially repeats the CArBON assessment battery in the immediate post-concussion recovery period. CARS participants will under-go post-exposure neuroscientific assessments immediately after injury and then at one, two and three weeks post-injury. If symptoms persist beyond this time, a further two assessments at monthly intervals will be offered.</description>

    <description>Originally developed at the University of Cambridge, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) platform includes highly sensitive, precise and objective measures of cognitive function, correlated to neural networks. These tests have demonstrated sensitivity to detecting changes in neuropsychological performance and include tests of working memory, learning and executive function; visual, verbal and episodic memory; attention, information processing and reaction time; social and emotion recognition, decision making and response control.
The CANTAB touchscreen battery (www.camcog.com) will be utilised to perform neuropsychological assessments within RESCUE-RACER, whose study-specific protocol may include assessments of: Spatial Working Memory (working memory and strategy), Reaction Time (processing and psychomotor speed), Paired Associated Learning and the Multi-Tasking Test.</description>
