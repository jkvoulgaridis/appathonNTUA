    <textblock>
      Study design: Two consecutive prospective case series. Study population: Part 1 will enroll
      10 healthy volunteers (50 years or older). Part 2 will enroll 10 elderly patients (50 years
      or older) with a dorsally displaced distal radius fracture (AO type 23-A-C) that is
      acceptably reduced. In both parts, participants should have no restrictions in activities of
      daily living pre-fracture and no evident anatomical difference between both wrists.

      Intervention:

      Part 1: Participants will wear the brace continuously for one week. Part 2: Participants will
      wear the brace as treatment of the fracture for five weeks (instead of a plaster cast).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: In parts 1 and 2, the primary outcome measure will be a
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score for wearing comfort. Secondary outcome measures are the
      occurrence of fracture redislocation (part 2 only), pain (VAS), inconvenience during
      NL61002.078.17 / DRFB-Tolerability Distal Radius Fracture Brace Tolerability Version number:
      1.1, d.d. April 24, 2017 8 of 34 activities of daily living (Katz Index), and adverse
      reactions like pain, skin pressure, skin irritation/redness, sensibility issues, or
      device-related problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Each year, approximately 34,500 adults in The Netherlands sustain a fracture of
      the distal radius (wrist fracture). Incidence peaks in the elderly. The currently preferred
      treatment is closed reduction and nonoperative treatment by immobilization in a plaster cast
      for 4-6 weeks. Surgery is only performed if closed reduction fails or redislocation occurs.
      Plaster immobilization is inconvenient and interferes with daily activities. More
      importantly, standard nonoperative treatment often fails; in 40-60% of the fractures,
      redislocation requires surgery. Surgical treatment is about 9 times more expensive than
      nonoperative treatment and not without risks. This project aims to develop an innovative
      nonoperative treatment option. The central idea is to produce a 3D-printed brace for the
      fractured wrist using a mirrored CT-scan of the contralateral, unfractured wrist as a model.
      This innovative approach has the advantage that it does not depend on surgery and provides a
      better and potentially more durable positioning than the currently applied plaster cast. We
      expect that redislocation will occur less frequently, so surgery may be avoided. In contrast
      to a traditional plaster cast, the newly developed brace is water resistant/repellant,
      lighter, and enables movement of the hand. It enables daily activities and improves
      independency in the elderly with a wrist fracture. The treatment has been successfully
      evaluated in an ex vivo model. The clinical implementation will follow a step-wise approach.

      Objective: Part 1 aims to determine the tolerability of the 3D-printed brace when worn by
      healthy volunteers (50 years of order), performing their normal daily activities. In part 2,
      the objective is to determine tolerability of the 3D-printed brace in patients (50 years or
      older) with an extra-articular distal radius fracture with dorsal displacement, performing
      their normal daily activities.

    <description>The distal radius fracture brace is constructed from biocompatible materials (like polylactic acid; PLA) and the skin is protected by commercially available and approved waterproof padding (like Aquacast®). The major brace components are connected and reinforced with carbon rods and plastic bolt-nut connections. PLA is extensively used, for example in surgical implants, but also as biological alternative for plastics. Aquacast® is approved and used as waterproof padding in swim plaster. The biomechanical function of the distal radius brace has been tested successfully in an ex vivo setting (results to be published). The DRFB includes the distal forearm, wrist an base of the hand. The thumb and fingers are free and the DRFB provides more movement than classical casting.</description>
