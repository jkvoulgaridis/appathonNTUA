  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The histologic hallmarks of lung inflammation and in the extreme, acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS), include intense accumulation of inflammatory cells in the airspaces and
      interstitium, injury to alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells, loss of
      epithelial-capillary integrity and accumulation of edema fluid in the interstitium and
      airspaces. Accordingly, for alveolar repair to occur inflammation must be halted, debris and
      inflammatory cells removed, injured tissue cells replaced, and capillary barrier function
      re-established. Macrophages are key players in all of these. Here the investigators
      hypothesize that resident alveolar macrophages and recruited macrophages serve completely
      different functions, acting independently (i.e. division of labor) yet cooperatively
      (synergism).

    <description>Mini-BAL is a minimally invasive technique frequently used in the investigator's local intensive care units (ICUs) to obtain alveolar fluid samples from mechanically ventilated patients. This is typically done for microbial analysis.</description>

        The population to be studied are patients identified to have ARDS, admitted to the
        intensive care unit, and placed on a mechanical ventilator. The MICU at National Jewish-St
        Joseph Hospital will be the primary site for enrollment. Control subjects will be
        individuals on mechanical ventilation for non-pulmonary reasons (i.e. following surgery,
        sepsis without lung involvement). A total of 56 subjects will be enrolled. As described
        below (in Research Methods and Enrollment) a 2:1 ratio of ARDS to control subjects will be
        targeted.

             necrosis factor alpha antagonists, cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or
             mycophenolate. Treatment with glucocorticoids for septic shock is acceptable).

          7. Presence of an advanced directive to withhold life-sustaining treatment

          8. Morbid state or expected to survive less than 14 days because of an advanced co-morbid
             medical condition;
