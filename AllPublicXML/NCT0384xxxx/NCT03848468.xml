      A comparison study was performed between Ligasure and Milligan morgan hemorrhoidectomy to
      find out the outcome between these two techniques in 3rd and 4th degree hemorrhoids.This
      advance vessel sealing device is used to seal the pedicle of the vessel and does not burn the
      surrounding tissues , so the outcome was monitored in terms of operative time, post operative
      pain pain, duration of wound healing in 3 weeks and return to normal activities

      INTRODUCTION:

      Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy is conventional procedure in 3rd and 4th degree hemorrhoids
      but recent advances in ligasure hemorrhoidectomy have shown to produce favorable results.
      Comparison of these two is studied in terms of pain outcome as patient perceives, operative
      time, wound healing and return to normal activities.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To compare the outcome of ligasure hemorrhoidectomy with conventional hemorrhoidectomy in III
      and IV degree hemorrhoids.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Randomized controlled trial

      STUDY SETTING:

      The study was conducted in surgical unit 1, Services hospital, Lahore.

      DURATION OF STUDY:

      Study was completed in six months after the approval of synopsis i.e. from 1st April 2014 to
      30th September 2014.

      DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE:

      After approval from hospital ethical committee, 100 patients fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria has been recruited from outdoor and emergency department. A detailed history had
      been taken including demographic data (age, address) and all patients had been clinically
      examined .Patients was divided in two groups randomly using random number tables. Group A:
      Conventional hemorrhoidectomy. Group B: Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy. Patients had been
      requested to sign an informed consent. They had been assured regarding confidentiality and
      expertise used for the procedure. All procedures have been performed by a single surgical
      operating team to control bias. Preoperatively operative time was noted. Post operatively
      pain had been assessed after 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours, wound has been assessed in 2nd
      and 3rd postoperative week to assess epithelization and return to normal activities in days.
      All data had been collected and recorded on the Proforma
