  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the tolerability of injections of each of 3
      formulations of ixekizumab using a prefilled syringe. Information about any side effects
      (including injection site reactions [ISRs]) will be collected.

    <description>The injection pain VAS is a participant administered single item scale designed to measure pain using a 0-100 millimetre (mm) horizontal VAS. Overall severity of participant's pain is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal 100 mm scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst imaginable pain)</description>
