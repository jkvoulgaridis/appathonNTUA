      European Economic Area (EEA) Marketing Authorisation) to assess the occurrence and dynamics

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple center, single-arm, open-label, 12-month follow-up phase IV pragmatic
      clinical trial. Men with unilateral prostate cancer meeting eligibility criteria for the drug
      (as per the EEA Marketing Authorisation) will receive TOOKAD® VTP under general anesthesia.
      The primary objective is to assess the occurrence and dynamics of the time with toxicities
      (urinary incontinence Grade 2 and over and/or erectile dysfunction Grade 2 and over) in
      patients 12 months following TOOKAD® VTP. Prior to the TOOKAD® VTP, patients will undergo
      routine ultrasound examination in the operating room for morphometric description of the
      prostate and to facilitate accurate treatment guidance for the treatment with TOOKAD® VTP.
      Treatment will then be applied to the prostate gland as a hemi-ablation procedure designed to
      destroy the lobe of the prostate gland that contains the cancer. Afterwards, patients will be
      followed for 12 months with clinical evaluation, data collection on erectile and urinary
      functions at 1, 2, 3 6 and 12 months, using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite
      (EPIC), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and International Prostate Score
      Symptom (IPSS) questionnaires on Quality Of Life (QOL) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)
      testing at 3, 6 and 12 months.

      The clinical follow-up of patients will follow local standard of care processes, based on
      recommendations in the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

      This study is a phase IV pragmatic trial using optimal dose of TOOKAD® and optimal
      light-energy level conditions that were determined during development and approved by the
      European Commission.
