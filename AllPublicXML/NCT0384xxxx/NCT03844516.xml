  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantation with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in patients with end-stage heart
      failure (HF) leads to improvements in survival and quality of life, however, work capacity
      remains disappointingly low, at half of the expected value. Complex central and peripheral
      hallmarks of heart failure attribute to the continued work intolerance, to which heart rate
      may be a contributing factor.

      The purpose of this study is to clarify the impact of heart rate (by means of pacing) on work
      capacity (measured as peak oxygen uptake) in LVAD recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While implantation with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) in patients with end-stage
      heart failure (HF) improve survival and quality of life, work capacity remains at a
      disappointing 50% of the expected value.

      Due to the worldwide (increasing) shortage of donor hearts, LVADs are increasingly used as
      destination therapy which makes it crucial for physicians to persistently identify
      opportunities to improve management, lower the adverse events and maximize the benefits of
      this treatment option.

      In recent years it was found that upregulation of device pump speed improves the maximal work
      capacity of LVAD recipients with no side effects. More recently it was found that the
      patients' heart rate reserve also was of importance in this regard, however, the latter was
      shown in a retrospective study and needs to be confirmed in a prospective randomized
      double-blinded intervention study. As a large portion of LVAD recipients are already
      implanted with a pacing device (and suffer from chronotropic incompetence) such a study is
      possible to conduct by controlling their heart rate during exercise by pacing (ie randomized
      crossover design).

    <masking_description>Patients and staff performing the peak oxygen uptake test (pVO2) will be blinded to device regulation. Blinding will be ensured by recruiting a secondary doctor or other staff to regulate pace-settings in relation to the paced pVO2 test while performing sham regulations (or just read pace-settings) in relation to the non-paced pVO2 test.
Thus, both patients and investigator are blinded.</masking_description>
