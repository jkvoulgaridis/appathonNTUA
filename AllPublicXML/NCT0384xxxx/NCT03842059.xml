      We developed an artificial intelligent computer system with a deep neural network to analyze
      real-time video signals from the endoscopy station. This randomised controlled trial compared
      adenoma detection rate between computer-assisted colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy.

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a primary screening and follow-up tool to detect colorectal cancer, a third
      leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from
      preexisting adenomas, and the adenoma-carcinoma sequence offers an opportunity for the
      screening and prevention of CRCs. The removal of adenomatous polyps can lower the incidence
      of CRCs and result in reduced motality from CRCs. The adenoma detection rate, the proportion
      of screening colonoscopies performed by a endoscopist that detect at least one colorectal
      adenoma or adenocarcinoma, has been recommended as a quality indicator. The adenoma detection
      rate was inversely associated with the risks of interval colorectal cancer, advanced-stage
      interval cancer, and fatal interval cancer. However, adenoma detection rates vary widely
      among endoscopists in both academic and community settings. Polyp miss rates as high as 20%
      have been reported for high definition resolution colonoscopy. An improvement in adenoma
      detection rate at screening colonoscopy, translates into reduced risks of interval colorectal
      cancer and colorectal cancer death. Computer-aided detection of polyps might assist
      endoscopists to reduce the miss rate and enhance screening performance during colonoscopy.
      Computer-aided diagnosis and computer-aided detection are computerized systems that learn and
      inference in medical fields. Computer-aided diagnosis has been developed in colon polyp
      classification.

      Computer-assisted image analysis has the potential to further aid adenoma detection but has
      remained underdeveloped. A notable benefit of such a system is that no alteration of the
      colonoscope or procedure is necessary. Machine learning with a deep neural network has been
      successfully applied to many areas of science and technology, such as object recognition and
      detection of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing. We developed
      an artificial intelligent computer system (PX-1) with a deep neural network to analyze
      real-time video signals from the endoscopy station. This randomised controlled trial compared
      ADR between computer-assisted colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients aged â‰¥20 years, scheduled for colonoscopy for one of the following indications for
        colonoscopy, were invited to participate in this study: polyp surveillance, changed bowel
        habits and/or bloody stools, bowel complaints, a positive family history for CRC, a
        positive FOBT, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, post-polypectomy surveillance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        We excluded patients from this study if: (1) they had known colonic neoplasia or
        inflammatory or other significant colonic disease, such as patients specifically presenting
        for polypectomy; (2) there was open bleeding or they were receiving an emergency
        colonoscopy; (3) they had previously previous colonic resection; (4) they were in poor
        general condition (more than American Society of Anesthesiologists grade III); (5) they
        were receiving anticoagulant medication; (6) they had severe comorbidity, including
        end-stage cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver or renal disease); (7) they were not able or
        refused to give informed written consent; (8) following enrolment and randomisation to one
        of the arms, those subjects who had inadequate colon preparation or in whom the caecum
        could not be reached were also excluded.
