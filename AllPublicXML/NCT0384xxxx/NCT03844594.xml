  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial.The primary purpose of this
      trial is to evaluate the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours after the use of Eptifibatide injection. Patients with
      acute ischemic stroke treated with intravascular thrombolytic therapy, mechanical
      thrombolysis, angioplasty and so on were treated with Eptifibatide injection on the first
      day, followed by the second day, the third day, the discharge day and the 90 days.

      The study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial.A total of 220 patients
      (Age≥18years) with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravascular thrombolysis, mechanical
      thrombolysis, angioplasty, etc., were treated with Eptifibatide, providing informed consent
      and medication.The recommended dose of this study was: first, 135ug / kg was injected
      intravenously or intraductal (within 5 minutes), followed by continuous intravenous infusion
      of 0.75 ug / kg / min for 24 h. In special cases, it is up to the operator to decide whether
      to reinject or increase the dosage according to experience. The maximum dose for the first
      time was 180ug / kg, if necessary, with a 10-minute interval of intravenously or intraductal
      injection, and a maximum dose of 180ug / kg, intravenously / intraductal injection of no more
      than 360ug / kg. Continuous intravenous infusion does not exceed 2ug/kg/ Min. Then the second
      day, the third day, the discharge and 90 days visit. Follow-up information included vital
      signs and physical examination, observation of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, NIHSS
      scale, and recording of current drug use by AE,SAE.The trial is anticipated to last from
      January 2019 to December 2019 with 220 subjects recruited form 15 centers in China. All the
      related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and
      Chinese GCP standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety
      during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics
      Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University.
