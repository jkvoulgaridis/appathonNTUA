  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid treatment is usually performed with either balanced crystalloid fluids or iso-oncotic
      colloids, (synthetic colloids, plasma and 5% albumin). Doubts have been raised about
      synthetic colloids (impairment of renal function and coagulation), and the natural albumin
      has been used more extensively. Albumin is the main protein responsible for plasma oncotic
      pressure and its volume expansion effect. An alternative therapeutic option is the
      mobilization of tissue fluid by infusing a small amount of hyper-oncotic fluid like the 20%
      albumin solution (endogenous fluid recruitment).

      The primary objective of this study is to test the effect of 20% albumin on plasma volume
      expansion and fluid recruitment in the frame of blood loss replacement during cystectomy
      using established fluid kinetic models.

      The investigators expect that fluid replacement with crystalloid will be better sustained
      intravascularly with the administration of 20% albumin and be able to recruit fluid into the
      vascular compartment.

    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer occurs mainly in old comorbid patients. The standard treatment of localized
      muscle invasive bladder cancer is pelvic lymph node dissection and open radical cystectomy
      with urinary diversion. Optimal perioperative fluid management for this surgery is
      challenging and still controversial in terms of how much to perfuse, choice of fluids
      (crystalloids and colloids) to restore hydrated state and volemia.

      Fluid treatment is usually performed with either balanced crystalloids fluids or iso-oncotic
      synthetic colloids, plasma or 5% albumin. Because crystalloids quickly equilibrate between
      the intravascular and interstitial volumes, they are mainly used to treat dehydration and
      temporary volume deficits. Iso‐oncotic colloids remain intravascular for a prolonged period.
      Doubts have been raised about synthetic colloids, and the natural albumin has been used more
      extensively. Albumin is the main protein responsible for plasma oncotic pressure and its
      volume expansion effect. An alternative therapeutic option is the mobilization of tissue
      fluid by infusing a small amount of hyper-oncotic fluid like the 20% albumin solution
      (endogenous fluid recruitment).

      There are still unknown aspects of the physiological effects of hyper-oncotic albumin. One of
      them is the, in this study investigated, effect of 20% albumin on plasma volume expansion,
      fluid recruitment, and crystalloid kinetic in the frame of blood loss replacement during
      cystectomy.

      It is expected that fluid replacement with crystalloid will be better sustained
      intravascularly with the administration of 20% albumin.
