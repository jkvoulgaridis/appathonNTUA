    <textblock>
      This is a research study of adults with hemophilia that have limitations in elbow joint
      motion that is the result of bleeding into the joint.

      People with hemophilia who have bleeding into their elbow joint may have limitations in elbow
      joint movement and pain in the joint. This research is being done to determine the effect a
      strength training program has on the amount of movement people with hemophilia and elbow
      joint disease have.
