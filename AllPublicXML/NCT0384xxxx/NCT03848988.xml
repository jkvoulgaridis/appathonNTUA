  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keele STarT Back SCreening Tool (KSB) is a practical and validated bio-psychosocial
      questionnaire that stratifies lower back pain patients into 3 risk groups (low, medium,
      high), with suggested treatment guidelines for each grouping. The 9-question KSB has been
      used in chiropractic practice to help guide medical decision making, but its use in
      chiropractic teaching environments has been limited.

      All new LBP patients between the ages of 18-65 years presenting to a chiropractic teaching
      clinic in Dallas, TX between March 05, 2018 and April 06, 2018 were asked to complete the KSB
      questionnaire. No introduction of the KSB was given to students or faculty. For all patients
      that completed the KSB, a chart review of the first 4 weeks of care was completed to retrieve
      patient follow-up information and treatment provided, including: self-reported LBP on a
      10-point numerical rating scale (NRS), region of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), and
      active rehabilitation provided.
