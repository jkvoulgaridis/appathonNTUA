  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 1 healthy volunteer study to assess the excretion and metabolism as well as the
      absolute bioavailability of oral ONO-5788. The study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1
      to assess the absolute bioavailability using ONO-5788 and radiolabelled ONO-5788 as
      intravenous and oral forms; part 2 will assess the mass balance of ONO-5788 using orally
      administered radiolabelled ONO-5788

          7. The subject has a supine blood pressure less than 90/40 millimeter of mercury (mmHg)
             or greater than 140/90 mmHg or a supine pulse rate lower than 50 beats per minute

             drugs.

         21. The subject was exposed to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental xrays and
             plain xrays of thorax and bony skeleton [excluding spinal column]), during work, or
             during participation in a clinical study in the period of 1 year prior to screening.

         22. The subject participated in another study with a radiation burden of &gt;0.1 mSv and ≤1
             mSv in the period of 1 year prior to screening; a radiation burden of &gt;1.1 mSv and ≤2
             mSv in the period of 2 years prior to screening; a radiation burden of &gt;2.1 mSv and ≤3
             mSv in the period of 3 years prior to screening, etc. (add 1 year per 1 mSv).
