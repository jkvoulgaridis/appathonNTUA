             herpes), abscess, an unhealed wound, or a cancerous or precancerous lesion on the face
             or thigh that could interfere with measurements.

          -  Subject having changed, started or stopped any hormonal treatment or any treatment
             likely to have an impact on skin condition (over-the-counter or prescription, oral or
             topical, or anti-wrinkle products on the face), within 30 days prior to enrollment or
             is planning to begin using such products during the study.
