      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Jetstream
      Atherectomy System for the treatment of Japanese patients with symptomatic occlusive
      atherosclerotic lesions in native superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/ or proximal popliteal
      arteries (PPA).

      A prospective, multicenter, single-arm trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the
      Jetstream Atherectomy System in the treatment of symptomatic occlusive atherosclerotic
      lesions ≤150 mm in length located in the femoropopliteal arteries in subjects with symptoms
      classified as Rutherford categories 2-4.
