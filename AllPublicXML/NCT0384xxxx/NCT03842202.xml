  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how the emptying of the participant's stomach after a meal is
      affected by semaglutide (a new medicine) compared to a &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. In addition, the
      study will also look at the effect of semaglutide on the participant's appetite and energy
      intake. Participants will either get semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine - which treatment any
      participant gets is decided by chance. Participants will take 1 injection per week. The study
      medicine is injected with a thin needle in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study will
      last for about 27 weeks (from first treatment to last check-up). Participants will have 8
      visits at the clinic with the study doctor.
