  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition mainly affecting
      older people, causing pain, physical disability, and reduced quality of life. Exercise and
      patient education are non-pharmacological interventions for knee OA unanimously recommended
      by leading international organisations and authorities based on extensive research that
      documents that exercise and education are superior to no-attention control groups.

      In Denmark, an initiative to implement these recommendations was initiated in 2013. The
      initiative is called Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D) and aims at
      facilitating high quality care of patients with OA in the Danish population. The core
      components of the GLA:D program are 8 weeks of education (2 sessions) and supervised
      neuromuscular exercise delivered by GLA:D certified physiotherapists. The GLA:D concept has
      been exported to Canada, China and Australia.

      While several randomised controlled trials have investigated exercise and education for knee
      OA none have used a placebo comparison group. The effect size of exercise plus education
      therapy is in line with the current theories that the contact with a caring clinician that
      believes in efficacy of the treatments he/she provides can result in beneficial health
      effects. In exercise and education programs (such as the GLA:D program) frequent and lengthy
      contacts with a physiotherapist are typically necessary. Hence, a significant proportion of
      the beneficial effects can be expected to be attributable to placebo or placebo.like effects.

      In trials of intra-articular treatment of knee OA (e.g. in trials of corticosteroids,
      viscosupplementation, or platelet-rich-plasma) saline injections are a commonly used as
      placebo comparator. While saline is recognised as a pharmacologically inert agent, a recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that although intra-articular saline injection
      is often used as a &quot;placebo&quot; treatment in clinical trials for knee OA it can provide
      substantial pain relief. The effect size of saline injections is in line with the current
      theories that the &quot;invasiveness&quot; of a procedure is an important determinant for the magnitude
      of placebo effects.

      This trial aims to compare a widely used 8-week education plus exercise program (the GLA:D
      program) with 4 intra-articular saline injections as treatments of knee OA symptoms. Outcomes
      are taken at baseline, after 8-weeks of treatment (week 9) and after additionally 4 weeks of
      follow-up (week 12).

    <description>The 4x10 meter fast walk test (40mFWT) is a physical performance test that quantifies short distance walking performance. The 40mFWT is a measure of walking speed over short distances and changing direction during walking. It is recommended as a performance-based test to assess physical function in people diagnosed with hip or knee OA.
The participant is asked to walk as quickly but as safely as possible to a mark 10 m away, return, and repeat for a total distance of 40 m. Regular walking aid is allowed and recorded. Time of one trial, with turn time excluded, is recorded and expressed as speed m/s by dividing distance (40 m) by time (s).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 9 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 seconds chair stand test (30sCST) is a physical performance test that quantifies how many sit-to-stand movements an individual is able to perform within 30 seconds. The 30sCST is a measure of balance during functional activities and lower extremity function and strength. It is recommended as a performance-based test to assess physical function in people diagnosed with hip or knee OA.
From the sitting position in the middle of seat with feet shoulder width apart, flat on the floor, arms crossed at chest, the participant is asked to stand completely up, then sit completely back down, repeatedly for 30 seconds. The total number of complete chair stands (up and down represents one stand) is counted. There is given only one trial. If a full stand is completed at 30 seconds, then this is counted in the total. The same chair is used at all assessments.</description>

It consists of 2 educational sessions over 2 weeks (1/week in week 1 and 2) and 12 exercise sessions over 6 weeks (2/week in weeks 2 thru 8) The 2 educational sessions provide knowledge of OA, treatment and self-management, with a special focus on exercise and its benefits. The exercise part lasts for 6 weeks with 2 exercise sessions per week of approximately 1 hour (12 sessions total). The exercise sessions are group based at a facility supervised by a GLA:D certified physiotherapist. The goal is the obtain muscle control and stability in situations resembling daily life and/or more strenuous activities.</description>

The injections will be carried out with a 21 gauge (38 mm) needle and a Luer-lock syringe under ultrasound guidance to ensure that the needle is inserted into the study knee joint cavity and document correct deposition of the bolus in the joint cavity.
