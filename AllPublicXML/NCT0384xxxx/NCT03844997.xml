      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Palbociclib in
      combination with investigational (experimental) drug, CPX-351 and evaluate the efficacy of
      Palbociclib in combination with chemotherapy as measured by overall response rate (ORR), i.e.
      complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) by 2003 IWG
      criteria.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Palbociclibin
      combination with CPX-351, and to evaluate the efficacy of Palbociclibin combination with
      chemotherapy as measured by overall response rate (ORR), i.e. complete response (CR) and CR
      with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) by IWG criteria.

      CPX-351 is an investigational drug that works as formulation of a fixed combination of the
      antineoplastic (acting to prevent, inhibit or halt the development of a neoplasm (a tumor))
      drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin.

      Palbociclibis an investigational drug that works to induce early G1 arrest by inhibiting
      CDK4/6, which are two types of CDKs that are overexpressed in AML cell cancer lines.

      CPX-351 and Palbociclib is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      This is a single arm, open label study of the combination of Palbociclib with CPX-351 in
      adults with AML. The trial consists of two components: phase I to evaluate the safety with
      dose escalation of Palbociclib in combination with CPX-351 and phase II to evaluate the
      overall response rate of the combination in the targeted participant population.

Either of these responses will constitute ORR.</description>

    <description>Palbociclib will be administered orally on day -1 and -2 at 125 mg PO during the phase IIaportion (dose level 0).Day 0 will be rest and then CPX-351 at 100 u/m2 will be started on days 1, 3, and 5 along with Palbociclib day 2, 4, and 6 followed by rest/monitoring period (day 7-28).
If Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity is observed in 1 or less of 6 patients treated, the study will move to Phase IIb. If Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity is observed in 2 or more of 6 patients treated, 6 additional patients will be treated on the Phase IIa portion at a lower dose level (100 mg po) until a Phase IIb safe dose schedule is defined at which 1 or less out of 6 patients on the Phase IIa experience Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity. After the Phase IIa portion ensures safety, the study will proceed with phase IIb. The phase IIb component is a Simon 2-stage design trial whose objective is to assess the clinical efficacy of the combination of Palbociclib and CPX-351.</description>
