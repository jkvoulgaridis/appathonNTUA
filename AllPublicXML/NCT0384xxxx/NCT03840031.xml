  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To combat iron deficiency in Low and Middle-Income Countries, sustainable food-based
      solutions have to be implemented to serve populations, not only individuals. One solution is
      the introduction of iron biofortified staple crops on market level. Before market level
      introduction, the bioavailability of iron in the new biofortified Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato
      (OFSP) breed needs to be assessed. In this study the investigator compares the fractional and
      total iron absorption after extrinsic stable isotope labelling of the new biofortified high
      iron OFSP variety and a normal market level OFSP variety. The study is conducted in Malawian
      women of reproductive age with marginal iron status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 25 women enrolled will consume test meals consisting of 400g steamed and mashed high iron
      sweet potatoes labelled with Fe-58 daily for a period of 10 days and will then switch to the
      test meals consisting of 400g steamed and mashed control sweet potatoes labelled with Fe-57
      for a period of 10 days. The order of test meal type is random. A baseline blood sample will
      be taken on the first meal feeding day prior to consumption of any test meals, on study day
      26 (14 days after completion of the first test meal period) and on Day 40 (14 days after
      completion of the second test meal period). Erythrocyte incorporation of the stable isotope
      labels will be measured in these blood samples using an ICPMS and will be used to calculate
      fractional and total iron absorption from the two different type of test meals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Woman aged 18-35 years old

          2. low/marginal iron status respectively evidenced by one of the following criteria: PF ≤
             25 µg/L

          3. Normal BMI for age (18.5-25.0 kg/m2)

          4. Weight less than 65 kg. A maximum weight limitation is needed since the stable isotope
             portions are based on body weight. We want to give equal amounts of stable isotopes to
             each study participant and therefore need to standardize body weight.
