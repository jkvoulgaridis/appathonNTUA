      Factors affecting the pulpal prognosis of injured teeth. Dental injuries may affect the
      survival of teeth. It is recommended to monitor the injured teeth at regular intervals to
      ensure that the appropriate treatment is delivered promptly. In order to conclude what
      treatment is required, a correct diagnosis must be reached.

      However, reaching this diagnosis can be difficult as injured teeth often respond erroneously
      to many of the diagnostic tests used, thereby affecting our ability to interpret the results.

      This study aims to identify the clinical factors that affect the ability of the blood supply
      of a tooth to survive an injury. This will help ensure that patients are provided with the
      appropriate treatment with the avoidance of delays that may affect the long-term survival of
      the tooth.

      Patients that attend the Edinburgh Dental Institute trauma clinic will be invited to
      participate in this study. The patients, seen on this clinic, are assessed in regular
      intervals in a systematic way, as per accepted and validated international guidelines on the
      subject of dental trauma. There are specific investigations and clinical assessments that are
      carried out on the initial and each review appointment.

      The study will attempt to identify those teeth that lose their vitality at different points
      following the injury and will attempt to link this to the nature of the injury suffered. The
      data will be collected from the patients' routine dental trauma assessment and no additional
      investigations will be required. As per routine practice the patients are reviewed for one
      year following their injury unless otherwise indicated. All responses to the investigations
      will be collected and combined to identify the prognostic factors associated with the loss of
      vitality of traumatised teeth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dento-alveolar trauma may affect the quality of life of patients and the long term prognosis
      of the teeth. Following dental trauma regular monitoring and follow up of the teeth is
      required to ensure that the appropriate treatment is delivered promptly. Although there is
      information in the literature focused on child and adolescent dental trauma, there is limited
      information regarding traumatised permanent teeth. Permanent teeth have differing healing
      capacity after injury and this is dependent on the degree of root formation.

      During the initial assessment of patients that have suffered from dental trauma, negative
      responses to investigations assessing the health of the vasculature might lead clinicians to
      initiate unnecessary and irreversible treatment on traumatised teeth. Equally false positive
      results might delay treatment which might have an effect on the outcome, leading to the
      development of healing complications such as infection and root resorption. By collecting and
      analysing the clinical factors, we aim to identify which of aspects of the assessment might
      influence the prognoses of the teeth.
