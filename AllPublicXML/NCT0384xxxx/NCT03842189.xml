  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety in mother and neonate/infant of M281
      administered to pregnant women who are at high risk for Early Onset Severe Hemolytic Disease
      of the Fetus and Newborn (EOS-HDFN). The effectiveness of the investigational drug M281 will
      be measured by looking at the percentage of participants with live birth at or after
      gestational age (GA) 32 weeks and without a need for an intrauterine transfusion (IUT)
      throughout their entire pregnancy.
