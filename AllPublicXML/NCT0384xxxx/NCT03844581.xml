      A total of 40 volunteers women with a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. Their ages ranged
      from 25 to 40 years old; their body mass index was &gt; 30 kg/m2 and were randomly assigned to a
      group (A) received interferential current at the lower abdomen, and also received traditional
      medicine or group (B) received traditional medicine for 8 successive weeks. Both of the
      groups received the treatment program for 8 successive weeks. Assessment of pain perception
      and disability level for all patients in both groups (A&amp;B) were done through Visual analogue
      scale, O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index or Interstitial Cystitis Index (ICSI) and blood cortisol
      concentration were done before and after the treatment program.

      Forty volunteers women diagnosed clinically by gynecologist as painful bladder syndrome were
      participated in this study. They were selected randomly from the gynecological outpatient
      clinic, at Al-Zahra Universal Hospital, Al Azhar University, their ages ranged from 25 to 40
      years and their body mass index was &gt; 30 kg/m2. All participants complain from suprapubic
      pain related to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms such as increased daytime and
      night-time frequency. Exclusion criteria of the study were as follows: Participant who had
      acute viral disease, acute tuberculosis and mental disorders, benign or malignant tumors of
      the pelvic region, Participant who had active endometriosis or having artificial pacemaker or
      cardiac arrhythmia, Participant who had sensory disturbances.

      Participants were assigned randomly used sealed envelope into two groups (A&amp;B) equally in
      number. Group (A): Consisted of twenty patients suffering from painful bladder syndrome. They
      received interferential current at the lower abdomen, and also received traditional medicine
      (they were administered anticholinergics (propiverine hydrochloride 20 mg/once per day in the
      morning) for 8 successive weeks. Group (B): Consisted of twenty patients suffering from
      painful bladder syndrome. They received traditional medicine (they were administered
      anticholinergics (propiverine hydrochloride 20 mg/once per day in the morning) for 8
      successive weeks
