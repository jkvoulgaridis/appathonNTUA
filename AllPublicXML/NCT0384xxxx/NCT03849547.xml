    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the training effect of smartphone-based training for chronic ankle
      instability(CAI) subjects. By randomizing subjects to App training group, clinical training
      group and control group, the training effect will be compared among groups.

    <textblock>
      Postural control ability may be damaged after ankle sprains. Poor postural control ability is
      the risk factors of the ankle sprain, forming a vicious circle of recurrent sprains. Proper
      and early assessment is the key to breaking down the circle. Smartphones have been utilized
      in the medical field. With built-in sensors, utilizing smartphones as assessment tools can
      provide quantitative data of postural control performance. This study aims to verify the
      training effect of smartphone-based training for CAI subjects.

      CAI subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to App training group, Home training group
      and control group, receiving 6 weeks of intervention. Pre-test was conducted before the
      intervention, and the post-test was conducted after the 6-week intervention. The follow up
      assessment was conducted 4 weeks after the post-test.

    <description>An ankle function assessment tool, with 5 dimensions includes symptoms, pain, activity, function and sport, and quality of life.
The scale score ranges from 0% to 100%, the higher the percentage, the better ankle function. Subjects answer the questions by choosing different choices that describe their condition the best.
The total score will be summed up and calculated as percentage.</description>
