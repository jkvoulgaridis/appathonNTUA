    <textblock>
      This study compare the efficacy of transnasal high flow device with nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure. All of participants will be randomized to receive one night transnasal high
      flow therapy and another night for nasal continuous positive airway pressure.

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common medical condition. Nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is mainstay of treatment for OSAHS, but CPAP has
      some limitations. Patient who has bulbar dysfunction and poor consciousness are
      contraindications for CPAP. They are also not suitable for other therapy. There are still
      large number of patients could not accept CPAP. Alternative treatment method transnasal high
      flow (TNHF) was developed and previous study showed moderately reduce respiratory event. It
      is deliver 20 L/minute constant room air by nasal cannula. Because the technical limitation,
      the maximal flow rate is also 20 L/minute and it limit the effectiveness.

      Recently, new TNHF device is developed. This new TNHF device has already widely been used for
      respiratory disease. It can deliver air flow up to 60 L/mins. It is also can maintain high
      humidifier and adequate temperature. The every 10 L/min air flow could generate approximately
      1 cmH2O positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). The higher air flow could generate more high
      PEEP and may have better effect than previous TNHF, but there are no study to evaluate the
      efficacy in OSAHS patient. Thus, the purpose of our study is to compare the efficacy of TNHF
      with standard CPAP therapy.

      All of participants will estimate the air flow level before ongoing formal study and they
      will be randomly divided into two groups. The first group will ongoing CPAP therapy in first
      night and TNHF in the second night. The second group will oppositely performed TNHF in first
      night and CPAP in second night. All of study will be performed in sleep laboratory under
      attended polysomnography. The residual apnea hypopnea index under TNHF and CPAP will be used
      to compare the efficacy.

    <description>The Apnea Hypopnea Index(AHI) is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The AHI under one night transnasal high flow therapy will be compared with one night continuous positive airway pressure.</description>

    <description>The oxygen desaturation index (ODI) is the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood's oxygen level drop by 3% degree from baseline.The ODI under one night transnasal high flow therapy will be compared with one night continuous positive airway pressure.</description>

    <description>The ratio of the total time spent asleep in a night compared to the total amount of time spent in bed are common used to estimate sleep quality. Total sleep time and total time spend in bed will be measured by polysomnography in two different night under transnasal high flow and continuous positive airway pressure therapy.</description>
