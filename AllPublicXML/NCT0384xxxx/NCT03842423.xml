    <textblock>
      This study involves a retrospective evaluation of brachial plexus anaesthesia in children and
      adolescents (patients under the age of 18) undergoing surgical procedures of the upper
      extremity following trauma. The investigators plan to recruit patients from our hospital
      patient database meeting our inclusion criteria. Observational period was defined between 1st
      of January 2002 and 31st of October 2018. Necessity to convert to general anaesthesia was
      defined as primary endpoint.

    <description>The necessity to convert to general anaesthesia will be obtained from surgery and anaesthesiology protocols and serves as primary outcome to evaluate efficacy of the investigated method of anaesthesia. All patients who received plexus brachialis anaesthesia but had to be converted to general anaesthesia during or prior the surgical intervention will assigned to this outcome measurement. Number of patients who required conversion will be given as percentage of total patient collective. Possible variables: e.g. 0=no conversion, 1=conversion.</description>
