  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a complex and heterogenous disease with mortality and morbidity that equals
      more cancers. Numerous studies have examined the ability to improve prognostication from
      heart failure, ranging from basic statistical methodologies to machine learning, with
      impressive improvements in both predictive indices. However, no study to date has examined,
      in a randomized fashion, the impact of providing prognostic information on provider behavior
      and downstream clinical outcomes. It is for this reason that the investigators plan to
      perform the Risk EValuation And Its Impact on ClinicAL Decision Making and Outcomes in Heart
      Failure (REVeAL-HF) Trial within the Yale New Haven Health System. REVeAL-HF is a randomized,
      single-blind intervention trial that is testing the clinical impact of providing prognostic
      information to the provider on heart failure outcomes in the inpatient settings. The study
      hypothesis is that electronic alerting about prognostic information on heart failure patients
      along with links to guidelines will lead to reductions in all-cause mortality and 30-day HF
      hospitalizations via improved use of guideline directed medical therapy and more adequate
      decongestion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and Western
      Europe and prognosis in individual patients is highly variable. Quantifying a patient's
      survival prospects based on their overall risk profile has the potential to help identify
      those patients in need of more intensive monitoring and help target appropriate populations
      for therapies. In fact, several comprehensive risk scores in patients with heart failure are
      currently available for both reduced and preserved ejection fraction but their applicability
      to contemporary heart failure populations is unknown. Additionally, the impact of knowing a
      patient's prognostic information on treatment decisions in heart failure has never been
      studied. Therefore, guidelines do not recommend using risk assessments to decide on
      therapeutic decision making in heart failure due to a lack of data for this strategy. The
      investigators have proposed a randomized controlled trial be conducted of an electronic alert
      system that informs practitioners about their patients risk of inpatient mortality and 1-year
      predicted mortality using data from the electronic health record (EHR). The primary outcome
      for the trial will be a composite of all-cause mortality and 30-day risk of heart failure
      rehospitalization. The secondary outcomes will be length of stay, discharge doses of heart
      failure therapies, palliative care referral, referral for advanced therapies like transplant
      or mechanical circulatory support, referral to electrophysiology, and change in weight during
      hospitalization (aggressiveness of diuresis). The investigators will enroll into the trial
      across the hospitals that comprise the Yale New Haven Health System.
