  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is characterized by inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle portion of the eye.
      The greatest challenge for the treatment of uveitis is patients who have inflammation
      involving the posterior segment, either primarily in the vitreous (intermediate uveitis), the
      choroid or retina (posterior uveitis), or involving the entire eye (panuveitis). The term
      &quot;uveitis&quot; denotes a heterogeneous collection of diseases including infections, systemic
      immune-mediated diseases like sarcoidosis, and immune-mediated syndromes confined to the eye
      like sympathetic ophthalmia. Despite the progress in recent decades, uveitis and the related
      intraocular inflammation are comparable to diabetes or macular degeneration as a cause of
      lost quality-adjusted life years due to visual morbidity, and as such are a significant
      public health problem. The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group Guidelines
      recommend the use of corticosteroids as the first-line therapy for patients with active
      uveitis. However, long-term corticosteroid treatment can cause serious systemic and ocular
      side effects, such as hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataract, and glaucoma that limit
      its use in the treatment of uveitis. Alternatively, immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) drugs are
      given as steroid-sparing agents and have shown good clinical results for both systemic
      diseases and ocular inflammatory diseases. Given the side effects of chronic corticosteroid
      therapy and better understanding of the mechanisms of autoimmune-mediated uveitis, the aim of
      the treatment for patients with noninfectious uveitis is steroid-free remission with IMT.
      While uveitis is a heterogeneous disease with polygenic and environmental factors, most forms
      of immune-mediated uveitis are thought to be due to an imbalance between regulatory
      mechanisms that inhibit the immune system and inflammatory mechanisms, which have evolved to
      rid the body of infectious organisms, but which can result in immune-mediated, often chronic
      disease if they are activated outside the context of the immediate infection. The
      pathophysiology of non-infectious uveitis involves the rupture of peripheral tolerance,
      resulting in auto-aggressive Th1 or Th17 lymphocytes reaching the eye. L-12 and IL-23 are two
      key cytokines involved in Th1 and Th17 polarization in uveitis, respectively. Furthermore,
      these two cytokines share a common subunit (p40). Ustekinumab, a humanized anti-p40
      monoclonal antibody, is able to target both IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, thus disrupting Th1 and
      Th17 immune responses.

      Decreasing the dose as well as the duration of treatment with GC is of particular importance
      in uveitis, and ustekinumab, which selectively inhibits Th1 and Th17 pathways in the
      inflammatory cascade, could provide a ideal additional therapy for non-infectious severe
      uveitis (NISU) to reach this objective.

      Therefore, in the present study, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      ustekinumab for the treatment of NISU.
