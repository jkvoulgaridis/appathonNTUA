  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn how the Mediterranean and low-fat eating
      patterns affect memory, brain volume, brain antioxidant status and cardio-metabolic
      biomarkers, such as blood pressure and blood glucose, in cognitively normal older adults.
      Researchers also plan to examine underlying processes relating the patterns to brain health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to either a Mediterranean or low-fat eating pattern.
      Participation in the study will last about 13 months. Each person will be prescribed one of
      two eating patterns for 12 months. During the study, participants will be asked to track the
      food they eat and will be monitored by a registered dietitian. Participants will engage in
      monthly food demonstrations and cooking classes. Participants will pick up a bag of food
      items belonging to the prescribed eating pattern, on a weekly basis for 6 months, from a
      local grocery store chain.

      Participants have the option to continue in the study for up to 2 years for additional
      measurements.

      Potential participants need to be located within the Kansas City metro area.
