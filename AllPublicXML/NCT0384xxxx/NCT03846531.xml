      Evaluate Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) to clear or remove Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) lesions
      from off-facial areas of healthy adult subjects.

      The specific objectives of this study are to:

        -  Document the non-treated appearance of off-face SKs.

        -  Evaluate the clearance of SKs in off-face locations post-treatment versus pre-treated
           appearance of the same lesion.

        -  Evaluate the clearance of the treated SKs at various points in time over several weeks
           following the initial procedure, compared to the pre-treated SKs.

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject served as their own control. Each subject had 4 lesions with 3 of the lesions serving in the Active Comparative Arm (Lesions treated with Nano-Pulse Stimulation) and 1 lesion serving as control not treated with Nano-Pulse Stimulation and assigned to No Intervention Arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A Reference Key was developed for 3 independent reviewers to use during their review of the full set (196 image pairs) of study photographs. The reference key included 2 representative photographs for each of the 4 possible scores used in the SK study (clear, mostly clear, partially clear, and not clear). The three independent reviewers were not principal investigators at enrolling centers.</masking_description>
