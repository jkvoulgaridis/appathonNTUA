  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation (CA) is an established therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation (AF). During the procedure, patients are usually sedated and analgesized,
      most commonly by administration of Propofol combined with opioids under the supervision of
      the electrophysiologist. However, due to the depressive effect of Propofol on the respiratory
      system, this regimen is not without risk. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2
      agonist that demonstrates both analgesic and hypnotic properties with only weak effect on the
      respiratory system. The pharmacological profile of Dexmedetomidine may be advantageous for
      sedation during CA of AF. The aim of this randomized trial is to test this hypothesis and
      explore the safety and efficacy of Dexmedetomidine during CA of AF.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. In symptomatic patients,
      electroanatomic mapping aided catheter ablation (CA) is an established therapeutic option.
      The intervention may last several hours, during which patients are required to lie as still
      as possible, as inadequate patient movements disturb the electroanatomic map, prolong the
      intervention and increase its complication risks. Therefore patients are usually sedated and
      analgesized, most commonly by administration of Propofol combined with opioids under the
      supervision of the electrophysiologist. Despite its wide use, this regimen is not without
      risk, as Propofol has a pronounced depressive effect on the respiratory system.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2 agonist that demonstrates both analgesic and
      hypnotic properties with only weak respiratory depression. By reducing sympathetic activity
      it also reduces the stress response to an intervention. For these reasons, Dexmedetomidine is
      commonly used in intensive care units, where it has been shown to be well tolerated.
      Consequently, its range of application has been increasingly widened and good experience has
      been made with its use in transfemoral valve replacement procedures or gastroenterological
      interventions.

      The pharmacological profile of dexmedetomidine may be also advantageous for sedation during
      CA of AF. The aim of this randomized trial is to test this hypothesis and explore the safety
      and efficacy of Dexmedetomidine during CA of AF.

    <description>At minimum 5 minutes before start of sedation for atrial fibrillation ablation a bolus of fentanyl (20-50 µg) will be administered. Thereafter, sedation is induced via the continuous infusion of propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump. The effect-site propofol concentration will be initially set to 1.5 µg/ml, unless the patient is already sedated by fentanyl. Subsequently, an effect-site propofol concentration of 1 µg/ml will be chosen adjusted stepwise (using steps of 0.3 µg/ml) to reach a target score of 2-3 on the MOAA/S scale. In case of pain fentanyl can be administered bolus-wise (10-30 µg) at the cardiologists discretion.</description>

    <description>At minimum 5 minutes before start of sedation for atrial fibrillation ablation a bolus of fentanyl (20-50 µg) will be administered. Thereafter, sedation is induced with a loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.8 µg/kg) over 10 minutes. The maintenance dexmedetomidine dose is adjusted to the appropriate sedation criteria for CA (0.4 µg/kg/h) and for a target score of 2-3 on the MOAA/S scale. In case of pain, additional fentanyl can be administered bolus-wise (10-30 µg) at the cardiologists discretion.</description>
