      This is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, double blinded (blinded evaluator and
      subject), multicenter clinical trial, which will be performed in Tri-Service General
      Hospital, Linkou ChangGung Memorial Hospital and National Taiwan University Hospital. These
      hospitals will recruit subjects in a competitive way. 240 subjects will be recruited in
      total, and each hospital will recruit 60~120 subjects. The expected execution period is
      2018/10~2021/06. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the investigational device
      &quot;Sumax FULLSGEN with Lidocaine&quot; or controlled device &quot;Sumax FACIALGAIN collagen Implant with
      Lidocaine&quot; in 1:1 ratio. These devices will be processed to keep subjects and evaluators
      blinded.
