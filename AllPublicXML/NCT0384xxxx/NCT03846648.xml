  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is intended to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and
      efficacy of topical CyPep-1 as a potential treatment for HPV-associated conditions. Since
      this is a first-on-human study of a topical formulation, the first subjects will be monitored
      more frequently in order to establish the safety profile. Because clinical outcomes (i.e.
      reduction/clearance of the lesion) often require lengthy treatment / observation periods, the
      study design will primarily utilize clinical measurements of wart dimensions, along with HPV
      viral load as a biomarker of anti-viral effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has a phase 1, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, single center design
      to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics (PD) of topically applied CyPep-1 in
      otherwise healthy patients with cutaneous warts.

      The study will entail two parts. Part 1 will follow a target area of 5x5 cm healthy skin to
      study tolerability and safety of the formulation. During this study part also a maximum of 3
      common warts, preferably at the dorsal or palmar side of the hand / finger(s), will be
      treated. Several assessments will be done to determine pharmacodynamics and to explore
      possible efficacy after a treatment period of 1 week.

      Part 2 will evaluate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of CyPep-1 after a treatment period of
      4 weeks. Study part 2 will commence after an interim analysis, e.g. a blind data review, of
      study part 1 has been conducted.

    <description>CyPep-1 cream 1% (w/w) will be applied once daily on a 5x5 cm healthy skin area on the upper back and on 1 to max 3 common warts on the (dorsal/palmar) side of the hand.
In Part 1 the dosing will be performed once daily for 7 days. The dose of 200 μL CyPep-1 cream will be applied on a 5x5 cm on the back by clinical staff. In addition, up to 3 common warts will be treated with 20 μL of the CyPep1 cream per day.
In Part 2 subjects will administer 20-30 mg CyPep-1 cream once daily at home after instruction by clinical staff. The total treatment period will be 28 days, possibility of a maximum extension of three days is allowed.</description>

The treatment groups are:
CyPep-1 topical formulation 1% (w/w)
Vehicle topical formulation (placebo) The minimum set of studied warts is 1 treated common wart per subject. The subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment. During the treatment period topical formulation will be applied daily on to a maximum of 3 warts. One selected wart will serve as target wart, i.e. the primary wart, for detailed analysis. Selection of warts will be based on the feasibility to conduct treatment application and pharmacodynamics (including biopsy sampling) on the region of interest.</description>
