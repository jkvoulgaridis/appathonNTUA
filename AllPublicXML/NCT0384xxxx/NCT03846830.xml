  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective for this study is to compare outcome measures from vestibular rehabilitation
      (VPT) delivered in a traditional method against a new device Incremental Velocity Error (IVE)
      that improves physiologic performance of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Participants include
      active duty service members with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and civilians with
      peripheral vestibular hypofunction. The investigators will use a clinical trial cross-over
      design with randomization to either the control (VPT) or experimental (IVE) group and measure
      vestibulo-ocular reflex function as well as subjective and functional outcomes in order to
      investigate the best means to improve delivery of vestibular rehabilitation.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will randomize placement in two groups of gaze stability exercises (IVE or traditional VPT). Each of the three Aims will recruit active duty service members with mTBI and dizziness from the Intrepid Spirit Center at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (FBCH) and civilians with unilateral vestibular hypofunction from Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Inclusion criteria for the FBCH site are active duty service member with mTBI and 'vestibular' symptoms (dizziness, oscillopsia, motion sensitivity, imbalance). Inclusion criteria for the JHU site are civilians with unilateral vestibular hypofunction.</intervention_model_description>
