  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to investigate clinically the cleaning effectiveness of different
      treatment modalities, that is, oral irrigator or interdental brush usage addition to routine
      brushing and examine TGF-β1, IL-1β, t-PA, and PAI-1 levels in periimplant crevicular fluid of
      patients with periimplant mucositis. The null hypothesis was that oral irrigators would be
      effective compared to interdental brush in the oral care of individuals who use
      implant-supported protheses.

      Detailed Description: Our aim was to evaluate efficacy of a manual tooth-brush with either
      interdental brush or oral irrigator in treatment of periimplant mucositis.

      Material and Method: Forty-five patients with periimplant mucositis having at least one
      implant (age range:45-60) were included in study. Study was planned as randomized,
      single-blind, parallel-design. Patients were divided into 3 equal groups; i)toothbrush+oral
      irrigator ii)toothbrush+interdental brush, iii)only toothbrush. After baseline examinations
      [Silness-Löe plaque index(PI), Löe-Silness gingival index(GI), probing pocket depth(PPD),
      clinical attachment level(CAL), bleeding on probing(BOP)], initial periodontal therapy was
      completed using full-mouth disinfection method. Periimplant crevicular fluid(PCF) were taken
      from patents to assess levels of interleukin-1beta(IL-1β), Transforming growth
      factor-beta(TGF- β), tissue-type plasminogen activator(t-PA), plasminogen activator
      inhibitor-1(PAI-1). Clinical records were repeated at 2, 4 and 12 weeks.

      The hypothesis of our study is that oral irrigators may be effective in oral care of
      individuals using an implant-supported prosthesis because of the ease of use.

    <description>Fifteen patients using toothbrush and oral irrigator(oxytet oral irrigatör).All patients were told to use Modified Bass method of tooth brushing technique. PI, GI, PPD and CAL values were measured with William's probe (Hu-Fried, Chicago, IL, A.B.D) around the teeth and with plastic probe around the implants. All clinical parameters were evaluated on each of the six regions of the implant (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual).PICF was collected one day after the clinical examination from buccal aspects of the mesial and distal surfaces at the interproximal sites.Following the initial clinical records, all patients were performed full mouth instrumentation and described oral hygiene procedure according to their groups.</description>

    <description>Prior to PICF sampling, supragingival plaque was removed by sterile curets and, after air drying, the surfaces were isolated by cotton rolls. Filter paper strips (periopaper, proflow Inc., Amityville, New York, USA) were placed in sulcus for 30s. Care was taken not to avoid mechanical trauma and strips contaminated with blood or saliva were discarded. The absorbed PICF volume was estimated by a calibrated instrument (periotron 8000, proflow Inc., Amityville, NY, USA). Then, the strips were sealed into sterile tubes before freezing at -80⁰C. The readings were converted to an actual volume (µl) by reference to the standard curve.</description>
