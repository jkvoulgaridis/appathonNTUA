    <description>The (sub)investigator made the following clinical assessments by use of the scale below:
Score; Intensity; Description
Erythema:
0; No evidence; Normal skin color 0.5; Doubtful or very mild 1.0; Mild; Pink light red 1.5; Mild to moderate 2.0; Moderate; Red 2.5; Moderate to severe 3.0; Severe; Intense red
Scaling:
0; No evidence; No scaling 0.5; Doubtful or very mild 1.0; Mild; Slight roughness, mainly fine scales 1.5; Mild to moderate 2.0; Moderate; Coarse scaling 2.5; Moderate to severe 3.0; Severe; Coarse, thick scales
Infiltration:
0; No evidence 0.5; Doubtful or very mild 1.0; Mild Slight definite infiltration 1.5; Mild to moderate 2.0; Moderate; Moderate infiltration 2.5; Moderate to severe 3.0; Severe; Very marked infiltration
The TCS was defined as the sum of erythema plus scaling plus thickness scores. The TCS therefore ranged from 0 (all symptoms absent) to 9 (all symptoms severe).</description>

    <measure>Pathology and Histology by Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Skin biopsies were taken on Day 29. The evaluation of immunohistochemical sections were performed on cross sections of the skin tissue. The same pathologist did all evaluations, and samples were masked to ensure a blind fashion study. The extent of the following parameters were measured in scored semi-quantitatively (semi) on blinded haematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections. Semi-quantitative scoring was categorized as No (0), mild (1), moderate (2), marked (3) or severe (4). In evaluating the morphology of epidermis (Stratum corneum and Stratum granulosum) the tissue was classified by the characteristics seen below:
Morphology of epidermis
Stratum corneum (semi (extent of))
Stratum granulosum (semi (extent of))
Parakeratosis (semi (extent of))
Infiltration of inflammatory cells (semi (extent of))</description>

    <description>Skin biopsies were taken on Day 29. The evaluation of immunohistochemical sections were performed on cross sections of the skin tissue. The same pathologist did all evaluations, and samples were masked to ensure a blind fashion study. In evaluating the morphology of epidermis (Stratum corneum and Stratum granulosum), the tissue was classified by the characteristic epidermal thickness. This was measured in the absolute number of µm measured on blinded haematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections..</description>

    <description>Skin biopsies were taken on Day 29. The evaluation of immunohistochemical sections were performed on cross sections of the skin tissue. The same pathologist did all evaluations, and samples were masked to ensure a blind fashion study.
In evaluating the morphology of epidermis (Stratum corneum and Stratum granulosum), the tissue was classified by the characteristic of frequency of neutrophil microabscesses (Monroe´s abscess). This was measured in absolute number of cells that were positive for the marker on blinded haematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections.</description>

        <title>Change in Total Clinical Score (TCS) of the Clinical Symptoms Compared to Baseline (Day 1)</title>
        <description>The (sub)investigator made the following clinical assessments by use of the scale below:
Score; Intensity; Description
Erythema:
0; No evidence; Normal skin color 0.5; Doubtful or very mild 1.0; Mild; Pink light red 1.5; Mild to moderate 2.0; Moderate; Red 2.5; Moderate to severe 3.0; Severe; Intense red
Scaling:
0; No evidence; No scaling 0.5; Doubtful or very mild 1.0; Mild; Slight roughness, mainly fine scales 1.5; Mild to moderate 2.0; Moderate; Coarse scaling 2.5; Moderate to severe 3.0; Severe; Coarse, thick scales
Infiltration:
0; No evidence 0.5; Doubtful or very mild 1.0; Mild Slight definite infiltration 1.5; Mild to moderate 2.0; Moderate; Moderate infiltration 2.5; Moderate to severe 3.0; Severe; Very marked infiltration
The TCS was defined as the sum of erythema plus scaling plus thickness scores. The TCS therefore ranged from 0 (all symptoms absent) to 9 (all symptoms severe).</description>

        <description>Skin biopsies were taken on Day 29. The evaluation of immunohistochemical sections were performed on cross sections of the skin tissue. The same pathologist did all evaluations, and samples were masked to ensure a blind fashion study. The extent of the following parameters were measured in scored semi-quantitatively (semi) on blinded haematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections. Semi-quantitative scoring was categorized as No (0), mild (1), moderate (2), marked (3) or severe (4). In evaluating the morphology of epidermis (Stratum corneum and Stratum granulosum) the tissue was classified by the characteristics seen below:
