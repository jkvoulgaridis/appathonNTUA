  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the potential for ridaforolimus to prolong the QTc interval (an effect on the
      electrical activity of the heart) in participants with advanced cancer. This study will be
      done in 2 parts. Part 1 (Pt 1) will evaluate the effect of a single 100 mg dose of
      ridaforolimus on QT interval in participants with advanced cancer. Fridericias's correction
      (QTcF) will be used. In Part 2 (Pt 2), participants will receive ridaforolimus at the current
      therapeutic dose (40 mg x 5 days).

    <measure>Part 1. Mean Change From Baseline in Rate-Corrected (Fridericia's) QT Interval (QTcF) at 0.5 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 0.5 hours post-dose on Days 1 &amp; 2 of Part 1</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change from baseline (CFB) in QTcF at 0.5 hours post-dose was assessed. At baseline (pre-dose) and at 0.5 hours post-dose, 5 replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected to reduce measurement variability. The 5 replicate QTcF values were averaged to calculate the QTcF value for each participant. Further, each participant served as their own control for the calculation of CFB in QTcF after placebo and ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing. Additionally, CFB in QTcF after single ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing for each participant was adjusted for the CFB in QTcF observed after placebo dosing.</description>

        <description>The mean change from baseline (CFB) in QTcF at 0.5 hours post-dose was assessed. At baseline (pre-dose) and at 0.5 hours post-dose, 5 replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected to reduce measurement variability. The 5 replicate QTcF values were averaged to calculate the QTcF value for each participant. Further, each participant served as their own control for the calculation of CFB in QTcF after placebo and ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing. Additionally, CFB in QTcF after single ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing for each participant was adjusted for the CFB in QTcF observed after placebo dosing.</description>

An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. Participants experiencing AEs were counted under the treatment they received when the AE occurred. Participants experiencing AEs during the washout period between Part 1 and Part 2 are counted in the &quot;Pt 1, Day 2. Ridaforolimus 100 mg&quot; arm.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event</title>
          <description>The number of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE was assessed. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. Participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE were counted as discontinuing under the treatment they received when the AE occurred.</description>
          <population>All participants receiving ≥1 dose of study treatment. One participant discontinued from study after the Day 1 placebo dose and did not receive ridaforolimus 100 mg or 40 mg.</population>

        <description>The mean change from baseline (CFB) in QTcF at 1 hour post-dose was assessed. At baseline (pre-dose) and at 1 hour post-dose, 5 replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected to reduce measurement variability. The 5 replicate QTcF values were averaged to calculate the QTcF value for each participant. Further, each participant served as their own control for the calculation of CFB in QTcF after placebo and ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing. Additionally, CFB in QTcF after single ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing for each participant was adjusted for the CFB in QTcF observed after placebo dosing.</description>

        <title>Part 1. Mean Change From Baseline in Rate-Corrected (Fridericia's) QT Interval (QTcF) at 4 Hours</title>
        <description>The mean change from baseline (CFB) in QTcF at 4 hours post-dose was assessed. At baseline (pre-dose) and at 4 hours post-dose, 5 replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected to reduce measurement variability. The 5 replicate QTcF values were averaged to calculate the QTcF value for each participant. Further, each participant served as their own control for the calculation of CFB in QTcF after placebo and ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing. Additionally, CFB in QTcF after single ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing for each participant was adjusted for the CFB in QTcF observed after placebo dosing.</description>

        <description>The mean change from baseline (CFB) in QTcF at 10 hours post-dose was assessed. At baseline (pre-dose) and at 10 hours post-dose, 5 replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected to reduce measurement variability. The 5 replicate QTcF values were averaged to calculate the QTcF value for each participant. Further, each participant served as their own control for the calculation of CFB in QTcF after placebo and ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing. Additionally, CFB in QTcF after single ridaforolimus 100 mg dosing for each participant was adjusted for the CFB in QTcF observed after placebo dosing.</description>
