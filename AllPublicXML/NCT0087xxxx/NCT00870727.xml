  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a better tolerated and more effective pharmacologic
      treatment with individuals with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. This is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole in the management of the maladaptive behaviors of
      Pervasive Developmental Disorder. The investigators hypothesize that aripiprazole will be
      more effective than placebo for reducing aggression, tantrum and self-injurious behavior in
      children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are characterized by severe impairments in social
      interaction and communication in addition to restricted patterns of interests and activities.
      Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to
      these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics
      were reported in subjects with PDD, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotics which
      have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the
      atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a
      need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and
      adolescents with PDDs. The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether
      aripiprazole is effective and well tolerated for irritability in children and adolescents
      with PDD not otherwise specified (NOS) during an 8-week acute phase and whether the
      effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole is maintained during a 16-week continuation
      phase.

    <description>Clinical Global Impressions (Guy, 1976) global improvement (CGI-I) is designed to take into account all factors to arrive at an assessment of response to treatment. The CGI-I scale ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating greater improvement (1=very much improved and 2=much improved). Participants with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 were classified as improved. Four participants assigned to placebo completed an exit interview prior to week 8. One participant assigned to placebo and one participant assigned to aripiprazole withdrew from the study without completing an exit interview.</description>

    <measure>Mean Post-baseline Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale Score, Parent Report, Double-blind Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors in individuals ages 6 to 54 years-old with mental retardation. The full ABC is a 58-item parent rating with five factors: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech. It has been used as a primary outcome measure in several trials in children with developmental disabilities. The interpretation of the tool and its subscales is that a greater number of items indicates greater severity. The range of scores for the Irritability subscale is 0 to 45. Means were estimated using a repeated measures linear regression model with treatment group, baseline score, study week (in categories), and Tanner stage as covariates. A linear contrast estimated the average across study timepoints. Confidence intervals reflect a Bonferroni multiple testing correction accounting for the selection of two primary outcomes.</description>

The full ABC is a 58-item parent rating with five factors: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech. The 16-item Hyperactivity subscale covers overactivity (7 items), impulsiveness (2 items), inattention (3 items) and noncompliance (4 items). It has been used as a primary outcome measure in several trials in children with developmental disabilities. The interpretation of the tool and its subscales is that a greater number of items indicates greater severity. The range of scores is 0 to 48 on the Hyperactivity subscale. Means were estimated using a repeated measures linear regression model with treatment group, baseline score, study week (in categories), and Tanner stage as covariates.

        <description>Clinical Global Impressions (Guy, 1976) global improvement (CGI-I) is designed to take into account all factors to arrive at an assessment of response to treatment. The CGI-I scale ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating greater improvement (1=very much improved and 2=much improved). Participants with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 were classified as improved. Four participants assigned to placebo completed an exit interview prior to week 8. One participant assigned to placebo and one participant assigned to aripiprazole withdrew from the study without completing an exit interview.</description>

        <title>Mean Post-baseline Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale Score, Parent Report, Double-blind Phase</title>
        <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors in individuals ages 6 to 54 years-old with mental retardation. The full ABC is a 58-item parent rating with five factors: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech. It has been used as a primary outcome measure in several trials in children with developmental disabilities. The interpretation of the tool and its subscales is that a greater number of items indicates greater severity. The range of scores for the Irritability subscale is 0 to 45. Means were estimated using a repeated measures linear regression model with treatment group, baseline score, study week (in categories), and Tanner stage as covariates. A linear contrast estimated the average across study timepoints. Confidence intervals reflect a Bonferroni multiple testing correction accounting for the selection of two primary outcomes.</description>

The full ABC is a 58-item parent rating with five factors: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech.

It has been used as a primary outcome measure in several trials in children with developmental disabilities. The interpretation of the tool and its subscales is that a greater number of items indicates greater severity. The range of scores is 0 to 48 on the Hyperactivity subscale.

          <title>Mean Post-baseline Aberrant Behavior Checklist Inappropriate Speech Subscale Score, Parent Report, Double-blind Phase</title>
          <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors in individuals ages 6 to 54 years-old with mental retardation. The full ABC is a 58-item parent rating with five factors: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech. It has been used as a primary outcome measure in several trials in children with developmental disabilities. The interpretation of the tool and its subscales is that a greater number of items indicates greater severity. The range of scores for the Inappropriate Speech subscale is 0 to 12. Means were estimated using a repeated measures linear regression model with treatment group, baseline score, study week (in categories), and Tanner stage as covariates. A linear contrast estimated the average across study timepoints.</description>
