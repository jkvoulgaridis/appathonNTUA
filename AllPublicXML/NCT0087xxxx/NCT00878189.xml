    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and then Day 1 (+ or - 5 days) of every odd cycle or as clinically indicated, up to Cycle 9 (up to maximum of 84 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The RFS of CR was defined as the time from the date of first attaining CR to the date of relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Similarly, the RFS of CR + CRi (or RFS of CR + CRi + PR) was defined as the time from the date of first attaining CR + CRi (or CR + CRi + PR) to the date of relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Expression Levels of Notch 1 Target Genes in Tumor Biopsies for Solid Tumor Participants: Hairy and Enhancer of Split-4 (Hes4) Gene Expression Levels on Cycle 1 Day 21 Relative to That at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 21 (-5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Gene expression analysis in tumor biopsies was done using cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from tumor biopsies. Gene expression was measured by custom Taqman low density array (TLDA) cards run on Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. Changes from baseline were calculated as ratios to baseline. Only Hes4 gene showed consistent down modulation across dosing cohorts (150 mg and 220 mg BID) and therefore results were reported for Hes4 only. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for two arms only.</description>

A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life-threatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), and resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of casual relationship. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life-threatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), and resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. CTCAE version 3.0 was used for AE grading: Grade 1 mild AE; Grade 2 moderate AE; Grade 3 severe AE; Grade 4 life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 death related to AE.</description>

        <description>Parameters analyzed included: white blood cell (WBC) count plus differential, absolute (abs) neutrophil count, platelets, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, uric acid, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), partial prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PTT/INR). Urinalysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites. Pregnancy test: Serum or urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. There were no changes in urine protein among the solid tumor and T-ALL/LBL participants that were clinically significant. Clinical significance was judged by the investigator.</description>

The testing order for fed versus fasted conditions was as follows: The first 6 participants in this sub-study were tested under fed followed by fasted conditions, the next 6 participants were tested under fasted followed by fed conditions.</description>

        <title>Changes in Expression Levels of Notch 1 Target Genes in Tumor Biopsies for Solid Tumor Participants: Hairy and Enhancer of Split-4 (Hes4) Gene Expression Levels on Cycle 1 Day 21 Relative to That at Baseline</title>
        <description>Gene expression analysis in tumor biopsies was done using cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from tumor biopsies. Gene expression was measured by custom Taqman low density array (TLDA) cards run on Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. Changes from baseline were calculated as ratios to baseline. Only Hes4 gene showed consistent down modulation across dosing cohorts (150 mg and 220 mg BID) and therefore results were reported for Hes4 only. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for two arms only.</description>
