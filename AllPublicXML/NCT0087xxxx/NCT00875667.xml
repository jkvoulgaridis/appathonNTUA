      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide versus investigator choice in patients
      with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients who have relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma
      following treatment such as radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radioimmunotherapy.
      Chemotherapy agents such as gemcitabine, cytarabine, chlorambucil, fludarabine, or the
      immunotherapeutic agent, rituximab, may be proposed. Thus, the aim is to search for new
      treatments that may improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

      The present clinical study aims at determining if lenalidomide is safe and active in patients
      with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory to their treatment or have relapsed once, twice
      or three times. Enrollment goal was met on March 7th 2013 and thus enrollment was stopped.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 67 sites including 3 sites in Belgium, 3 in Czech Republic, 14 in France, 7 in Germany, 2 in Israel, 10 in Italy, 1 in the Netherlands, 5 in Poland, 11 in Russia, 4 in Spain, 2 in Sweden, and 5 in the United Kingdom (UK).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive lenalidomide monotherapy or investigator’s choice. Participants were stratified according to the time since diagnosis (&lt; 3 years or ≥ 3 years), time since last treatment (&lt; 6 months [refractory] or ≥ 6 months) and if they had undergone a prior stem cell transplant or not.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Lenalidomide</title>
          <description>Participants received lenalidomide 25 mg capsules orally every day for 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 mL/min but &lt; 60mL/min received 10 mg lenalidomide for 21 days of each 28-day cycle (Cycles 1 and 2). After Cycle 2, if the participant remained free of Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity, the dose was increased to 15 mg lenalidomide for 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

Individual nodes previously confluent decreased by more than 75% in the SPD compared with original mass; 2) indeterminate bone marrow; PR = is defined ≥50% decrease in 6 largest nodes or nodal masses. Stable disease (SD) is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is not progressive disease or relapsed disease.</description>

        <title>Maximum Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Domain to Treatment Discontinuation Visit</title>
        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Scale ranges from 0 to 100, with a high score indicating better functioning. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline known as screening visit, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after Cycle 4 (C5D1), after Cycle 6, (C7D1), after Cycle 8, (C9D1) and at discontinuation; median treatment duration was 24.3 weeks for lenalidomide and 13.1 weeks for the investigator choice arm.</time_frame>

        <title>Maximum Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Role Functioning Domain to Treatment Discontinuation Visit</title>
        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Role Functioning Scale ranges from 0 to 100, with a high score indicating better functioning. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline known as screening visit, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after Cycle 4 (C5D1), after Cycle 6, (C7D1), after Cycle 8, (C9D1) and at discontinuation; median treatment duration was 24.3 weeks for lenalidomide and 13.1 weeks for the investigator choice arm.</time_frame>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Cognitive Functioning Scale ranges from 0 to 100, with a high score indicating better functioning. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Domain was scored between 0 and 100, with a higher score representing worse symptomatic expression.</description>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Pain Scale was scored between 0 and 100, with a higher score representing worse symptomatic expression.</description>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Nausea and Vomiting Scale was scored between 0 and 100, with a high score representing worse symptomatic expression.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline known as screening visit, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after Cycle 4 (C5D1), after Cycle 6, (C7D1), after Cycle 8, (C9D1) and at discontinuation; median treatment duration was 24.3 weeks for lenalidomide and 13.1 weeks for the investigator choice arm.</time_frame>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Insomnia Domain was scored between 0 and 100, with a higher score representing worse symptomatic expression.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline known as screening visit, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after Cycle 4 (C5D1), after Cycle 6, (C7D1), after Cycle 8, (C9D1) and at discontinuation; median treatment duration was 24.3 weeks for lenalidomide and 13.1 weeks for the investigator choice arm.</time_frame>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Dyspnoea Domain to Treatment Scale was scored between 0 and 100, with a higher score representing worse symptomatic expression.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline known as screening visit, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after Cycle 4 (C5D1), after Cycle 6, (C7D1), after Cycle 8, (C9D1) and at discontinuation; median treatment duration was 24.3 weeks for lenalidomide and 13.1 weeks for the investigator choice arm.</time_frame>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Appetite Loss Domain to Treatment Scale was scored between 0 and 100, with a higher score representing worse symptomatic expression.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline known as screening visit, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after Cycle 4 (C5D1), after Cycle 6, (C7D1), after Cycle 8, (C9D1) and at discontinuation; median treatment duration was 24.3 weeks for lenalidomide and 13.1 weeks for the investigator choice arm.</time_frame>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Emotional Functioning Domain</title>
        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Emotional Domain ranges from 0 to 100, with a high score indicating better functioning. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>
