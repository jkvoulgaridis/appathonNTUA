  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the incidence of a two-part composite endpoint consisting of de novo
      donor specific antibody (DSA) formation or a designation of immune activation (IA) on
      peripheral blood molecular profiling in participants maintained on twice daily,
      immediate-release tacrolimus versus those maintained on Astagraf XL in the first year
      post-transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an exploratory, two year (shortened to 1 year due to a stopping rule necessitated by
      the adaptive design), prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial examining
      long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a two-part,
      composite surrogate endpoint. Specifically, it was designed to compare the effects of twice
      daily, immediate-release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and the
      development of a peripheral blood molecular profile indicating the presence of IA in de novo
      kidney transplant recipients during the first year following transplantation. For the
      purposes of this study, IA was defined as a positive molecular signature using a molecular
      assay in all participants.

      Participants were screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:1 to receive immediate-release
      tacrolimus, administered twice daily, or Astagraf XL, as a component of a standard
      immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (if given per
      institutional protocol) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or Myfortic® equivalent).
      Investigators were encouraged to start participants on the randomized study treatment
      (immediate release tacrolimus or Astagraf XL) within 48 hours of transplantation
      (pre-transplant administration of study treatment was not allowed). However, if medically
      indicated per the treating physician's discretion, initiation of study treatment was delayed
      for up to seven days post-transplant.

    <description>DSA was considered as a categorical (binary) variable with positivity determined at a threshold criteria approaching mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)=1000 at any time during the study.

             regimen following his/her transplant procedure.

          -  Patient currently taking, having taken within 30 days, or who will be maintained on an

             excluded by this criterion.

          -  Presence of current or historic pre-formed anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) DSA
             against the current donor (evidence of pre-formed, non-donor HLA is not exclusionary)

             have normal liver function tests (LFT) and who are either hepatitis C positive with a
             negative viral load or have natural or vaccine-acquired immunity from hepatitis B are

        <description>DSA was considered as a categorical (binary) variable with positivity determined at a threshold criteria approaching mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)=1000 at any time during the study. IA was considered either present or absent using the Trugraf™ v2.0 molecular assay. A negative designation (Trugraf TX Normal) was referred to as Immune Quiescence (IQ). Due to operating characteristics of the assay, a positive designation was considered evidence of IA in all participants.</description>

Banff Lesion Scores assess the presence and the degree of histopathological changes in the different compartments of renal transplant biopsies, focusing primarily but not exclusively on the diagnostic features seen in rejection. [Roufosse C et. al 2018]. Here, Score 0= No mononuclear cells in tubules or single focus of tubulitis only, Score 1= Foci with 1 to 4 mononuclear cells/tubular cross section (or 10 tubular cells), Score 2= Foci with 5 to 10 mononuclear cells/tubular cross section (or 10 tubular cells) and Score 3= Foci with &gt;10 mononuclear cells/tubular cross section or the presence of ≥2 areas of tubular basement membrane destruction accompanied by i2/i3 inflammation and t2 elsewhere.</description>

          <description>Central pathology reading was performed as per the 2007 Update to the Banff '97 classification. Banff Lesion Scores assess the presence and the degree of histopathological changes in the different compartments of renal transplant biopsies, focusing primarily but not exclusively on the diagnostic features seen in rejection. [Roufosse C et. al 2018]. Here, Score 0= No GBM double contours by light microscopy (LM) or electron microscopy (EM), Score 1= No GBM double contours by LM but GBM double contours (incomplete or circumferential) in at least 3 glomerular capillaries by EM or Double contours of the GBM in 1-25% of capillary loops in the most affected nonsclerotic glomerulus by LM , Score 2= Double contours affecting 26 to 50% of peripheral capillary loops in the most affected—glomerulus and Score 3= Double contours affecting more than 50% of peripheral capillary loops in the most affected-glomerulus.</description>

        <description>Central pathology reading was performed as per the 2007 Update to the Banff '97 classification. Banff Lesion Scores assess the presence and the degree of histopathological changes in the different compartments of renal transplant biopsies, focusing primarily but not exclusively on the diagnostic features seen in rejection. [Roufosse C et. al 2018]. Here, Score 0= No chronic vascular changes, Score 1= Vascular narrowing of up to 25% luminal area by fibrointimal thickening, Score 2= Vascular narrowing of 26 to 50% luminal area by fibrointimal thickening and Score 3= Vascular narrowing of more than 50% luminal area by fibrointimal thickening.</description>

        <description>Central pathology reading was performed as per the 2007 Update to the Banff '97 classification. Banff Lesion Scores assess the presence and the degree of histopathological changes in the different compartments of renal transplant biopsies, focusing primarily but not exclusively on the diagnostic features seen in rejection. [Roufosse C et. al 2018]. Here, Score 0= No more than mild mesangial matrix increase in any glomerulus, Score 1= At least moderate mesangial matrix increase in up to 25% of nonsclerotic glomeruli, Score 2= At least moderate mesangial matrix increase in 26% to 50% of nonsclerotic glomeruli and Score 3= At least moderate mesangial matrix increase in &gt;50% of nonsclerotic glomeruli.</description>
