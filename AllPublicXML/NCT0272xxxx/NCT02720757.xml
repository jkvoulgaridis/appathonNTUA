  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Non Interventional Study is to measure changes in physical
      functioning, a surrogate for physical activity and exercise capacity, in COPD patients on
      treatment with Spiolto® Respimat® in routine daily treatment after approximately 6 weeks.

      A secondary objective is to evaluate the patient's general condition (physician's evaluation)
      from Visit 1 (baseline visit at the start of the study) to Visit 2 (final visit at the end of
      the study, approx. 6 weeks after Visit 1), as well as patient satisfaction with Spiolto®
      Respimat® at Visit 2.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Therapeutic Success After Approximately (Approx.) 6 Weeks After Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (baseline) and at Visit 2 (approx. 6 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Therapeutic success&quot; is defined as a 10-point increase of physical functioning (PF)-10 between Visit 1 (baseline) and Visit 2 (approx. 6 weeks later) using a PF questionnaire, which is a subdomain of the Short form (SF)-36 patient questionnaire. The PF-10 sub-domain consists of 10 questions evaluating the extent of experienced restrictions while conducting usual activities. Each question of the PF-10 can be answered with &quot;yes, limited a lot&quot;, &quot;yes, limited a little&quot;, or &quot;No, not limited at all&quot;, with a score of 1, 2, or 3. The scores over the 10 questions will be summed, resulting in a value between 10 (a patient answering all questions with &quot;yes, limited a lot&quot;) and 30 (a patient answering all questions with &quot;No, not limited at all&quot;). The final sum of the individual scores will be standardized to a range of 0 to 100 using the following formula: 100*(sum-10)/20.

    <description>Change in PF-10 score was determined by taking into account the individual change of each patient between Visit 1 and Visit 2.

    <description>The treating physician used the Physician's Global Evaluation (PGE) to evaluate the general condition of the patient on an 8-point ordinal scale from 1 (very poor) to 8(excellent). PGE will be completed before and approx. 6 weeks after treatment initiation.

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Therapeutic Success After Approximately (Approx.) 6 Weeks After Baseline</title>
        <description>&quot;Therapeutic success&quot; is defined as a 10-point increase of physical functioning (PF)-10 between Visit 1 (baseline) and Visit 2 (approx. 6 weeks later) using a PF questionnaire, which is a subdomain of the Short form (SF)-36 patient questionnaire. The PF-10 sub-domain consists of 10 questions evaluating the extent of experienced restrictions while conducting usual activities. Each question of the PF-10 can be answered with &quot;yes, limited a lot&quot;, &quot;yes, limited a little&quot;, or &quot;No, not limited at all&quot;, with a score of 1, 2, or 3. The scores over the 10 questions will be summed, resulting in a value between 10 (a patient answering all questions with &quot;yes, limited a lot&quot;) and 30 (a patient answering all questions with &quot;No, not limited at all&quot;). The final sum of the individual scores will be standardized to a range of 0 to 100 using the following formula: 100*(sum-10)/20.
