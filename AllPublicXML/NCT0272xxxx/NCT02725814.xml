  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that babies in hospital undergo an average of 4 to 5 painful procedures,
      such as heel lances, every day. Sucrose (sugar water) has been shown to be effective for
      reducing babies' pain during painful procedures. Unfortunately, sucrose is not used as often
      as it could be to reduce babies' pain. This may be due to lack of certainty about the least
      effective amount of sucrose to use and concerns about the long-term effects of repeated use
      of sucrose on infant development. Factors within the hospital units where babies receive care
      may also influence caregivers' decisions to use sucrose. In this research the investigators
      will conduct two main studies. In the first study the investigators determined the lowest
      amount of sucrose needed to manage babies' pain effectively. In the second study the
      investigators will explore (a) if this amount of sucrose can manage pain when it is used
      repeatedly for all painful procedures while the baby is hospitalized and (b) whether
      consistent use of sucrose influences the development of babies when they are 18 and 36 months
      old. During the second study, the investigators will also examine the hospital units where
      the babies receive care. They will look at staff support for research, time and resources and
      other factors that promote and prevent sucrose use. The results of these studies will be used
      to determine the best management of babies' pain during painful procedures in hospitals to
      achieve the best outcomes.

    <description>Two minutes prior to the start of a painful procedure neonates will receive 0.12ml of 24% sucrose solution, over a period of no more than 1 minute. A pacifier will be offered immediately following sucrose administration for non-nutritive sucking if the infant is able to hold the pacifier securely. The sucrose study dose is to be repeated as needed based on pain response and procedure duration.</description>
