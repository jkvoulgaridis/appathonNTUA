  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single dose, open-label, three-treatment period crossover study in
      healthy participants to determine whether 2 test lots of 10-mg capsules that vary by the
      level of lenvatinib Type-C crystal are bioequivalent to a reference lot of 10-mg capsules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization
      Phase will have 2 periods: Screening and Baseline. The Randomization Phase will consist of
      three 6-day long Treatment Periods with each Treatment Period separated by a 1-day long
      Baseline. Sixty participants will be evenly randomized to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences
      (A, B, C, D, E, or F). The 3 treatments vary by the level of crystalline polymorph Type-C
      present in the drug product batch used in each arm, respectively: Treatment 1 - low Type-C
      crystal level less than 12%; Treatment 2 - reference Type-C crystal level 12% to 26%; and
      Treatment 3 - high Type-C crystal level greater than 26%.

    <description>Blood samples (6 mL each) were collected at the following time points for each Period: 0 (Predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose. The window for 0 to 12 hours was +/-2 minutes, for 24 hours was +/-5 minutes and for &gt;24 hours was equal to +/-15 to 60 minutes. Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology using a previously validated assay. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the assay was 0.25 ng/mL. AUC(0-t) was calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method. No concentration estimates were provided for missing sample values. Any sample with a missing value was treated as if the sample had not been scheduled for collection.</description>

AUC(0-t) was calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method. AUC(0-inf) was calculate as follows; (AUC(0-inf)) = (AUC(0-t)) + (Ct/Kel), where Ct is the last measurable drug concentration and Kel is the elimination rate constant. The apparent first-order Kel was estimated, when possible, from the slope of the regression line for the terminal ln-linear concentration-time values.</description>

    <description>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) (serious and non-serious); regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms, performance of physical examinations. A TEAE was defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline), or reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment but stopped before treatment, or worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. TEAEs considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug, or TEAEs with missing causality, were included.</description>

Participants in Sequence D were administered lenvatinib with 240 mL of water in the following sequence; Treatment 3 (high Crystal form Type-C level 38%), Treatment 2 (reference* Crystal form Type-C level 15%, *reference range determined from clinical batches), and Treatment 1 (low Crystal form Type-C level &lt;4%), on the morning of Days 1, 8, and 15 following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. No food was allowed for at least 4 hours postdose. Water was allowed ad libitum except for the period beginning 1 hour before and lasting until 1 hour after treatment. Treatments were administered at the same time on the 3 mornings. On dosing days, all participants observed identical schedules with respect to fasting before dosing and timing of postdose meals.</description>

        <description>Blood samples (6 mL each) were collected at the following time points for each Period: 0 (Predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose. The window for 0 to 12 hours was +/-2 minutes, for 24 hours was +/-5 minutes and for &gt;24 hours was equal to +/-15 to 60 minutes. Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were quantified by chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology using a previously validated assay. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the assay was 0.25 ng/mL. AUC(0-t) was calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method. No concentration estimates were provided for missing sample values. Any sample with a missing value was treated as if the sample had not been scheduled for collection.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Non-Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Lenvatinib</title>
        <description>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) (serious and non-serious); regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms, performance of physical examinations. A TEAE was defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline), or reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment but stopped before treatment, or worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. TEAEs considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug, or TEAEs with missing causality, were included.</description>
