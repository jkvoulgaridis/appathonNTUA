  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine if altered renal function affects the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of gepotidacin, which will inform if dosing recommendations based upon renal
      impairment are required. The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of
      gepotidacin administered as a 750 milligram (mg) intravenous (IV) dose in normal healthy
      subjects compared with subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and with
      subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD). This is a Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label,
      parallel-group, multi-center, multi-part study. In Part 1, up to 16 subjects with normal
      renal function will be matched to approximately 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment,
      and approximately 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and/or subjects with ESRD not on
      hemodialysis for a total of approximately 32 subjects. In Part 2 (optional), approximately 4
      to 8 subjects with normal renal function (if enrolled), approximately 4 to 8 subjects with
      mild renal impairment, and approximately 4 to 8 subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis will be
      enrolled for a total of approximately 12 to 24 subjects. The duration from Screening to the
      Follow-up Visit will be approximately 44 days for Part 1 and approximately 50 days for Part
      2.

    <description>Serial blood samples were collected at specified time-points for PK analysis. Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug.

        <description>Urine samples, from the participants were collected during the study. Ae total assessed the, total unchanged drug (total amount of drug excreted in urine), which was calculated, by adding all the fractions of drug gepotidacin collected, at the indicated time points. Urine samples were collected at pre-dose (0.0), 0 to 8 hours, 8 to 12 hours, 12 to 24 hours, 24 to 36 hours, and 36 to 48 hours post-dose during the single treatment period. Only those participant's available at the specified time points were analyzed. No formal statistical analysis of group comparison was planned for urine PK parameters.</description>

          <description>Renal clearance is the volume of plasma from which the drug is completely removed by the kidney in a given amount of time via renal clearance pathways, expressed as volume (Liter) per unit of time (hour). Urine samples were collected at pre-dose (0.0), 0 to 6 hours, 6 to 8 hours, 8 to 12 hours, 12 to 24 hours, 24 to 36 hours, and 36 to 48 hours post-dose in each of the two treatment periods. Only those participant's available at the specified time points were analyzed. No formal statistical analysis of group comparison was planned for urine PK parameters.</description>

        <description>Single 12-lead ECGs were obtained at each time point during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and corrected Q to T interval (QTc). The data for abnormal ECG recordings not clinically significant (NCS) and clinically significant (CS), have been reported at specific time points during the study. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). NA indicates data was not available</description>

        <description>Vital signs were measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The data for change from Baseline values for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was reported. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline, was defined as post Baseline values minus the values at Baseline.</description>

        <description>Vital signs were measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The data for change from Baseline values for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was reported. Change from Baseline, was defined as post Baseline values minus the values at Baseline. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

These participants, during treatment period 1 on Day 1 and treatment period 2 on Day 8, received a single dose of study drug gepotidacin 750 milligram, administered as a 2-hour infusion starting approximately 2 hours before the initiation of the last hemodialysis session of the week (Period 1) and gepotidacin 750 milligram, administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion starting within 2 hours after completion of the last hemodialysis session of the week (treatment period 2).</description>
