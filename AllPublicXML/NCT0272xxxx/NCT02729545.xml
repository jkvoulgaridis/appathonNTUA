  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety in improving ovarian function of polycystic
      ovarian syndrome in adults. Half of patients will receive Tung's acupuncture therapy, while
      the other half will receive Diane-35(CPA/EE) as the control group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both Tung's acupuncture therapy and Diane-35(CPA/EE) could improve the symptom of patients
      with polycystic ovarian syndrome, but until now there is no definite evidence to indicate
      acupuncture could play the same role in improving ovarian function. So we design this study
      to observe the change of follicular development, ovary size and sex hormone( testosterone,
      follitropin, luteinizing hormone) before and after the treatment, and evaluate the efficacy
      and safty of acupuncture.
