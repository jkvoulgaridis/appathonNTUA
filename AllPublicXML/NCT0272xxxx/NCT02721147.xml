  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central goal of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      efficacy of the IE intervention on patient and partner sexual QOL and relationship outcomes,
      and on patient psychosocial outcomes. We expect that the IE will show adequate feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Secondarily, based on the rationale that barriers
      exist that limit participation in intensive sexual QOL interventions for breast cancer
      survivors, an innovative secondary aim will investigate the perspectives of study-eligible
      patient candidates who opt out of participating in the pilot trial. We expect that we will be
      able to identify the participation barriers and intervention preferences of breast cancer
      survivors with sexual concerns who opt out of the intensive trial in order to inform the
      development of different interventions for future study.

    <measure>Acceptability Measured Using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability was measured through the median score on a validated acceptability measure. Item responses run on a scale of 1 to 4, with a total score range of 8-32. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with the service (acceptability). A median score of 28 or higher is considered acceptable. This measure was collected for both patients and partners.</description>
