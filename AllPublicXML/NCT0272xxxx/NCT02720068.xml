  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and pharmacokinetics study of MK-4280 as monotherapy and in combination with
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) AND MK-4280A as monotherapy in adults with metastatic solid tumors
      for which there is no available therapy which may convey clinical benefit. Part A of this
      study is a dose escalation design in which participants receive MK-4280 as monotherapy or
      MK-4280 in combination with pembrolizumab. Part B is a dose confirmation design to estimate
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD), as determined by dose-limiting toxicity, for MK-4280 in
      combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors. Part B will also
      assess the efficacy of MK-4280 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab with and
      without chemotherapy AND MK-4280A as monotherapy in expansion cohorts.

          -  Part A and Part B: Has histologically or cytologically-confirmed metastatic solid
             tumor.

          -  Has measurable disease by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (irRECIST) 1.1 criteria.

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function

          -  If female of child-bearing potential, is willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  If male with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential, must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through
             120 days after the last dose of study drug. Males with pregnant partners must agree to
             use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant
             partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had chemotherapy, radiation or biological cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             the first dose of study drug, or has not recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 0 or 1 from the AEs due to cancer therapeutics
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier (this includes participants with previous
             immunomodulatory therapy with residual immune-related [ir]AEs).

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Has received previous treatment with another agent targeting the lymphocyte-activation
             gene 3 (LAG-3) receptor.

          -  Has received previous treatment with an immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. anti-programmed
             cell death-1/anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1] or cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA 4] agent) and was discontinued from that
             therapy due to a Grade 3 or higher irAE.

          -  Is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             in excess of replacement doses, or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication.

             skin, superficial bladder cancer or in situ cervical cancer, or other in situ cancers.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

          -  Has had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal
             antibody.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.

          -  Has an active infection requiring therapy.

          -  Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Has had a prior stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

          -  Has a known history of or screens positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
             active chronic or acute Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the study.

          -  Is a regular user as determined by investigator judgment (including &quot;recreational
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or has a recent history (within the last year) of substance
             abuse (including alcohol), at the time of signing informed consent.

          -  Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A participant who is clinically stable
             following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thoraco- or
             paracentesis) is eligible.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Has clinically significant heart disease that affects normal activities.

          -  Has had major surgery in the past 4 weeks.

          -  Has received a live-virus vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug.
             Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.
