  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide works in treating patients with prostate
      cancer who are in active surveillance. Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer
      cells. Hormone therapy using androgen receptor antagonist apalutamide may fight prostate
      cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 90 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 180, 365, 545, and 730
      days; and at years 3, 4 and 5 by medical record review.
