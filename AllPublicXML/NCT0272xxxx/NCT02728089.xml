  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-site, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of MK-7625A 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) for the treatment of
      complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including pyelonephritis (uncomplicated or
      complicated pyelonephritis and complicated lower urinary tract infection) in Japanese
      participants. Efficacy will be primarily assessed by microbiological response defined as
      eradication of the baseline pathogen or pathogens.

    <description>The per-pathogen microbiological outcome was determined for each uropathogen isolated at baseline at TOC (14 days post first dose). Microbiological outcome was classified as &quot;eradication&quot;, &quot;persistence&quot; or &quot;indeterminate.&quot; A successful microbiological response was &quot;eradication&quot; which was defined as urine culture showed all uropathogens found at baseline at ≥10^5 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL were reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL.
