  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of volasertib in two dosing schedules of
      intravenous volasertib as monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after hypomethylating agents (HMA) treatment failure.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in the First Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>First treatment cycle, up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) considered to be related to study drug: 1. Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4.03 ≥Grade 3 drug related non- haematological toxicity, excluding; ≥Grade 3 untreated nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Any laboratory abnormality - not considered clinically significant by investigator or resolved spontaneously or could have been recovered with appropriate treatment within 7 days. Grade 3 infection which could be recovered with appropriate treatment within 7 days. Azacitidine injection site reaction or complications related to azacitidine injection. 2. Febrile neutropenia as defined by CTCAE which could not recovered with appropriate treatment within 7 days. 3. Inability to deliver full dose of volasertib according to the assigned dose level within Cycle 1 due to drug-related AEs. 4. Haematological DLTs. 5. Any other drug-related AEs that resulted in the delay of starting new treatment cycle for ≥4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Volasertib</measure>
    <time_frame>First treatment cycle, up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose with less than 35% risk of the true dose limiting toxicities (DLT) rate being above 0.33 for schedule A, and the highest dose with less than 40% risk of the true DLT rate being above 0.33 for schedule B. The phase I dose-finding was to be guided by a Bayesian 2-parameter logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose control in each schedule separately.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Defined as Best Overall Response of Complete Remission, Partial Remission or Haematological Improvement According to the International Working Group 2006 Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response defined as best overall response of complete remission, partial remission or haematological improvement according to the International Working Group 2006 criteria. It is based on Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow: &lt;=5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, Peripheral blood: Hemoglobin &gt;=11 Grams Per Decilitre (g/dL), Platelets &gt;=100 x 109/L, Neutrophils &gt;=1.0 x 109/L, Blasts 0%. Peripheral blood responses had to last at least 4 weeks to qualify for CR. Partial remission (PR): All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except: Bone marrow blasts decreased by &gt;=50% to baseline but still &gt;5%, Cellularity and morphology not relevant. Peripheral blood responses must last at least 4 weeks to qualify for PR. Haematological improvement (HI): HI was evaluated in patients with abnormal pretreatment values based on Erythroid response, Platelet response, Neutrophil response. Peripheral blood responses had to last at least 8 weeks to qualify for HI.</description>

          <description>DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) considered to be related to study drug: 1. Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4.03 ≥Grade 3 drug related non- haematological toxicity, excluding; ≥Grade 3 untreated nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Any laboratory abnormality - not considered clinically significant by investigator or resolved spontaneously or could have been recovered with appropriate treatment within 7 days. Grade 3 infection which could be recovered with appropriate treatment within 7 days. Azacitidine injection site reaction or complications related to azacitidine injection. 2. Febrile neutropenia as defined by CTCAE which could not recovered with appropriate treatment within 7 days. 3. Inability to deliver full dose of volasertib according to the assigned dose level within Cycle 1 due to drug-related AEs. 4. Haematological DLTs. 5. Any other drug-related AEs that resulted in the delay of starting new treatment cycle for ≥4 weeks.</description>
