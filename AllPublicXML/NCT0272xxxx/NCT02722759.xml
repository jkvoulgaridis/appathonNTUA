      In this prospective study different methods of haemoglobin measurement in term and preterm
      neonates are compared with the gold standard. Non-invasive haemoglobin measurement with the
      Radical-7® (SpHb, Masimo®), point-of-care haemoglobin-measurement (HcHb, HemoCue@,
      Radiometer), blood-gas-analysis (BGAHb,ABL800®, Radiometer) are compared with haemoglobin
      measurement by an automated hematology analyzer (labHb, Siemens Advia®).

      Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit or to a normal neonatal ward are enrolled
      in the study, if parents have given their written informed consent. Non-invasive SpHb
      measurements are recorded prior to routine venous sampling. Routine venous sampling includes
      labHb and BGAHb. Additionally HcHb is taken from the routine venous sampling (HcHbart/ven)
      and from an additionally capillary puncture of earlobe or heel (HcHbcap). Every neonate can
      participate in two measurements.

    <description>In this arm hemoglobin measurement is done by four different devices
device &quot;Radical-7&quot; for non-invasive measurement of SpHb
device &quot;HemoCue&quot; for taking capillary and venous blood for measurement of HcHb
device &quot;ABL 800&quot; for measurement of BGAHb
device &quot;Siemens ADVIA&quot; for measurement of labHb
For measurement of haemoglobin by the devices the following interventions have to be done:
venous or arterial puncture (routine)
capillary puncture
placing of the &quot;Radical 7&quot; sensor</description>
