      The purpose of this observational study is to investigate the treatment of complaints
      following sports injuries with Traditional Chinese Medicine by therapists in Switzerland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland, still very little is known about the treatment with TCM (acupuncture, Chinese
      medicinal therapy, Tuina massage, nutrition, qigong) under everyday conditions. The
      importance of non-medical therapists in the healthcare system is rarely investigated. It is
      likely that patients with chronic injuries use several therapies (including conventional
      medicine) in a pragmatic way. They may apply TCM either due to primary preference or because
      other forms of therapy fail to produce satisfactory results.

      There is evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews that acupuncture
      can be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic back pain, chronic shoulder pain and
      ankle sprains.

      Randomized controlled trials usually investigate a single TCM method, in which therapists or
      physicians are limited in the selection of acupuncture points or herbal formulas. This does
      not reflect the complex practice, where several TCM methods and auxiliary techniques are
      combined.

      The investigators aim to investigate in a prospective observational study how complaints
      following sports injuries are treated by non-medical TCM therapists in Switzerland under
      everyday conditions.
