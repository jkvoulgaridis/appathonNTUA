  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to modify the HITSystem to engage and retain HIV+ pregnant women
      before, during and after delivery and evaluate the HITSystem impact on prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) related behaviors and outcomes. HITSystem 2.0
      intervention will support a range of PMTCT outcomes including retention in care, ART
      adherence, and integration of maternal and pediatric HIV services in low-resource settings.

      The study will be conducted in three phases:

      Phases 1: The researchers will conduct formative research (focus groups and interviews) with
      HIV+ pregnant women and PMTCT providers to customize communication strategies for text
      messaging and inform patient flow and optimal implementation across the various PMTCT-related
      services at the intervention site.

      Phase 2: The researchers will design and refine the HITSystem 2.0 technical components to
      support PMTCT outcomes guided by clinical content experts, technology analysts, and findings
      from Phase 1.

      Phase 3: The researchers will implement HITSystem 2.0 at one hospital over an 18 month
      period, and compare targeted PMTCT outcomes to those at a matched control hospital.

      The study will be conducted at two government hospitals in Kenya. HIV+ pregnant women will be
      enrolled in the HITSystem 2.0 at Kapsabet Hospital. HIV+ pregnant women receiving the current
      standard of PMTCT care at Nandi Hills Hospital will be the comparison group.

    <time_frame>first PMTCT visit during pregnancy to the return of the infant's first HIV DNA PCR test result by 12 weeks postnatal</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is retention (complete or incomplete), measured from first PMTCT appointment until HIV status determination of the HIV-exposed infant at 12 weeks postnatal. This aggregate outcome includes completion of several intermediate outcomes throughout the PMTCT cascade of care, including: ART initiation (if not already on ART at time of pregnancy) (Yes/No), attendance at PMTCT appointments (Yes/No), a hospital delivery (Yes/No), infant enrollment in EID prior to hospital discharge (Yes/No), infant blood sample collected and HIV DNA PCR test result obtained (Yes/No). Complete retention requires completion of all of these steps.</description>

    <description>The HITsystem 2.0 intervention will be designed to: (1) utilize electronic prompts to notify providers and program managers when actions are required, and (2) send text messages to women's mobile phones to (a) motivate adherence to medication, (b) remind women of antenatal (ANC) appointments and medication refills, (c) prompt preparation for a hospital delivery, and (d) support early infant testing. Given advancements in the approach and protocols for care, HITSystem 2.0 will continue to engage mothers and encourage postnatal medication adherence. The researchers will design HITSystem 2.0 to integrate seamlessly into the existing HITSystem to link PMTCT and early infant diagnosis (EID) services through one coordinated system-level intervention.</description>
