  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although cochlear implants can restore hearing to individuals who have lost cochlear hair
      cell function, there is no adequately effective treatment for individuals suffering chronic
      imbalance, postural instability and unsteady vision due to loss of vestibular hair cell
      function. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the vestibular
      nerve via a chronically implanted multichannel vestibular prosthesis can partially restore
      vestibular reflexes that maintain steady posture and vision. This pilot clinical feasibility
      study of a multichannel vestibular implant system will evaluate this approach in up to ten
      human subjects with bilateral vestibular deficiency due to gentamicin ototoxicity or other
      causes of inner ear dysfunction.

      The system used in this study is the (MVI)™ Multichannel Vestibular Implant System produced
      by Labyrinth Devices, LLC. It is similar to commercially available cochlear implants in that
      it includes an implanted stimulator powered and controlled by an external unit, which
      communicate with the implant across the skin via an inductive link. Unlike a cochlear
      implant, the implanted stimulator's electrode array is designed for implantation near the
      ends of the vestibular nerve. The implanted stimulator also includes additional magnets to
      help facilitate retention of the external unit on the scalp over the implant. The external
      unit includes a head-worn unit (for sensing head motion and delivering power and signals to
      the implanted stimulator) and a power and control unit containing a battery and
      microprocessor. Participants in this trial who meet candidacy criteria and who choose to
      proceed with implantation surgery, device activation and device deactivation will be asked to
      participate in a series of post-operative monitoring visits over a ≥1 year period.

          1. Adults age 22.0-90 with bilateral vestibular deficiency not responsive to vestibular
             rehabilitation as determined by pre-inclusion history, vestibular testing and clinical
             examination

          2. Hearing status: (1) Hearing in the candidate ear for implantation is equivalent to or
             worse than that in the contralateral ear; and (2) hearing in the contralateral ear is
             good enough to allow functional communication in case hearing in the implanted ear is
             lost after implantation. Specifically, the contralateral ear must satisfy all of the
             following criteria:

               1. 0.5/1/2/4 kHz pure-tone-average threshold (PTA) hearing better than (i.e., less

               2. ear-specific sentence recognition score using the recorded AzBio Sentence Test
                  presented at 60 dB SPL-A in quiet must be &gt;60% when tested under either the
                  unaided condition or, if 0.5/1/2/4 kHz PTA&gt;50 dB, the best-aided condition; and

               3. ear-specific word recognition score using the recorded
                  Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) Word Recognition Test presented at 60 dBHL in

             responses to warm and cool supine caloric stimuli totaling &lt;10°/sec per ear for each
             of both ears; (b) summed speed of ice water caloric responses during supine and prone
             head orientation tests totaling &lt;10°/sec per ear for each of both ears; or (c) speed
             of ice water caloric responses during supine head orientation tests &lt;5°/sec per ear

             surgical access to each semicircular canal, skull thickness ≥3 mm at the planned well
             site, and scalp soft tissue thickness ≤7 mm. This criterion may be satisfied without

          3. Diagnosis of acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannoma, chronic middle ear disease,
             cholesteatoma, or central nervous system causes of vestibulo-ocular reflex
