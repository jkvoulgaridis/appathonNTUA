      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the injectable drug
      cabotegravir (CAB LA), for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-uninfected cisgender men
      and transgender women who have sex with men (MSM and TGW).

      This study will enroll HIV-uninfected MSM and TGW at risk for acquiring HIV infection.
      Participants will be followed for a total of 4 years.

      This study will take place in three steps. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      two arms:

      Arm A:

      Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB tablets and daily oral TDF/FTC placebo
      tablets for 5 weeks.

      Step 2: Participants will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of CAB LA at two time
      points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter and daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablets to
      Week 153.

      Arm B:

      Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets and daily oral CAB placebo
      tablets for 5 weeks.

      Step 2: Participants will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets and an IM injection of placebo
      at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter to Week 153.

      In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablets starting
      at Week 153 (last day of Step 2)/Day 0 (first day of Step 3) and continue for 48 weeks.

      Participants will attend up to 47 study visits throughout the study. Visits may include
      physical examinations, blood collection, urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and
      rectal swab collection. Some participants may have a bone mineral density-energy x-ray
      absorptimetry (DXA) scan at select visits.

      All participants will be transitioned to locally available HIV prevention services, including
      services for PrEP, if available, at the end of their participation in the study.

      HPTN 083-01 is a sub-study of HPTN 083. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and acceptability of CAB LA for the prevention of HIV among adolescent males.
      Participants will receive oral CAB for 5 weeks, followed by 29 weeks on CAB LA, then
      quarterly visits for 48 weeks after final injection. All participants who have received at
      least one injection will be followed for 48 weeks after their last injection. Total study
      duration per participant will be approximately 21 months.

      HPTN 083-02 is a qualitative sub-study of participants enrolled in HPTN 083. The purpose of
      this study is to explore potential barriers, facilitators, and potentially modifiable issues
      related to adherence to clinic visits in the context of injectable PrEP; to learn about
      preferences and decision making regarding the use of oral versus injectable PrEP, or other
      biomedical prevention products; and to gather explanatory qualitative data regarding
      participants' experiences in HPTN 083 to better interpret study results and guide next
      prevention strategies. Participants in this sub-study will complete one individual
      semi-structured qualitative interview.

          -  Active or recent use of any illicit intravenous drugs (&quot;recent&quot; defined as in the 90
             days prior to enrollment)

          -  Co-enrollment in any other interventional research study or other concurrent studies
             that may interfere with this study (as provided by self-report or other available
             documentation. Exceptions may be made if appropriate after consultation with the CMC.)

          -  Past or current participation in HIV vaccine trial. An exception will be made for

             as of Version 1.0 of HPTN 083.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, as defined by history/evidence of
             symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
             surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or any clinically
             significant cardiac disease

          -  Inflammatory skin conditions that compromise the safety of intramuscular (IM)
             injections, per the discretion of the Investigator of Record. Mild skin conditions may
             not be exclusionary at the discretion of the Investigator of Record (IoR) or designee
             in consultation with the CMC

          -  Has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the buttock region which in
             the opinion of the IoR or designee, in consultation with the CMC, may interfere with

             steatohepatitis) or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, or cholecystectomy)

          -  Coagulopathy (primary or iatrogenic) which would contraindicate IM injection
             (concomitant anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy use should be discussed with the
             CMC)

          -  Active or planned use of prohibited medications as described in the Investigator's
             Brochure or listed in the Study Specific Procedures (SSP) Manual (provided by
             self-report, or obtained from medical history or medical records). In particular,
             future use of TDF/FTC at any point during the study.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to study product components (active or placebo), including
             egg or soy products (egg and soy products are contained in Intralipid)

          -  Surgically-placed or injected buttock implants or fillers, per self-report. Contact
             the CMC for guidance regarding questions about individual cases.

          -  Alcohol or substance use that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would
             jeopardize the safety of the participant on study (e.g., provided by self-report, or
             found upon medical history and examination or in available medical records).
