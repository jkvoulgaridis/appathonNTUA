    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single visit extension study is to explore immune status in RRMS patients
      treated for at least 48 months with fingolimod. Long-term changes in T cell counts will be
      compared to short-term changes in immune status (baseline to month 6) after treatment start
      with fingolimod as assessed in the original Biobank study (CFTY720DDE01).

    <measure>Change in T Cells Status (Decrease or Increase) at Month 48 (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aim of trial was to was to show reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells (CCR7+CD45RA+), central memory T cells (CCR7+CD45RA-), central memory Th17 cells (CD4+ CCR4+ and CCR6+), and an elevation of 2 types of effector memory T cells TEM (CCR7- CD45RA-) and TEMRA (CCR7- CD45RA+) in peripheral venous blood. Changes from baseline to month 48 in biomarkers were analyzed for all patients in the FAS.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disability Progression as Measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It is a two-part system including
(1) a series of scores in each of eight functional systems, and (2) the EDSS steps (ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The definition of disability progression was based on increases in EDSS from baseline and depended on the EDSS baseline value: Disability progression was defined as a 1.5 increase in EDSS from baseline in subjects with a baseline EDSS score between 0.0 and 0.5, as a 1.0 increase in EDSS from baseline in subjects with a baseline EDSS score between 1.0 and 5.0 inclusive and 0.5 increase from baseline in subjects with EDSS score &gt; 5.0.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disability Progression as Measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (FAS)</title>
        <description>EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It is a two-part system including
(1) a series of scores in each of eight functional systems, and (2) the EDSS steps (ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The definition of disability progression was based on increases in EDSS from baseline and depended on the EDSS baseline value: Disability progression was defined as a 1.5 increase in EDSS from baseline in subjects with a baseline EDSS score between 0.0 and 0.5, as a 1.0 increase in EDSS from baseline in subjects with a baseline EDSS score between 1.0 and 5.0 inclusive and 0.5 increase from baseline in subjects with EDSS score &gt; 5.0.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Disability Progression Assessed With the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at Month 6 and Month 48 (FAS)</title>
          <description>EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It is a two-part system including
(1) a series of scores in each of eight functional systems, and (2) the EDSS steps (ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The definition of disability progression was based on increases in EDSS from baseline and depended on the EDSS baseline value: Disability progression was defined as a 1.5 increase in EDSS from baseline in subjects with a baseline EDSS score between 0.0 and 0.5, as a 1.0 increase in EDSS from baseline in subjects with a baseline EDSS score between 1.0 and 5.0 inclusive and 0.5 increase from baseline in subjects with EDSS score &gt; 5.0.</description>
