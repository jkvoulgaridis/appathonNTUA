  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects of using ramucirumab along
      with the usual trastuzumab and chemotherapy to using the usual chemotherapy and trastuzumab
      alone.

             and/or amplification as determined by next generation sequencing assay,
             immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH+ is defined
             as HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0). MSKCC confirmation of HER2 status is not mandatory prior
             to enrollment and treatment on study. For patients with outside HER2 testing, if
             sufficient tissue is available HER2 testing will be repeated at MSKCC for purpose of
             analysis and will not impact the patient's eligibility.

             clearance ≥60 mL/minute using the Cockcroft-Gaul formula or equivalent method.

             is &gt;2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate &lt;2g of protein in 24
             hours to allow participation in this protocol).

          -  The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International
             Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds
