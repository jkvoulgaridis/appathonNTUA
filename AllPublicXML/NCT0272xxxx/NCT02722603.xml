  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of gabapentin relative to tramadol for the
      treatment of chronic, neuropathic or mixed pain in the paediatric population. Children from 3
      months to less than 18 years of age experiencing moderate to severe chronic pain will receive
      either gabapentin or tramadol for 15 weeks. The difference in average pain scores between
      treatment arms at the end of the treatment period will be assessed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. In the
      absence of specific paediatric studies, it is not approved for the same condition in
      children.

      The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by a) the lack of a suitable paediatric
      formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin pharmacokinetics profile and c)
      efficacy and safety data in this specific population.

      The GABA-1 study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of gabapentin oral solution relative
      to tramadol and to document the Pharmacokinetic and safety profile of gabapentin in this
      indication.

      GABA-1 is a non-inferiority trial because gabapentin is expected to be equally effective but
      better tolerated than tramadol, thus providing a clinical benefit to affected children.
