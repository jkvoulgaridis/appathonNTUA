  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Phase II, multicenter trial of vaccination with Dendritic
      cell/myeloma fusions with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) adjuvant
      plus lenalidomide maintenance therapy versus maintenance therapy alone or with GM-CSF
      following autologous transplant as part of upfront treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). It is
      hypothesized that the dendritic cell myeloma vaccine will result in improved response in
      patients with multiple myeloma after autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three-arm, phase II randomized, open-labeled clinical trial that randomizes
      patients to vaccination with Dendritic Cell (DC)/myeloma fusions/GM-CSF plus lenalidomide
      maintenance therapy or lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or without GM-CSF following
      autologous transplant as part of upfront treatment for patients diagnosed with multiple
      myeloma. Patients are randomized approximately 2 months post transplant and will begin
      maintenance lenalidomide between day 90 and 100. The primary objective of this randomized
      trial is to compare the proportion of patients alive and in complete response (defined as CR
      or sCR) at one year post transplant between patients receiving DC/myeloma vaccine/GM-CSF with
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy to those receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or
      without GM-CSF.
