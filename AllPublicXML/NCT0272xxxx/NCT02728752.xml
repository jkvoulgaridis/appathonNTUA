    <description>Subjects eligible after screening, randomized to placebo arm, will receive 4 infusions of placebo every 4 weeks during the First Period (16 weeks). In case of deterioration at or after Week 6, subjects will be crossed-over to the alternate treatment, and will not drop-out before the primary endpoint assessment at Week 16 to keep the blind unless they deteriorate also on the alternate IMP after starting it at least 6 weeks before. After response assessment at Week 16, patients will be unblinded. From Week 16 onwards, all subjects, except subjects randomized to Octagam 10% who deteriorate in the First Period and who will drop-out, will enter the open-label Extension Period. In the Extension Period they will receive six infusions of 2.0 g/kg Octagam 10% every 4 weeks (± 4 days). At Week 28, subjects who are stable on 2.0 g/kg Octagam 10% can be switched to 1.0 g/kg Octagam 10%, at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
