      This trail is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of high dose Iconitib combined with
      SRS for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation with brain metastases.

    <textblock>
      The long-term control of brain metastases becomes a clinical challenge. Whole brain
      radiotherapy, the standard treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases, can only
      bring a modest survival improvement around 3-6 months. EGFR-TKIs like icotinib with its
      proven activity in non-small cell lung cancer may provide clinical benefits to brain
      metastases patients.

          -  Have one or more measurable encephalic lesions according to RECIST.

          -  The patient has not received radiotherapy for the head or extracranial target lesions
             before.

          -  Adequate hematological function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L, and
             Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L.

          -  Adequate liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and
             Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN in the
             absence of liver metastases, or &lt; 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases.

          -  Female subjects should not be pregnant.

             procedures, and able to receive oral medications.

          -  Written informed consent provided.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous usage of EGFR-TKI or antibody to EGFR: gefitinib, erlotinib, herceptin,

             judgment of the investigator, may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and
             follow-up, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from
             treatment-related complications.
