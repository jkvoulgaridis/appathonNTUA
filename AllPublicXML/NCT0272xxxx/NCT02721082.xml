  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact and efficacy of a new approach to
      smoking cessation treatment versus the traditional approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many health conditions, the default treatment approach is to first identify the health
      condition and then begin treatment. In this scenario, the physician discusses treatment
      options with the patient. The patient is free to decline treatment as they wish. If patients
      do nothing though, they will receive care.

      For tobacco users, the default treatment is for them to &quot;opt in&quot; to receive smoking cessation
      assistance. The provider asks the smoker if they are ready to quit, and they offer medication
      and support only to those who respond back &quot;yes&quot;. This limits the amount of smokers that
      receive treatment because only 1 in 3 smokers say they are ready to quit.

      This study is looking at a novel approach to smoking cessation treatment. This study will
      compare the traditional, &quot;standard of care&quot; approach to opting in against a new approach
      where all smokers are provided with cessation medication and counseling unless they refuse
      it.
