  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are seeking to determine the effects of CBT, anodal tDCS over left DLPFC, and
      combined CBT+ tDCS on clinical pain and functioning among a sample of patients with
      fibromyalgia. This study will be the first randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tDCS
      technology as an adjunctive pain management strategy for fibromyalgia pain. Data from this
      trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS+CBT as a
      chronic pain-management approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with fibromyalgia will complete questionnaires, six cognitive behavioral therapy
      sessions, quantitative sensory testing before and after the six therapy sessions, and undergo
      30 minutes of tDCS during each of the six therapy sessions.

    <measure>Baseline Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Before treatment, Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) will be completed for all participants. The QST involves a comprehensive laboratory pain assessment including heat stimuli using a Pathway Thermo-sensory Analyzer System which is specifically designed for assessing laboratory pain testing. The QST collects the temperature in celsius of when the participant first begins to feel the stimuli (Sensory), starts to feel pain (average pain threshold), and when the participant can no longer tolerate the stimuli (Tolerance). The temperature ranges from 37 degrees celsius to 50 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature on the scale is 37 degrees celsius and the maximum temperature on the scale is 50 degrees celsius. Average pain threshold: A lower temperature represents a lower pain threshold and a higher temperature represents a higher pain threshold. Tolerance: A lower temperature represents a lower pain tolerance and a higher temperature represents a higher pain tolerance.</description>

    <measure>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be used for screening purposes to characterize depression in each participant at baseline. The BDI is a 21 item participant rated inventory that evaluates depression symptoms, cognition, and physical symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex. The BDI scale also assesses suicidal ideation, those patients exhibiting suicidal ideations will be referenced to a therapist in order to further manage their depressive symptoms. The Total score range is 0 to 63; higher score indicates more depression. Individual items are scored on a 4 point scale (0 to 3), with 0=none/absent and 3=most severe.</description>

        <title>Baseline Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)</title>
        <description>Before treatment, Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) will be completed for all participants. The QST involves a comprehensive laboratory pain assessment including heat stimuli using a Pathway Thermo-sensory Analyzer System which is specifically designed for assessing laboratory pain testing. The QST collects the temperature in celsius of when the participant first begins to feel the stimuli (Sensory), starts to feel pain (average pain threshold), and when the participant can no longer tolerate the stimuli (Tolerance). The temperature ranges from 37 degrees celsius to 50 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature on the scale is 37 degrees celsius and the maximum temperature on the scale is 50 degrees celsius. Average pain threshold: A lower temperature represents a lower pain threshold and a higher temperature represents a higher pain threshold. Tolerance: A lower temperature represents a lower pain tolerance and a higher temperature represents a higher pain tolerance.</description>

        <title>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be used for screening purposes to characterize depression in each participant at baseline. The BDI is a 21 item participant rated inventory that evaluates depression symptoms, cognition, and physical symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex. The BDI scale also assesses suicidal ideation, those patients exhibiting suicidal ideations will be referenced to a therapist in order to further manage their depressive symptoms. The Total score range is 0 to 63; higher score indicates more depression. Individual items are scored on a 4 point scale (0 to 3), with 0=none/absent and 3=most severe.</description>

        <title>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a well-researched, brief self-report anxiety-screening instrument that assesses different aspects of anxiety experience (e.g., physiological, cognitive, behavioral). It was designed to measure participant's level of anxiety. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 63. Low scores are associated with low levels of anxiety, while high scores are associated with high levels of anxiety.</description>

        <description>To assess each participant's average pain at baseline, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-short form will be administered. The BPI rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning and has been widely used in both research and clinical settings. Participants rate their average pain in the past 24 hours using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, where 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain.</description>

The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller, 1996). The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>

        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be used for screening purposes to characterize depression in each participant at the one month follow up visit. The BDI is a 21 item participant rated inventory that evaluates depression symptoms, cognition, and physical symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex. The BDI scale also assesses suicidal ideation, those patients exhibiting suicidal ideations will be referenced to a therapist in order to further manage their depressive symptoms. The Total score range is 0 to 63; higher score indicates more depression. Individual items are scored on a 4 point scale (0 to 3), with 0=none/absent and 3=most severe.</description>

        <title>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) at 3 Month Follow Up</title>
        <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a well-researched, brief self-report anxiety-screening instrument that assesses different aspects of anxiety experience (e.g., physiological, cognitive, behavioral). It was designed to measure participant's level of anxiety. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 63. Low scores are associated with low levels of anxiety, while high scores are associated with high levels of anxiety.</description>

        <description>At the one month follow up visit, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-short form will be administered to assess each participant's pain on average in the past 30 days. The BPI rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning and has been widely used in both research and clinical settings. Participants rate their pain on average in the past 30 days using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, where 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain.</description>

        <description>To assess each participant's mental and physical functioning at the 1 Month Follow Up visit, The Short-Form 12 Healthy Survey (SF-12) will be administered. The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller, 1996). The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>

          <description>To assess each participant's mental and physical functioning at the 1 Month Follow Up visit, The Short-Form 12 Healthy Survey (SF-12) will be administered. The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller, 1996). The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>

        <title>The Fibromyalgia (FM) Impact Questionnaire at 1 Month Follow Up</title>
        <description>To assess the impact of fibromyalgia on each participant's function at the 1 Month Follow Up visit, The Fibromyalgia (FM) Impact Questionnaire will be administered. The FM assesses the following symptoms; physical Impairment, well-being, pain, fatigue, rested, stiffness, anxiety, and depression within the past 24 hours. Each symptom scale ranges from 0 to 10. For example, 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain, 0=not fatigued and 10=extremely fatigued. The final score is the total score which ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate greater impact of fibromyalgia on functioning.</description>

        <title>Post Baseline Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)</title>
        <description>After treatment, Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) will be completed for all participants. The QST involves a comprehensive laboratory pain assessment including heat stimuli using a Pathway Thermo-sensory Analyzer System which is specifically designed for assessing laboratory pain testing. The QST collects the temperature in celsius of when the participant first begins to feel the stimuli (Sensory), starts to feel pain (average pain threshold), and when the participant can no longer tolerate the stimuli (Tolerance). The temperature ranges from 37 degrees celsius to 50 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature on the scale is 37 degrees celsius and the maximum temperature on the scale is 50 degrees celsius. Average pain threshold: A lower temperature represents a lower pain threshold and a higher temperature represents a higher pain threshold. Tolerance: A lower temperature represents a lower pain tolerance and a higher temperature represents a higher pain tolerance.</description>
