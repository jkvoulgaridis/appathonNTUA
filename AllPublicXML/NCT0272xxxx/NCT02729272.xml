    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the degree of surgical smoke obstructing
      vision and thermal damage caused by two different ESDs (ultrasonic versus monopolar ESD) in
      colpotomy during total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to previous studies performed in porcine and bovine tissues, ultrasonic energy
      based surgical devices (ESDs) created less surgical smoke, involved less visual obstruction,
      and produced less lateral thermal damage than monopolar ESDs. However, there was no study
      comparing ultrasonic ESD and monopolar ESD in laparoscopic colpotomy in terms of surgical
      smoke and lateral thermal damage. Therefore, the aim of this randomized trial was to compare
      the degree of surgical smoke obstructing vision and thermal damage caused by two different
      ESDs (ultrasonic versus monopolar ESD) in colpotomy during total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

    <description>The degree of surgical smoke obstructing laparoscopic view was assessed by an independent, blinded, gynecologic surgeon who reviewed videotapes of each patient's laparoscopic colpotomy procedure using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very clear; 2 = quite clear; 3 =somewhat smoky; 4 = quite smoky; and 5 = extremely smoky), and a higher score indicates a worse visuality</description>
