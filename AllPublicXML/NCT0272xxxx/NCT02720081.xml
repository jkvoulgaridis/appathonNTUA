  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of adding
      MK-1029 to montelukast in adults with persistent asthma that is uncontrolled while receiving
      montelukast alone. Participants will have a specific genetic marker for clinical efficacy of
      MK-1029. The primary hypothesis is that when added to montelukast, treatment with MK-1029 is
      superior to placebo, as demonstrated by an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second
      (FEV1), measured as the average change from baseline at the end of Week 4 and Week 6 of
      treatment.

    <description>A day with worsening asthma was defined as any day during which any of the following occurred: a decrease from baseline in morning (AM) peak expiratory flow (PEF) of more than 20%; AM PEF less than 180 liters/minute (L/min); an increase in Î²-agonist use of more than 70% (and a minimum increase of at least 2 puffs); an increase from baseline in daytime asthma symptom score of more than 50%; overnight asthma symptom of: Awake &quot;all night&quot;; an asthma attack, as defined by any day when one or more of the following events due to asthma has occurred: corticosteroid use (systemic); unscheduled visit to the doctor or urgent care clinic; unscheduled visit to the emergency department; and/or hospitalization. Participants needed at least 80% of days with a complete diary during Weeks 3 to 6. A diary is considered complete if none of the above 6 components used to determine asthma worsening are missing.</description>

        <description>A day with worsening asthma was defined as any day during which any of the following occurred: a decrease from baseline in morning (AM) peak expiratory flow (PEF) of more than 20%; AM PEF less than 180 liters/minute (L/min); an increase in Î²-agonist use of more than 70% (and a minimum increase of at least 2 puffs); an increase from baseline in daytime asthma symptom score of more than 50%; overnight asthma symptom of: Awake &quot;all night&quot;; an asthma attack, as defined by any day when one or more of the following events due to asthma has occurred: corticosteroid use (systemic); unscheduled visit to the doctor or urgent care clinic; unscheduled visit to the emergency department; and/or hospitalization. Participants needed at least 80% of days with a complete diary during Weeks 3 to 6.
