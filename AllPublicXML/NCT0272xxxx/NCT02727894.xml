      The purpose of this study is to determine whether colorectal cancer diagnosed by screening
      (primary screening colonoscopy, colonoscopy after immunochemical based faecal occult blood
      test) has more favourable clinical-pathological characteristics than colorectal cancer
      diagnosed for symptoms. We aimed to compare these two groups of patients at the time of
      diagnosis and confirm the efficiency of the screening programme.

      Multicentre prospective observational study. 12 centres across the Czech rep. included. Study
      approved by Ethical Committee.

      All participants gave their informed signed consent. Each centre was assigned a unique ID
      number to distinguish between the locations in which patients were enrolled.

      Patients informations were stored under identification number in secure internet database
      (RedCap) run by The International Clinical Research Center of St. Anne's University Hospital
      Brno.REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research
      studies.

      Statistical analysis was done with SAS, ver. 9.3. Descriptive statistics such as absolute and
      relative frequencies and median with 95 % confidence intervals were used. Differences between
      the screening and non-screening groups were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher's
      exact test (categorical parameters) and Mann-Whitney test (continuous parameters). Results
      with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant
