  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proportion of patients with an infusion reaction
      in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with Golimumab Intravenous (IV) or Infliximab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, noninterventional (no treatment medication provided by the study),
      observational (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure
      their outcomes), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study of Golimumab IV and
      Infliximab in RA patients. The study allows for an anticipated 2-year enrollment period and a
      3-year study duration for each patient. No interventions will be given to patients as a part
      of this study. This study will be conducted in the US, at rheumatology-based clinical
      practices and will enroll adult RA patients who meet all entry criteria. The primary endpoint
      of this study is the proportion of patients with an infusion reaction through week 52.
      Patients will be enrolled in a 1:1 ratio to initiate treatment with either Golimumab IV or
      Infliximab. Patients' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

             biologic. Patients with previous exposure to subcutaneously administered Simponi may
             enroll in the study

          -  Patient must be willing to complete Patient reported outcomes (PRO) forms during the
             study and agree to return completed forms to the site if receiving an infusion of
             Golimumab IV or Infliximab at a location remote from the study site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is less than 18 years of age

          -  Patient is pregnant or planning a pregnancy

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in an interventional study

          -  Patient has received an investigational drug (including investigational vaccines) or
             used an invasive investigational medical device within 28 days, as appropriate, before
             the planned first dose of Golimumab IV or Infliximab

          -  Patient previously received Golimumab IV if planning to receive Golimumab IV in this
             study or the patient previously received Infliximab if planning to receive Infliximab
             or BI in this study. Patient previously receive BI if planning to receive BI or
             Remicade in this study

          -  Patient has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation
             would not be in the best interest of the patient (example, compromise the patient's
             well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified
             assessments
