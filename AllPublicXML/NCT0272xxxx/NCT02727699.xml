      This XanADu Phase II study in mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is to assess the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of Xanamem™ in subjects with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's
      Disease. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 10mg once daily Xanamem™ or Placebo at
      a 1:1 ratio in a double-blinded fashion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      proof-of-concept study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral Xanamem™ once
      daily in adult subjects with mild dementia due to AD.

      Based on Xanamem™'s mode of action on hippocampal function, amnestic symptoms may respond
      best, thus favouring the inclusion of mild dementia due to AD, with given evidence of disease
      progression. Subjects will be treated in a double-blind fashion, where both the investigators
      and subjects will be unaware of the treatment assignments, to minimise any subjective or
      unrecognised bias carried by the investigators and subjects. Placebo will be used as the
      comparator in this study.

      It is planned to randomise approximately 174 subjects at approximately 25 study sites in
      three countries (Australia, United Kingdom, and United States), with the aim to enrol 7 to 10
      subjects at each study site. Subject enrolment will be competitive but a cap of 20 subjects
      per study site is to be established to avoid any site effects. In case the sample composition
      at one study site is creating concerns, an enrolment stop can also occur at fewer than 20
      subjects.

      The data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically meet for the review of accumulating
      safety study data and will also be involved in the interim analysis.

      At the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either Xanamem™ administered orally QD (treatment group) or matching placebo (placebo
      group). Subjects will return to the study site for visits at Week 4 and Week 8, End of
      Treatment (Week 12) and Follow-up (4 weeks post last dose of study drug) visits, at which
      study assessments will be performed.

      Ad hoc telephone contact may also occur at any other time-point throughout the study, if
      deemed necessary by the investigator/study nurse, or if the subject wishes to report an AE.

      Subjects will be interviewed and examined at the study site at each visit, and will complete
      a variety of questionnaires and routine safety evaluations.

      Optional PD sampling will be performed at specific visits. Subjects who do not provide
      consent for this optional sub-study will still be eligible for the main study.

      The overall study duration for an individual subject will be 17 to 20 weeks, including a
      screening period of one to 4 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 12 weeks, and a
      follow-up period of 4 weeks. The total duration of the study is expected to be 2 years.

               1. Post menopausal women, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
                  medical cause. If there is any concern about the menopausal status of a
                  prospective female subject, a follicle stimulating hormone test (FSH) should be
                  requested to confirm post-menopausal status. Post menopausal women confirmed by
                  FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL, will be confirmed by central laboratory.

               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at
                  Screening and Baseline, and be willing to use highly effective methods of
                  contraception from the Screening visit until 3 months after last dose of study
                  drug. If re-test is required, a local urine pregnancy test will be performed at
                  Baseline to determine if the subject can continue to randomisation.

               3. Are permanently sterile or have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy.

               4. Women must not be breastfeeding.

          3. Male Subjects:

               1. Who are sexually active, fertile men must use highly effective methods of
                  contraception from Day 1 until 3 months after last dose of study drug if their
                  partners are WOBC.

               2. Who are permanently sterile or have had bilateral orchiectomy.

          4. Diagnosis of mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with increased level of
             certainty (provided by evidence of clinical deterioration within the 6 months
             preceding Screening, as assessed by the investigator) as determined by the National
             Institute of Ageing (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) workgroup.

          5. Mild dementia due to probable AD with MMSE 20 to 26 (inclusive).

          6. Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Global Score of 0.5 to 1.0.

          7. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan in the 12
             months preceding Screening that in the investigator's opinion is consistent with AD as
             the principle aetiology of the dementia with no other clinically significant
             abnormality, e.g. another principle underlying aetiology of the subject's dementia, or
             a lesion which could affect cognition e.g. a brain tumour or large stroke.

          8. On stable dose of acetylcholinesterase (AChEI) and/or memantine (at least 3 months
             prior to Screening) OR treatment-naïve. Initiating AChEIs or memantine during the
             study will not be permitted.

          9. Apart from a clinical diagnosis of mild dementia due to AD, the subject must be in
             good health as determined by the investigator, based on medical history and screening
             assessments.

         10. Has a consenting study partner who, in the investigator's judgement, has frequent and
             sufficient contact with the subject to be able to provide accurate information as to
             the subject's cognitive and functional abilities. The study partner must be available
             to provide information to the investigator and study site staff about the subject and
             agrees to attend all study site visits in person for scale completion. A study partner
             should be available for the duration of the study. The measure of adequate
             availability will be at the investigator's discretion.

         11. Must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and must be
             available to complete the study.

         12. Must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the study.

         13. Must provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,
             respiration rate and oral temperature), as determined by the investigator.

          2. Clinically significant abnormal haematology, biochemistry and urine examination
             values, specifically abnormal liver and renal function and Vitamin B12 levels below
             lower threshold since these parameters may impact cognitive function, as determined by
             the investigator.

          3. Has had a significant systematic illness or infection within the past 4 weeks prior to
             randomisation, as determined by the investigator.

             to) Parkinson's disease, multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, normal pressure
             hydrocephalus, brain tumour, progressive supranuclear palsy, seizure disorder,
             subdural haematoma, multiple sclerosis or a history of significant head trauma
             followed by persistent neurologic defaults or known structural brain abnormalities.

          5. Subjects with clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy or historical evidence of
             clinically significant nerve conduction abnormalities.
