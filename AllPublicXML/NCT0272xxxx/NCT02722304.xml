      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      weekly administration of Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (A1PI) augmentation therapy in subjects
      with A1PI deficiency and emphysema/ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

    <measure>Rate of Change in Lung Density Based on Group 1 (ARALAST NP) Versus Placebo, Group 3 and Group 4 (GLASSIA) Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Early termination of the study (approximately 22 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of change in lung density was assessed by computed tomography (CT) densitometry. Computed Tomography (CT) scans was used to measure lung density as a quantitative assessment of emphysema progression and treatment efficacy at each of the study visits. CT lung density at the 15th percentile (PD15) is the threshold below which 15% of the voxels have lower densities, and was used as the parameter for estimating the rate of lung density decline. Rate of change in lung density based on Group 1 (ARALAST NP) versus Placebo, Group 3 and Group 4 (GLASSIA) versus Placebo were reported. The safety analysis set used for all the efficacy parameter assessment.</description>

    <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an IP that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of double-blind investigational product or a start date before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product that increased in severity or after the date of the first dose. TEAE related to Investigational Product (IP) and Study Procedures (SP) were considered. A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE. Number of events with related and unrelated serious and non-serious TEAE were reported.</description>

        <title>Rate of Change in Lung Density Based on Group 1 (ARALAST NP) Versus Placebo, Group 3 and Group 4 (GLASSIA) Versus Placebo</title>
        <description>Rate of change in lung density was assessed by computed tomography (CT) densitometry. Computed Tomography (CT) scans was used to measure lung density as a quantitative assessment of emphysema progression and treatment efficacy at each of the study visits. CT lung density at the 15th percentile (PD15) is the threshold below which 15% of the voxels have lower densities, and was used as the parameter for estimating the rate of lung density decline. Rate of change in lung density based on Group 1 (ARALAST NP) versus Placebo, Group 3 and Group 4 (GLASSIA) versus Placebo were reported. The safety analysis set used for all the efficacy parameter assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Events With Related and Unrelated Serious and Non-Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</title>
        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an IP that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of double-blind investigational product or a start date before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product that increased in severity or after the date of the first dose. TEAE related to Investigational Product (IP) and Study Procedures (SP) were considered. A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE. Number of events with related and unrelated serious and non-serious TEAE were reported.</description>

        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an IP that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of double-blind investigational product or a start date before the date of the first dose of double-blind investigational product that increased in severity or after the date of the first dose. A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE. TEAE related to IP and Study Procedures were considered. Percentage of participants with related and unrelated serious and non-serious TEAE were reported.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Reactions (ARs) plus suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event which met any of the following criteria: an adverse event that began during infusion or within 72 hours following the end of IP infusion; an adverse event considered by either the investigator and/or the sponsor to be possibly or probably related to IP administration; an adverse event for which causality assessment was missing or indeterminate. Adverse reaction included both serious and non-serious ARs.</description>

      <time_frame>From start of study treatment up to early termination of the study (approximately 22 months)</time_frame>
      <desc>Study was terminated early. One arm/ group (ARALAST NP 120 mg/kg (Group 2)) did not have any participants randomized to it at the time of the study termination. Therefore there are zero participants at risk.
This applies to the following fields, below for the ARALAST NP 120 mg/kg (Group 2) arm/group:
participants at risk for Serious Adverse Events
participants at risk for All-Cause Mortality
participants at risk for Other (Not Including Serious) Adverse Events</desc>
