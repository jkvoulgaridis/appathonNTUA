  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, single dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      AT-GTX-501 delivered intrathecally into the lumbar spinal cord region of subjects with mild
      to moderate variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis associated with mutation(s)
      in the CLN6 gene (vLINCL6 disease).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose study of AT-GTX-501 administered by a single intrathecal
      injection. Safety and efficacy are evaluated over a 2 year period. The efficacy assessments
      in this study are to evaluate motor, language, visual, and cognitive function, as well as
      survival and other outcome measures. Subjects are tested at baseline, receive AT-GTX-501 on
      Day 0, and return for visits on Days 7, 14, 21, and 30, and then every 3 months until Month
      24. Following completion of this study, there is a long-term follow up study in which data
      will continue to be collected (Study AT-GTX-501-02 / NCT04273243).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of vLINCL6 disease determined by genotype available at screening

          2. A score of ≥ 3 on the quantitative clinical assessment of the Hamburg motor-language
             aggregate score at screening

          3. Aged ≥ 1 year

          4. Ambulatory or able to walk with assistance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of another inherited neurologic disease, eg, other forms of Batten disease
             (also known as NCL) or seizures unrelated to vLINCL6 disease (Subjects with febrile
             seizures may be eligible at discretion of the investigator.)

          2. Presence of another neurological illness that may have caused cognitive decline (eg,
             trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage) before screening

          3. Active viral infection (includes HIV or serology positive for hepatitis B or C)

          4. Has received stem cell or bone marrow transplantation for vLINCL6 disease

          5. Contraindications for intrathecal administration of the product or lumbar puncture,
             such as bleeding disorders or other medical conditions (eg, spina bifida, meningitis,
             or clotting abnormalities)

          6. Contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (eg, cardiac pacemaker,
             metal fragment or chip in the eye, aneurysm clip in the brain)

          7. Episode of generalized motor status epilepticus within 4 weeks before the gene
             transfer visit (Visit 2)

          8. Severe infection (eg, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or meningitis) within 4 weeks before

             protocol-required testing or procedures or compromise the subject's wellbeing, safety,
             or clinical interpretability

         12. Pregnancy any time during the study (Any female subject judged by the investigator to
             be of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy.)

         13. Abnormal laboratory values from screening considered clinically significant (gamma
             glutamyl transferase [GGT] &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin ≥ 3.0 mg/dL,
             creatinine ≥ 1.8 mg/dL, hemoglobin &lt; 8 or &gt; 18 g/dL, white blood cells &gt; 15,000 per
             cmm)

         14. Family does not want to disclose subject's study participation with primary care
             physician and other medical providers.

         15. History of or current chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other immunosuppression therapy
             within the 30 days preceding screening (Corticosteroid treatment may be permitted at
             the discretion of the investigator.)

         16. Has 2 consecutive abnormal liver tests at screening (&gt; 2 times the upper limit of
             normal). Liver enzymes will be re-tested once if abnormal upon initial screening.
