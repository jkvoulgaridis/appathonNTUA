  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3359609 is an anti-Inducible T cell Co-Stimulator (ICOS) receptor agonist antibody
      intended for the treatment of cancers of different histology. This is a first-time-in-human
      (FTIH), open-label, multicenter study designed to investigate the safety, pharmacology, and
      preliminary antitumor activity in participants with selected, advanced or recurrent solid
      tumors with the aim to establish recommended dose(s) of GSK3359609 for further exploration as
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, chemotherapy or other immune therapies.
      The study is comprised of two primary parts, each composed of two phases: Part 1: GSK3359609
      monotherapy with Part 1A as dose escalation phase and Part 1B as cohort expansion phase; Part
      2: GSK3359609 combination therapy with Part 2A pembrolizumab or GSK3174998 or dostarlimab or
      dostarlimab plus cobolimab or Bintrafusp alfa combination dose escalation phase and Part 2B
      expansion phase with pembrolizumab. Part 2A GSK3359609 combinations with chemotherapy will
      only consist of safety run-in cohorts. Each part and phase of the study includes a screening
      period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. The primary objective of the study is to
      determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose or the maximum administered dose
      of GSK3359609 alone or in combination.

          -  Histological or cytological documentation of an invasive malignancy that was diagnosed
             as locally advanced/metastatic or relapsed/refractory and is of one of the following
             tumor types: bladder/urothelial cancer of the upper and lower urinary tract; cervical;
             colorectal (includes appendix); esophagus, squamous cell; head and neck carcinoma;
             melanoma; malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM); non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
             prostate; Microsatellite Instability-High/deficient mismatch repair (MSI-H/dMMR) tumor
             (Part 1B and Part 2B) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive or Epstein-Barr
             (EBV)-positive tumor (Part 1B and Part 2B).

          -  Disease that has progressed after standard therapy for the specific tumor type, or for
             which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective, intolerable, or is considered
             inappropriate, or if no further standard therapy exists; exceptions are in these tumor
             types in which pembrolizumab single agent may be a standard: NSCLC, head and neck
             squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), bladder/urothelial cancer, MSI-H/dMMR cancers and
             melanoma and cervical cancer. In Part 2B pembrolizumab combination expansion cohorts,
             prior treatment with anti-Programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1)/ Ligand-1 (L1) may not
             be required. 1) Participants must not have received more than 5 prior lines of therapy
             for advanced disease including both standards of care and investigational therapies.
             2) Participants who received prior PD-1/L1 therapy must fulfill the following
             requirements (Part 1B [except PK/PD cohort]/ Part 2B):a) Have achieved a CR, PR or SD
             and subsequently had disease progression while still on PD-1/L1 therapy; b) Have
             received at least 2 doses of an approved PD-1/L1 inhibitor (by any regulatory

             the PD-1/L1 inhibitor. The initial evidence of disease progression is to be confirmed
             by a second assessment no less than four weeks from the date of the first documented
             Progressive Disease (PD) (the confirmatory scan could be the Baseline eligibility scan
             for this study). 3) In Part 2A 5-fluorouracil (FU)/platinum combination with
             GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab cohort, participants must not have received prior
             systemic therapy administered in the recurrent or metastatic setting (with the
             exception of systemic therapy given as part of multimodal treatment for locally
             advanced disease).

             target/index lesion unless agreed upon by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1.
