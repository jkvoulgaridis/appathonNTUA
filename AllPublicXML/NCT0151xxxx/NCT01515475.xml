    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare visual acuity outcomes and development of strabismus
      after a 3-year follow-up period in children age 12 to &lt;72 months with moderate hyperopia
      (spherical equivalent +3.00D to +6.00D) who are prescribed glasses either immediately or only
      after confirmation of pre-specified deterioration criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate and high hyperopia are associated with the development of strabismus and amblyopia.
      The primary aims of treatment for asymptomatic moderate and high hyperopia in preschool
      children are to facilitate the development of normal visual acuity and to prevent the
      development of esotropia and amblyopia. Treatment consists of optical correction, typically
      using glasses. For children with high hyperopia (&gt;+5.00D) and without strabismus or
      amblyopia, there is general consensus that a correction should be prescribed. Nevertheless,
      for children with moderate hyperopia (+3.00D to +5.00D) without strabismus or amblyopia,
      there is less consensus among pediatric eye care professionals. A survey by Lyons et al found
      that for a 2-year-old child with hyperopia greater than +3.00D, 65% of optometrists would
      prescribe glasses compared to 25% of ophthalmologists; for a 4-year old with hyperopia
      greater than +3.00D, 67% of optometrists would prescribe compared with 42% of
      ophthalmologists. The American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS)
      recommends correcting +4.00D or more in 2 to 7 year olds and the American Academy of
      Ophthalmology recommends a threshold of +4.50D for correction in 2-to 3-year olds. Unlike
      ophthalmology, optometry does not provide specific recommendations based on age and level of
      refractive error. Such variation in practice highlights the lack of rigorously collected
      scientific evidence for the management of this condition. Across all levels of hyperopia,
      most ophthalmologists and optometrists usually prescribe less than the full cycloplegic
      refraction (71% in the Lyons survey) when no strabismus or amblyopia is present.

      The rationale for proactively correcting moderate hyperopia in an asymptomatic child is the
      prevention of esotropia, amblyopia, or asthenopia. The argument against correcting moderate
      hyperopia in an asymptomatic child is the expense and inconvenience of glasses that might be
      unnecessary and the potential disruption of emmetropization in infants and toddlers. At
      present, it remains uncertain whether correction of moderate hyperopia is beneficial in terms
      of visual acuity outcomes or strabismus development. There is some evidence that using
      partial correction of hyperopia allows emmetropization to take place.

      If refractive correction of moderate hyperopia does not reduce the incidence of amblyopia
      and/or esotropia compared to no refractive correction, then glasses can be avoided. However,
      if correcting moderate hyperopia does reduce the development of amblyopia and/or esotropia,
      then the benefits of preemptive refractive correction will have been identified.

    <description>At the 36-month visit, each subject's condition will be classified as either failure or not a failure. The primary analytic approach will be a treatment group comparison of the proportion meeting failure criteria at 36-months using the Fisher's exact test.
The participant met failure criteria if ANY of the following criteria (except strabismus surgery prior to the 3-year outcome exam) were met during testing at the 3-year examination both with and without trial frames (without prism or bifocal), and the criteria was confirmed by a retest
Any measurable manifest strabismus in primary gaze at distance or at near not correctable with distance refractive correction alone

    <measure>Mean Change in Spherical Equivalent (SE) Refractive Error (Diopters)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Refractive error is the measurement of the power of the lenses needed to focus light on the retina. This is measured in diopters (D). Spherical Equivalent is a pair of numbers, one for each eye, that gives an estimate of the refractive error in the eyes. Hyperopia is farsightedness, or a type of refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at a distance than at near. Myopia is nearsightedness, or refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at near.
Mean change in SE refractive error is from baseline to 3 years, measured in diopters. Negative values indicate a shift in the myopic direction.</description>

    <description>A treatment group comparison of the mean maximum visual acuity per subject at the masked 36-month visit (best visual acuity on any test with and without correction) will be performed using a t-test. Evaluated the best of the values reported with and without trial frames, during initial assessment and retest.
Snellen visual acuity (VA) equivalents were converted to logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) equivalents (in parentheses) as follows: 20/16 (-0.1), 20/20 (0), 20/25 (0.1), 20/32 (0.2), 20/40 (0.3), 20/50 (0.4)
A logMAR value of less than 0 is associated with better than 20/20 vision, while a logMAR value greater than 0 is associated with worse than 20/20 vision.</description>

    <description>A treatment group comparison of the mean binocular near visual acuity (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution, or logMAR) at the 36-month outcome exam will be performed. Assessment completed in randomized correction.
Snellen visual acuity (VA) equivalents were converted to logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) equivalents (in parentheses) as follows: 20/16 (-0.1), 20/20 (0), 20/25 (0.1), 20/32 (0.2), 20/40 (0.3), 20/50 (0.4) A logMAR value of less than 0 is associated with better than 20/20 vision, while a logMAR value greater than 0 is associated with worse than 20/20 vision.</description>

    <measure>Mean Stereoacuity</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean stereoacuity at 3 years was measured in log seconds of arc (log arcsec) (see explanation below). Evaluated the best of the values reported with and without trial frames, during initial assessment and retest.
Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40). Seconds of arc refers to the visual angle that is being measured in order to determine depth perception. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores to the log scale to calculate descriptive statistics (reported as seconds of arc, or arcsec). Seconds of arc were converted to logarithm of seconds of arc, or log arcsec (in parentheses) as follows: 40 (1.60), 60(1.78), 100 (2.00), 200 (2.30), 400 (2.60), 800 (2.90), Nil (3.20)</description>

          <title>SE Refractive Error: More hyperopic eye</title>
          <description>Refractive error is the measurement of the power of the lenses needed to focus light on the retina. This is measured in diopters (D). Spherical Equivalent is a pair of numbers, one for each eye, that gives an estimate of the refractive error in the eyes. Hyperopia is farsightedness, or a type of refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at a distance than at near.

          <title>SE Refractive Error: More hyperopic eye</title>
          <description>Refractive error is the measurement of the power of the lenses needed to focus light on the retina. This is measured in diopters (D). Spherical Equivalent is a pair of numbers, one for each eye, that gives an estimate of the refractive error in the eyes. Hyperopia is farsightedness, or a type of refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at a distance than at near. This measurement is in the more hyperopic eye, or the eye that sees worse at near than the other eye.</description>

          <title>SE Refractive Error: Less hyperopic eye</title>
          <description>Refractive error is the measurement of the power of the lenses needed to focus light on the retina. This is measured in diopters (D). Spherical Equivalent is a pair of numbers, one for each eye, that gives an estimate of the refractive error in the eyes. Hyperopia is farsightedness, or a type of refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at a distance than at near. This measurement is in the less hyperopic eye, or the eye that sees better at near than the other eye.</description>

          <title>Distance Visual Acuity: Better-seeing Eye</title>
          <description>Distance visual acuity is typically measured by testing the smallest letter or object a patient can identify from 20 feet away. This measurement is recorded as a fraction. The numerator is the distance at which the patient is identifying the letter/object, while the denominator is the distance that a person with normal vision could identify that same object. For example, 20/20 vision is considered normal, where a patient can see at 20 feet what is normally seen at 20 feet. This measurement is for the better-seeing eye, or the eye with better visual acuity.</description>
          <population>This measure was only used as a baseline characteristic for the Older cohort, no data for this characteristic was collected from the younger cohort.</population>

          <title>Distance Visual Acuity: Better-seeing Eye</title>
          <description>Each visual acuity (VA) measure was assigned a logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) equivalent, with 20/20 VA equal to 0 logMAR, and each progressively worse VA equal to an additional 0.1 logMAR. For example:
20/50 = 0.4 logMAR, 20/40 = 0.3 logMAR, 20/32 = 0.2 logMAR, 20/25 = 0.1 logMAR, 20/20 = 0 logMAR, 20/16 = -0.1 logMAR
Larger logMAR indicates worse visual acuity.
This measurement is for the better-seeing eye, or the eye with smaller logMAR visual acuity.</description>

        <measure>
          <title>Distance Visual Acuity: Worse-seeing Eye</title>
          <description>Distance visual acuity is typically measured by testing the smallest letter or object a patient can identify from 20 feet away. This measurement is recorded as a fraction. The numerator is the distance at which the patient is identifying the letter/object, while the denominator is the distance that a person with normal vision could identify that same object. For example, 20/20 vision is considered normal, where a patient can see at 20 feet what is normally seen at 20 feet. This measurement is for the worse-seeing eye, or the eye with worse visual acuity.</description>

          <description>Measure Description: Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40). Seconds of arc refers to the visual angle that is being measured in order to determine depth perception. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.</description>
          <population>This measure was only used as a baseline characteristic for the Older cohort, no data for this characteristic was collected from the younger cohort.</population>

        <description>At the 36-month visit, each subject's condition will be classified as either failure or not a failure. The primary analytic approach will be a treatment group comparison of the proportion meeting failure criteria at 36-months using the Fisher's exact test.
The participant met failure criteria if ANY of the following criteria (except strabismus surgery prior to the 3-year outcome exam) were met during testing at the 3-year examination both with and without trial frames (without prism or bifocal), and the criteria was confirmed by a retest

        <title>Mean Change in Spherical Equivalent (SE) Refractive Error (Diopters)</title>
        <description>Refractive error is the measurement of the power of the lenses needed to focus light on the retina. This is measured in diopters (D). Spherical Equivalent is a pair of numbers, one for each eye, that gives an estimate of the refractive error in the eyes. Hyperopia is farsightedness, or a type of refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at a distance than at near. Myopia is nearsightedness, or refractive error in which things are seen more clearly at near.
Mean change in SE refractive error is from baseline to 3 years, measured in diopters. Negative values indicate a shift in the myopic direction.</description>

Evaluated the best of the values reported with and without trial frames, during initial assessment and retest.
Snellen visual acuity (VA) equivalents were converted to logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) equivalents (in parentheses) as follows: 20/16 (-0.1), 20/20 (0), 20/25 (0.1), 20/32 (0.2), 20/40 (0.3), 20/50 (0.4)
A logMAR value of less than 0 is associated with better than 20/20 vision, while a logMAR value greater than 0 is associated with worse than 20/20 vision.</description>

        <title>Mean Stereoacuity</title>
        <description>Mean stereoacuity at 3 years was measured in log seconds of arc (log arcsec) (see explanation below). Evaluated the best of the values reported with and without trial frames, during initial assessment and retest.
Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40). Seconds of arc refers to the visual angle that is being measured in order to determine depth perception. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores to the log scale to calculate descriptive statistics (reported as seconds of arc, or arcsec). Seconds of arc were converted to logarithm of seconds of arc, or log arcsec (in parentheses) as follows: 40 (1.60), 60(1.78), 100 (2.00), 200 (2.30), 400 (2.60), 800 (2.90), Nil (3.20)</description>
