      Photosensitivity is well documented among lupus patients and is one of the diagnostic
      criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Photosensitivity is highly prevalent in
      lupus and has a wide range of clinical presentations. However, photosensitivity is a poorly
      defined in lupus and its pathogenesis is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to
      characterize the early clinical and histopathological changes in lupus skin that occur as a
      response to ultraviolet light.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have a diagnosis of CLE based on either the Gilliam classification of
             DLE and SCLE, or SLE based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants who do not meet criteria for either CLE or SLE.

          2. Participants with a diagnosis of Erythropoietic Protoporphyria and Solar Urticaria, or
             another photodermatoses other than Polymorphous light eruption.

          3. Participants who are not yet 18 years old or who are not capable of giving written
             informed consent prior to enrolling in the study.

          4. Participants who have undergone any recent phototesting, or phototherapy exposure, or
             those who are suspected of having a drug-induced photosensitivity.

          5. Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study.
             This will be determined by patient self-reporting.
