  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Smoking is thought to cause changes in the brain that lead to addiction and craving.
      Smokers who try to quit experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms that include irritability,
      anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms make it difficult for people to stop
      smoking. Many people say that they continue smoking to help relieve these symptoms, often
      within the first week after trying to quit. Researchers want to study what is happening in
      the brain to cause these symptoms, which may help identify new ways to successfully quit
      smoking.

      Objectives:

      - To study nicotine withdrawal symptoms and brain function in smokers who stop smoking for 36
      hours.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day.
      Participants must be able to stop smoking for 36 hours on two occasions.

      Design:

      Phase 1

        -  This study will involve three visits to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

        -  NOT be able to smoke for 36 hours before the two imaging visits.

        -  Wear a nicotine skin patch or a placebo (fake) patch during your 36 hour smoking
           abstinence period and study visits.

        -  Have your blood drawn to test for levels of stress-related hormones.

        -  Complete multiple MRI scanning sessions that last about 1.5 to 2 hours each.

        -  Undergo EEG (brain waves) recording.

        -  Answer questionnaires about how you think and feel.

        -  Complete various tasks and procedures inside and outside of the MRI scanner.

      Phase 2

        -  This study will involve thirteen visits to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

        -  Set a quit date and develop a treatment plan with a study therapist.

        -  Take Chantix (varenicline) every day for a period of 12 weeks.

        -  Meet for weekly and biweekly counseling sessions with a therapist.

        -  Answer questionnaires about how you think and feel.

      Phase 3

        -  This study will involve three visits to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

        -  Complete an MRI scanning session that will last about 20min each visit

        -  Meet with a study staff member on each visit who will ask you questions about your
           smoking behavior and how you think and feel.

      Objective

      The primary objective of the current protocol is to gain a greater understanding of the
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying acute nicotine withdrawal and contributing to the
      maintenance of, or return to smoking behavior among nicotine-dependent individuals, in the
      service of developing future smoking cessation treatments. The Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome
      is a major cause of failed quit attempts in smokers, and targeting this time period for
      intervention may help improve smoking cessation outcomes.

      Study Population

      We will recruit treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking smokers, as well as matched
      non-smoker control participants.

      Design

      There are 3 arms included in this protocol, each of which aims to understand the neurobiology
      of the Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome during the initial quit period, with the broader goal of
      increasing quit success rate in the future.

      Main Study: To understand (1) the acute neurobiological effects of nicotine withdrawal on
      treatment-seeking and non-treatment seeking smokers, (2) the long term neurobiological
      outcomes of varenicline treatment and smoking cessation counseling at 1, 6, and 12 months. We
      will recruit 85 treatment seeking and 35 non-treatment seeking smokers for a within (nicotine
      deprivation), between (treatment-seeking status) subjects randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled study.

      Motivational Interviewing Arm: (1) To increase motivation and preparation for smoking
      cessation treatment among individuals who express an interest in quitting smoking but are not
      currently ready to enter treatment, in the service of increasing quit success rate and (2) to
      understand the neurobiological basis of motivation to quit smoking, and the interaction
      between motivation to quit and mechanisms that underlie acute nicotine withdrawal. We will
      recruit 300 current smokers interested in quitting smoking, but not yet ready to set a quit
      date.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Arm: To understand the acute effect of tDCS on
      3 large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal, the Default
      Mode Network, the Executive Control Network, and the Salience Network. We will enroll 60
      non-treatment seeking smokers, with the expectation of 35 completers; and enroll 55
      non-smoking controls, with the expectation of 45 completers, for a double blind, sham
      controlled, randomized crossover study. Smokers will be studied in nicotine abstinence and
      nicotine sated conditions, as in the Main Study design.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcome measures:

        1. Change in BOLD signal and FC related to task parameters, between drug (or tDCS)
           condition.

        2. Behavioral performance on each of the tasks assessing inhibitory control processes,
           reward responsiveness, amygdala, striatal, BNST reactivity, impulsive decision making,
           cue reactivity and working memory (e.g., reaction time, error rate, hit rate, reward
           bias).

        3. Self-reported craving, withdrawal symptoms and mood/affect

        4. Smoking abstinence as determined by self-reported tobacco use, urine cotinine, and
           breath CO.

      Secondary outcome measures:

        1. MRS for glutamate concentration.

        2. Plasma ACTH and cortisol.

        3. Resting state CBF from ASL.

        4. ERP and EEG measures.

        5. Ratings and scores on self-report characterization measures.

        6. Structural MRI and DTI data.

        7. Resting state FC at 1, 6 and 12 months post-treatment.

    <description>To simulate the experience of tDCS stimulation, current is ramped on and turned off at the beginning and end of the tDCS session. An additional sham option is to have the current ramp up and down only at the beginning of the sham session, and not at the end. This second sham is supported in the literature as an effective blinding technique, which subjects cannot distinguish from active stimulation. One of these sham options will be used for data that will be analyzed together, to be determined based on equipment capabilities and preliminary analysis of blinding efficacy in our cross over design. We will assess the efficacy of sham condition by providing participants and the investigator with a questionnaire on the MRI/tDCS session, wherein they will report whether they thought the tDCS session was active or sham. The MRIoperator (or other non protocol personnel) will control active/sham conditions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), a type of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS), has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. Two potential targets for tDCS as a smoking cessation aid are the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a node of the ECN, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a node of the DMN. tDCS can potentially strengthen the control of the ECN through excitatory stimulation of the dlPFC, and weaken the influence of the DMN by inhibitory stimulation of the vmPFC. The tDCS model we will use is the neuroConn DCStimulator MR (neuroCare Group GmbH, Munchen, Germany).</description>

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Subjects must:

          -  Be between the ages of 18-65.

          -  Be right-handed. Assessment tool(s): Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.

          -  Be in good health. Justification: Many illnesses may alter fMRI signals as well as
             cognitive processes and neural functioning. Assessment tool(s): Participants will
             provide a brief health history during phone screening, and undergo a medical history
             and physical examination with a qualified IRP clinician.

          -  Be free of current moderate to severe DSM-V Substance Use Disorder on any drug, except
             nicotine in smokers. Those with past moderate to severe use disorder on substances may
             be included, provided they are in sustained remission (and not on maintenance therapy
             for opioid use disorder) and are not intoxicated on the day of the imaging session.
             Justification: Moderate to severe use disorder on other substances may result in
             unique CNS deficits that could confound results and introduce excessive variance,
             while mild substance use disorder and substance use disorder in remission are common
             in community samples of smokers. Assessment tool(s): Computerized SCID or comparable
             assessment and DSM-5 substance use disorder assessment.

          -  Be able to abstain from alcohol and other recreational drugs for 24 hours before each
             imaging session, and able to moderate caffeine intake 12 hours before each imaging
             session. Justification: Recent substance use, including alcohol, and caffeine modulate
             neural functioning in a way that would complicate data interpretation. Assessment
             tool(s): Self-report, breathalyzer, and urine toxicology screen with follow up
             neuromotor assessment to ensure absence of acute impairment with positive urine test.

          -  Smokers must meet the additional criteria:

               -  Have a urine cotinine (NicAlert) level of 4 or higher and have been smoking for
                  at least 1 year. Justification: The present protocol is interested in
                  neurobiological mechanisms that underlie nicotine withdrawal, and is thus
                  contingent on the presence of nicotine dependence. Assessment tool(s):
                  Selfreport, NicAlert of 4 or higher

               -  Be able to abstain from smoking for 12 hours prior to MRI-tDCS study sessions.
                  Justification: The present protocol will investigate the effect of acute nicotine
                  withdrawal on cognitive processes and response to tDCS. Assessment: Self-report
                  and expired CO levels

          -  In addition, non-smokers must meet:

               -  Not have a history of daily cigarette smoking or have used any nicotine products
                  continuously lasting more than a month, and no smoking or continuous use of any
                  nicotine products within the past year. Assessment Tools: Self-report, NicAlert,
                  and expired CO levels.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants will be excluded if they:

          -  Are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to certain implanted devices
             (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical
             clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology, or claustrophobia.
             Justification: MR scanning is one of the primary measurement tools used in the
             protocol. Assessment tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening
             questionnaire and undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Questions concerning
             suitability for scanning will be referred to the MR Medical Safety Officer.
             Prospective participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and
             placed in the mock scanner during their first visit to assess for possible difficulty
             tolerating the confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.

          -  Have musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual s ability to lie flat for
             extended periods of time. Justification: MR scanning sessions require participants to
             lie flat on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately one hour.
             Therefore, conditions that would make that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain,
             significant scoliosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical
             examination by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the
             mock scanner to assess comfort issues.

          -  Have HIV or Syphilis. Justification: HIV and Syphilis both can have central nervous
             system (CNS) sequelae, thus introducing unnecessary variability into the data.
             Assessment tool(s): Oral HIV followed by blood test if oral test is + and STS+ without
             adequate prior treatment

          -  Regularly or intermittently use any prescription (e.g., benzodiazepines,
             barbiturates), over-the-counter (e.g., cold medicine) medications that are likely to
             alter BOLD signal (neuronal-vascular coupling). Justification: The use of these
             substances may alter the fMRI signal and/or neural functions of interest in the
             current study. Assessment tool(s): History and comprehensive urine drug screening to
             detect benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and barbiturates. Note: If a
             participant is intermittently taking a medication likely to affect BOLD signal, the
             participant may be excluded or if scanned, will be scanned in the same medication
             state for data continuity purposes (i.e. either all scan days are scheduled after 5
             half-lives since last medication use; or all scan days are scheduled on medication).

          -  Have any current neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure
             disorders, frequent migraines or on prophylaxis, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular
             accident, movement disorders (except essential tremor, so long as it would not
             interfere with study tasks such as button pressing), history of significant head
             trauma, or CNS tumor. Justification: Neurological diseases alter CNS function and,
             possibly, the neuronal-vascular coupling that forms the basis of the fMRI signal.
             Assessment tool(s): History and physical examination by a qualified IRP clinician,
             urine drug screening for anticonvulsants not disclosed by history. History of head
             trauma with loss of consciousness of more than 30 minutes or with post-concussive
             sequelae lasting more than two days, regardless of loss of consciousness, will be
             exclusionary. The MAI who will also retain discretion to exclude based on a history of
             neurological illness that may compromise data integrity.

          -  Have current major psychotic disorders, mania, substance-induced psychiatric
             disorders, or any current suicidal ideations or history of suicide attempts. Moderate
             to severe current symptoms of mood or anxiety disorders will be exclusionary as well.
             However, mild mood or anxiety disorder symptoms will not be exclusionary, whether
             medicated or unmedicated. The MAI will reserve the right to exclude on the basis of
             psychiatric history not explicitly described in this criterion. Justification:
             Psychiatric disorders involve the central neural system (CNS) and, therefore, can be
             expected to alter the fMRI measures being used in this study, however, some degree of
             mood and anxiety symptoms are common in community samples of smokers. Assessment
             tool(s): Computerized SCID or comparable assessment, and clinical interview
             confirmation by clinician.

          -  Are cognitively impaired or learning disabled. Justification: Cognitive impairment and
             learning disabilities may be associated with altered brain functioning in regions
             recruited during laboratory task performance. Cognitive impairment may affect one s
             ability to give informed consent. Assessment tool(s): History of placement in
             special-education classes as a consequence of serious learning problems and not solely
             as a consequence of behavioral problems, assessed during the History and Physical
             screening assessment.

          -  Have significant cardiovascular conditions that would make use of nicotine patch
             unsafe. Justification: Nicotine patch may cause significant arrhythmias in susceptible
             individuals. Assessment tool(s): History and physical exam, including 12-lead EKG.

          -  Have any other major medical condition, such as diabetes mellitus, that in the view of
             the investigators would compromise the safety of an individual during participation,
             or the quality of data obtainable. Justification: Many illnesses not explicitly
             covered here may increase risk or alter important outcome measures. Assessment
             tool(s): History and physical examination by a qualified IRP clinician and CBC,
             urinalysis, NIDA chemistry panel (liver function tests, electrolytes, kidney
             function). The following lab values will result in exclusion from the study:

             i. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl

        ii. White Blood Cell Count &lt; 2400/microl

        iii. Liver Function Tests &gt; 3X upper limit of normal

        iv. Serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl

        v. Urine protein &gt; 2+

        vi. Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl

        The MAI will retain discretion to exclude based on less extreme lab results. After the
        screening process has been completed, the MAI will take into account all data collected in
        order to decide if there is an existing medical illness that would compromise participation
        in this research.

          -  Pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Females are instructed in the
             consent to use effective forms of birth control during the study period.
             Justification: study procedures and drugs used in the current protocol may complicate
             pregnancy or be transferred to nursing children. Assessment tool(s): Urine and/or
             serum pregnancy tests, and clinical interview. Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted
             at the beginning of each imaging visit.

          -  The following exclusion criteria are new for the tDCS study:

               -  Participated in any brain stimulation session less than two weeks ago, or
                  underwent brain stimulation exposure for treatment purposes in the last 6 months,
                  including tDCS or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Justification: Prior
                  exposure to brain stimulation may result in carry-over effects that could
                  confound the results of this study. Participants may enroll in the study once the
                  listed time periods have passed. Assessment tool(s): Participant medical history
                  and physical (H&amp;P).
