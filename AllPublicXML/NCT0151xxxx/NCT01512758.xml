      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      alisertib twice daily (BID) dosing for 7 days in East Asian participants with advanced solid
      tumors or lymphomas. The secondary objective was to describe any antitumor activity that may
      have been observed with alisertib treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib (MLN8237). Alisertib is being tested
      to treat people who have advanced solid tumors or lymphomas for which standard curative or
      life-prolonging treatment did not exist or was no longer effective or tolerable. This study
      evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of alisertib, as well as any antitumor activity.

      The study enrolled 36 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment groups
      and received:

        -  Alisertib 30 mg

        -  Alisertib 40 mg All participants took two enteric-coated tablets every 12 hours each day
           for 7 days followed by a 14-day rest period in a 21-day cycle for up to 16 cycles.

      This multi-center trial is conducted in East Asia. The overall time to participate in this
      study was 24 months, unless it was determined that a participant would derive benefit from
      continued therapy beyond 24 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were
      contacted up to a maximum of 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>MTD was defined as highest dose at which &lt;2 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was defined as any of the following events considered possibly related to therapy with alisertib by the investigator: 1. Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/mm^3) for &gt;7 days; 2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever (oral or ear temperature ≥38.5°C); 3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;25,000/mm^3) for &gt;7 days; 4. Platelet count &lt;10,000 cells/mm^3; 5. ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; 6. Delay in initiation of subsequent cycle by &gt;7 days due to treatment-related toxicity; 7. ≥Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity except following: a. ≥Grade 3 nausea and/or emesis in the absence of optimal antiemetic therapy; b. ≥Grade 3 diarrhea in the absence of optimal supportive therapy; c. Grade 3 fatigue lasting &lt;1 week; d. Other Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that can be safely and reliably controlled to ≤Grade 2 with appropriate treatment.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

    <description>Laboratory AEs in the following system organ classes (SOCs) are reported: blood and lymphatic system disorders, investigations, and metabolism and nutrition disorders. An abnormal laboratory value was assessed as an AE if that value lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or was considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. A treatment¬-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/mm^3) for &gt;7 days; 2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever (oral or ear temperature ≥38.5°C); 3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;25,000/mm^3) for &gt;7 days; 4. Platelet count &lt;10,000 cells/mm^3; 5. ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; 6. Delay in initiation of subsequent cycle by &gt;7 days due to treatment-related toxicity; 7. ≥Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity except following: a. ≥Grade 3 nausea and/or emesis in the absence of optimal antiemetic therapy; b. ≥Grade 3 diarrhea in the absence of optimal supportive therapy; c. Grade 3 fatigue lasting &lt;1 week; d. Other Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that can be safely and reliably controlled to ≤Grade 2 with appropriate treatment.</description>

        <description>Laboratory AEs in the following system organ classes (SOCs) are reported: blood and lymphatic system disorders, investigations, and metabolism and nutrition disorders. An abnormal laboratory value was assessed as an AE if that value lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or was considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. A treatment¬-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Values Reported as Adverse Events</title>
          <description>Laboratory AEs in the following system organ classes (SOCs) are reported: blood and lymphatic system disorders, investigations, and metabolism and nutrition disorders. An abnormal laboratory value was assessed as an AE if that value lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or was considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. A treatment¬-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

IWG criteria for CR is defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is defined as regression of measurable disease and no new sites. RECIST response criteria is defined as: CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
