  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, monocentric, double blind, placebo controlled, two arm study.

      Curcumin is derived from the rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa (common name, turmeric)
      belonging to the Zingiberaceae family found in South Asian countries, especially India which
      is the largest producer. BCM95 (bioCurcumin) is a combination of a Curcumin extract and oil
      to enhance the bio-absorbability in humans. BCM95 may enhance and prolong the antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects of the standard therapy maintaining a good safety profile.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects must experience at least one Gadolinium (GD) enhancing Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) lesion at the baseline visit or one Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse in the last
      6 months before the screening visit.

      Randomization, in a 1:1 ratio, will be done with two arms:

      40 subjects with Interferon (IFN) beta 1 a 44 mcg TIW + Curcumin (BCM 95) and 40 subjects
      with IFN beta-1a 44 mcg TIW + placebo.

      The study will last 42 months: 18 months of enrolment and 24 months of treatment period.

      The study consists of 6 visits per subject: screening visit (Visit 0), baseline (Visit 1), a
      visit 3 months after baseline (Visit 2), 6 months after baseline (Visit 3), 12 months after
      baseline (Visit 4) and 24 months after baseline (Visit 5).

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Free From Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Progression at Month 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Disability progression was assessed using EDSS. EDSS is based on a standardized neurological exam and focuses on symptoms that commonly occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) . Overall scores ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (death due to MS). Disability progression was defined as an increase of EDSS score of at least 1.0 point compared to baseline for subjects with an EDSS =&lt; 4.0. For subjects with an EDSS= 0 at baseline, EDSS progression was defined as an increase of EDSS score of at least 1.5 point.

    <time_frame>Baseline to date at which the first confirmed EDSS progression occurs, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS progression is based on a standardized neurological exam and focuses on symptoms that commonly occur in MS. Overall scores ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (death due to MS). A sustained progression on EDSS score was defined as an EDSS progression confirmed into two consecutive assessment. EDSS values obtained during clinical attacks are not excluded for the assessment of EDSS progression. However, EDSS values obtained during MS attacks that are not confirmed after two consecutive assessments will be excluded from statistical analysis of confirmed EDSS progression. Hazard ratio for time to first sustained EDSS progression was planned to be reported as per SAP.</description>

Body temperature also was also recorded to determine the presence of fever using the following scale: 0 (≤ 37.2 °C); 1 (≥ 37.3 °C but &lt; 37.8 °C); 2 (≥ 37.8 but &lt; 38.4 °C); and 3 (≥ 38.4 °C).The scores for each symptom (muscle aches, chills, weakness, body temperature) was added together to provide the combined flu-like symptom score ranging from 0 to 12 where 0 indicates absence of any symptom and 12 indicates the worst severity of the symptoms.</description>

Overall scores ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (death due to MS). Disability progression was defined as an increase of EDSS score of at least 1.0 point compared to baseline for subjects with an EDSS =&lt; 4.0. For subjects with an EDSS= 0 at baseline, EDSS progression was defined as an increase of EDSS score of at least 1.5 point.

        <description>EDSS progression is based on a standardized neurological exam and focuses on symptoms that commonly occur in MS. Overall scores ranges from 0.0 (normal) to 10.0 (death due to MS). A sustained progression on EDSS score was defined as an EDSS progression confirmed into two consecutive assessment. EDSS values obtained during clinical attacks are not excluded for the assessment of EDSS progression. However, EDSS values obtained during MS attacks that are not confirmed after two consecutive assessments will be excluded from statistical analysis of confirmed EDSS progression. Hazard ratio for time to first sustained EDSS progression was planned to be reported as per SAP.</description>

        <title>Flu-like Symptoms (FLS) Assessed by FLS Scale Score</title>
        <description>Flu-like symptoms were measured using FLS score in which subjects were scored as per the presence and intensity of muscle aches, chills, and weakness, each separately, on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0 = absent; 1 = mild, do not interfere with daily activities; 2 = moderate, sufficient to interfere with daily activities; and 3 = severe, bed rest require. Body temperature also was also recorded to determine the presence of fever using the following scale: 0 (≤ 37.2 °C); 1 (≥ 37.3 °C but &lt; 37.8 °C); 2 (≥ 37.8 but &lt; 38.4 °C); and 3 (≥ 38.4 °C).The scores for each symptom (muscle aches, chills, weakness, body temperature) was added together to provide the combined flu-like symptom score ranging from 0 to 12 where 0 indicates absence of any symptom and 12 indicates the worst severity of the symptoms.</description>

          <title>Flu-like Symptoms (FLS) Assessed by FLS Scale Score</title>
          <description>Flu-like symptoms were measured using FLS score in which subjects were scored as per the presence and intensity of muscle aches, chills, and weakness, each separately, on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0 = absent; 1 = mild, do not interfere with daily activities; 2 = moderate, sufficient to interfere with daily activities; and 3 = severe, bed rest require. Body temperature also was also recorded to determine the presence of fever using the following scale: 0 (≤ 37.2 °C); 1 (≥ 37.3 °C but &lt; 37.8 °C); 2 (≥ 37.8 but &lt; 38.4 °C); and 3 (≥ 38.4 °C).The scores for each symptom (muscle aches, chills, weakness, body temperature) was added together to provide the combined flu-like symptom score ranging from 0 to 12 where 0 indicates absence of any symptom and 12 indicates the worst severity of the symptoms.</description>
          <population>The Safety population included all subjects who received at least one administration of study medication. Here &quot;Number analyzed&quot; signifies those subjects who were evaluable for this outcome measure at the specified timepoint.</population>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Serious AE (SAE), TEAE Leading to Death and Discontinuation</title>
        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 24 months. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
