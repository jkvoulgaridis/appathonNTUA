  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the significant benefits of herpes zoster vaccine (HZV), vaccination rates remain
      low. Electronic medical records (EMR) can serve as a practical strategy to better facilitate
      the application of preventative health care, such as increasing immunization rates. A new
      care model that can increase the herpes zoster vaccination rate, as well as other
      preventative health services, is warranted. The objective of this study is to investigate if
      the functions of an EMR, in combination with a pharmacist as part of the care team, can
      improve the herpes zoster vaccination rate.
