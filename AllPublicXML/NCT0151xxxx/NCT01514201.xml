    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib when given
      together with radiation therapy and temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating
      younger patients newly diagnosed with diffuse pontine gliomas. Veliparib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving veliparib with radiation therapy and temozolomide may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum-tolerated dose or recommended Phase II dose of ABT-888 (veliparib)
      which can be safely administered concurrently with radiation therapy, followed by maintenance
      therapy with ABT-888 and temozolomide (TMZ), in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse pontine
      gliomas (DIPG). (Phase I) II. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 during
      ABT-888 and radiation therapy. (Phase I) III. To study the feasibility of intra-patient dose
      escalation of TMZ during maintenance therapy with ABT-888 and TMZ. (Phase I) IV. To describe
      the toxicities associated with administering ABT-888 and radiation therapy, followed by
      ABT-888 and TMZ, in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. (Phase I) V. To estimate the
      proportion of newly diagnosed DIPG patients treated on protocol that are determined to have
      experienced pseudo progression. (Phase I) VI. To estimate the overall survival distribution
      for newly diagnosed patients with DIPG treated with the combination of ABT-888 and radiation
      therapy, followed by ABT-888 and TMZ, and compare to Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC)
      historical controls. (Phase II) VII. To study the feasibility of intra-patient dose
      escalation of TMZ during maintenance therapy with ABT-888 and TMZ. (Phase II) VIII. To
      estimate the proportion of newly diagnosed DIPG patients treated on protocol that are
      determined to have experienced pseudo progression. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) distribution and to summarize the best
      tumor responses observed prior to progression or recurrence.

      II. To explore the plasma PK of ABT-888 during ABT-888 and radiation therapy. III. To explore
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1(PARP) activity before
      and after treatment with ABT-888.

      IV. To explore quantifying non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity or gamma-H2A histone
      family, member X (H2AX) levels (as surrogate markers of unrepaired double-strand breaks
      (DSBs)) in PBMC before and after treatment with ABT-888.

      V. To explore quantifying PARP activity and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair protein levels
      in biopsied atypical pontine gliomas, if available.

      VI. To explore associations of molecular parameters from secondary aims III, IV, and V with
      PFS and overall survival (OS) after conclusion of clinical trial.

      VII. To explore the quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) measures of relative cerebral blood
      volume (rCBV), vascular permeability (Ktrans, fractional plasma volume [vp], and
      extravascular extracellular space volume fraction [ve] values), and apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) within the first six months of initiating protocol treatment to correlate
      with disease outcome and determine whether such metrics differentiate patients with pseudo
      progression from those with true early progressive disease.

      VIII. To explore the potential utility of urine biomarkers as a novel, non-invasive method of
      detecting and tracking changes in the status of pediatric brain stem gliomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

      DOSE-ESCALATION: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for
      6-7 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-5
      and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years.

    <measure>Maximum-tolerated Dose of Veliparib Defined as Highest Dose Level With Fewer Than 2 Dose Limiting Toxicities in 6 Patients as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The traditional 3+3 dose finding algorithm was used to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose of veliparib given concurrently with radiation therapy. The dose-limiting toxicity observation period was the first 10 weeks of therapy. Dose-limiting toxicities included any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with a few exceptions (see section 5.2.1.2 of the protocol document), any grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that persisted for &gt;7 days and considered medically significant that required treatment interruption; grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia; and any Veliparib related adverse event that led to a dose reduction or the permanent cessation of therapy.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Observed to Have Unacceptable Toxicity During the Intra-patient Dose Escalation of Temozolomide During Maintenance Therapy (Feasibility Analysis Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days per treatment cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Unacceptable toxicities during maintenance included events at least possibly attributable to Veliparib and temozolomide (TMZ) such as any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with some exceptions (e.g., grade 3 nausea/vomiting &lt;5 days, grade 3 fever or infection &lt;5 days), grade 3+ thrombocytopenia, grade 4 neutropenia, delay &gt;14 days in starting subsequent cycle due to neutrophil &lt;1,000/mm3 or platelet &lt;100,000/mm3. Maintenance therapy was initiated with 25 mg/m2 Veliparib and 135 mg/m2 of TMZ, with the possibility to escalate TMZ to 175 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2 in courses 2 and 3, respectively, if no unacceptable toxicities occurred following one course of treatment at each of the dose levels to be tested. Intra-patient dose escalation to a given dose (135, 175, or 200 mg/m2) was halted based on rules employed in 3+3 designs. This dose escalation was intended for all patients but was halted early, during the phase I portion, as it was not well tolerated.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from initiation of therapy to the date of death from any cause or to the date patient was known to be alive for surviving patients, assessed to up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the interval from date on treatment to date of death from any cause or to date of last follow-up. Patients who had not failed (died) at the time of analyses were censored at their last date of contact. The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to estimate overall survival. The 3-year estimate with a 95% confidence interval is reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Phase I Patients Who Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs were defined as any of the following adverse events that were at least possibly attributable to Veliparib observed during the dose finding phase (the first 10 weeks of therapy). Hematologic dose limiting toxicities included grade 3 and higher thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia. Non-hematologic dose limiting toxicities included any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with some exceptions (e.g., nausea and vomiting of &lt;5 days; fever or infection of &lt;5 days; hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation; elevation of transaminases that return to levels meeting eligibility criteria within 7 days), or any grade non-hematologic toxicity that persisted for &gt;7 days and considered medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that required treatment interruption.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from initiation of treatment to the earliest date of failure (disease progression, death from any cause, or second malignancy), assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the interval from date of treatment initiation to date of first event (disease progression or relapse, second malignancy or death from any cause). Patients who had not failed at the time of analyses were censored at their last date of contact. The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to estimate PFS. A 3-year estimate with a 95% confidence interval is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Pseudo Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For participants that showed possible tumor progression (pseudo progression) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 6 months of therapy, treating physicians had the option of allowing patients to remain on therapy and repeating the disease assessment in 4-6 weeks. If the repeat MRI at 4-6 weeks showed disease progression, the patient was noted to have true disease progression (and the progression date corresponded to that of the first MRI). If the repeat MRI at 4-6 weeks did not show disease progression, then the patient was noted to have pseudo progression. The percentage of patients observed to have experienced pseudo progression was provided with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients up to 21 years of age with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) were enrolled at Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) member institutions. The first patient was enrolled on 2/1/2012 and the last patient was enrolled on 01/20/2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 66 patients enrolled, 1 phase II patient was deemed ineligible due to an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Of note, the 6 phase I patients who were treated at the established maximum tolerated dose (MTD) during the phase I portion of the trial were also counted as phase II patients in analyses of phase II objectives.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Phase I, Dose Level 1 (50 mg)</title>
          <description>Dose Escalation: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once a day (QD) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks.
Maintenance Therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-5 and temozolomide (TMZ) PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients start maintenance with 25 mg/m2 BID of veliparib and 135 mg/m2/day of TMZ. Intra-patient escalation of TMZ to 175 mg/m2/day and 200 mg/m2/day in subsequent courses was allowed for patients with minimal toxicities. However this intra-patient dose escalation was halted early as it was not well tolerated.</description>

          <title>Phase I, Dose Level 1 (50 mg)</title>
          <description>Dose Escalation: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once a day (QD) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks.
Maintenance Therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-5 and temozolomide (TMZ) PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients start maintenance with 25 mg/m2 BID of veliparib and 135 mg/m2/day of TMZ. Intra-patient escalation of TMZ to 175 mg/m2/day and 200 mg/m2/day in subsequent courses was allowed for patients with minimal toxicities. However this intra-patient dose escalation was halted early as it was not well tolerated.</description>

        <title>Maximum-tolerated Dose of Veliparib Defined as Highest Dose Level With Fewer Than 2 Dose Limiting Toxicities in 6 Patients as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (Phase I)</title>
        <description>The traditional 3+3 dose finding algorithm was used to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose of veliparib given concurrently with radiation therapy. The dose-limiting toxicity observation period was the first 10 weeks of therapy. Dose-limiting toxicities included any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with a few exceptions (see section 5.2.1.2 of the protocol document), any grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that persisted for &gt;7 days and considered medically significant that required treatment interruption; grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia; and any Veliparib related adverse event that led to a dose reduction or the permanent cessation of therapy.</description>

The starting dose level was 50 mg/m2/dose twice a day (BID) and other dose levels to be studied were 65 and 85 mg/m2/dose BID. If the 85 mg/m2 dose level was tolerated, there was a plan to study a higher dose level (110 mg/m2/dose BID) but only if supported by clinical data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Observed to Have Unacceptable Toxicity During the Intra-patient Dose Escalation of Temozolomide During Maintenance Therapy (Feasibility Analysis Population)</title>
        <description>Unacceptable toxicities during maintenance included events at least possibly attributable to Veliparib and temozolomide (TMZ) such as any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with some exceptions (e.g., grade 3 nausea/vomiting &lt;5 days, grade 3 fever or infection &lt;5 days), grade 3+ thrombocytopenia, grade 4 neutropenia, delay &gt;14 days in starting subsequent cycle due to neutrophil &lt;1,000/mm3 or platelet &lt;100,000/mm3. Maintenance therapy was initiated with 25 mg/m2 Veliparib and 135 mg/m2 of TMZ, with the possibility to escalate TMZ to 175 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2 in courses 2 and 3, respectively, if no unacceptable toxicities occurred following one course of treatment at each of the dose levels to be tested. Intra-patient dose escalation to a given dose (135, 175, or 200 mg/m2) was halted based on rules employed in 3+3 designs. This dose escalation was intended for all patients but was halted early, during the phase I portion, as it was not well tolerated.</description>

        <description>DLTs were defined as any of the following adverse events that were at least possibly attributable to Veliparib observed during the dose finding phase (the first 10 weeks of therapy). Hematologic dose limiting toxicities included grade 3 and higher thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia. Non-hematologic dose limiting toxicities included any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with some exceptions (e.g., nausea and vomiting of &lt;5 days; fever or infection of &lt;5 days; hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation; elevation of transaminases that return to levels meeting eligibility criteria within 7 days), or any grade non-hematologic toxicity that persisted for &gt;7 days and considered medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that required treatment interruption.</description>

Maintenance Therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-5 and temozolomide (TMZ) PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients start maintenance with 25 mg/m2 BID of veliparib and 135 mg/m2/day of TMZ. Intra-patient escalation of TMZ to 175 mg/m2/day and 200 mg/m2/day in subsequent courses was allowed for patients with minimal toxicities.

          <title>Number of Phase I Patients Who Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</title>
          <description>DLTs were defined as any of the following adverse events that were at least possibly attributable to Veliparib observed during the dose finding phase (the first 10 weeks of therapy). Hematologic dose limiting toxicities included grade 3 and higher thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia. Non-hematologic dose limiting toxicities included any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with some exceptions (e.g., nausea and vomiting of &lt;5 days; fever or infection of &lt;5 days; hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation; elevation of transaminases that return to levels meeting eligibility criteria within 7 days), or any grade non-hematologic toxicity that persisted for &gt;7 days and considered medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that required treatment interruption.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Pseudo Progression</title>
        <description>For participants that showed possible tumor progression (pseudo progression) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 6 months of therapy, treating physicians had the option of allowing patients to remain on therapy and repeating the disease assessment in 4-6 weeks. If the repeat MRI at 4-6 weeks showed disease progression, the patient was noted to have true disease progression (and the progression date corresponded to that of the first MRI). If the repeat MRI at 4-6 weeks did not show disease progression, then the patient was noted to have pseudo progression. The percentage of patients observed to have experienced pseudo progression was provided with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

Maintenance Therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-5 and temozolomide (TMZ) PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients start maintenance with 25 mg/m2 BID of veliparib and 135 mg/m2/day of TMZ. Intra-patient escalation of TMZ to 175 mg/m2/day and 200 mg/m2/day in subsequent courses was allowed for patients with minimal toxicities.

        <description>During course 1, blood samples were collected pre-veliparib on day 1, at 0.5, 1, 2, and 6-8 hours after the first dose, pre-veliparib on day 4 (steady state), and 2 hours after the morning dose. Veliparib concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using a non-compartmental analysis.</description>

Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once a day (QD) 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks.
Maintenance Therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks later, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-5 and temozolomide (TMZ) PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients start maintenance with 25 mg/m2 BID of veliparib and 135 mg/m2/day of TMZ. Intra-patient escalation of TMZ to 175 mg/m2/day and 200 mg/m2/day in subsequent courses was allowed for patients with minimal toxicities.

Intra-patient escalation of TMZ to 175 mg/m2/day and 200 mg/m2/day in subsequent courses was allowed for patients with minimal toxicities. However this intra-patient dose escalation was halted early (before the phase II study was initiated) as it was not well tolerated.</description>

          <title>Trough for Veliparib [Pharmacokinetic Parameter]</title>
          <description>During course 1, blood samples were collected pre-veliparib on day 1, at 0.5, 1, 2, and 6-8 hours after the first dose, pre-veliparib on day 4 (steady state), and 2 hours after the morning dose. Veliparib concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using a non-compartmental analysis.</description>
          <population>Pharmacokinetic studies were optional for the phase II portion of the study. 6/6 phase I dose level 1 patients, 5/6 phase I dose level 2 patients, 4/6 phase I dose level 3 patients, and 20/47 phase II patients had this data available.</population>

      <desc>Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to CTCAE v4.0. AEs collected per protocol included: a) grade 1 and 2 AEs if attribution was at least possibly related to veliparib and b) all grade 3+ AEs on treatment and within 30 days off treatment. All AEs collected are reported. As the intra-patient escalation of TMZ during maintenance was by course (rather than patient) and was halted early (only 5(3) patients escalated to 175(200) mg/m2), AEs were not reported separately by course-specific doses.</desc>
