      This study will examine over the long-term the progress of patients with neurofibromatosis
      Type 2 (NF2), a condition associated with tumors of the nerves, brain and spinal cord. It
      will study patients tumors to learn how fast they can grow and if certain factors might
      affect their growth. It will also examine the effects of the tumors on patients abilities to
      carry out activities of daily living.

      People between 8 and 75 years of age with NF2 may be eligible for this study. Participants
      undergo the following procedures:

      Initial evaluation, including hearing and balance testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scans of the brain/spine and right upper extremity, nverve conduction study and
      electromyography of the arms/legs, blood tests, questionnaires, and physical and neurological
      examinations.

      MRI scans of the brain and spine every 12 months to follow the size and number of tumors.

      Physical and neurological examinations, questionnaires and blood tests every 12 months.

      Auditory tests every 12 months for hearing patients. These tests evaluate middle and inner
      ear function and the patient s ability to hear tones at different frequencies and to hear
      words at different volumes. The subject responds to tones and words that are delivered
      through earphones.

      Vestibular testing if the patient experiences changes in balance or undergoes treatment for
      vestibular schwannoma (a tumor that develops on the hearing and balance nerves). These tests
      check the function of various components of the balance system (eyes, inner ear, or leg and
      body sensation and muscles). They include:

        -  Videoelectronystagmogram Tracks subjects eye movements while they follow moving red
           lights with their eyes.

        -  Vestibular evoked myogenic potential Assesses subjects neck muscle movements in response
           to noise.

        -  Posturography Determines which parts of the balance system the subject relies on most.
           Subjects stand on a platform and try to maintain their balance while changes are made to
           the platform and the environment.

        -  Rotary chair test Subjects eye movements are monitored as they follow red spots and
           strips of light with their eyes while seated in a rotary chair that turns side to side
           at several speeds.

      Primary Outcome Measures :

      1. To determine the natural history (clinical and radiographic) of nervous system tumors in
      NF2

      Secondary Outcome Measures :

        1. To identify underlying causes, and patterns or progression of speech and swallowing
           problems in patients with NF2.

        2. To identify imaging biomarkers of hearing loss in patients with NF2.

        3. To identify the etiology of peripheral neuropathy in patients with NF2.

        4. To identify serum biomarkers of NF2 disease progression.

      Objective

      With this prospective natural history study on neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) study, we hope
      to understand the factors leading to tumor progression and neurological disease burden in
      NF2.

      Study Population

      A total of 269 participants, ages 8-75, with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of NF2 will
      participate in this study.

      Design

      Study participants will be evaluated with a thorough physical and neurologic examination upon
      enrollment. This initial outpatient evaluation will include magnetic resonance imaging with
      contrast of brain and spine and blood collection for research use. Participants with
      measurable hearing will have audiology assessment performed during the initial visit.
      Participants with untreated vestibular schwannomas will have vestibular assessment performed
      during the initial visit. Genetic studies performed outside will be acceptable as
      confirmation of NF2 in enrolled patients. If needed to confirm NF2 with genetic studies, or
      for research purpose, whole genome/whole exome sequencing may be performed on blood obtained
      from subjects enrolled in this study. All participants will be evaluated by a speech language
      pathologist.

      Subjects will be followed as outpatients for up to ten years, during which clinical, and
      radiologic evaluation will be performed annually. Auditory testing will be performed annually
      for participants with measurable hearing. Participants with initially untreated vestibular
      schwannomas will be followed annually with vestibular testing. Speech and swallowing
      reassessments will be repeated if worsening of speech or swallowing is reported. Blood will
      be collected at each visit for blood biomarker testing

      Outcome measures

      We hope to understand the biologic basis for speech and swallowing dysfunction in patients
      with NF2. We will study and report the strength of association of MRI findings, clinical
      assessments cranial nerve deficits and speech/swallowing dysfunction. We hope to

      identify imaging biomarkers of hearing loss in NF2. We will attempt to discover the mode of
      peripheral neuropathy in patients with NF2. Lastly, we will attempt to discover previously
      unknown serum biomarkers associated with high tumor burden in NF2.
