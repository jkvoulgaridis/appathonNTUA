    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial was to establish the dose-response relation of sugammadex (Org
      25969) given as a reversal agent of rocuronium or vecuronium at 1-2 PTC during sevoflurane
      anesthesia for Japanese participants.

    <measure>Time From Start of Sugammadex Administration to Recovery of the Neuromuscular Response to a Ratio of 0.9 for Train-Of-Four (TOF) Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 269:45 (min:sec)</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Sugammadex Administration to Recovery of the Neuromuscular Response to a Ratio of 0.9 for Train-Of-Four (TOF) Stimulation</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>

        <population>The analysis population consisted of all randomized participants who were given at least one administration of sugammadex and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement, without any major protocol violation.</population>

          <title>Time From Start of Sugammadex Administration to Recovery of the Neuromuscular Response to a Ratio of 0.9 for Train-Of-Four (TOF) Stimulation</title>
          <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the amplitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). In this study, twitch responses were recorded until the T4/T1 Ratio reached &gt;= 0.9, the minimum acceptable ratio that indicated recovery from NMB. A faster time to recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 indicates a faster recovery from NMB.</description>
          <population>The analysis population consisted of all randomized participants who were given at least one administration of sugammadex and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement, without any major protocol violation.</population>
