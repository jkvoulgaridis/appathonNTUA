  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the personal experiences of patients who are
      treated with pelvic exenteration surgery. Pelvic exenteration is a surgical procedure in
      which the pelvic organs including the reproductive organs, bladder and/or rectum are removed.
      We would like to understand more about the physical, emotional, educational, and sexual needs
      of patients who are treated with this surgery. We will use what we learn from this study to
      help find better ways of preparing patients for this type of surgery. This will also allow us
      to be more helpful to patients' needs after surgery.

      This protocol represents the first study to comprehensively evaluate QOL in a mixed
      population of male and female patients treated with total, anterior or posterior pelvic
      exenteration. This unique approach to QOL assessment which is both domain-centered and able
      to emphasize individual differences through the C-SHIP model has the potential to set the
      standard for evaluating QOL in patients who undergo extensive pelvic surgery. The
      longitudinal design of this study facilitates the documentation of patients'responsiveness to
      change. By analyzing participants' responses at intervals we will be able to document the
      redefinition of life goals which occurs as patients adapt to their new health status. The
      data and analysis completed in first three years of this study will be used to generate
      further hypotheses for future investigation.

    <description>All patients who agree to participate will be interviewed for a baseline quality of life assessment prior to surgery. A brief in hospital interview will follow in the peri-operative period. In the ensuing months, patients will be interviewed at approximately 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively (eg: 3 month interview will be done between 8-16 weeks and 6 month interview between 20-28 months post-operatively). Annual interviews in years two through five will be employed to determine areas for future study and solicit narrative on transition toward cancer survivorship.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients (male and female) who are scheduled to undergo total, anterior or
             posterior pelvic exenteration for pelvic malignancies arising in gynecologic,
             colorectal or urologic organs are eligible for participation in the study. Anterior or
             posterior pelvic exenteration must involve formation of a permanent ostomy (urostomy
             or colostomy).

          -  Participants must be able to speak and read English proficiently.

          -  Participants must be able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older to enroll.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may be excluded or withdrawn from the study based on the following criteria.

          -  Development of a cognitive or psychiatric deficit resulting in an inability to provide
             meaningful informed consent

          -  Inability to speak or read in English.
