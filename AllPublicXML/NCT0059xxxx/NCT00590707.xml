    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see what effects sedative drugs during surgery have on
      peoples' thinking processes after they wake up.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We give sedative drugs to patients having spinal anesthesia so they are &quot;asleep&quot; (sedated)
      while we are fixing their broken hips. The spinal anesthesia provides pain relief at the site
      of surgery, while the sedative drugs keep people &quot;asleep&quot; during the procedure. We want to
      find out whether the amount of sedation we give might (1) make patients be confused when they
      wake up or (2) have anything to do with how well patients can do their ordinary daily
      routines a few months after their surgery.

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Presence of Delirium as Assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative days up to hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of delirium is assessed by the confusion assessment method (CAM), during postoperative Day 1 to Day 5 or up to hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. The CAM consists of 4 features: 1-Onset, 2-Inattention, 3-Disorganized thinking, and 4-altered level of consciousness. The diagnosis of delirium by CAM is based on the presence of features 1 and 2, and either 3 or 4.</description>

    <description>The presence of delirium is assessed by the confusion assessment method (CAM), after 1 month postoperative. The CAM consists of 4 features: 1-Onset, 2-Inattention, 3-Disorganized thinking, and 4-altered level of consciousness. The diagnosis of delirium by CAM is based on the presence of features 1 and 2, and either 3 or 4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Dementia Rating consists of 6 domains (&quot;boxes&quot;) of function: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain (&quot;box&quot;) is rated on a 5-point scale (0= no impairment, 0.5=questionable impairment, 1= mild impairment, 2= moderated impairment, 3= severe impairment. The CDR-SOB score is a sum of these ratings, for a total Sum of boxes ranging from 0-18, where 0=cognitively intact. Increasing sum of boxes score is associated with greater cognitive impairment.</description>

        <description>The presence of delirium is assessed by the confusion assessment method (CAM), during postoperative Day 1 to Day 5 or up to hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. The CAM consists of 4 features: 1-Onset, 2-Inattention, 3-Disorganized thinking, and 4-altered level of consciousness. The diagnosis of delirium by CAM is based on the presence of features 1 and 2, and either 3 or 4.</description>
