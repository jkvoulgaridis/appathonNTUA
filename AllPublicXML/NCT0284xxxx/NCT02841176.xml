      This study will be an open label pilot study to explore the utility of thermography in
      assessing response to Golimumab treatment in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Ten patients
      fulfilling the Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) for Psoriatic
      Arthritis with active disease and eligible for anti-TNF therapy will be invited to
      participate in this study. They will be assessed at 4 time points during the study: prior to
      their first anti-TNF medication (screening and basal visits), and subsequently within 5 days
      after their 2nd and 4th doses of monthly Golimumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic Arthritis is a joint problem (arthritis) that often occurs with a skin condition
      called psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common skin problem that causes red patches on the body, and
      it is an on-going (chronic) inflammatory condition. About 1 in 20 people with psoriasis will
      develop arthritis with the skin condition. In most cases, psoriasis comes before the
      arthritis. The cause of Psoriatic Arthritis is not known.

      Psoriatic Arthritis can be treated using different types of drugs to reduce pain and swelling
      of the joints. New medicines that block an inflammatory protein called tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) are being widely used for progressive Psoriatic Arthritis, as is the case of the drug
      Golimumab.

      Thermography is the use of images to study heat distribution in different parts of the body,
      and allows one to see variations in temperature, for example in detecting joint inflammation.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate whether thermography is able to reliably detect joint
      inflammation in Psoriatic Arthritis, and whether it is able to detect improvement or
      worsening in inflammation during medical treatment with Golimumab. This involves assessing
      disease activity using some questionnaires, examining of patient joints, performing blood
      tests, ultrasound and thermography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women aged 18 to 95 years

          2. Patients fulfilling the CASPAR criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis with active disease

          3. Subjects eligible for anti-TNF therapy (ie. have 3 or more swollen and 3 or more
             tender joints who have failed treatment with 2 disease modifying drugs) and planning
             to be treated with Golimumab.

          4. Subjects may be on oral steroids (prednisone ≤10 mg/day, or equivalent corticosteroid)
