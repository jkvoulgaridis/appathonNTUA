  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without atezolizumab work in
      treating patients with non-HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread from its original site
      of growth to nearby tissues or lymph nodes and is not amenable to surgical resection (locally
      advanced unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Olaparib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. It is not known whether giving olaparib with or without atezolizumab will work better
      in patients with non-HER2-positive breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) between two study arms, i.e., olaparib
      monotherapy (arm 1) and olaparib + atezolizumab in combination (arm 2) based on normal
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-HER2-positive breast cancer harboring homologous deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) repair (HDR) through BRCA 1/2 mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) between the two study arms based on immune
      response criteria.

      II. To compare the time to treatment failure (TTF) between the two study arms based on immune
      response criteria and normal RECIST.

      III. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) between the two study arms based on immune
      response criteria and normal RECIST.

      IV. To compare the duration of response (DoR) between the two study arms based on immune
      response criteria and normal RECIST.

      V. Determine the changes in extent of mutational burden in BRCA 1/2 mutated tumors at
      baseline and at progression.

      VI. Evaluate and characterize changes in the extent of PD-L1 expression and tumor immune
      infiltrates.

      VII. Retrospectively evaluate tumors with limited immune infiltrate (e.g. &quot;non-inflamed&quot;) to
      determine if PARPi increased immune infiltration.

      VIII. Determine the immune-related best overall response (irBOR) of olaparib in combination
      with atezolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic non-HER2+ breast cancer harboring HDR
      through BRCA 1/2 mutation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate changes in candidate neoantigen profiles and immune/inflammation signatures using
      DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing in serial tumor biopsies.

      II. Evaluate and characterize circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and immune parameters in blood.

      III. Test the hypothesis that DNA repair status affects the tumor-immune interaction.

      IV. Characterize mechanism of action of the PARP inhibitor olaparib. V. To explore the
      inclusion of patient reported symptomatic adverse events. VI. To use anti-Kynurenine
      antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as unbiased metabolome studies on plasma to
      understand the metabolic consequences of PARP-inhibition and their effects on immune
      infiltrates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      disease progression may cross-over to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib as Arm I and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly.

                    -  Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA)

                    -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency

                    -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months
                       (not requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA], methotrexate,

             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed
             tomography (CT) scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field
             (fibrosis) is permitted if recovered

          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to cycle 1, day 1 and patients must have
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery; anticipation of need for a major
             surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before cycle 1, day 1 or

             interstitial bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan

             compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib and atezolizumab are have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with olaparib and atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with olaparib and atezolizumab

          -  Any prior grade &gt;= 3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving any previous

             of long QT syndrome

          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin,
             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,

             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil); the required washout
