  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to use quetiapine as an adjunct treatment to treatment as usual to
      improve both substance use disorder (SUD) and mood symptoms in youth with SUD and severe mood
      dysregulation (SMD). This is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled parallel design
      study. Youth with symptoms of mood dysregulation and active substance use that meets criteria
      for a SUD will be randomized to adjunct treatment with quetiapine or placebo. The
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with quetiapine will lead to a reduction in
      substance use, improvement in mood, and lead to greater engagement in outpatient treatment.

    <measure>Change in the number of days of most problematic substance use in the previous month</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days of substance use over the past month for the substance that the participant identifies as most problematic will be assessed by participants' self report</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of mania</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of mania will be assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The YMRS consists of 11 items rated on a scale from 0 (symptoms not present) to 4 (symptoms extremely severe). The total YMRS score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores on the YMRS indicate greater symptoms of mania.</description>

    <measure>Change in the number of negative urine toxicology specimens</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of negative urine toxicology specimens will be assessed for the substance that the participant identifies as most problematic.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in craving for the substance that the participant identifies as most problematic</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Craving will be measured by the Weiss Craving Scale. This scale consists of 3 items rated on a scale from 0 (no desire/likelihood of use) to 9 (strong desire/likelihood of use). The total Weiss Craving Scale score ranges from 0 to 27. Higher scores on the Weiss Craving Scale indicate greater cravings for a substance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of depression will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) scale. The BDI-II consists of 21 items rated on a scale from 0 (symptoms not present) to 3 (symptoms extremely severe). Total scores on the BDI-II range from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate greater symptoms of depression.</description>
