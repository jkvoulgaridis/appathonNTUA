  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial seeks to assess if potassium nitrate (KNO3) therapy improves exercise capacity and
      oxygen uptake in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of heart failure patients exhibit preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection
      fraction (EF), and therefore have HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). There are currently no proven
      effective pharmacologic interventions. Exercise intolerance with reduced aerobic capacity is
      the hallmark of HFpEF and greatly impairs quality of life (QOL). During exercise, blood
      vessels within active muscle vasodilator, increasing perfusion to the muscle bed. Nitric
      oxide is a chief mediator of this process. Inorganic nitrate can ultimately be converted to
      nitric oxide. This conversion occurs preferentially at the site of exercising muscle,
      allowing for vasodilation to occur, hence increasing blood flow to the working muscle.
      Preliminary data suggest that inorganic nitrate improves exercise tolerance in HFpEF. The
      investigator will aim to test this hypothesis in a larger group.
