  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a
      combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and Interferon beta-1b in hospitalized patients with MERS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir /ritonavir and
      recombinant Interferon beta-1b combination given with optimal supportive care compared to
      placebo with optimal supportive care for patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV
      infection requiring hospital admission.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a recursive two-stage group sequential multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized controlled trial. The trial is initially designed to include 2 two-stage components. The first two-stage component is designed to adjust sample size and determine futility stopping, but not efficacy stopping (n=34). The second two-stage component is designed to determine efficacy stopping and possibly readjustment of sample size.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion criteria at eligibility assessment

          1. Adult (defined as ≥18 years of age);

          2. Laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection by reverse-transcription polymerase
             chain reaction (RT-PCR) from any diagnostic sampling source; and

          3. New organ dysfunction that is judged to related to MERS including: hypoxia defined as
             requirement of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations &gt;90%, hypotension
             (systolic blood pressure&lt;90 mmHg) or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication, renal
             impairment (increase of creatinine by 50% from baseline, glomerular filtration rate
             reduction by &gt;25% from baseline or urine output of &lt;0.5 ml/kg for 6 hours - Risk stage
             by RIFLE criteria), neurologic (reduction of Glasgow Coma Scale by 2 or more, i.e. 13
             or lower of 15 points), thrombocytopenia (&lt;150,000 platelets/mm3) or gastrointestinal
             symptoms that requires hospitalization (e.g. severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or/and
             abdominal pain).

        Exclusion criteria at eligibility assessment

          1. Suicidal ideation based on history (contraindication to interferon (IFN)-β1b);

          2. Known allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to lopinavir/ritonavir or to recombinant
             IFN-β1b, including, but not limited to, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson
             syndrome, erythema multiforme, urticaria or angioedema;

          3. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5 fold the upper limit in the hospital's
             laboratory;

          4. Use of medications that are contraindicated with lopinavir/ritonavir and that cannot
             be replaced or stopped during the study period, such as CYP3A inhibitors;

          5. Pregnancy - eligible and consenting female participants in childbearing age will be
             tested for pregnancy before enrollment in the study;

          6. Known HIV infection, because of concerns about the development of resistance to
             lopinavir/ritonavir if used without combination with other anti-HIV drugs; or

          7. Patient likely to be transferred to a non-participating hospital within 72 hours.
