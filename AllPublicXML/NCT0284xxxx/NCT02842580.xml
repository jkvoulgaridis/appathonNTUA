  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intensity of tumour response appears to be correlated with the feasibility and the
      duration of a therapeutic pause or of a reduced maintenance therapy maintained until
      progression in patients initially controlled by so-called &quot;induction&quot; chemotherapy.
      Bevacizumab combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy (5-FU, irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin) has
      shown that it is possible to improve the tumour response rate and patient prognosis in 1st
      and 2nd lines. With a very favourable safety profile , it is an excellent candidate as
      induction treatment and also as maintenance treatment. Prospective data from recent trials
      have actually demonstrated improvement in PFS and/or overall survival with bevacizumab
      maintenance alone or in combination with 5FU (or capecitabine) after induction chemotherapy
      (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX + bevacizumab).

      At the same time, the maintenance of anti-angiogenic pressure after progression in 1st line
      metastatic has demonstrated its benefit in terms of PFS and overall survival. Bevacizumab
      maintenance in 2nd line metastatic, despite progression, thus appears to be a valid strategy.

      Thus, the objective of this work is to combine continuous blocking of angiogenesis by
      bevacizumab given on the first 3 metastatic lines in a randomised phase II trial evaluating a
      &quot;descending&quot; strategy of immediate optimisation by 4 cycles of FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab and 4
      cycles of FOLFIRI-bevacizumab, followed by maintenance treatment with 5FU-bevacizumab until
      progression (re-introduction of induction in case of progression) and evaluate an &quot;ascending&quot;
      strategy with 5FU-bevacizumab immediately followed, at progression, by the introduction of
      irinotecan, then oxaliplatin, with maintenance of blocking of angiogenesis by bevacizumab.
