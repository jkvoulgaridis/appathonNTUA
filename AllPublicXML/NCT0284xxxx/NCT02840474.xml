  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The human body uses antibodies as one way to help fight infection. VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS
      are antibodies directed against the HIV virus. Researchers want to see if they are safe and
      well tolerated. In Part A of the study, the researchers studied VRC01LS. Enrollment in Part A
      of the study is finished. In Part B, the researchers are studying VRC07-523LS. Depending on
      which antibody received, they will study the amount of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in the body and
      how it changes over time. They will check to see if people who get VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS
      develop an immune response to it.

      Objective:

      To see if VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS are safe and well tolerated.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-70 who are HIV infected but otherwise healthy. Females who are able to get
      pregnant must be willing to use birth control during the study.

      Design:

      Participants will get the study drug one time, by IV infusion. A needle will guide a thin
      tube into a vein. The study drug mixed with salt water will be dripped into the vein over
      about 30 minutes.

      Participants will be monitored for 30 minutes after the infusion.

      Blood samples will be taken at the following times:

        -  Once before the infusion

        -  5 times in the 4 hours after the infusion

        -  1 time 24 hours after infusion. Some participants may have 3 optional blood draws in the
           time period between 4 and 24 hours.

      For 3 days after the infusion, participants will write their temperature and symptoms in a
      diary.

      There will be a total of 23 study visits over 48 weeks. Ten visits will be in the first 4
      weeks. At all visits, participants will answer health questions and give blood samples.

      Study Design:

      Open-label, single dose study to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and virologic
      impact of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults.

      Study Hypotheses:

      This is the first study of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults. The primary
      hypothesis is that both VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS will be safe for intravenous administration
      to HIV-1-infected adults. The secondary hypothesis is that VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS will be
      detectable in human sera with a definable halflife. Part A (VRC01LS) of the study has
      completed enrollment.

      Product Description:

      VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) and VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB are human MAbs targeted to the CD4+
      binding site of HIV-1. Both MAbs are modifications of the VRC01 MAb (which has been shown to
      be safe and to have antiviral activity in human studies) with the addition of the LS , a
      2-amino acid mutation designed to improve the half-life of the antibody. There are no changes
      to the Fab binding sites. These MAbs were developed and manufactured by VRC/NIAID/NIH under
      cGMP at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials
      Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD. Vials are provided at 100
      mg/mL.

      Participants:

      HIV-1-infected viremic adults; 18-70 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This study will assess VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS administered at 40 mg/kg IV in HIV-infected
      viremic participants. Participants will enroll in one of two parts: Part A (VRC01LS) and Part
      B (VRC07-523LS). Enrollment into Part A (VRC01LS) is complete. Part B enrollment will include
      7 participants (up to 10 participants may be enrolled in the event that there are
      participants who do not complete the sampling schedule) who will receive VRC07-523LS. Safety
      lab samples, HIV viral load, CD4+ count, PK samples, and blood samples for human anti-VRC01LS
      antibody (Part A) and human anti-VRC07-523LS antibody (Part B) detection will be drawn at
      baseline and intervals throughout the study. Participants will keep a daily diary of
      reactogenicity symptoms for 3 days after study product administration and will be queried at
      each study visit for adverse events. Participants in Part B will be strongly encouraged to
      initiate 3-drug ART (prescribed by their primary HIV clinician; not study-provided) any time
      after completing day 14 study evaluations. Results from Part A and Part B may be analyzed,
      published, and presented separately since they involve two different MAbs.

      VRC 607/A5378 Study Schema:

        -  Part: A (Enrollment Complete); Participants: 7; Product: VRC01LS; Administration
           Schedule (Day 0): 40 mg/kg IV.

        -  Part: B; Participants: 7; Product: VRC07-523LS; Administration Schedule (Day 0): 40
           mg/kg IV.

             -  Total Participants: 14*

                  -  The expected enrollment is 14 participants (i.e., a minimum of 7 participants
                     in each part). However, up to 20 participants (i.e., 10 participants in each
                     part) may be enrolled in the event that there are participants who do not
                     complete the sampling schedule, if additional PK evaluations are needed, or if
                     additional participants are needed for safety evaluations.

      Study Duration:

      Participants will be followed for 48 weeks after study product administration.
