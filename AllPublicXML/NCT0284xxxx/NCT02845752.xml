  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exercise can be prolonged in COPD can by
      the inhaled bronchodilator Stiolto Respimat. The study will identify whether any endurance
      benefit is due to reduction in fatigue that originates within the skeletal muscles and/or
      from effects on neural activation of the skeletal muscles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have reduced exercise tolerance.
      One mechanism for this is thought to be due to dynamic hyperinflation during exercise (an
      increase in the end-expiratory lung volume) that contributes to the sensation of
      breathlessness. Whether this also contributes to inhibiting motor recruitment, and reduces
      the available power output (termed performance fatigue; PF), is not well understood.
      Preliminary data suggests that many COPD patients, unlike healthy subjects, stop exercise
      with a 'skeletal muscle power reserve' i.e. the ability to acutely increase muscle power
      output. This suggests that they are limited in the exercise task by mechanisms other than
      acute intramuscular limitations to power production (termed muscle fatigue; MF). Exercise
      tolerance is increased by treatment with the fixed-dose combination bronchodilator, STIOLTO™
      RESPIMAT®. We hypothesize that increased exercise tolerance with STIOLTO™ RESPIMAT® (reduced
      performance fatigue; PF) will be mediated by a combination of: 1) reduced inhibition of
      muscle activation (termed activation fatigue; AF) allowing patients to drive their leg
      muscles harder, and thus; 2) increased muscle fatigue (MF).

    <description>Constant work rate (CWR) exercise causes fatigue. Fatigue is measured by the difference between pre-CWR and post-CWR maximal voluntary isokinetic power i.e. how much maximal voluntary isokinetic power declines during CWR. The magnitude of fatigue is measured in watts at the time of the shortest exercise duration in either study arm, which is termed &quot;isotime&quot;. A smaller value (in watts) of performance fatigue means that the intervention was associated with less fatigue after a given CWR exercise duration (i.e. at isotime).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Constant work rate (CWR) exercise causes fatigue and reduces muscle activation. The relationship between muscle activation and power is measured at baseline (unfatigued condition). Fatigue is measured by the difference between pre-CWR and post-CWR maximal voluntary isokinetic power i.e. how much maximal voluntary isokinetic power declines during CWR. The fraction of fatigue that is ascribed to reduced muscle activity is then calculated. The magnitude of activation fatigue is measured in EMG activity and expressed in watts at the time of the shortest exercise duration in either study arm, which is termed &quot;isotime&quot;. A smaller value (in watts) of activation fatigue means that the intervention was associated with a less reduction in EMG actvity after a given CWR exercise duration (i.e. at isotime).</description>

        <title>The Magnitude of Change in Isokinetic Power (Performance Fatigue, PF) Associated With Stiolto Respimat Compared With Placebo Respimat at Isotime During Constant Work Rate Exercise (CWR)</title>
        <description>Constant work rate (CWR) exercise causes fatigue. Fatigue is measured by the difference between pre-CWR and post-CWR maximal voluntary isokinetic power i.e. how much maximal voluntary isokinetic power declines during CWR. The magnitude of fatigue is measured in watts at the time of the shortest exercise duration in either study arm, which is termed &quot;isotime&quot;. A smaller value (in watts) of performance fatigue means that the intervention was associated with less fatigue after a given CWR exercise duration (i.e. at isotime).</description>

        <title>The Magnitude of Change Electromyographic (EMG) Muscle Activity (Activation Fatigue, AF) Associated With Stiolto Respimat Compared With Placebo Respimat at Isotime During Constant Work Rate Exercise (CWR)</title>
        <description>Constant work rate (CWR) exercise causes fatigue and reduces muscle activation. The relationship between muscle activation and power is measured at baseline (unfatigued condition). Fatigue is measured by the difference between pre-CWR and post-CWR maximal voluntary isokinetic power i.e. how much maximal voluntary isokinetic power declines during CWR. The fraction of fatigue that is ascribed to reduced muscle activity is then calculated. The magnitude of activation fatigue is measured in EMG activity and expressed in watts at the time of the shortest exercise duration in either study arm, which is termed &quot;isotime&quot;. A smaller value (in watts) of activation fatigue means that the intervention was associated with a less reduction in EMG actvity after a given CWR exercise duration (i.e. at isotime).</description>
