  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-arterially in
      combination with oral metronomic capecitabine or pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable,
      refractory liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors, including
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A third arm will study the intra-tumoral injection of
      Ad-p53 combined with nivolumab infusions in recurrent head and neck squamous cell cancer
      (HNSCC). This safety study has a standard 3+3 design for arms A and B; .HNSCC will be placed
      in a single dosing cohort. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined as well for
      intra-arterial infusions, and the entire study will determine the general efficacy using
      RECIST 1.1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria. Safety will be followed using the CTCAE
      listings for adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study split into 3 arms. Arm A will follow the combination of Ad-p53
      administered intra-arterially in combination with oral metronomic capecitabine while Arm B
      follows the intra-arterial administration of Ad-p53 combined with pembrolizumab, both in
      patients with unresectable, refractory liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and
      other solid tumors, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Arm C will follow the
      combination of intra-tumoral injections of Ad-p53 and nivolumab infusions. Arms A and B have
      a standard 3+3 design, with dosing following the initial cohort determined by MTD and DLT
      criteria as well as safety and tolerance. Arm C will be a single dosing cohort followed for
      safety and efficacy. All patients will be followed for adverse events and preliminary
      efficacy. In Arms A and B, the Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined. All patients
      will be followed for general safety and preliminary efficacy using RECIST 1.1 and
      Immune-Related Response Criteria. CEA levels will also be followed for patients with
      metastatic colo-rectal cancer. Biomarker testing of archival or fresh tissue is performed
      during the study. In Arms A and B, patients will undergo a maximum of 2 8-week cycles, with
      scans every 8 weeks. For Arm B, patients will undergo a maximum of 3 28-day Cycles. All
      patients will continue on the background therapy for any additional cycles. No additional
      biopsies are planned following Screening. Enrollment will be up to 24 patients.
