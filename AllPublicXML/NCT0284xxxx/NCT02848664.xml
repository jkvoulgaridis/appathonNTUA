      The purpose of this study is to develop appropriate training methods and gather participant
      feedback on their use of the Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Training Device (PMSST). The PMSST is
      a small device that provides external vibratory stimulation to the larynx during swallowing
      and swallowing training. A secondary purpose of the study is to determine how 3 months of use
      of the PMSST affects swallowing physiology, brain activation, oral intake and quality of
      life. This was an uncontrolled pilot study aimed at gaining patient feedback on use of the
      vibratory device.

      The investigators are currently developing the Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Trainer to continue
      treatment of dysphagia after the patient is discharged to home. The self-training device is
      worn around the neck with motors placed externally on the skin over the thyroid cartilage to
      provide vibratory stimulation to the larynx. The vibrations activate the sensory receptors
      inside the larynx which excite central nervous system (CNS) control for swallowing and can
      help the patient to initiate swallowing. Patients can use the self-training device at home to
      promote swallowing rehabilitation during daily swallowing practice. The device can also be
      programmed to vibrate at regular intervals throughout the day to promote saliva swallows.
      Using this method, the patient can continue their swallowing therapy independently and in a
      manner that is cost effective. A previous Phase I trial compared the clinical outcomes of 8
      patients with chronic dysphagia using either an intramuscular electrical stimulation implant
      device or an external vibratory stimulator to practice swallowing daily at home. Functional
      outcomes of oral intake improved with both devices. As the external vibratory stimulation has
      the advantage of being external and completely noninvasive, it has been selected for further
      development as a self-training device. A second pilot study examined the effect of different
      frequencies of vibration on the swallowing frequency of healthy participants and found
      swallowing rate significantly increased from baseline when using a vibration of either 70 Hz
      or 150 Hz (Mulheren and Ludlow, 2017). Data has also been collected on the effect of
      different vibration characteristics on swallowing in participants who have swallowing
      problems after stroke (Kamarunas et al., in press).

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to allow patients with chronic dysphagia to use the
      Self-Trainer for daily swallowing practice in their home and collect feedback on device use
      and satisfaction and use. Objective information on the effectiveness of self-training for
      swallowing rehabilitation will also be gathered.

      Objectives:

        1. To develop and evaluate training for participants and caregivers to use the
           self-trainer.

        2. To gather participant feedback on the use of the device after 3 months of daily
           practice.

        3. To determine how 3 months of daily practice with the Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Trainer
           affects swallowing physiology, brain activation, oral intake, and quality of life in
           participants with chronic dysphagia.

    <measure>Change in Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) Rating</measure>

    <description>An ordinal scale of 7 levels of severity of swallowing disorder with 1 being the lowest level and 7 being the highest level.
Level 1 is Severe dysphagia Nothing per oral and unable to tolerate any per oral liquid/substance safely.
Level 2 is Moderately severe dysphagia, requires maximum assistance or use of strategies with partial per oral only, tolerates at least one consistency safely with total use of strategies.
Level 3 is Moderate Dysphagia, requires total assist, supervision, or strategies with two or more consistencies restricted.
Level 4 is Mild-moderate Dysphagia, Requires intermittent supervision/cueing, one or two consistencies restricted level 5 is Mild dysphagia: requires distant supervision may need one diet consistency restricted Level 6 Within functional limits, modified independence Level 7 Normal in all situations</description>

    <description>Calibrated kinematic measures from videofluoroscopic imaging during a modified barium swallow study. Computed the change in peak elevation in millimeters during swallowing from the rest position before swallowing for two structures: the larynx and the hyoid bone. The peak elevation of the two structures were compared by subtracting the hyoid peak elevation from the laryngeal peak elevation. If the measure was positive the larynx was elevated to a greater degree than the hyoid bone resulting in vestibule closure and airway protection during the swallow.</description>

    <measure>Cortical Activation for Swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>From before onset of device use to return 3 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The level of cortical activation for swallowing was measured using near infra-red spectroscopy. Overall blood oxygenation level during swallowing was compared with the level during a non activation period prior to swallowing. To compute Z scores, the change in overall level between swallowing and prior to swallowing was divided by the standard deviation of the level prior to swallowing. The Z scores measured prior to and post device use for 3 months were compared.</description>

               1. Penetration-Aspiration Scale score of 2 or greater verified by modified barium
                  swallow (Rosenbek et al., 1996) and/or

               2. Functional Oral Intake Scale score of 5 or lower (Crary et al., 2005)

          -  Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 23 or greater indicating
             cognitive ability to follow directions and communicate preferences

          -  Willingness to travel to Sentara Rockingham Memorial Hospital 2 or more times to
             undergo initial evaluation, device use training and checkup at 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Cardiac problems

               -  history of cardiac rhythm condition (including heart murmur or cardiac
                  arrhythmia)

               -  cardiac pacemaker in place

          -  Highly-pigmented (dark) skin color is an exclusion criterion because near-infrared
             spectroscopy requires the measurement of the degree of absorption of different
             wavelengths of light after being reflected back through the scalp. Highly pigmented
             skin interferes with wavelength transmission, making the measurement of changes in
             absorption inaccurate.

             Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan.

             medical hardware)

          -  Presence of certain tattoos with ferromagnetic metal or permanent makeup, due to the
             exposure to high magnetic force through MRI procedures.

          -  Subjects who were metal workers as a previous occupation will also be excluded due to
             the possibility of unknown/undetected metal in their body.

Participants and their caregivers received training to criterion on how to use the device and were then given a device to take home for 3 months for daily use in swallowing training and for saliva swallowing throughout the day. They were asked to use the device for a minimum of 60 practice trials of swallowing their own and to wear the device to assist with saliva swallowing.

        <description>Calibrated kinematic measures from videofluoroscopic imaging during a modified barium swallow study. Computed the change in peak elevation in millimeters during swallowing from the rest position before swallowing for two structures: the larynx and the hyoid bone. The peak elevation of the two structures were compared by subtracting the hyoid peak elevation from the laryngeal peak elevation. If the measure was positive the larynx was elevated to a greater degree than the hyoid bone resulting in vestibule closure and airway protection during the swallow.</description>
