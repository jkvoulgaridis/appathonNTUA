    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the malabsorption blood test (MBT), stool
      coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and stool bomb calorimetry (BC) methods as potential
      screening or diagnostic tests for reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic
      insufficiency (RPF/PI). A further objective is to determine the test responses before and
      after pancreatic enzyme medication administration (Creon36™) in the patients with chronic
      pancreatitis (CP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI) contributes to poor
      clinical outcome in a number of diseases and conditions. The incidence, mechanism and
      substantial adverse clinical outcomes of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) are well known in
      patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the life sustaining role of pancreatic enzyme
      medication in CF care is well established. Much less is known about the incidence and impact
      of RPF/PI in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Reliable non-invasive screening or
      diagnostic tests with acceptable patient burden are not available for RPF/PI.

      This is a cohort study of subjects with CP who will be evaluated before and after pancreatic
      enzyme medication (Creon36™) administration. A cohort of healthy subjects will serve as a
      comparison group and will be evaluated only once.

      Subjects with CP will receive Creon36™, a pancreatic enzyme medication, and fat and energy
      absorption will be evaluated using three methods: MBT, CFA, and BC before and after
      administration of Creon36™. Many patients with CP are at risk for RPF/PI yet they rarely
      undergo diagnostic testing. Pancreatic enzyme medication will likely improve clinical
      outcomes and quality of life in some of those with RPF/PI. A cohort of healthy volunteers
      will be evaluated with the three methods to provide essential comparison data to optimize the
      understanding and interpretation of the findings from the three methods and the RPF/PI cohort
      with CP. There will be no intervention for the healthy cohort.

          <description>Healthy controls will fast for 12 hours prior to the malabsorption blood test (MBT) testing, consume the MBT breakfast meal following this fast, have blood drawn (MBT, vitamins A, D, E and K, zinc, selenium, and prealbumin) prior to MBT breakfast consumption and each hour for 8 hours after consumption, consume a low-fat study lunch, eat a moderate fat diet for 4 days during home diet and stool collection, maintain a 3-day food record, collect stool over 72 hours, have body size and composition assessment, complete quality of life questionnaires, home environment and health questionnaires, and adverse events diary. Controls will only have 1 study visit and receive no intervention.</description>

          <description>The fat absorption pattern in CP subjects before and after treatment with Creon36™ will be compared. Mean HA AUC will be calculated for the CP subjects before and after the medication and compared to determine whether there is a difference in the fat absorption in the same subjects between the two time points.</description>
          <population>For this paired analysis, twenty subjects had valid tests at both time points. Two subjects were excluded from baseline; one did not complete the study meal for a valid test, and one was a significant outlier calling into question the validity of the test. Two subjects were excluded from follow-up, as they did not complete the study meal or test.</population>

Subjects will take Creon36™ for 9 days at a daily dose of 72,000 lipase units per meal (two capsules) and 36,000 units per snack (one capsule), with each capsule containing 36,000 lipase units. Subjects will take Creon36™ for three days prior to Visit 2 and the day of Visit 2.
