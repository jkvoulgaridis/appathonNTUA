  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of a single intravenous
      autologous or allogeneic, unrelated cord blood (CB) infusion in children ages 2-7 years with
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants will be randomly assigned to Sequence A,
      consisting of a single infusion of CB cells at baseline followed 6 months later by a single
      infusion of placebo, or Sequence B, consisting of an infusion of placebo at baseline followed
      6 months later by an infusion of CB cells. All participants will ultimately be treated with
      CB cells at some point during the study. Participants with an available qualified autologous
      CB unit will receive autologous cells, and those without a suitable autologous CB unit
      available will receive cells from a ≥4/6 HLA-matched, ABO-matched allogeneic, unrelated donor
      CB unit from the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank. All infusions will be double-blinded. The primary
      outcomes will be assessed 6 months after the initial infusion in the sequence. Additional
      testing for secondary exploratory analyses will be performed at 12 months. Duration of study
      participation will be 12 months from the time of baseline infusion.

    <measure>Change in Social Communication as Measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3) Socialization domain standard score has mean=100 and standard deviation=15 (range: 20-140). Higher scores indicate better developed adaptive social behavior. The change in the Socialization domain standard score was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6. Changes in the Socialization standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Socialization standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vineland Socialization Domain Raw Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There are 3 raw scores within the Socialization domain of the VABS-3. These are the Interpersonal Relationships Raw Score (range: 0-86), the Play and Leisure Raw Score (range: 0-72), and the Coping Skills Raw Score (range: 0-66). Higher numbers on all three scores reflect better functioning in each area. Each raw score is the sum of the item scores in the respective subdomain of Socialization skills. The items are scored as follows: 2=usually present, 1=sometimes present, 0= never present. The item scores are assigned by a trained interviewer who interviews the parent of the child participating in the study. The change in raw score was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6. Positive scores indicate improvement over time whereas negative scores indicate worsening, and zero indicates no change. The scores are not norm-referenced.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vineland Socialization Domain Age Equivalent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There are 3 age equivalent scores within the Socialization domain of the VABS-3: the Interpersonal Relationships Age Equivalent, the Play and Leisure Age Equivalent, and the Coping Sills Age Equivalent. An individual participant's age equivalent represents the chronological age (in years:months) at which their score would be considered normative. The age equivalent ranges are 0:0-22:0, 0:0-20:0, and 2:0-22:0 for the Interpersonal Relationships, Play and Leisure and Coping Skills age equivalents, respectively. The change in this age equivalent was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6 and expressed as a number of months. Positive scores indicate increases in the age equivalent of the participant's social communication skills over time and are considered an improvement. Negative scores indicate decreases in the age equivalent of the participant's social communication skills and are considered worsening, and zero indicates no change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory (PDD-BI) Composite Standard Score (Parent Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PDD-BI is an informant-based rating scale that assesses problem behaviors as well as appropriate social, language, and learning/memory skills. The PDD-BI assesses both social impairments and development of pro-social skills that are integral to improved reciprocal social behavior. The PDD-BI renders T scores (mean=50, standard deviation=10) based on comparisons to a standardized ASD population. The Autism Composite T score ranges from 10-100. The typical child with autism scores between 40-60.Higher scores indicate more severe autism symptoms and lower scores reflect milder symptoms. Change in this score from Baseline to Month 6 was calculated for each participant. Negative change scores indicate improvement in autism symptoms over time whereas positive scores indicate worsening of symptoms, and zero indicates no change in symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score, Clinician Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7 point scale completed at the baseline and 6-month visits that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's symptoms of autism at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. There are 3 CGI-S scores: the Social Communication Score, the Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Score, and the Overall Score. The clinician's rates the severity of autism symptoms - 1, normal, no symptoms; 2, borderline level of symptoms; 3, mild symptoms; 4, moderate symptoms; 5, marked symptoms; 6, severe symptoms; or 7, extremely severe symptoms. Increases in the change score represent increases in symptom severity, decreases in the change score indicate improvement, and zero indicates no change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions - Global Improvement (CGI-I) Score, Clinician Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's autism symptoms have improved or worsened relative to a baseline assessment. The symptoms are rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. There are three separate CGI-I ratings: social communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive interests and behaviors, and overall improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test (Clinician Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test is a standardized evaluation of the child's expressive one-word vocabulary by a trained clinician. It tests an individual's ability to name, with one word, objects, actions, and concepts when presented with color illustrations. Higher EOWPVT standard scores reflect a better vocabulary. The minimum score is age-dependent (years:months) as follows. For a child age 2:0 to 2:1 the minimum is 65; age 2:2-2:3 (min=62); age 2:4-2:5 (min=60); age 2:6-2:7 (min=58); age 2:8-2:9 (min=57); age 2:10-2:11 (min=56); age 3:0 and older (min=55). The maximum possible score across all ages is 145. The change in score from Baseline to Month 6 was the outcome measure. Increases reflect increases in vocabulary skills, decreasing reflect decreases in vocabulary skills, and zero reflects no change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II (VABS-II) Communication Subscale Standard Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VABS-II measures adaptive functioning in socialization, communication, daily living, and motor skills. The Communication subscale standard score is derived by summing norm-referenced (by age group and sex) v-scale scores (mean=15, standard deviation=3) from the Receptive, Expressive, and Written communication subdomains and standardizing this sum to a normal distribution with mean=100 and standard deviation=15. Changes in the Communication standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Communication standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>

    <description>The VABS-II measures adaptive functioning in socialization, communication, daily living, and motor skills. The Daily Living standard score is derived by summing norm-referenced (by age group and sex) v-scale scores (mean=15, standard deviation=3) from the Personal, Domestic and Community subdomains and standardizing this sum to a normal distribution with mean=100 and standard deviation=15. Changes in the Daily Living standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Daily Living standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>

        <title>Change in Social Communication as Measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3)</title>
        <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3) Socialization domain standard score has mean=100 and standard deviation=15 (range: 20-140). Higher scores indicate better developed adaptive social behavior. The change in the Socialization domain standard score was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6. Changes in the Socialization standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Socialization standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>

          <title>Change in Social Communication as Measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3)</title>
          <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3) Socialization domain standard score has mean=100 and standard deviation=15 (range: 20-140). Higher scores indicate better developed adaptive social behavior. The change in the Socialization domain standard score was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6. Changes in the Socialization standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Socialization standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>

These are the Interpersonal Relationships Raw Score (range: 0-86), the Play and Leisure Raw Score (range: 0-72), and the Coping Skills Raw Score (range: 0-66). Higher numbers on all three scores reflect better functioning in each area. Each raw score is the sum of the item scores in the respective subdomain of Socialization skills. The items are scored as follows: 2=usually present, 1=sometimes present, 0= never present. The item scores are assigned by a trained interviewer who interviews the parent of the child participating in the study. The change in raw score was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6. Positive scores indicate improvement over time whereas negative scores indicate worsening, and zero indicates no change. The scores are not norm-referenced.</description>

        <description>There are 3 age equivalent scores within the Socialization domain of the VABS-3: the Interpersonal Relationships Age Equivalent, the Play and Leisure Age Equivalent, and the Coping Sills Age Equivalent. An individual participant's age equivalent represents the chronological age (in years:months) at which their score would be considered normative. The age equivalent ranges are 0:0-22:0, 0:0-20:0, and 2:0-22:0 for the Interpersonal Relationships, Play and Leisure and Coping Skills age equivalents, respectively. The change in this age equivalent was calculated for each participant from Baseline to Month 6 and expressed as a number of months. Positive scores indicate increases in the age equivalent of the participant's social communication skills over time and are considered an improvement. Negative scores indicate decreases in the age equivalent of the participant's social communication skills and are considered worsening, and zero indicates no change.</description>

The PDD-BI assesses both social impairments and development of pro-social skills that are integral to improved reciprocal social behavior. The PDD-BI renders T scores (mean=50, standard deviation=10) based on comparisons to a standardized ASD population. The Autism Composite T score ranges from 10-100. The typical child with autism scores between 40-60.Higher scores indicate more severe autism symptoms and lower scores reflect milder symptoms. Change in this score from Baseline to Month 6 was calculated for each participant. Negative change scores indicate improvement in autism symptoms over time whereas positive scores indicate worsening of symptoms, and zero indicates no change in symptoms.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S is a 7 point scale completed at the baseline and 6-month visits that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's symptoms of autism at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. There are 3 CGI-S scores: the Social Communication Score, the Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Score, and the Overall Score. The clinician's rates the severity of autism symptoms - 1, normal, no symptoms; 2, borderline level of symptoms; 3, mild symptoms; 4, moderate symptoms; 5, marked symptoms; 6, severe symptoms; or 7, extremely severe symptoms. Increases in the change score represent increases in symptom severity, decreases in the change score indicate improvement, and zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impressions - Global Improvement (CGI-I) Score, Clinician Assessment</title>
        <description>The CGI-I is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's autism symptoms have improved or worsened relative to a baseline assessment. The symptoms are rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. There are three separate CGI-I ratings: social communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive interests and behaviors, and overall improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>Four subjects randomized to placebo were not included in the efficacy analyses. Two were pre-specified exclusions (defined as pilot subjects in the protocol) and two were found ineligible after enrollment. Two additional subjects were excluded from the Cord Blood group because they were missing assessments.</population>

        <title>Change in Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test (Clinician Assessment)</title>
        <description>This Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test is a standardized evaluation of the child's expressive one-word vocabulary by a trained clinician. It tests an individual's ability to name, with one word, objects, actions, and concepts when presented with color illustrations. Higher EOWPVT standard scores reflect a better vocabulary. The minimum score is age-dependent (years:months) as follows. For a child age 2:0 to 2:1 the minimum is 65; age 2:2-2:3 (min=62); age 2:4-2:5 (min=60); age 2:6-2:7 (min=58); age 2:8-2:9 (min=57); age 2:10-2:11 (min=56); age 3:0 and older (min=55). The maximum possible score across all ages is 145. The change in score from Baseline to Month 6 was the outcome measure. Increases reflect increases in vocabulary skills, decreasing reflect decreases in vocabulary skills, and zero reflects no change.</description>

        <title>Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II (VABS-II) Communication Subscale Standard Score</title>
        <description>The VABS-II measures adaptive functioning in socialization, communication, daily living, and motor skills. The Communication subscale standard score is derived by summing norm-referenced (by age group and sex) v-scale scores (mean=15, standard deviation=3) from the Receptive, Expressive, and Written communication subdomains and standardizing this sum to a normal distribution with mean=100 and standard deviation=15. Changes in the Communication standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Communication standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>

        <title>Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II (VABS-II) Daily Living Subscale Standard Score</title>
        <description>The VABS-II measures adaptive functioning in socialization, communication, daily living, and motor skills. The Daily Living standard score is derived by summing norm-referenced (by age group and sex) v-scale scores (mean=15, standard deviation=3) from the Personal, Domestic and Community subdomains and standardizing this sum to a normal distribution with mean=100 and standard deviation=15. Changes in the Daily Living standard score are indicative of skill acquisition relative to chronologically aged peers of the same sex. Thus, a zero (no change) represents change consistent with what is expected. An increase represents acquisition of more skills over time than would be expected. Participants who experience a decrease in Daily Living standard score may still have acquired skills although not at the rate expected based on their age and sex.</description>

The score ranges from 34 to 100 for participants aged 2-8 years. Higher values indicate increasing levels of severity. The change in this score from Baseline to Month 6 was calculated for each participant. Increases in the change score reflect worsening of problem behaviors, decreases indicate improvement, and zero indicates no change.</description>

          <description>The PDD-BI is an informant-based rating scale that assesses problem behaviors as well as appropriate social, language, and learning/memory skills. The Expressive Social Communication Abilities T-Score (mean=50, standard deviation=10) measures a broad range of social communication skills affected by autism. The score ranges from 20 to 100 for participants aged 2-8 years. Higher values indicate increasing levels of competence. The change in this score from Baseline to Month 6 was calculated for each participant. Increases in the change score reflect improvement, decreases indicate worsening, and zero indicates no change.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events collected on Safety Population (all 180 participants). Participants were randomized to receive a single infusion of umbilical cord blood or placebo and evaluated at six months. Participants then received a second infusion in a blinded fashion (placebo for participants initially randomized to cord blood, and cord blood for participants initially randomized to placebo). Participants were then followed for an additional 6 months for safety data collection.</desc>
