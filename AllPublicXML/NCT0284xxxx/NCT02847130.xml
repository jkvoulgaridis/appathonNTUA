      This research trial studies the use of clinical practice guidelines by pediatric oncology
      healthcare providers in order to identify, understand, and overcome barriers to them. The
      treatments for childhood cancers are intense and result in a high rate of symptoms which
      require support by healthcare providers. By reviewing patients' medical chart records,
      meeting in focus groups and in one-on-one interviews, healthcare providers may improve how
      clinical practice guidelines are used to support children undergoing cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the rate of adherence to selected Children's Oncology Group (COG)-endorsed
      supportive care clinical practice guidelines (CPG) recommendations at National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) sites. (Aim 1) II. To describe
      the possible influence of NCORP site size and the number of patients enrolled in COG studies
      per site on the delivery of CPG-consistent care. (Aim 1a) III. To describe the clinical
      outcome of episodes during which patients receive CPG-consistent or CPG-inconsistent care.
      (Aim 1b) IV. To describe facilitators of and barriers to the use of CPGs elicited via focus
      group interviews with a diverse set of potential users (physician, nurse, nurse practitioner
      and pharmacists) who provide pediatric cancer care at NCORP sites. (Aim 2) V. To improve how
      well CPG recommendations are understood by health care providers by refining the CPG
      recommendation format based on an iterative process of cognitive interviewing and formatting
      revisions. (Aim 3)

      OUTLINE:

      AIM 1 (CHART REVIEW): Patients are separated for each CPG evaluated (fever and neutropenia
      [FN], chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting [CINV], fertility preservation [FP]) and are
      randomly selected for medical chart review. Patients with eligible episodes of FN, CINV or FP
      within the health records are selected and have the data from their records abstracted and
      reviewed by COG for adherence to COG endorsed CPGs.

      AIM 2 (FOCUS GROUPS): Health care providers who provide direct care to pediatric oncology
      patients are identified and separated to participate in three types of focus groups:
      physician-only, non-physician, and mixed.

      AIM 3 (INTERVIEWS): Health care providers undergo one-on-one interviews consisting of think
      aloud technique (TAL) of cognitive interviewing.

    <time_frame>Data collected from March 28, 2017 through October 15, 2018 will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>Will be identified by the Framework for Clinical Practice Guideline Implementability. Operational definitions of each category will be determined. The implementation barriers and facilitators identified by focus group members will be coded using these categories independently by two investigators. New categories and sub-categories will be used to code concepts that do not fall within the pre-determined categories. Themes of commonality will be sought especially within the newly developed categories that fall outside the framework adapted from Gagliardi et al. Facilitators of and barriers to CPG implementation will be described.</description>

    <measure>CPG format which is well understood by pediatric oncology healthcare providers (Aim 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected from 25 interviews starting from February 1, 2019 to the timepoint where the minimum number of interviews conducted is met will be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>The issues identified via the interviews, changes made to the formatting, and rationale for the changes will be documented between each round in a tracking matrix. The proportion of interviewees who select the correct course of action when presented with four possible courses of action will be described for each iteration of the CPG format including the final version. Understanding is defined as the correct interpretation of the course of action recommended or suggested by a CPG.</description>
