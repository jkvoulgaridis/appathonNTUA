  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      efficacy of a family-focused behavioral intervention (&quot;FLARE&quot;, which stands for Family
      Lifestyle Actions and Risk Education) that aims to improve adherence to melanoma preventive
      behaviors among children at elevated risk for the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Test the feasibility and acceptability of FLARE, a family-focused behavioral intervention
      that is designed to improve and maintain adherence to photoprotection (e.g., use of
      sunscreen) and screening (e.g., implementation of self skin exams). We expect that the
      feasibility of the intervention will be supported by at least 75% of participants attending
      at least 3 intervention sessions. We also expect that the acceptability of the intervention
      (e.g., overall satisfaction, ease of participation, perceived utility of intervention) will
      be supported by mean ratings that indicate adequate levels of acceptability across
      participants (e.g., mean rating of &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;very satisfied&quot; for overall satisfaction).

      Pilot test the efficacy of the FLARE intervention with children at elevated risk for melanoma
      and their primary caregiver.

      We will also explore the potential impact of the FLARE intervention on melanoma preventive
      behaviors among siblings of the child who receives the intervention, as well as the child's
      other parent/caregiver (if another parent/caregiver is available).

Measurements were taken using a spectrophotometer to quantify skin color.
