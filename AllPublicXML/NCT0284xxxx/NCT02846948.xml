  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify the diagnostic value of the focused assessed
      echocardiography in septic patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery due to peritonitis.
      The investigators expect that the incidence of hemodynamic instability will be reduced and
      the survival of the patients will be improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Often sepsis remains undiagnosed at the very beginning because of the concentration to the
      surgical pathology in perioperative period. This results in unacceptably high mortality. The
      investigators hypothesize that extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused transthoracic
      echocardiography will personalize early fluid resuscitation which will improve patient's
      outcome.

      The goals of the investigators study are:

        -  To conduct two-group randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patient management
           based on standard monitoring and extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused
           transthoracic echocardiography in patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery due to
           peritonitis.

        -  To demonstrate that patient management based on extended hemodynamic monitoring by
           focused echocardiography results in improved survival, reduced incidence of hemodynamic
           instability during perioperative period.

        -  To compare an amount of administrated of intravenous fluids in both groups.

      The investigators hypothesize that focused echocardiography monitoring will result in more
      administrated intravenous fluids during perioperative period.
