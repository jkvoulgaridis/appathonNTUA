    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with either
      lulizumab or BMS-986142 versus placebo in subjects with moderate to severe primary Sjögren's
      syndrome as measured by the change from baseline in ESSDAI at Week 12 between active
      treatment arms (lulizumab or BMS-986142, respectively) and the placebo arm.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in ESSDAI</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSDAI is a clinical index that measures Sjogren's syndrome disease activity. A physician scores the disease activity level of twelve organ-specific domains in 3 or 4 levels according to their severity. For example, for no disease activity the domain score equals 0 and for high disease activity the domain score equals 3 or 4. Each domain is assigned a weight between 1 and 6, and the domain score is multiplied by the domain weight. The sum of the weighted domain scores is the overall score, which can range from 0 to 123. A higher score indicates more disease activity. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 18</time_frame>
    <description>First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given in Table 1. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Table 2 lists the items averaged together to create each scale. Items that are left blank(missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in ESSDAI</title>
        <description>The ESSDAI is a clinical index that measures Sjogren's syndrome disease activity. A physician scores the disease activity level of twelve organ-specific domains in 3 or 4 levels according to their severity. For example, for no disease activity the domain score equals 0 and for high disease activity the domain score equals 3 or 4. Each domain is assigned a weight between 1 and 6, and the domain score is multiplied by the domain weight. The sum of the weighted domain scores is the overall score, which can range from 0 to 123. A higher score indicates more disease activity. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening</description>

          <description>Determined by instilling fluorescein dye and evaluating the stability of the pre-corneal tear film. After several blinks, the tear film is examined using a broad beam of the slit-lamp (biomicroscope) with a cobalt blue filter. The TBUT, defined as the time in seconds between the subjects's last blink and the first appearance of a random dry spot on the corneal surface, is measured 3 times and the mean value is recorded.</description>

        <description>First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given in Table 1. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Table 2 lists the items averaged together to create each scale. Items that are left blank(missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered</description>
