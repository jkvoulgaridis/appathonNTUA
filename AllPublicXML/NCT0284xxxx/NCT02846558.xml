      This is a pragmatic, single-blinded randomized trial of improving adherence to dietary
      interventions in patients with MS who are receiving monthly natalizumab infusions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS affects at least 400,000 people in the US alone, and its incidence has increased in the
      past 50 years, likely due to changing environmental risk factors. Recent research suggests
      that diet may be a critical factor in the development of MS. The &quot;Western diet&quot;, high in
      sugar, fat, and salt, may influence MS risk and progression by directly affecting the immune
      system, altering gut bacteria, and changing metabolism.

      Studying patients with MS who are overweight and obese may be relevant as obesity can cause
      chronic low-grade inflammation, potentially worsening MS symptoms. Diet modification
      represents an interesting potential therapy for MS, particularly calorie restriction and
      fasting, which have been associated with reduced markers of inflammation. In addition to
      these direct effects, weight optimization may lead to improvements in MS-related symptoms,
      like fatigue, and overall quality of life.

      This is a single-blinded randomized trial of adherence to a dietary intervention in patients
      with MS who are receiving monthly natalizumab infusions. The study will evaluate how use of
      technology may help patients with MS adhere to a calorie restricted diet. It will also
      evaluate the effect of weight loss on fatigue and quality of life in patients with MS. A
      second part of the study will evaluate if shortening the period during the day in which
      people consume their typical food amounts leads to improvements in patient-reported outcomes.

    <measure>Functional Assessment in MS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment in Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) is an instrument that measures quality of life among people with MS. The instrument contains 44 questions scored on a 5-point Likert scale in 6 areas: mobility, symptoms, emotional wellbeing, general contentment, thanking/fatigue, and family/social wellbeing. Subscores for each area is calculated as the sum of responses in that section, and the total FAMS score is the sum of all subscores. Minimum total score is 0 and maximum total score is 176, where a higher score indicates better quality of life. Increase in the FAMS score over the study period indicates a better outcome, or improved quality of life, among participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Fatigue is a question bank of 95 items validated to evaluated fatigue in a variety of chronic conditions. The PROMIS-FatigueMS is a subset of 8 questions from the question bank, which have been validated to measure fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis. Individual items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, and the total score is the sum of individual items, with a minimum score of 8 and maximum score of 40. Lower scores indicate less fatigue, while higher scores indicate more fatigue. Reduction in score over 6 months indicates a better outcome, or improved fatigue among participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an instrument used to measure the quality and sleeping pattern of adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality, and the total score is calculated from the sum of seven components, each scored from 0 to 3. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 21. A total score equal to or greater than 5 units indicates &quot;poor&quot; quality sleep, while a score of 0-4 indicates &quot;good&quot; quality sleep; lower scores indicate better sleep quality. Decrease in PSQI score indicates a better outcome, or improved sleep quality, among study participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is a 10-item scale that measures global self-worth using a 4-point Likert scale to ask about negative and positive feelings about the self. Individual items are summed to calculate the total score. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 30. Scores between 15 and 25 are considered within the normal range, while scores below 15 indicates poor self-esteem. An increase in RSES score over 6 months indicates a better outcome, or improved self-esteem, among participants.</description>

          <description>The Patient-Determine Disability Scale (PDDS) measures level of disability from multiple sclerosis as reported by the patient. The scale ranges from a minimum of 0 (No disability – “I may have some mild symptoms, mostly sensory due to MS, but they do not limit my activity”) to a maximum of 8 (Bedridden – “Unable to sit in a wheelchair for more than one hour”). Lower values on this scale indicate less disability from multiple sclerosis. A reduction in PDDS over the study period indicates a better outcome, or improvement in disability/symptoms from MS, among participants.</description>

          <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue is a 95-item question bank to evaluate fatigue in a variety of chronic conditions. The PROMIS-FatigueMS is a subset of 8 questions from the question bank, which have been validated to measure fatigue specifically in people with multiple sclerosis. Individual items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, and the total score is the sum of individual items, with a minimum score of 8 and maximum score of 40. Lower scores indicate less fatigue; reduction in score over 6 months indicates a better outcome.</description>

          <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an instrument used to measure the quality and sleeping pattern of adults. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep quality, and the total score is calculated from the sum of seven components, each scored from 0 to 3. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 21. A total score equal to or greater than 5 units indicates “poor” quality sleep, while a score of 0-4 indicates “good” quality sleep; lower scores indicate better sleep quality.</description>

          <description>The Functional Assessment in Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS) is an instrument that measures quality of life among people with MS. It contains 44 questions scored on a 5-point Likert scale in 6 areas: mobility, symptoms, emotional wellbeing, general contentment, thinking/fatigue, and family/social wellbeing. Subscores are the sum of responses in that section, and the total FAMS score is the sum of all subscores. Minimum total score is 0 and maximum total score is 176, where a higher score indicates better quality of life. Increase in score over the study period indicates a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Score</title>
          <description>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is a 10-item scale that measures global self-worth using a 4-point Likert scale to ask about negative and positive feelings about the self. Individual items are summed to calculate the total score. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 30. Higher scores indicate higher/better self-esteem. Scores between 15 and 25 are considered within the normal range, while scores below 15 indicates poor self-esteem. An increase in RSES score over 6 months indicates a better outcome, or improved self-esteem, among participants.</description>

The instrument contains 44 questions scored on a 5-point Likert scale in 6 areas: mobility, symptoms, emotional wellbeing, general contentment, thanking/fatigue, and family/social wellbeing. Subscores for each area is calculated as the sum of responses in that section, and the total FAMS score is the sum of all subscores. Minimum total score is 0 and maximum total score is 176, where a higher score indicates better quality of life. Increase in the FAMS score over the study period indicates a better outcome, or improved quality of life, among participants.</description>

Individual items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, and the total score is the sum of individual items, with a minimum score of 8 and maximum score of 40. Lower scores indicate less fatigue, while higher scores indicate more fatigue. Reduction in score over 6 months indicates a better outcome, or improved fatigue among participants.</description>

        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an instrument used to measure the quality and sleeping pattern of adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality, and the total score is calculated from the sum of seven components, each scored from 0 to 3. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 21. A total score equal to or greater than 5 units indicates &quot;poor&quot; quality sleep, while a score of 0-4 indicates &quot;good&quot; quality sleep; lower scores indicate better sleep quality. Decrease in PSQI score indicates a better outcome, or improved sleep quality, among study participants.</description>

        <description>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is a 10-item scale that measures global self-worth using a 4-point Likert scale to ask about negative and positive feelings about the self. Individual items are summed to calculate the total score. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 30. Scores between 15 and 25 are considered within the normal range, while scores below 15 indicates poor self-esteem. An increase in RSES score over 6 months indicates a better outcome, or improved self-esteem, among participants.</description>
