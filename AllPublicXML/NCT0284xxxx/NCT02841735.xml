  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important to explore use of technology to reduce drinking. The purpose of this research
      study is to compare different types of mobile technology for their effects on alcohol
      drinking and ratings of usability among young adults.This study will be conducted in four
      phases: a web-based screening assessment; brief appointment on the day of the alcohol
      drinking session; alcohol drinking session; and a follow-up appointment. Participation in
      this study will last approximately two months.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Smartphone breathalyzer device &amp; app</arm_group_label>
    <description>This is a small device that attaches to a smartphone with an accompanying app that produces accurate breath alcohol readings when a user blows into a small tube attached to the device. Participants randomized to this study condition will have the opportunity to use this device and app during an alcohol drinking session in a simulated laboratory.</description>

    <arm_group_label>BAC estimator app</arm_group_label>
    <description>This is an app that produces estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) readings based on sex, weight, number of drinks and time taken to consume drinks. Participants randomized to this study condition will have the opportunity to use this app during an alcohol drinking session in a simulated laboratory.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Text Messaging</arm_group_label>
    <description>A procedure whereby one sends a text message to the phone one is using after each alcoholic drink. Participants randomized to this study condition will have the opportunity to the text messaging procedure during an alcohol drinking session in a simulated laboratory.</description>

    <intervention_name>Smartphone breathalyzer device/app use</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will be able to blow into the smartphone breathalyzer after consuming each alcoholic drink, which produces an accurate breath alcohol reading on the app. These breath alcohol readings may inform participants' subsequent decisions regarding drinking.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will be able to make an entry into the BAC estimator app after consuming each alcoholic drink, which produces an estimated blood alcohol concentration based on the individual's sex, weight, number of alcoholic drinks and time spent drinking alcohol. These estimated blood alcohol concentrations may inform participants' subsequent decisions regarding drinking.</description>
