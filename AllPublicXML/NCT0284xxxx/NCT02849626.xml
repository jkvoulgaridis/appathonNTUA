    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study with an Extension Phase to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of perampanel oral suspension when administered as an adjunctive therapy in
      children (ages 4 to less than [&lt;] 12 years) with inadequately controlled partial onset
      seizures (POS) or primary generalized tonic clonic (PGTC) seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in children (age 4 to &lt;12 years) with
      inadequately controlled POS or PGTC seizures. The study will consist of a Core Phase and two
      Extension Phases (Extension Phase A [for all countries in the study], and Extension Phase B
      [available for participants enrolled in Japan and in countries where an extended access
      program {EAP} cannot be implemented, after completion of Extension Phase A]). The Core Phase
      will consist of the following 2 phases: Pretreatment and Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment
      Phase, during which participants will be assessed for eligibility, will consist of up to a
      4-weeks +/- 3 days Screening/Baseline Period. The Treatment Phase will consist of 3 periods:
      Titration Period (up to an 11-weeks: dose titration on the basis of individual clinical
      response and tolerability), Maintenance Period (up to a 12-weeks: continuation of perampanel
      oral suspension once daily at the dose level achieved at the end of the Titration Period),
      and Follow-up Period (up to 4-weeks +/- 7 days: only for those participants not entering into
      Extension Phase A or those who prematurely discontinue from the study). Extension Phase A
      will consist of up to 29-weeks Maintenance Period and up to 4-weeks +/- 7 days Follow-up
      Period after the last dose of perampanel only for participants who did not enter into
      Extension Phase B. All participants who complete all scheduled visits up to and including
      Visit 9 in the Treatment Phase will be eligible to participate in Extension Phase A of the
      study. During the Maintenance Period of Extension Phase A, all participants will continue
      with their optimal perampanel dose (that is, dose level that they complete on during the Core
      Phase). After completing Extension Phase A, participants in Japan and in countries where EAP
      cannot be implemented, participants will be eligible to participate in Extension Phase B. In
      Japan, treatment will continue as long as clinically appropriate according to the judgment of
      the investigator. However, treatment of participants in Extension B will be completed when
      the participant reaches 12 years of age or when perampanel is commercially available in Japan
      for treatment of POS in pediatric participants (4 to less than 12 years of age). In countries
      where an EAP cannot be implemented, participation in Extension B will continue as long as
      clinically appropriate according to the judgment of the investigator, until the participants
      reaches 12 years of age or perampanel oral suspension is commercially available.

    <measure>Model Predicted Percent Change in Average Seizure Frequency Over 28 Days During Maintenance Period in Core Phase of This Study From Baseline- Assessed as Relationship With Average Steady State Plasma Concentration (Cav, ss) of Perampanel (518 ng/mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 23</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure frequency was derived from information (seizure count and type) recorded in participant diary. The seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated as the number of seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. Due to the sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling in this study, the data of this outcome measure was analyzed by pooling the data from other Phase II and III studies of perampanel along with the data of this current study, including participants with POS or PGTC. Only data for participants taking perampanel 8 mg/day (corresponding to Cav, ss of 518 ng/mL) were reported. Participants taking perampanel 12 mg/day in the studies from which data were pooled, were not included in analysis for this measure. Here, ng/mL refers to nanogram per milliliter. Data for this measure was calculated through model prediction and reported as &quot;percent change&quot; with measure type as &quot;number&quot; and measure dispersion as &quot;Not applicable, NA&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Number of Seizure Free Observations During Core Phase of This Study: Assessment Based on Relationship With Average Steady State Plasma Concentration (Cav, ss) of Perampanel</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 23</time_frame>
    <description>Due to the sparse PK sampling in this study, the data of this outcome measure were analyzed by pooling data from other Phase II and III studies of perampanel along with this current study, including participants with POS or PGTC. Data for this outcome measure have been reported in relationship with different ranges of Cav, ss of Perampanel as &quot;number of observations&quot; those were seizure free for up to 3 visits. The reason for using number of observations for analysis of this outcome measure was because data were available as up to 3 visits per participant and not necessarily that the participant was seizure-free on all three visits.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression of Change Scores (CGIC)- Core Phase and Extension Phase A of This Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 23, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of disease severity utilized the CGIC scale at end of treatment to evaluate participant's change in disease status from baseline. The CGIC is a 7-point scale that measures a physician's global impression of a participant's clinical condition. Scale ranged from 1 to 7 with lower score indicated improvement (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved), higher score indicated worsening (5=minimally worse, 6= much worse, 7=very much worse), and a score of 4 indicated no change.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of epilepsy with POS with or without secondarily generalized (SG)
             seizures or PGTC seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy's
             (ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981). A diagnosis should have been
             established at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 by clinical history and an
             electroencephalogram (EEG) that is consistent with the diagnosis; normal interictal
             EEGs will be allowed provided that the participant meets the other diagnosis criterion
             (that is, clinical history)

          -  Male or female participant, from age 4 to &lt;12 years at the time of informed
             consent/assent

          -  Have a minimum weight of 16 kilograms (kg) (35 pounds [lb])

          -  Have had a brain imaging (example, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed
             tomography [CT] before Visit 1 that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy)

          -  During the 12 weeks +/- 3 days (4 weeks +/- 3 days in Japan only) prior to Visit 2,
             participants must have equal or greater than (=&gt;) one POS or one PGTC seizure. Only
             simple POS with motor signs, complex POS, and complex POS with secondary
             generalization are counted toward this inclusion for POS

          -  Are currently being treated with stable doses of 1 to a maximum of 3 approved
             antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Doses must be stable for at least 4 weeks before to Visit
             1; in the case where a new AED regimen has been initiated for a participant, the dose
             must be stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. Only one EIAED (defined as
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, or eslicarbazepine) out of the maximum of
             three AEDs is allowed (A vagal nerve stimulator [VNS] will be counted as one of the 3
             allowed AEDs)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             equivalent units of β-hCG or hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug

          -  Females of childbearing potential who:

               -  Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and who do
                  not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (example, total

                  contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)
                  throughout the entire study period or for 28 days after study drug
                  discontinuation. If a highly effective method is not appropriate or acceptable
                  for the participant, then the participant may use a medically effective method

                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not
                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study or for 28 days after study
                  drug discontinuation

             before Visit 1

          -  Have an unstable psychiatric diagnosis that may confound participants' ability to
             participate in the study or that may prevent completion of the protocol-specified
             tests (example, significant suicide risk, including suicidal behavior and ideation
             within 6 months before Visit 1, current psychotic disorder, acute mania)

          -  Any suicidal ideation with intent with or without a plan within 6 months before Visit

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants took part at 58 investigative sites in the United States, European Union and Asia Pacific. A total of 208 participants were screened and enrolled, of which 28 were screen failures and 180 received study treatment in Core Phase. Of 146 participants who completed the Core Phase, 136 entered Extension Phase A and received study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study included a Core Phase and two Extension Phases (Extension Phase A and Extension Phase B). This result summary includes data only for the Core Phase and Extension Phase A of the study at the primary completion date (05 February 2019). Extension Phase B results will be provided at the time of study completion date.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Perampanel 0.5 mg/mL: POS</title>
          <description>Core Phase: Participants with partial onset-seizures (POS) received perampanel 0.5 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) oral suspension titrated beyond 8 milligram per day (mg/day) up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug [EIAED]), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

            <description>Core Phase: Participants with POS or PGTC seizures received perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension titrated beyond 8 mg/day up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any EIAED), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

        <title>Model Predicted Percent Change in Average Seizure Frequency Over 28 Days During Maintenance Period in Core Phase of This Study From Baseline- Assessed as Relationship With Average Steady State Plasma Concentration (Cav, ss) of Perampanel (518 ng/mL)</title>
        <description>Seizure frequency was derived from information (seizure count and type) recorded in participant diary. The seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated as the number of seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. Due to the sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling in this study, the data of this outcome measure was analyzed by pooling the data from other Phase II and III studies of perampanel along with the data of this current study, including participants with POS or PGTC. Only data for participants taking perampanel 8 mg/day (corresponding to Cav, ss of 518 ng/mL) were reported. Participants taking perampanel 12 mg/day in the studies from which data were pooled, were not included in analysis for this measure. Here, ng/mL refers to nanogram per milliliter. Data for this measure was calculated through model prediction and reported as &quot;percent change&quot; with measure type as &quot;number&quot; and measure dispersion as &quot;Not applicable, NA&quot;.</description>

        <title>Overall Responder Probability For Participants With PGTC Seizures During Core Phase of This Study: Assessment Based on Relationship With Average Steady State Plasma Concentration (Cav, ss) of Perampanel</title>
        <description>For this outcome measure, responders were those who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days from baseline. Due to the sparse PK sampling in this study, the data of this outcome measure were analyzed by pooling the data from other Phase II and III studies of perampanel along with data of this current study, including participants with PGTC seizures. In this outcome measure, responder probability at different concentration values of perampanel when given with or without topiramate (an antiepileptic) has been reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to 23 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received perampanel who have seizure frequency, cognition, or AE data with documented dosing history. Population for this measure included participants from other studies as well participants from this current study.

        <title>Model Predicted Change From Baseline in Total Aldenkamp-Baker Neuropsychological Assessment Schedule (ABNAS) Score During Core Phase of This Study: Assessment Based on Relationship With Plasma Levels of Perampanel</title>
        <description>The ABNAS assessment measured 5 aspects of cognitive function such as fatigue, memory, concentration, motor speed, and reading. The assessment was a measure of participant-perceived cognitive effects of AEDs. This instrument was aimed at assessing participant perceived drug-related cognitive impairment. Total score ranged from 0-72. Higher scores indicate a worsening of these cognitive functions. Analysis for this outcome measure was planned to be performed via Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling only if a graphical relationship between perampanel exposure and change from baseline in ABNAS could be discerned.</description>

        <description>The CBCL for participants with age 4 to 5 years is a questionnaire to assess behavioral and emotional problems in children as reported by the primary caregiver for the following domains activities: emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, internalizing, attention problems, aggressive behavior, externalizing, sleep problems. CBCL total score for participants with age 4 to 5 years ranged from 0 to 200, was calculated by adding individual score of each domain. Higher scores indicate greater problems in child behavior. Analysis for this outcome measure was planned to be performed via PK/PD modelling only if a graphical relationship between perampanel exposure and change from baseline in CBCL score (participants aged 4 to 5 years) could be discerned.</description>

        <title>Model Predicted Change From Baseline in Total Time to Complete LGPT Score for Dominant Hand in Core Phase of This Study for All Participants Aged 4 to &lt;12 Years: Assessment Based on Relationship With Plasma Levels of Perampanel</title>
        <description>The Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test (LGPT) measures visuomotor skills. This test is a manipulative dexterity test that consist of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Participants require to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. The task is timed and the scores are the time taken for the participant to complete all 10 pegs for each hand. If the test cannot be completed within 300 seconds, 300 seconds are recorded for the time. An increase in score (longer time) indicate worsening of visuomotor skills. Analysis for this outcome measure was planned to be performed via PK/PD modelling only if a graphical relationship between perampanel exposure and change from baseline in Total Time to Complete LGPT Score for Dominant Hand could be discerned.</description>

Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

        <description>The ABNAS assessment measured 5 aspects of cognitive function such as fatigue, memory, concentration, motor speed, and reading. The assessment was a measure of participant-perceived cognitive effects of AEDs. This instrument was aimed at assessing participant perceived drug-related cognitive impairment. Total score ranged from 0-72. Higher scores indicate a worsening of these cognitive functions.</description>

        <description>The CBCL for participants (age group 1.5 to 5 years) is a questionnaire to assess behavioral and emotional problems in children as reported by the primary caregiver for the following domains activities: emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, internalizing, attention problems, aggressive behavior, externalizing, sleep problems. CBCL total score for participants (age group 1.5 to 5 years) ranged from 0 to 200, was calculated by adding individual score of each domain. Higher scores indicate greater problems in child behavior.</description>

        <description>The LGPT test measured visuomotor skills. This test was a manipulative dexterity test that consisted of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The participant was required to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes. The task was completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. The task was timed and the scores were the time taken for the participant to complete all 10 pegs for each hand. If the test cannot be completed within 300 seconds, 300 seconds were recorded for the time. An increase in score (longer time) indicated worsening of visuomotor skills. The time to complete test is presented as mean seconds plus/minus (+/-) SD.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time to Complete Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test (LGPT) Scores Over 8 Years as Per Seizure Type at Week 23 (Core Phase) and at Week 52 (Extension Phase A) of This Study</title>
        <description>The LGPT test measured visuomotor skills. This test was a manipulative dexterity test that consisted of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The participant was required to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes. The task was completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. The task was timed and the scores were the time taken for the participant to complete all 25 pegs for each hand. If the test cannot be completed within 300 seconds, 300 seconds were recorded for the time. An increase in score (longer time) indicated worsening of visuomotor skills. The time to complete test is presented as mean seconds +/- SD.</description>

Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

            <description>Core Phase: Participants with POS received perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension titrated beyond 8 mg/day up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any EIAED), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

            <description>Core Phase: Participants with POS received perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension titrated beyond 8 mg/day up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any EIAED), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

            <description>Core Phase: Participants of age 7 to &lt;12 years with POS or PGTC seizures received perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension titrated beyond 8 mg/day up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any other EIAED), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel oral suspension once daily at the optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed the Core Phase, entered the Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>

          <title>Median Percent Change in Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days During the Treatment Phase Relative to the Pretreatment Phase (Baseline)- Core Phase and Extension Phase A of This Study</title>
          <description>Seizure frequency was based on number of seizures per 28 days, calculated as number of seizures over entire time interval divided by number of days in interval and multiplied by 28. Total POS: sum of all POS including simple partial seizures without motor signs, simple partial seizures with motor signs, complex partial seizures, and complex partial seizures with secondary generalization (SG). Data for this measure has been reported for 13 week time periods as per age groups.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Based on 50% Responder Rate- Core Phase and Extension Phase A of This Study</title>
        <description>A 50% responder was a participant who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days from baseline. Total POS: sum of all POS including simple partial seizures without motor signs, simple partial seizures with motor signs, complex partial seizures, and complex partial seizures with SG. Data for this outcome measure has been reported for 13 week time periods as per age groups.</description>

            <description>Core Phase: Participants of age 4 to &lt;7 years with POS or PGTC seizures received perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension titrated beyond 8 mg/day up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any EIAED), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression of Change Scores (CGIC)- Core Phase and Extension Phase A of This Study</title>
        <description>Assessment of disease severity utilized the CGIC scale at end of treatment to evaluate participant's change in disease status from baseline. The CGIC is a 7-point scale that measures a physician's global impression of a participant's clinical condition. Scale ranged from 1 to 7 with lower score indicated improvement (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved), higher score indicated worsening (5=minimally worse, 6= much worse, 7=very much worse), and a score of 4 indicated no change.</description>

          <description>Core Phase: Participants with POS received perampanel 0.5 mg/mL oral suspension titrated beyond 8 mg/day up to 12 mg/day, if 8 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are not taking any EIAED), or titrated beyond 12 mg/day up to 16 mg/day, if 12 mg/day was tolerable and were deemed likely to be benefitted by higher dose (for participants who are taking any EIAED). Dose titration- up to 11 weeks to identify each participant’s optimum dose. Participants then continued to take perampanel once daily at optimal dose level as a maintenance dose for up to 12 weeks. Extension Phase A: Participants who completed Core Phase, entered Extension Phase A, and continued with their optimal perampanel dose from Core Phase for up to 29 weeks. Total duration of treatment for Core Phase and Extension Phase A was up to 52 weeks.</description>
