    <measure>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>Change in DTSQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire - status (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 52. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 52, week 104</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from week 52 in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 104. A positive change score indicates an improvement since week 52. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>Change in DTSQ- Switch</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52, week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Change from week 52 in diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire - status (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 104. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The main phase of the trial was conducted at 77 sites in 10 countries, and the extension phase (Switch) at 71 sites in 9 countries, as follows (main phase/extension phase): Argentina (3/3), Austria (3/3), Belgium (7/7), Brazil (2/0), Egypt (4/4), Norway (4/4), South Korea (7/7), Switzerland (8/5), Turkey (8/8), and United States (31/30).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consisted of two treatment periods: a 52-week main phase and a 52-week extension phase. In Switch, participants were allowed to re-randomise from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide. Sustainability included results for participants who received oral semaglutide during main + extension phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Oral Semaglutide Flex</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive oral semaglutide tablets once daily from week 0 to week 52 (main phase): 3 milligrams (mg) for the first 8 weeks, 3 or 7 mg for next 8 weeks followed by 3, 7 or 14 mg for the remaining treatment period. Participants who were still on treatment at week 52 were allowed to continue on oral semaglutide in the extension phase (week 53 to week 104). Participants were to continue their anti-diabetic background medication (metformin, sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors) throughout the trial.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

          <title>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)</title>
          <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in DTSQ</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire - status (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 52. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)- Switch</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from week 52 in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 104. A positive change score indicates an improvement since week 52. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in DTSQ- Switch</title>
        <description>Change from week 52 in diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire - status (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 104. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36v2 (Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)- Sustainability</title>
        <description>Short form (SF)-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 104. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in DTSQ- Sustainability</title>
        <description>Change from week 0 in diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire - status (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 104. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

      <time_frame>Week 0 to week 109. Results are based on the safety analysis set (SAS), which comprised all randomised participants who received at least one dose of trial product.</time_frame>
      <desc>Serious adverse events and other AEs were based on the on-treatment observation period, i.e., the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. All-cause mortality were based on the in-trial observation period, i.e., the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</desc>
