  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase II, open-label, prospective, multicenter study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of single-agent atezolizumab as a first-line therapy in participants with
      locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the primary
      biomarker objective was to measure blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) and evaluate whether
      it can predict for improved clinical outcome with atezolizumab.
