    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is to characterize the single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic
      (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/ PD) profiles after oral rivaroxaban therapy
      administered to pediatric participants 2 to 8 years of age with single ventricle physiology
      who have completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrollment (Part A) and to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban, administered twice daily (exposure matched
      to rivaroxaban 10 milligram [mg] once daily in adults) compared to acetylsalicylic acid
      (ASA), given once daily (approximately 5 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) for
      thromboprophylaxis in pediatric participants 2 to 8 years of age with single ventricle
      physiology who have completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrollment.

      Part A: This part includes a 12-day Initial PK, PD, and Safety Assessment Period.
      Participants in Part A will not participate in Part B. Randomization in Part B of this study
      will begin once the cumulative data from the Initial PK, PD, and Safety Assessment Period in
      Part A are deemed acceptable by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Part A of the
      study will consist of an up to 21-day Screening Period, a 12-day Initial PK, PD, and Safety
      Assessment Period, a 12-month Open-Label Treatment Period, and a 30-day Follow-Up phone
      contact. Part B: Participants will be randomly assigned to two treatment groups and
      randomization ratio will be 2:1 for rivaroxaban and ASA. ASA will be used as control. There
      will be an up to a 21-day Screening Period, a 12 month Open-Label Treatment Period and a
      30-day Follow-Up phone contact.

    <description>Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding and associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or more; or leading to a transfusion of the equivalent of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood in adults; or occurring in a critical site: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal; or contributing to death.</description>
