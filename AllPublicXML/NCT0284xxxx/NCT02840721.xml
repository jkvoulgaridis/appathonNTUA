      This is a Phase 2a, single arm, two-stage study in subjects with moderate to severe
      ulcerative colitis. Subjects will receive 500 mg of PF-06480605 intravenously every 2 weeks
      for a total of 7 doses. Blood, stool, and tissue samples will be collected at various time
      points throughout the study to evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and
      immunogenicity. Duration of participation for subjects will be approximately 8 months.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Who Withdrew Due to Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to final onsite visit (Week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious AE (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that (1) resulted in death; (2) was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); (3) required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; (4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); (5) resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an event that emerged during treatment having been absent pre-treatment, or worsened relative to the pre-treatment state. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Endoscopic Improvement at Week 14, Based on Uniformly Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimator (UMVUE) - Per Protocol Analysis Set</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic improvement at Week 14 was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1, and without friability. The Mayo scoring system was used to assess ulcerative colitis activity, and it ranges from 0 to 12, calculated as sum of 4 sub-scores, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The 4 sub-scores are stool frequency (0=normal number of stools; 1=1 to 2 stools more than normal; 2=3 to 4 stools more than normal; 3= 5 or more stools more than normal); rectal bleeding (0=no blood seen; 1=streaks of blood with stools less than half the time; 2=obvious blood with stool most of the time; 3=blood alone passes); findings on endoscopy (0=normal or inactive disease; 1=mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]; 2=moderate disease [marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions]; 3=severe disease [spontaneous bleeding, ulceration]); and physician's global assessment (0=normal; 1=mild disease; 2=moderate disease; 3=severe disease).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Who Withdrew Due to Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious AE (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that (1) resulted in death; (2) was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); (3) required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; (4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); (5) resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an event that emerged during treatment having been absent pre-treatment, or worsened relative to the pre-treatment state. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Endoscopic Improvement at Week 14, Based on Uniformly Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimator (UMVUE) - Per Protocol Analysis Set</title>
        <description>Endoscopic improvement at Week 14 was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1, and without friability. The Mayo scoring system was used to assess ulcerative colitis activity, and it ranges from 0 to 12, calculated as sum of 4 sub-scores, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The 4 sub-scores are stool frequency (0=normal number of stools; 1=1 to 2 stools more than normal; 2=3 to 4 stools more than normal; 3= 5 or more stools more than normal); rectal bleeding (0=no blood seen; 1=streaks of blood with stools less than half the time; 2=obvious blood with stool most of the time; 3=blood alone passes); findings on endoscopy (0=normal or inactive disease; 1=mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]; 2=moderate disease [marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions]; 3=severe disease [spontaneous bleeding, ulceration]); and physician's global assessment (0=normal; 1=mild disease; 2=moderate disease; 3=severe disease).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Endoscopic Improvement at Week 14, Based on Uniformly Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimator (UMVUE) - Per Protocol Analysis Set</title>
          <description>Endoscopic improvement at Week 14 was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1, and without friability. The Mayo scoring system was used to assess ulcerative colitis activity, and it ranges from 0 to 12, calculated as sum of 4 sub-scores, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The 4 sub-scores are stool frequency (0=normal number of stools; 1=1 to 2 stools more than normal; 2=3 to 4 stools more than normal; 3= 5 or more stools more than normal); rectal bleeding (0=no blood seen; 1=streaks of blood with stools less than half the time; 2=obvious blood with stool most of the time; 3=blood alone passes); findings on endoscopy (0=normal or inactive disease; 1=mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]; 2=moderate disease [marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions]; 3=severe disease [spontaneous bleeding, ulceration]); and physician's global assessment (0=normal; 1=mild disease; 2=moderate disease; 3=severe disease).</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all participants who were eligible for enrollment, not a major protocol violator, with at least 6 out of 7 planned doses received and a final colonoscopy at Week 14.</population>
