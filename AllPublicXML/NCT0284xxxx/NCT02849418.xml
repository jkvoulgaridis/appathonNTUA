  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK1358820 in Japanese patients with
      neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) with urinary incontinence, whose symptoms have not
      been adequately managed with medications for urinary incontinence due to NDO.

      This study consists of a screening phase up to 28 days followed by a double-blind Treatment
      phase 1 of 12 to 48 weeks wherein subjects will receive a single treatment of either
      GSK1358820 200 Units (U) injection or placebo injection. After the first treatment, subjects
      who meet the re-treatment criteria between 12 to 36 weeks can enter an open-label Treatment
      phase 2 to receive a second treatment with GSK1358820 200 U. Subjects will be permitted to
      receive re-treatment up to 2 times, and there should be a gap of minimum of 12 weeks since
      the previous treatment. The duration of overall treatment phases is 48 weeks. The total
      duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including screening.

    <measure>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) and Week 6 in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted mean and standard error of adjusted mean has been reported.</description>

A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Percentage of participants attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline in the daily average of urinary incontinence episodes in Treatment Cycle 2 have been presented.</description>

             surgery, other than NDO, that may have affected bladder function including but not
             limited to:

               1. Bladder stones (including bladder stone surgery) within 6 months prior to
                  screening or confirmed occurrence of bladder stones at the screening phase

               2. Surgery (including minimally invasive surgery) within 1 year of screening for
                  stress incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse

               3. Current use of an electrostimulation/neuromodulation device for treatment of
                  urinary incontinence. Note: Use of any implantable device is prohibited within 4
                  weeks prior to initiation of Screening phase and throughout the study period. Use
                  of any external device is discontinued at least 7 days prior to the start of the
                  screening phase

               4. Current use of a baclofen pump

               5. History of interstitial cystitis, in the opinion of the investigator (or
                  subinvestigator)

               6. Past or current evidence of hematuria due to urological/renal pathology or
                  uninvestigated hematuria. Subjects with investigated hematuria may enter the
                  study if urological/renal pathology has been ruled out to the satisfaction by the
                  investigator (or subinvestigator)

               7. Past or current history of bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy,
                  positive result of urine cytology or uninvestigated suspicious urine cytology
                  results at the Screening phase. Suspicious urine cytology abnormalities require
                  that bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy has been ruled out to the
                  satisfaction of the investigator according to local site practice.

               8. An active genital infection, other than genital warts, either concurrently or
                  within 4 weeks prior to Screening

               9. Male with previous or current diagnosis of prostate cancer or a prostate specific
                  antigen (PSA) level of &gt;10 nanogram (ng)/milliliter (mL) at Screening. Subjects
                  with a PSA level of &gt;= 4 ng/mL but &lt;= 10 ng/mL must have prostate cancer ruled
                  out to the satisfaction of the investigator (or subinvestigator) according to
                  local site practice.

              10. Evidence of urethral and/or bladder outlet obstruction, in the opinion of the
                  investigator (or subinvestigator)

          -  Subject has a serum creatinine level &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at
             screening

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2×ULN; and bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5×ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) at
             screening

          -  Subject has current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's
             syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per
             investigator assessment). Notes:

               1. Stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of
                  ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric
                  varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis

               2. Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (example, presence of hepatitis B surface
                  antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody [HCVAb] test result within 3
                  months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if subject
                  otherwise meets entry criteria

          -  QTc &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block
             from the result of ECG at screening. Notes:

               1. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula
                  (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or
                  manually over-read

               2. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and
                  discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to
                  initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be
                  used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value
                  used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial

          -  Subject has hemophilia or other clotting factor deficiencies or disorders that cause

          -  Subject changes or initiates or discontinues anticholinergic, beta-3 adrenergic
             receptor agonist or any other medications or therapies to treat urinary incontinence
             due to NDO, within 6 days prior to the start of the screening phase

          -  Subject has been treated with any intravesical pharmacologic agent (e.g., capsaicin,
             resiniferatoxin) for urinary incontinence due to NDO within 12 months prior to
             initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0)

          -  Subject has previous or current use of botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype for the
             treatment of any urological condition

          -  Subject has previous use within 12 weeks prior to initiation of Treatment phase 1
             (Week 0) or current use of botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype for any
             non-urological condition or beauty care

          -  Subject has been immunized for botulinum toxin of any serotype

          -  Subject cannot withhold any antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or medications with
             anticoagulative effects for 3 days prior to initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0).
             Some medications may need to be withheld for &gt; 3 days, per clinical judgment of the
             investigator (or subinvestigator).

          -  Subject without a urinary tract infection (UTI) as determined from the urinalysis or
             urine culture and/or investigator opinion, has not initiated prophylactic antibiotic
             medication 1 to 3 days prior to the initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0). Subject
             with a UTI as determined from the urinalysis or urine culture and/or investigator
             opinion, has not initiated antibiotic medication at least 5 days prior to the
             initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0)

          -  Subject is symptomatic for UTI on day of treatment

          -  Subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the study medications, medications used
             in the study (including anesthesia), or their components or a history of drug or other
             allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates
             their participation

          -  Subject has any medical condition that may put them at increased risk with exposure to
             GSK1358820 including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, or

          -  Subject is currently participating in or has previously participated in another
             therapeutic study within 30 days prior to the start of the Screening phase

          -  Subject has any condition or situation which, in the investigator's (or
             sub-investigator's) opinion, puts the subject at significant risk, may confound the
             study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the
             study.

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 6</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Adjusted mean and standard error of adjusted mean has been reported.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. FAS2 comprised all randomized participants who had at least 1 post-second treatment efficacy assessment after the second treatment.</description>

        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. FAS3 comprised all randomized participants who had at least 1 post-third treatment efficacy assessment after the third treatment.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Percent Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data on the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Percent Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Voids</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of void episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 void episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Voids</title>
          <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of void episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 void episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Percent Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Voids</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of void episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 void episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Percent Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Voids</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of void episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 void episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants over one 24-hour period during the 3-day bladder diary collection period. To perform this measurement, urine collection containers provided by the sponsor were used. The volume voided per void was determined by the sponsor from the total urine volume measured by the participants divided by the number of voids (excluding urinary incontinence episode). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants over one 24-hour period during the 3-day bladder diary collection period. To perform this measurement, urine collection containers provided by the sponsor were used. The volume voided per void was determined by the sponsor from the total urine volume measured by the participants divided by the number of voids (excluding urinary incontinence episode). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants over one 24-hour period during the 3-day bladder diary collection period. To perform this measurement, urine collection containers provided by the sponsor were used. The volume voided per void was determined by the sponsor from the total urine volume measured by the participants divided by the number of voids (excluding urinary incontinence episode). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Percent Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants over one 24-hour period during the 3-day bladder diary collection period. To perform this measurement, urine collection containers provided by the sponsor were used. The volume voided per void was determined by the sponsor from the total urine volume measured by the participants divided by the number of voids (excluding urinary incontinence episode). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose 3-day diary which had at least one valid diary day assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Percentage of Participants Attaining 100 Percent (%), &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Percentage of participants attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline in the daily average of urinary incontinence episodes in Treatment Cycle 1 have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Percentage of participants attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline in the daily average of urinary incontinence episodes in Treatment Cycle 2 have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data on the bladder diary over 3 consecutive days. For Baseline and post-treatment visits, analysis was based on the diary data collected during a 3-day interval for each visit. Each 3-day interval consisted of 3 consecutive 24-hour periods, with the first period starting from the time of the first urinary episode on the first of the 3 days. A valid diary day was defined as any of the three 24-hour periods with 2 or more any type of urinary incontinence episodes. Data collected from a 24-hour period with less than 2 urinary incontinence episodes (i.e., an invalid diary day) were set to missing. Percentage of participants attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline in the daily average of urinary incontinence episodes in Treatment Cycle 3 have been presented.</description>

        <description>Participants can be considered for re-treatment beginning at the week 12 visit following the initial treatment or the week 12 visit following any re-treatment. Qualification criteria was; participants must have initiated request for re-treatment, participants experienced at least 4 episodes of urinary incontinence, with no more than one incontinence-free day, post-void residual (PVR) urine volume must have been &lt;200 mL for participants who micturated or had a mixed catheterization / spontaneous micturition pattern, body weight &gt;=40 kilogram; investigator deemed re-treatment appropriate. Time to the participant's first qualification for 2nd treatment from the day of 1st treatment was calculated as the earliest date when participants gave &quot;Yes&quot; response to the question of participants qualification for retreatment minus the day of first treatment plus 1.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) Domain Score</title>
        <description>KHQ is a 21 item questionnaire, consisting of 9 domains:General health (GH) (1[Very good] to 5[Very poor]), Incontinence impact (Int Imp) (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), Role Limitations (RL) (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), Physical limitations (PL) (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), Social limitations (SL) (0[not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Personal relationships (PR) (0[Not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Emotions (1[Not at all] to 4[Very much]), Sleep or energy (S or E) (1[Never] to 4[All the time]) and Severity or Coping (S or C) (1[Never] to 4[All the time]). Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S or E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S or C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S or E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S or C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Change From Baseline in KHQ Domain Score</title>
        <description>KHQ is a 21 item questionnaire, consisting of 9 domains: GH (1[Very good] to 5[Very poor]), Int Imp (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), RL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), PL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), SL (0[not applicable] to 4[A lot]), PR (0[Not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Emotions (1[Not at all] to 4[Very much]), S or E (1[Never] to 4[All the time]) and S or C (1[Never] to 4[All the time]). Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S or E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S or C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Change From Baseline in KHQ Domain Score</title>
        <description>KHQ is a 21 item questionnaire, consisting of 9 domains: GH (1[Very good] to 5[Very poor]), Int Imp (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), RL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), PL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), SL (0[not applicable] to 4[A lot]), PR (0[Not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Emotions (1[Not at all] to 4[Very much]), S or E (1[Never] to 4[All the time]) and S or C (1[Never] to 4[All the time]). Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S or E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S or C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>TBS consisted of 4 answers to 1 question, to which participants had to answer considering their current condition (urinary problems, urinary incontinence) compared to their condition before receiving any study treatment in the trial. Responses for questions were coded as 1 to 4 where 1 - Greatly improved, 2 - Improved, 3 - Not changed and 4 - Worsened. The answers of 1 - Greatly improved or 2 - Improved were regarded as positive response. Other answers including missing data were regarded as NO positive response.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</title>
        <description>Vital sign parameter SBP and DBP were measured in seated position after 5 minutes rest. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Change From Baseline in Body Temperature</title>
        <description>Vital sign parameter temperature was measured in seated position after 5 minutes rest. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value from the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosinophils, Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (Hct), Lymphocytes (Lympho), Monocytes, Neutrophil bands (N bands), Total Neutrophils (T neutro), Platelet count (PC), Red Blood Cell (RBC) count, and White Blood Cell count (WBC). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosinophils, Hb, Hct, Lympho, Monocytes, N bands, T neutro, PC, RBC count, and WBC. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosinophils, Hb, Hct, Lympho, Monocytes, N bands, T neutro, PC, RBC count, and WBC. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters; Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phosp), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Direct Bilirubin (Bil), Total Bil, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Total Protein (T Protein), Urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Uric acid. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters; Albumin, Alk Phosp, ALT, AST, Direct Bil, Total Bil, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, T Protein, Urea/BUN and Uric acid. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters; Albumin, Alk Phosp, ALT, AST, Direct Bil, Total Bil, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, T Protein, Urea/BUN and Uric acid. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Number of Participants With Worst-case Urinalysis Results Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline by Dipstick Analysis</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine occult blood, urine protein. In this dipstick test, the level of occult blood and protein in urine samples was recorded as negative, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+ (the plus sign increases with a higher level of occult blood or proteins in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 2+=positive, 3+=high positive etc). Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Number of participants with worst-case urinalysis results post-Baseline relative to Baseline by dipstick analysis have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Number of Participants With Worst-case Urinalysis Results Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline by Dipstick Analysis</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine occult blood, urine protein. In this dipstick test, the level of occult blood and protein in urine samples was recorded as negative, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+ (the plus sign increases with a higher level of occult blood or proteins in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 2+=positive, 3+=high positive etc). Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Number of participants with worst-case urinalysis results post-Baseline relative to Baseline by dipstick analysis have been presented.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in PVR Urine Volume</title>
        <description>PVR was measured in non-catheterizing participants, or those with mixed patterns (ie, they do both clean intermittent catheterization [CIC] and spontaneous voiding). PVR urine volume was assessed by ultrasound, bladder scan or catheterization after participants performed a voluntary void according to the study schedule. PVR urine volume could be assessed at any other time depending on clinical need. In case PVR urine volume indicated a clinically meaningful elevation, participants were asked to void once again (allowing the participants sufficient time to void) and the PVR urine volume was then reassessed. For participants who had a PVR urine volume measurement repeated, only the repeat value was recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>PVR was measured in non-catheterizing participants, or those with mixed patterns (ie, they do both CIC and spontaneous voiding). PVR urine volume was assessed by ultrasound, bladder scan or catheterization after participants performed a voluntary void according to the study schedule. PVR urine volume could be assessed at any other time depending on clinical need. In case PVR urine volume indicated a clinically meaningful elevation, participants were asked to void once again (allowing the participants sufficient time to void) and the PVR urine volume was then reassessed. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

In order to assess the presence of stones in the kidneys and bladder, an ultrasound of these structures (with the bladder at least half full) was performed. Participants were excluded from this study if the screening ultrasound demonstrated the presence of bladder stones. In the case of unclear findings in an ultrasound study, other diagnostic measures (e.g., x-ray) was required in order to confirm the presence of bladder stones. If a stone was detected in participants after the injection of the investigational product, the event was recorded as an adverse event.</description>

In order to assess the presence of stones in the kidneys and bladder, an ultrasound of these structures (with the bladder at least half full) was performed. Participants were excluded from this study if the screening ultrasound demonstrated the presence of bladder stones. In the case of unclear findings in an ultrasound study, other diagnostic measures (e.g., x-ray) was required in order to confirm the presence of bladder stones. If a stone was detected in participants after the injection of the investigational product, the event was recorded as an adverse event.</description>
