    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax work in
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma or Richter
      syndrome that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and obinutuzumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax may
      work better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic
      lymphoma, or Richter syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab and venetoclax
      in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/Richter
      transformation (RT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of atezolizumab combined with obinutuzumab and venetoclax in
      patients with CLL/SLL/RT.

      II. To determine overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), duration of
      response (DOR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negative remission rate.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To determine the overall survival
      (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine immunological and molecular features, at baseline and/or that change with
      treatment, that correlate with outcomes in patients treated with atezolizumab combined with
      obinutuzumab and venetoclax.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8,
      and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-9 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days
      3-4 of cycle 1 and on days 1-2 of cycles 2-9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 9 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients also
      receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 14 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously IV over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and
      15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-9 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 3-4
      of cycle 1 and on days 1-2 of cycles 2-9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 9 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients receive
      venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 25 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
