  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II
      as a bone filler containing the patient's own (autologous) adipose (fat) tissue-derived cells
      in reconstructing bone in two clinical indications:

        1. Bone augmentation (e.g. sinus augmentation)

        2. Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws

      Primary endpoint:

      The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible defect/void is safe under the
      following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no significant changes in
      complete blood count (CBC) and in general health.

      Secondary endpoint:

      The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible void is efficient under the
      following conditions: Following BonoFill-II implantation, the bone regeneration in the
      operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids were filled with a
      significant amount of bone tissue.

    <description>The study will assess the safety of the BonoFill-II drug product post transplantation by demonstrating no treatment-related adverse events such as chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis) or significant changes in complete blood counts. adverse events will be assessed by type, severity, seriousness, relatedness, incidence, and duration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Bonofill-ll Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month clinical Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>Following BonoFill-II transplantation, the bone regeneration in the operated site will be evaluated using CT or panoramic X Ray. Bone formation at the implantation site inside the maxillary sinus will be evaluated by measuring the bone height (mm) at the end of the study (residual + Augmented bone at 3 evenly-spaced locations) and comparing to measurements of bone height of the residual bone only prior to Bonofill-ll administration. Efficacy will be evaluated also by having a stable dental implants at the uncovering procedure by the end of the study.</description>

    <description>Sinus augmentation - Surgery will be performed by either open or close sinus augmentation as per investigator discretion and as per common medical practice. After the elevation, BonoFill-II will be transplanted on the residual sub-antral bone.
Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws - Treatment will be performed according to the size of the cyst: in relatively small cyst total enucleation will be performed. In large cysts, a process of marsupialization will be performed. The entire cyst will be removed, including the epithelium layer, and the BonoFill-II product will be used for filling.</description>
