    <measure>Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was assessed using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with the number of bleeds as a function of randomization and the time that each participant stays in the study (i.e., length of the efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. The model also includes the number of bleeds (&lt;9 or ≥9) in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry as a stratification factor. A bleed is considered a &quot;treated bleed&quot; if it is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;, irrespective of the time between treatment and the preceding bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

    <measure>Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Joint Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated joint bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was assessed using a NB regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with the patient's number of bleeds as a function of randomization and the time that each patient stays in the study (i.e., length of the efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. The model also includes the number of bleeds (&lt;9 or ≥9) in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry as a stratification factor. A &quot;joint bleed&quot; is defined as a bleed reported as &quot;joint&quot; and with at least one of the following symptoms: increasing swelling or warmth of the skin over the joint; and/or increasing pain, decreased range of motion, or difficulty using the joint compared with baseline. It is considered a &quot;treated joint bleed&quot; if it is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline to at least 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated spontaneous bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was assessed using a NB regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with the patient's number of bleeds as a function of randomization and the time that each patient stays in the study (i.e., length of the efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. The model also includes the number of bleeds (&lt;9 or ≥9) in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry as a stratification factor. A bleed is classified as &quot;spontaneous&quot; if there is no other known contributing factor such as trauma or procedure/surgery. A &quot;treated spontaneous bleed&quot; is a spontaneous bleed that is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

             elimination half-lives (24 weeks) after the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inherited or acquired bleeding disorder other than hemophilia A

          -  Previous or current treatment for thromboembolic disease or signs of thromboembolic
             disease

          -  Conditions that may increase risk of bleeding or thrombosis

             therapies or components of the emicizumab injection

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with cluster of differentiation
             (CD) 4 count &lt;200 cells per microliter (cells/mcL) within 24 weeks prior to screening.
             Participants with HIV infection who has CD4 greater than (&gt;) 200 and meet all other
             criteria are eligible

          -  Use of systemic immunomodulators at enrollment or planned use during the study, with

          -  Planned surgery (excluding minor procedures) during the study

          -  Receipt of emicizumab in a prior investigational study; an investigational drug to
             treat or reduce the risk of hemophilic bleeds within 5 half-lives of last drug
             administration; a non-hemophilia-related investigational drug concurrently, within
             last 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter

        <title>Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds</title>
        <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was assessed using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with the number of bleeds as a function of randomization and the time that each participant stays in the study (i.e., length of the efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. The model also includes the number of bleeds (&lt;9 or ≥9) in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry as a stratification factor. A bleed is considered a &quot;treated bleed&quot; if it is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;, irrespective of the time between treatment and the preceding bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

        <title>Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) for Treated Spontaneous Bleeds</title>
        <description>The number of treated spontaneous bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) that was assessed using a NB regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with the patient's number of bleeds as a function of randomization and the time that each patient stays in the study (i.e., length of the efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. The model also includes the number of bleeds (&lt;9 or ≥9) in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry as a stratification factor. A bleed is classified as &quot;spontaneous&quot; if there is no other known contributing factor such as trauma or procedure/surgery. A &quot;treated spontaneous bleed&quot; is a spontaneous bleed that is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

        <title>Intra-Participant Comparison of ABR for Treated Bleeds on Study Versus Pre-Study in Participants From the Non-Interventional Study Population Previously Treated With Factor VIII (FVIII) Prophylaxis (NISP)</title>
        <description>This is an intra-participant comparison of the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for treated bleeds on study versus pre-study in the NIS population previously treated with FVIII prophylaxis in NIS BH29768. The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period is presented as an ABR that was assessed using a NB regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times, with the number of bleeds as a function of treatment and the time that each participant stays in the study (i.e., length of the efficacy period) included as an offset in the model. The model also includes a repeated statement to account for intra-participant comparison. A bleed is considered a &quot;treated bleed&quot; if it is directly followed (i.e., no intervening bleed) by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;, irrespective of the time between treatment and the preceding bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure are excluded.</description>

        <title>Hemophilia A Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Physical Health Subscore for Adult Participants (≥18 Years of Age) in the Randomized Population at Week 25</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL questionnaire has been developed and used in hemophilia A participants, assessing very specific aspects of dealing with hemophilia. The questionnaire consists of items pertaining to 10 domains: physical health, sports and leisure, school and work, dealing with hemophilia, family planning, feeling, relationships, treatment, view of yourself, and outlook for the future. The total score for each domain ranges from 0 to 100 with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. Physical Health domain score is reported (range 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better physical health). The means were derived via an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and have been adjusted for the following co-variates: baseline score, treatment group, and treatment by baseline interaction term.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L VAS. The VAS is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state. The means were derived via an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and have been adjusted for the following co-variates: baseline score, treatment group, and treatment by baseline interaction term.</description>

        <title>EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire Index Utility Score in the Randomized Population at Week 25</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L VAS. The EQ-5D-5L health state profile is designed to record the participant's current health state in 5 domains: mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses from the five domains are used to calculate a single index utility score on a scale of 0 to 1, with higher scores reflective of better quality of life. The means were derived via an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and have been adjusted for the following co-variates: baseline score, treatment group, and treatment by baseline interaction term.</description>

        <title>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life - Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) Questionnaire Score in Adolescent Participants (12 to 17 Years of Age) in the Randomized Population at Week 25</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF contains 35 items, which cover nine domains considered relevant for the children's health-related quality of life (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia and treatment). Items are rated with five respective response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Haemo-QoL-SF total score range from 0 to 100, where lower scores reflect better health-related quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 25</time_frame>
        <population>The pre-specified efficacy objective was the comparison of Haemo-QoL-SF scores at Week 25 in adolescents who were previously on episodic treatment (i.e., randomized to Arms A, B, or C). Because there was a total of just one adolescent randomized to this study (in Arm C), statistical analyses could not be performed and no data is reported.</population>

          <description>The percentage of participants with adverse events of abnormal laboratory values is reported here. An abnormal laboratory value is defined as a laboratory test result outside of the normal range for hematology or serum chemistries. It is reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: is accompanied by clinical symptoms; results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation); results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. At the clinical cut-off date for primary analysis (15 Sep 2017), data was collected over a period of approximately 1 year.</description>
