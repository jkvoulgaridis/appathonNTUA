  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel study was conducted in patients undergoing
      resuscitation with chest compression for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in the mixed
      medical-surgical ICU's of 8 academic tertiary care hospitals in Iran. Patients randomized
      into 2 groups: 1) standard chest compression, 2) chest compression with real-time
      audio-visual feedback using the Cardio First Angel™ (CFA; INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) device.
      The primary outcome was sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary
      outcomes were survival to ICU and hospital discharge, incidence of sternum and rib fractures.

      A prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel study was conducted in patients undergoing

      audio-visual feedback using the Cardio First Angel™ (INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) device.
      Randomization accomplished using Random Allocation Software© (RAS; Informer Technologies,
      Inc., Madrid, Spain). Crossover was not allowed. The patient and data analyzer were blinded.
      The clinical provider was not blinded. The primary outcome was sustained return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes were survival to ICU and hospital
      discharge, incidence of sternum and rib fractures.

    <description>The Cardio First Angel™ (CFA; INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) is a handheld device consisting of three components. The rescuer-side has a red palm-sized push-button with a pictogram illustrating proper use. The center unit is composed of a stable plastic base containing an arrangement of springs, and the patient-side consists of liquid-absorbent polyurethane foam. Application of 400 ± 30 Newtons of force results in an audible click alerting the rescuer to cease compression, and an additional click on decompression alerts the rescuer to resume compression.</description>
