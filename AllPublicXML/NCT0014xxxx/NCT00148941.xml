  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this trial are to demonstrate the consistency of three manufacturing lots of GSK
      Biologicals' DTaP-IPV candidate vaccine in terms of immunogenicity and to evaluate the
      non-inferiority of GSK Biologicals' DTaP-IPV vaccine with respect to immunogenicity and
      safety compared to the control vaccines (separate injections of GSK Biologicals' DTaP vaccine
      [Infanrix] and Aventis Pasteur's IPV vaccine [IPOL]) when administered as a 5th dose of DTaP
      and a 4th dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in subjects 4 to 6 years of age. Vaccines
      will be co-administered with the second dose of M-M-RII, which is recommended at this age.
      Concomitant administration of a US-licensed influenza vaccine will be allowed according to
      seasonal availability of vaccine and at the discretion of the investigator.

      -  Investigational groups: 3, each receive one of 3 lots of DTaP-IPV vaccine.

        -  Control: US-licensed DTaP (Infanrix) + US-licensed IPV (IPOL) vaccines administered in
           separate injections.

        -  Two study visits one month apart for a subset of subjects (Safety and Immunogenicity
           subset) with a blood draw at each visit. All other subjects will have one visit.

        -  A telephone contact 4-6 days after vaccination for all subjects, a telephone contact
           31-38 days after vaccination for the Safety only subset and a telephone contact for all
           subjects during the extended safety follow-up phase (5 months following the active
           phase).
