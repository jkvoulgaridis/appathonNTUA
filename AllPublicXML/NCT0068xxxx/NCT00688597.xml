  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of 3 different
      doses of duvoglustat (AT2220) in participants affected by Pompe disease. The study also
      evaluated the effects of duvoglustat on functional parameters in Pompe disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, open-label study in participants with Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage
      disorder. Duvoglustat is designed to act as a pharmacological chaperone of alpha-glucosidase,
      in order to restore enzyme activity. This study consisted of a 28-day screening period, an
      11-week treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up period. Three dosing regimens of oral
      duvoglustat were to be evaluated (Cohort 1: 2.5 g daily for 3 days, followed by no study drug
      for 4 days; Cohort 2: 5 g daily for 3 days, followed by no study drug for 4 days; Cohort 3: 5
      g daily for 7 days, followed by no study drug for 7 days).

      Participants meeting all eligibility criteria underwent physical examination,
      electrocardiogram, spirometry, muscular strength test, functional muscle test, 6-minute walk
      test (when appropriate), laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and muscle (needle)
      biopsy. Quality of life was assessed via the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire.
      Functional ability and level of handicap was assessed by Rotterdam handicap scale.

    <measure>Proportion Of Participants Experiencing Severe Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing severe TEAEs is presented for participants who received duvoglustat treatment in this open-label study. The duration of duvoglustat exposure for Cohort 1 ranged from 2 to 24 days, and their exposure ranged from a total of 7,500 to 32,500 milligrams of duvoglustat. An adverse event (AE) refers to any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the period of observation in the clinical study. The following guideline was used to grade the intensity of an AE: mild, the AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity; moderate, the AE interferes with the daily activity but the participant is still able to function; severe, the AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Change In 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT) From Baseline To End Of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT (American Thoracic Society standards) was evaluated in ambulatory participants at screening, baseline, and to the end of the study. It was a standardized test that measured the distance in meters (m) covered over a 6-minute walk. Reference equations used (for 6MWT distance in healthy adults) included: (height in centimeters [cm], weight in kilograms [kg]) 6MWT distance for men = [7.57 × height (cm)] - [5.02 × age] - [1.76 × weight (kg)] - 309 m; 6MWT distance for women = [2.11 × height (cm)] - [5.78 × age] - [2.29 × weight (kg)] + 667 m</description>

The duration of duvoglustat exposure for Cohort 1 ranged from 2 to 24 days, and their exposure ranged from a total of 7,500 to 32,500 milligrams of duvoglustat. An adverse event (AE) refers to any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the period of observation in the clinical study. The following guideline was used to grade the intensity of an AE: mild, the AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity; moderate, the AE interferes with the daily activity but the participant is still able to function; severe, the AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Change In 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT) From Baseline To End Of Study</title>
        <description>The 6MWT (American Thoracic Society standards) was evaluated in ambulatory participants at screening, baseline, and to the end of the study. It was a standardized test that measured the distance in meters (m) covered over a 6-minute walk. Reference equations used (for 6MWT distance in healthy adults) included: (height in centimeters [cm], weight in kilograms [kg]) 6MWT distance for men = [7.57 × height (cm)] - [5.02 × age] - [1.76 × weight (kg)] - 309 m; 6MWT distance for women = [2.11 × height (cm)] - [5.78 × age] - [2.29 × weight (kg)] + 667 m</description>
