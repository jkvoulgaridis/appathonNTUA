    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of donepezil
      in children with persistent attention impairment that is present at least 12 months after the
      completion of cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in pediatric subjects who
      have persistent attention impairment following treatment for cancer. This trial has three
      phases: (1) pre-randomization to establish eligibility, (2) a 12-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase with dose escalation based on body weight, (3) a
      12-week, blinded extension phase during which all subjects will receive active drug.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Test of Variables in Attention-Continuous Performance Test (TOVA-CPT) &quot;D-prime&quot; Standard Score (SS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>TOVA-CPT test has a standardized computer game-like format that tests attention and simple impulse control. It precisely measures a person's reaction time to clicking on correct targets versus incorrect targets. Scores are based on the number of &quot;Hits&quot; (correct responses), omission errors (failure to respond), commission errors/&quot;False Alarms&quot; (incorrect responses), response time, and sensitivity (&quot;d-prime&quot;). &quot;D-prime&quot; a dimensionless statistics is a measure of distractibility and reflects how well a person reacts correctly versus incorrectly. A higher value of &quot;d-prime&quot; is reached by having more &quot;Hits&quot; (correct response) and fewer &quot;False Alarms&quot; (incorrect response). Analysis was based on three factors: the &quot;d-prime&quot; standard score, reaction time variability standard score, and response time standard score. Standard scores less than or equal to 80 were significant for an attention deficit disorder. Standard scores greater than 80 were not significant for an attention deficit disorder.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Reaction Time Variability is defined as the time measurement of how consistently the switch is pressed. The Response Time is the measurement of how fast or slow information is processed and responded to by the participant. The testing process was as described in a previous outcome measure. Standard scores less than or equal to 80 were significant for an attention deficit disorder. Standard scores greater than 80 were not significant for an attention deficit disorder.</description>

    <description>Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning test evaluates impairment of executive function(planning and organization),memory,and sustained attention in children aged 5-18 years with wide range of developmental and acquired neurological conditions.Survey assess parent/guardian's perception of their child's executive functioning in home and school environments,which relate to daily function(as judged by parent).Each survey contains 86 items scored as;1(behavior is never a problem),2(behavior is sometimes a problem),or 3(behavior is often a problem).Data was presented as t-scores(raw scale scores are used to generate t-scores)for Global Executive Composite Score(t-score range 72-216),Behavioral Regulation Index(t-score range 28-84;inhibit,shift,and emotional control),Metacognition Inde (t-score range 44-132;initiate,working memory,plan/organize,organization of materials, and monitor),and Working Memory Subscale(t-score range 35-90).Higher scores indicate decline in performance.</description>

             radiation, and must have completed this treatment at least one year before screening
             takes place for entry into this study.

          2. Subjects may be male or female; age range: 6 - 17.5 years; weight ≥ 20 kg. They must
             be physically healthy and able to move about, with or without aids, must be living in
             the community, and must have adequate motor skills as shown by tests that will be

             months after cessation of treatment. There must also be objective evidence for this

          6. The subject must not have previously taken any drugs in the class known as
             cholinesterase inhibitors.

             of the outcome measures, to administer medications, and to accompany the subject to
             the required clinic visits.

          8. Subjects with diabetes or thyroid disease may still be eligible if certain medical
             requirements are satisfied.

          9. Female subjects who could become pregnant must undergo pregnancy testing and must
             agree to use contraception.

          2. Motor coordination not sufficient, according to tests to be conducted at the time of
             screening.

          3. Recurrence of cancer. If this happens, the subject will have to withdraw from the

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 22 centers in the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Argentina, Chile, and Australia during the period of 02 July 2008 to 26 May 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This trial had three phases: (1)pre-randomization to establish eligibility; (2) a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase with dose escalation based on body weight; (3) a 12-week, blinded extension phase during which all participants received active drug. Eligible participants were randomized to receive placebo or donepezil.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Test of Variables in Attention-Continuous Performance Test (TOVA-CPT) &quot;D-prime&quot; Standard Score (SS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>TOVA-CPT test has a standardized computer game-like format that tests attention and simple impulse control. It precisely measures a person's reaction time to clicking on correct targets versus incorrect targets. Scores are based on the number of &quot;Hits&quot; (correct responses), omission errors (failure to respond), commission errors/&quot;False Alarms&quot; (incorrect responses), response time, and sensitivity (&quot;d-prime&quot;). &quot;D-prime&quot; a dimensionless statistics is a measure of distractibility and reflects how well a person reacts correctly versus incorrectly. A higher value of &quot;d-prime&quot; is reached by having more &quot;Hits&quot; (correct response) and fewer &quot;False Alarms&quot; (incorrect response). Analysis was based on three factors: the &quot;d-prime&quot; standard score, reaction time variability standard score, and response time standard score. Standard scores less than or equal to 80 were significant for an attention deficit disorder. Standard scores greater than 80 were not significant for an attention deficit disorder.</description>

        <description>The Reaction Time Variability is defined as the time measurement of how consistently the switch is pressed. The Response Time is the measurement of how fast or slow information is processed and responded to by the participant. The testing process was as described in a previous outcome measure. Standard scores less than or equal to 80 were significant for an attention deficit disorder. Standard scores greater than 80 were not significant for an attention deficit disorder.</description>
