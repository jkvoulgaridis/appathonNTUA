  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in the United States. It is estimated
      that 20 million Americans have arthritis, and the annual societal cost is $95 billion.
      Several exercise studies have shown modest improvements in disability, physical performance,
      and pain in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. While similar results have been suggested in
      hip osteoarthritis, well-designed randomized clinical trials have not been conducted.
      Exercise programs appear beneficial but without adherence, the beneficial effects of exercise
      for knee and hip osteoarthritis decline over time. A well-designed, evidence-based,
      arthritis-specific study controlling for exercise duration, frequency and adherence is
      needed. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of structured exercise
      programs on self-reported pain and disability in adults with hip osteoarthritis. This
      prospective, randomized study with a wait-list control is designed to develop preliminary
      data to support an R01 funding request for a large, randomized clinical trial. All exercise
      interventions and outcome assessments will take place at OHSU in the Orthopaedics and
      Rehabilitation Clinics, Rehabilitation Services physical therapy gym, and the General
      Clinical Research Center. Subjects will be selected to include individuals representative of
      the larger population with documented hip osteoarthritis. This three-month study will
      evaluate the effects of an aerobic and resistance exercise program on pain and disability in
      individuals with hip osteoarthritis. Outcome assessment will follow the Outcome Measures in
      Rheumatology (OMERACT) recommendations for a core set of outcome measures for clinical trials
      in arthritis and assess pain, physical function, patient global assessment, and joint
      imaging. Data analysis will focus on comparing pre- and post-intervention endpoints using
      conventional statistical analyses such as repeated-measure analysis of variance for repeated
      continuous measures (e.g. walking distance), and non-parametric methods such as Chi-square or
      frequency analysis for proportions (e.g. visual pain scores).

    <description>Exercise intervention will consist of a three-month, supervised, facility-based, hip-specific strengthening, flexibility, and endurance exercise program. The intervention will consist of two phases and take place at OHSU rehabilitation services. Phase 1 will be a two-week orientation and general conditioning program. Phase 2 will be a ten-week progressive workload program. Subjects in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 will meet two to three times per week for 45 minutes per session. Phase 1 will be group sessions with more individualized orientation and attention by the exercise instructors. Phase 2 will begin progressive conditioning and utilize exercise groups of four to six subjects.</description>

            <title>3 Month Exercise Program</title>
            <description>Structured exercise program: Exercise intervention will consist of a three-month, supervised, facility-based, hip-specific strengthening, flexibility, and endurance exercise program. The intervention will consist of two phases and take place at OHSU rehabilitation services. Phase 1 will be a two-week orientation and general conditioning program. Phase 2 will be a ten-week progressive workload program. Subjects in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 will meet two to three times per week for 45 minutes per session. Phase 1 will be group sessions with more individualized orientation and attention by the exercise instructors. Phase 2 will begin progressive conditioning and utilize exercise groups of four to six subjects.</description>
