    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to last study visit for treatment-emergent period (a maximum of approximately 111 months).</time_frame>
    <description>AE defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. Serious AE defined as AE that is fatal, life threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or other significant medical hazard. Severity of AEs assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) based on the general guideline: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Investigator assessed AEs for relatedness to study drug. Results are presented for treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) and included all AEs occurring from first dose in initial treatment phase to end of initial treatment phase (or for participants entering retreatment, from first dose in initial treatment phase until end of retreatment phase).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced the Maximum Toxicity Grade (CTCAE Grade ≥ 3) in the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1) up to last study visit for initial treatment phase (median duration approximately 30 months up to a maximum of approximately 109 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples for clinical chemistry were collected on study day 1 (baseline), day 15, week 5 and each study visit Q4W thereafter until last study visit for the on-study period (ie, until end of initial treatment phase). The parameters included albumin, calcium (albumin-adjusted), creatinine, magnesium and phosphate. Results are presented for number of participants who experienced the maximum toxicity grade for each of these clinical parameters. The maximum toxicity grade experienced by each participant was based on CTCAE, v3.0, and are summarized for Grade 3 and 4. Increases and decreases in relationship to the normal parameter ranges are indicated as 'Above' and 'Below' respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression or Recurrence During the On-Study Period for Cohort 1, Presented as Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Probability</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to the end of the initial treatment phase (median duration approximately 30 months up to a maximum of approximately 109 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression or recurrence during the on-study period was defined as the time interval (in days) from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of earliest Progressive Disease (PD) during the initial treatment phase. PD was defined as the response of progressive disease, locally recurrent disease or relapse as captured in the Disease Status page of the Case Report Form. If a participant had not had PD by the end of the initial treatment phase date, time to disease progression or recurrence were censored at her/his end of initial treatment phase date. Since median time to disease progression or recurrence for participants in cohort 1 was not reached, Kaplan-Meier estimates for the probability (expressed as a percentage) of participants in cohort 1 to have disease progression or recurrence at months 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Any On-Study Surgery at Month 6 for Cohort 2</measure>
    <time_frame>At month 6.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants without any surgery at month 6 was equivalent to the number of participants without any surgery by month 6 divided by the number of cohort 2 participants who had an opportunity to complete 6 months of treatment, expressed as a percentage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Serum Denosumab Trough Concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1), days 8 and 15 and weeks 5, 9, 13 and 25.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for determination of serum denosumab concentration levels were obtained from participants included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy at baseline (prior to administration of study drug on day 1) and at scheduled time points during the study up to week 25.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Adults and skeletally mature adolescents (≥12 years of age) were enrolled in this open-label single-arm study. The study was conducted at 30 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia from 09 Sep 2008 to study completion on 17 May 2018. The planned study duration for each participant was at least 60 months (following protocol amendment 7).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>3 participants from study 20040215 (NCT00396279) were enrolled directly into safety follow-up phase without retreatment. They were excluded from all defined analysis sets and results are reported for the 532 participants enrolled into the treatment phase. Non-completion reasons are summarized for the on-study period (ie, initial treatment phase).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Serum samples for clinical chemistry were collected on study day 1 (baseline), day 15, week 5 and each study visit Q4W thereafter until last study visit for the on-study period (ie, until end of initial treatment phase). The parameters included albumin, calcium (albumin-adjusted), creatinine, magnesium and phosphate. Results are presented for number of participants who experienced the maximum toxicity grade for each of these clinical parameters. The maximum toxicity grade experienced by each participant was based on CTCAE, v3.0, and are summarized for Grade 3 and 4. Increases and decreases in relationship to the normal parameter ranges are indicated as 'Above' and 'Below' respectively.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced the Maximum Toxicity Grade (CTCAE Grade ≥ 3) in the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
          <description>Serum samples for clinical chemistry were collected on study day 1 (baseline), day 15, week 5 and each study visit Q4W thereafter until last study visit for the on-study period (ie, until end of initial treatment phase). The parameters included albumin, calcium (albumin-adjusted), creatinine, magnesium and phosphate. Results are presented for number of participants who experienced the maximum toxicity grade for each of these clinical parameters. The maximum toxicity grade experienced by each participant was based on CTCAE, v3.0, and are summarized for Grade 3 and 4. Increases and decreases in relationship to the normal parameter ranges are indicated as 'Above' and 'Below' respectively.</description>

        <description>Time to disease progression or recurrence during the on-study period was defined as the time interval (in days) from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of earliest Progressive Disease (PD) during the initial treatment phase. PD was defined as the response of progressive disease, locally recurrent disease or relapse as captured in the Disease Status page of the Case Report Form. If a participant had not had PD by the end of the initial treatment phase date, time to disease progression or recurrence were censored at her/his end of initial treatment phase date. Since median time to disease progression or recurrence for participants in cohort 1 was not reached, Kaplan-Meier estimates for the probability (expressed as a percentage) of participants in cohort 1 to have disease progression or recurrence at months 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 are presented.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
