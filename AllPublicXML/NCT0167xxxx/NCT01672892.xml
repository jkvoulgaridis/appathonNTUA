      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different methods of radiation and
      their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating endometrial and cervical
      cancer after surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) reduces acute
           gastrointestinal toxicity in the 5th week (after 23-25 fractions) of pelvic radiation as
           measured with the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) instrument.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for
           Adverse Events version 4.0 [CTCAE v. 4.0]) is reduced with IMRT compared to conventional
           whole-pelvis radiation therapy (WPRT).

        -  To determine if grade 2+ hematologic toxicity (CTCAE v. 4.0) is reduced with IMRT
           compared to conventional WPRT.

        -  To determine if urinary toxicity is reduced with IMRT using the EPIC urinary domain.

        -  To validate EPIC bowel and urinary domains in women undergoing either IMRT pelvic
           radiation treatment or four-field pelvic radiation treatment for endometrial or cervical
           cancer.

        -  To assess the impact of pelvic IMRT on quality of life using the Functional Assessment
           of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) with cervix subscale.

        -  To determine if there is any difference in local-regional control, disease-free
           survival, and overall survival between patients treated with IMRT as compared to
           conventional WPRT.

        -  To perform a health-utilities analysis to measure the financial impact of pelvic IMRT
           via the EQ-5D instrument.

        -  To identify molecular predictors of radiation toxicity and novel circulating cancer
           biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of cancer
      (endometrial vs cervical), chemotherapy (none vs 5 courses of weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m²),
      and radiation dose (45 Gy vs 50.4 Gy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard (3-dimensional) radiation therapy 5 days a week for up
           to 5-6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for
           up to 5-6 weeks.

      Some patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues weekly for 5
      weeks, concurrently with radiation therapy, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Tissue and blood samples may be collected for biomarker and correlative analysis.

      Quality of life may be assessed by questionnaires (including the Expanded Prostate Cancer
      Index Composite [EPIC], the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G, Version
      4], the EQ-5D, and the Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events - Patient-Reported Outcome
      [PRO-CTCAE]) instruments at baseline and periodically during and after study therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for the first 2 years
      and then annually for 5 years.

    <measure>Acute Gastrointestinal Toxicity, as Measured by Change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Bowel Domain Score at 5 Weeks From the Start of Pelvic Radiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 5 of RT</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is change in acute GI toxicity, as measured by the EPIC bowel domain, from baseline to 5 weeks after the first fraction of radiation is delivered. The EPIC has four domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal) that have been validated separately, which allows use of only the domains of interest. The EPIC bowel domain consists of 14 items and has a function subscale (7 items) and bother subscale (7 items). For each domain, responses form a Likert scale and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, where higher scores correspond to better quality of life. At least 80% of the items in a domain or subscale of the domain must be completed in order to compute the score. Change was calculated as follow-up score - baseline score so a negative change score indicates a decline in function.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Acute Grade 2+ GI Toxicity at 5 Weeks From the Start of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 5 of RT</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE.</description>

    <measure>Urinary Toxicity, as Measured by Change in EPIC Urinary Domain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 3 and 5 of RT, and 4-6 weeks after RT</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is change in acute GI toxicity, as measured by the EPIC urinary domain, from baseline to 5 weeks after the first fraction of radiation is delivered. The EPIC has four domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal) that have been validated separately, which allows use of only the domains of interest.

    <measure>Quality of Life, as Measured by Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and FACT-Cx (Cervix) Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before study start, Week 5 of RT, 4-6 Weeks after RT, 1 year from start of RT and 3 years from start of RT</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G is a validated, 27-item measure where a higher score represents higher QOL. In addition to a total QOL score, subscale scores for physical, functional, social and emotional well-being are produced. There are 5 responses options, with 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. All items in a subscale are added together to obtain subscale totals. Scores range from 0-108 for the FACT-G total score, 0-28 for physical, social, functional, and 0-24 for emotional subscale. Certain items must be reversed before it is added by subtracting the response from 4. Subscale totals are summed to form the FACT-G total score. The FACT-Cx is 5-items, with score ranging 0-60, but is not included in total FACT-G. Each subscale requires &gt;= 50% of items completed and overall response rate must be greater than 80%. If items are missing, the subscale scores can be prorated. Change calculated as follow-up score - baseline score so that a negative change score indicates a decline in function.</description>

    <measure>Health Utilities, as Measured by Change From Baseline in EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5 of RT, 4-6 weeks after RT</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a 2-part self-assessment questionnaire. First part is 5 items (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with 3 problem levels (1-none, 2-moderate, 3-extreme). Health states are defined by the combination of the leveled responses to the 5 dimensions, generating 243 health states to which unconsciousness and death are added. The 2nd part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state, measured on a 20-cm 10-point interval scale. Worst imaginable health state is scored as 0 at the bottom of the scale, and best imaginable health state is scored as 100 at the top. Both the 5-item index score and the VAS score are transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). Change from baseline is calculated as score at the timepoint of interested - baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Local-regional Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 37.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Local recurrence is defined as a disease in the radiation treatment field. This can include a local vaginal recurrence or nodal disease within the field. Para-aortic recurrence is defined as new lymphadenopathy in the para-aortic distribution. Local-regional control time is defined as time from randomization to the date of local recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death (competing risk). Local-regional recurrence rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Three-year rates are provided. Analysis occurred after all patients had been on study for at least 3 years.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 37.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Disease (progression) is defined as local recurrence, para-aortic recurrence, or distant metastasis. Local recurrence is defined as a disease in the radiation treatment field. Para-aortic recurrence is defined as new lymphadenopathy in the para-aortic distribution. Distant metastasis is defined as involvement of another organ or peritoneal disease. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of progression, death, or last known follow-up (censored). Disease-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Three-year rates are provided. Analysis occurred after all patients had been on study for at least 3 years.</description>

    <measure>Standardized Cronbach's Alpha for EPIC Bowel and Urinary Domains (Validation - Internal Consistency Reliability)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 5 of RT</time_frame>
    <description>The EPIC bowel domain consists of 14 items and has a function subscale (7 items) and bother subscale (7 items). The EPIC urinary domain consists of 12 total items and 4 subscales, functional (5 items), bother (7), incontinence (4) and irritative/obstructive (7). For each item, responses form a Likert scale which are transformed to a 0-100 scale in which higher scores correspond to better quality of life. A domain score is the average of the transformed item scores. At least 80% of the items in a domain or subscale of the domain must be completed in order to compute the score. Cronbach's alpha is an internal consistency estimate of reliability of psychometric test scores and is a function of the number of items in a test, the average covariance between item-pairs, and the variance of the total score. An alpha of 0.60-0.79 was to be considered acceptable reliability; higher than 0.8 was to be considered good reliability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 5 of RT</time_frame>
    <description>The EPIC bowel domain and urinary domains consist of 14 and 12 items, respectively. For each item, responses form a Likert scale which are transformed to a 0-100 scale in which higher scores correspond to better quality of life (QOL). A domain score is the average of the transformed item scores. At least 80% of the items in a domain must be completed in order to compute the score. The FACT-G is 27-item measure. Higher scores represent higher QOL. Each item has 5 responses options, 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. Items are added together for the total score, ranging from 0-108. Certain items must be reversed before adding by subtracting the response from 4. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables with a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation.</description>

             for a minimum of 3 years.

          8. Prior radiation therapy to the pelvis

          9. Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. 10 Severe, active co-morbidity,
             defined as follows:

               -  10.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization
                  within the last 6 months

               -  10.2 Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months

               -  10.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the
                  time of registration

               -  10.4 Other major medical illness which requires hospitalization or precludes
                  study therapy at the time of registration

               -  10.5 Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation
                  defects; note, however,that laboratory test coagulation parameters are not
                  required for entry into this protocol

               -  10.6 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for
                  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing
                  is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with
                  AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this
                  protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements
                  may also exclude immunocompromised patients.

        11. Patients with prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy 12. Women who are
        breastfeeding

        <title>Acute Gastrointestinal Toxicity, as Measured by Change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Bowel Domain Score at 5 Weeks From the Start of Pelvic Radiation</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is change in acute GI toxicity, as measured by the EPIC bowel domain, from baseline to 5 weeks after the first fraction of radiation is delivered. The EPIC has four domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal) that have been validated separately, which allows use of only the domains of interest. The EPIC bowel domain consists of 14 items and has a function subscale (7 items) and bother subscale (7 items). For each domain, responses form a Likert scale and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, where higher scores correspond to better quality of life. At least 80% of the items in a domain or subscale of the domain must be completed in order to compute the score. Change was calculated as follow-up score - baseline score so a negative change score indicates a decline in function.</description>

          <title>Acute Gastrointestinal Toxicity, as Measured by Change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Bowel Domain Score at 5 Weeks From the Start of Pelvic Radiation</title>
          <description>The primary endpoint is change in acute GI toxicity, as measured by the EPIC bowel domain, from baseline to 5 weeks after the first fraction of radiation is delivered. The EPIC has four domains (bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal) that have been validated separately, which allows use of only the domains of interest. The EPIC bowel domain consists of 14 items and has a function subscale (7 items) and bother subscale (7 items). For each domain, responses form a Likert scale and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, where higher scores correspond to better quality of life. At least 80% of the items in a domain or subscale of the domain must be completed in order to compute the score. Change was calculated as follow-up score - baseline score so a negative change score indicates a decline in function.</description>

        <description>The FACT-G is a validated, 27-item measure where a higher score represents higher QOL. In addition to a total QOL score, subscale scores for physical, functional, social and emotional well-being are produced. There are 5 responses options, with 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. All items in a subscale are added together to obtain subscale totals. Scores range from 0-108 for the FACT-G total score, 0-28 for physical, social, functional, and 0-24 for emotional subscale. Certain items must be reversed before it is added by subtracting the response from 4. Subscale totals are summed to form the FACT-G total score. The FACT-Cx is 5-items, with score ranging 0-60, but is not included in total FACT-G. Each subscale requires &gt;= 50% of items completed and overall response rate must be greater than 80%. If items are missing, the subscale scores can be prorated. Change calculated as follow-up score - baseline score so that a negative change score indicates a decline in function.</description>

        <title>Health Utilities, as Measured by Change From Baseline in EQ-5D</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a 2-part self-assessment questionnaire. First part is 5 items (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with 3 problem levels (1-none, 2-moderate, 3-extreme). Health states are defined by the combination of the leveled responses to the 5 dimensions, generating 243 health states to which unconsciousness and death are added. The 2nd part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state, measured on a 20-cm 10-point interval scale. Worst imaginable health state is scored as 0 at the bottom of the scale, and best imaginable health state is scored as 100 at the top. Both the 5-item index score and the VAS score are transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). Change from baseline is calculated as score at the timepoint of interested - baseline score.</description>

        <title>Local-regional Recurrence</title>
        <description>Local recurrence is defined as a disease in the radiation treatment field. This can include a local vaginal recurrence or nodal disease within the field. Para-aortic recurrence is defined as new lymphadenopathy in the para-aortic distribution. Local-regional control time is defined as time from randomization to the date of local recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death (competing risk). Local-regional recurrence rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Three-year rates are provided. Analysis occurred after all patients had been on study for at least 3 years.</description>

Para-aortic recurrence is defined as new lymphadenopathy in the para-aortic distribution. Distant metastasis is defined as involvement of another organ or peritoneal disease. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of progression, death, or last known follow-up (censored). Disease-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Three-year rates are provided.

        <description>The EPIC bowel domain consists of 14 items and has a function subscale (7 items) and bother subscale (7 items). The EPIC urinary domain consists of 12 total items and 4 subscales, functional (5 items), bother (7), incontinence (4) and irritative/obstructive (7). For each item, responses form a Likert scale which are transformed to a 0-100 scale in which higher scores correspond to better quality of life. A domain score is the average of the transformed item scores. At least 80% of the items in a domain or subscale of the domain must be completed in order to compute the score. Cronbach's alpha is an internal consistency estimate of reliability of psychometric test scores and is a function of the number of items in a test, the average covariance between item-pairs, and the variance of the total score. An alpha of 0.60-0.79 was to be considered acceptable reliability; higher than 0.8 was to be considered good reliability.</description>

        <title>Pearson Correlation Coefficient for EPIC Bowel and Urinary Domains vs. FACT-G Total Score (Validation - Criterion Validity)</title>
        <description>The EPIC bowel domain and urinary domains consist of 14 and 12 items, respectively. For each item, responses form a Likert scale which are transformed to a 0-100 scale in which higher scores correspond to better quality of life (QOL). A domain score is the average of the transformed item scores. At least 80% of the items in a domain must be completed in order to compute the score. The FACT-G is 27-item measure. Higher scores represent higher QOL. Each item has 5 responses options, 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. Items are added together for the total score, ranging from 0-108. Certain items must be reversed before adding by subtracting the response from 4. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables with a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation.</description>

          <title>Pearson Correlation Coefficient for EPIC Bowel and Urinary Domains vs. FACT-G Total Score (Validation - Criterion Validity)</title>
          <description>The EPIC bowel domain and urinary domains consist of 14 and 12 items, respectively. For each item, responses form a Likert scale which are transformed to a 0-100 scale in which higher scores correspond to better quality of life (QOL). A domain score is the average of the transformed item scores. At least 80% of the items in a domain must be completed in order to compute the score. The FACT-G is 27-item measure. Higher scores represent higher QOL. Each item has 5 responses options, 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. Items are added together for the total score, ranging from 0-108. Certain items must be reversed before adding by subtracting the response from 4. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables with a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation.</description>

For each item, responses form a Likert scale which are transformed to a 0-100 scale in which higher scores correspond to better quality of life (QOL). A domain score is the average of the transformed item scores. At least 80% of the items in a domain must be completed in order to compute the score. Difference is calculated as baseline - week 5.
