      This phase II/III clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) transplanted directly into the injured spinal cord.

    <textblock>
      The Principal investigator has performed a clinical trial using autologous MSCs in patients
      with cervical spinal cord injury. The results revealed the safety of autologous MSC. This
      Phase II, III single-center trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived
      mesenchymal stem cell transplantation direct to injured spinal cord site via laminectomy.
      After recovery from the operation, the subjects receive 4 weeks of physical and occupational
      therapy.

&lt;American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale&gt; The exam is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body. Sensation is graded on a scale of 0-2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation. Each side of the body is graded independently. When an area is not available (e.g. because of an amputation or cast), it is recorded as &quot;NT&quot;, &quot;not testable&quot;.</description>
