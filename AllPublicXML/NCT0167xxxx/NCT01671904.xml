  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of venetoclax (GDC-0199, ABT-199) administered in combination with
      bendamustine and rituximab (BR) (MabThera/Rituxan) or bendamustine and obinutuzumab (BG) to
      participants with first-line (1L)/previously untreated or relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study will explore two venetoclax combination regimens in
      participants with 1L CLL: BR+venetolax (V) and BG+V. Participants with R/R CLL will be
      administered BR+V.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5.75 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
