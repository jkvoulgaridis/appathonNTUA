    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe, Oceania and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy of insulin degludec/liraglutide in
      controlling glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and OAD therapy.

    <measure>Number of Severe or Minor Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>After 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Rate (events per 100 patient years of exposure) of treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. The pool of severe and minor hypoglycaemic episodes was referred to as confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemia was categorised as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as an episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia with confirmation by blood glucose &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or PG &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), and which was handled by the subject himself/herself, or any asymptomatic blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Rate (events per 100 exposure years) of treatment-emergent adverse events (an event that had onset date (or an increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment) which occurred during the 26 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) Based on the Treatment Related Impact Measure - Diabetes (TRIM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The patient related outcome is calculated based on TRIM-D questionnaire. The TRIM-D questionnaire consists of 5 sub-domains (treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance and psychological health), where each question is scored to a 1-5-point scale with a higher score indicating a better health state (less negative impact). Mean TRIM-D individual sub-domain scores and total score are later transformed to a 0-100 scale for analysis. The mean change in scores from baseline to 26 weeks for all the individual sub domains and total scores are presented here.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) Based on Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire (DTSQs) scores from baseline. The scores ranged from 0 to 6. Higher total score on a 0-6 point scale indicates a general higher treatment satisfaction, whereas higher score on perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia indicate that blood glucose levels are out of the target range.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Treatment with daily GLP-1 receptor agonist at maximum dose according to local label
             (i.e. 1.8 mg once daily (OD) Victoza® (liraglutide) or 10 microgram twice daily (BID)
             Byetta® (exenatide)) or documented maximum tolerated dose (i.e. 1.2 mg OD Victoza®
             (liraglutide) or 5 microgram BID Byetta® (exenatide)) in combination with a stable

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 81 sites in 5 countries as follows: Australia: 5 sites; France: 7 sites; Hungary: 4 sites; Slovakia 6 sites; United States: 59 sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The duration of the screening period was 2 weeks. All subjects continued GLP-1 receptor agonist and metformin±pioglitazone±SU treatments in their pre-trial doses during the screening period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide + Oral Anti Diabetic Drugs (OADs)</title>
          <description>Subjects were treated with subcutaneous (under the skin) once daily (OD) insulin degludec/liraglutide. Treatment with insulin degludec/liraglutide was initiated at 16 dose steps containing 16 units of insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide. Adjustment of the insulin degludec/liraglutide dose was performed twice weekly based on the mean of 3 preceding daily fasting self measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values on 3 consecutive days. The aim was to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target of 4.0–5.0 mmol/L (72−90 mg/dL) and the maximum allowed dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide). Subjects also continued their pre-trial OADs (metformin±pioglitazone±SU) treatment without changing the frequency or dose throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

            <description>Subjects were treated with subcutaneous (under the skin) once daily (OD) insulin degludec/liraglutide. Treatment with insulin degludec/liraglutide was initiated at 16 dose steps containing 16 units of insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide. Adjustment of the insulin degludec/liraglutide dose was performed twice weekly based on the mean of 3 preceding daily fasting self measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values on 3 consecutive days. The aim was to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target of 4.0–5.0 mmol/L (72−90 mg/dL) and the maximum allowed dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide). Subjects also continued their pre-trial OADs (metformin±pioglitazone±SU) treatment without changing the frequency or dose throughout the trial, unless there was a safety concern.</description>

The pool of severe and minor hypoglycaemic episodes was referred to as confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemia was categorised as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as an episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia with confirmation by blood glucose &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or PG &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), and which was handled by the subject himself/herself, or any asymptomatic blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL).</description>

          <description>Rate (events per 100 patient years of exposure) of treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. The pool of severe and minor hypoglycaemic episodes was referred to as confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemia was categorised as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as an episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia with confirmation by blood glucose &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or PG &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), and which was handled by the subject himself/herself, or any asymptomatic blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL).</description>

        <description>The patient related outcome is calculated based on TRIM-D questionnaire. The TRIM-D questionnaire consists of 5 sub-domains (treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance and psychological health), where each question is scored to a 1-5-point scale with a higher score indicating a better health state (less negative impact). Mean TRIM-D individual sub-domain scores and total score are later transformed to a 0-100 scale for analysis. The mean change in scores from baseline to 26 weeks for all the individual sub domains and total scores are presented here.</description>
