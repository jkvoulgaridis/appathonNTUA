    <measure>Summary of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 106</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. AEs are determined by the Investigator to be related or not related to the study drug.
A serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences the subject is counted only once in a category. The same subject may appear in different categories.</description>

    <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for efficacy markers used the PANSS scores. The PANSS assessment is a medical scale designed to measure symptom severity among patients with schizophrenia. Each item is rated on a scale of 1=absent to 7=extreme. PANSS consists of three components:
The General Psychopathology Scale consists of 16 questions with a total range of 16 (no schizophrenia symptoms) to 112 (extreme schizophrenia symptoms).
Both the Positive Scale and the Negative Scale consists of 7 questions with a total range of 7 (no schizophrenia symptoms) to 49 (extreme symptoms) on each scale.
The PANSS range for assuring stability was a total PANSS General Psychopathology Scale score of 70 or less, with no score of 4 on any of the 7 questions in the Positive scale.</description>

    <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for efficacy markers used CGI scores. The CGI is used in the assessment of global illness severity and change in clinical condition over time in psychiatric patients.
Severity of illness is measured on a 7-point scale with 1=normal, not at all ill and 7=among the most extremely ill patients.
Global improvement is measured on a 7-point scale with 1=very much improved, 4=no change and 7=very much worse as compared to the severity of illness at baseline.</description>

    <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for safety markers used AIMS. The AIMS is a scale that aids in the early detection and ongoing monitoring of tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder that can result from long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication. By assessing the participant's body movement in specific positions requiring rotation, a psychiatrist is able to determine whether abnormal facial or body movements exist.
The total score is the sum of 7 questions assessing movement plus 3 questions representing global assessments on the overall level of involuntary movement severity, incapacitation due to involuntary movement, and patient's awareness of involuntary movement. Each of the 10 questions are scored on a 0 (none) - 4 (extremely severe) scale. Plus two dental status questions are scored on a 0 (no) - 1 (yes) scale. The total score is therefore a scale of 0 (normal) - 42 (advanced tardive dyskinesia).</description>

    <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for safety markers used SAS. The SAS is a 10-item scale used to detect the presence of drug induced parkinsonism and extrapyramidal side effects, and evaluates symptom severity. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0 to 4 scale with 0=normal and 4=extreme description of the particular side effect. The total range is 0=no side effects observed to 40 = extreme of each of the 10 side effects.</description>

    <description>The BAS is a scale that detects the presence and severity of any drug induced akathisia. The scale measures objective and subjective effects such as restlessness and awareness of restlessness, respectively. Participants are observed while seated, then while standing and engaged in neutral conversation. Symptoms observed during additional situations, such as participant behavior on the ward, may also be rated. Subjective phenomena should be elicited through direct questioning of the participant. The global clinical assessment is reported on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = absent and 5 = severe akathisia.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), Days 28, 56, 84, and End of Study (Day 106 or early termination visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a scale developed by the National Institute of Mental Health trial group as a counterpart to the FDA's categorization of suicidal events. It was developed by a careful review and consequent categorization of thoughts and behavior that were statistically identified as significantly related to suicidal behavior. The scale captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors throughout lifetime at screening, baseline, and for the time interval since last administration for repeat administrations during a study.
This outcome reports the number of participants with suicidal ideation or behavior.</description>

          <title>Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP-2D6)</title>
          <description>CYP-2D6 is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism and elimination of many drugs. Considerable variation exists in the efficiency and amount of CYP-2D6 enzyme produced between individuals. Hence, for drugs that are metabolized by CYP-2D6, certain individuals will eliminate these drugs quickly (ultrarapid metabolizers) while others slowly (poor metabolizers).
poor metabolizer – little or no CYP-2D6 function
intermediate metabolizers – metabolize drugs at a rate somewhere between the poor and extensive metabolizers
extensive metabolizer – normal CYP-2D6 function</description>

        <title>Summary of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. AEs are determined by the Investigator to be related or not related to the study drug.
A serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences the subject is counted only once in a category. The same subject may appear in different categories.</description>

        <title>Total Risperidone PK: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC0-24)</title>
        <description>Total risperidone concentration (risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone) was determined by adding risperidone concentration to risperidone-equivalent concentration (obtained from the 9-hydroxyrisperidone data). Total risperidone concentration was calculated using the molecular weights of 410 for risperidone and 426 for 9-hydroxyrisperidone:
[Total Risperidone] = [Risperidone] + (410/426) * [9-hydroxyrisperidone]
AUC0-24 calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule.
Results are reported across two timeframes:
Initial Peak, Injection 1 (Day 1 injection to 24 hours after injection)
Initial Peak, Injection 3 (Day 57 injection to 24 hours after injection)
The PK sampling schedule was:
Days 1 and 57: within 15 minutes prior to dosing, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 hours post-dose
Days 2, 4, 6, 8-12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 58, 60, 62, 64-68, 71, 74, 78, 81 once each day at same time of day as study drug administration</description>

        <title>Total Risperidone PK: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) During Initial Peak</title>
        <description>Total risperidone concentration (risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone) was determined by adding risperidone concentration to risperidone-equivalent concentration (from the 9-hydroxyrisperidone data). Total risperidone concentration was calculated using the molecular weights of 410 for risperidone and 426 for 9-hydroxyrisperidone:
[Total Risperidone] = [Risperidone] + (410/426) * [9-hydroxyrisperidone]
Cmax determined directly from individual concentration-time data.
Results are reported across two timeframes:
Initial Peak, Injection 1 (Day 1 injection to 24 hours after injection)
Initial Peak, Injection 3 (Day 57 injection to 24 hours after injection)
The PK sampling schedule was:
Days 1 and 57: within 15 minutes prior to dosing, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 hours post-dose
Days 2, 4, 6, 8-12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 58, 60, 62, 64-68, 71, 74, 78, 81 once each day at same time of day as study drug administration</description>

          <title>Total Risperidone PK: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Time Tau (Where Tau=28 Days) (AUCtau)</title>
          <description>Total risperidone concentration (risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone) was determined by adding risperidone concentration to risperidone-equivalent concentration (obtained from the 9-hydroxyrisperidone data). Total risperidone concentration was calculated using the molecular weights of 410 for risperidone and 426 for 9-hydroxyrisperidone:
[Total Risperidone] = [Risperidone] + (410/426) * [9-hydroxyrisperidone]
AUCtau calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule.
Results are reported across two timeframes:
Overall, Injection 1 (Day 1 injection to Day 28)
Overall, Injection 3 (Day 57 injection to Day 84)
The PK sampling schedule was:
Days 1 and 57: within 15 minutes prior to dosing, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 hours post-dose

        <title>Total Risperidone PK: Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) Over the PK Profile</title>
        <description>Total risperidone concentration (risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone) was determined by adding risperidone concentration to risperidone-equivalent concentration (obtained from the 9-hydroxyrisperidone data). Total risperidone concentration was calculated using the molecular weights of 410 for risperidone and 426 for 9-hydroxyrisperidone:
[Total Risperidone] = [Risperidone] + (410/426) * [9-hydroxyrisperidone]
Minimum plasma concentrations determined directly from individual concentration-time data.
Results are reported across two timeframes:
Overall, Injection 1 (Day 1 injection to Day 28)
Overall, Injection 3 (Day 57 injection to Day 84)
The PK sampling schedule was:
Days 1 and 57: within 15 minutes prior to dosing, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 hours post-dose
Days 2, 4, 6, 8-12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 58, 60, 62, 64-68, 71, 74, 78, 81 once each day at same time of day as study drug administration</description>

[Total Risperidone] = [Risperidone] + (410/426) * [9-hydroxyrisperidone]
The swing of total risperidone plasma concentrations calculated as (Cmax - Cmin) / Cmin.
Results are reported across two timeframes:
Overall, Injection 1 (Day 1 injection to Day 28)
Overall, Injection 3 (Day 57 injection to Day 84)
The PK sampling schedule was:

        <title>Total Risperidone PK: Swing Over the Secondary Peak</title>
        <description>Total risperidone concentration (risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone) was determined by adding risperidone concentration to risperidone-equivalent concentration (obtained from the 9-hydroxyrisperidone data). Total risperidone concentration was calculated using the molecular weights of 410 for risperidone and 426 for 9-hydroxyrisperidone:
[Total Risperidone] = [Risperidone] + (410/426) * [9-hydroxyrisperidone]
The swing of total risperidone plasma concentrations calculated as (Cmax - Cmin) / Cmin.
Results are reported across two timeframes:
Secondary Peak, Injection 1 (Day 2 - Day 29)
Secondary Peak, Injection 3 (Day 58 - Day 85)
The PK sampling schedule was:
Days 1 and 57: within 15 minutes prior to dosing, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 hours post-dose
Days 2, 4, 6, 8-12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 58, 60, 62, 64-68, 71, 74, 78, 81 once each day at same time of day as study drug administration</description>

        <title>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Scores at Baseline and Days 28, 56, 84 and 106</title>
        <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for efficacy markers used the PANSS scores. The PANSS assessment is a medical scale designed to measure symptom severity among patients with schizophrenia. Each item is rated on a scale of 1=absent to 7=extreme. PANSS consists of three components:
The General Psychopathology Scale consists of 16 questions with a total range of 16 (no schizophrenia symptoms) to 112 (extreme schizophrenia symptoms).
Both the Positive Scale and the Negative Scale consists of 7 questions with a total range of 7 (no schizophrenia symptoms) to 49 (extreme symptoms) on each scale.
The PANSS range for assuring stability was a total PANSS General Psychopathology Scale score of 70 or less, with no score of 4 on any of the 7 questions in the Positive scale.</description>

        <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for efficacy markers used CGI scores. The CGI is used in the assessment of global illness severity and change in clinical condition over time in psychiatric patients.
Severity of illness is measured on a 7-point scale with 1=normal, not at all ill and 7=among the most extremely ill patients.
Global improvement is measured on a 7-point scale with 1=very much improved, 4=no change and 7=very much worse as compared to the severity of illness at baseline.</description>

        <title>Global Assessment of the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for Tardive Dyskinesia at Baseline and Days 28, 56, 84 and 106</title>
        <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for safety markers used AIMS. The AIMS is a scale that aids in the early detection and ongoing monitoring of tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder that can result from long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication. By assessing the participant's body movement in specific positions requiring rotation, a psychiatrist is able to determine whether abnormal facial or body movements exist.
The total score is the sum of 7 questions assessing movement plus 3 questions representing global assessments on the overall level of involuntary movement severity, incapacitation due to involuntary movement, and patient's awareness of involuntary movement. Each of the 10 questions are scored on a 0 (none) - 4 (extremely severe) scale. Plus two dental status questions are scored on a 0 (no) - 1 (yes) scale. The total score is therefore a scale of 0 (normal) - 42 (advanced tardive dyskinesia).</description>

        <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for safety markers used SAS. The SAS is a 10-item scale used to detect the presence of drug induced parkinsonism and extrapyramidal side effects, and evaluates symptom severity. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0 to 4 scale with 0=normal and 4=extreme description of the particular side effect. The total range is 0=no side effects observed to 40 = extreme of each of the 10 side effects.</description>

          <description>The switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for safety markers used SAS. The SAS is a 10-item scale used to detect the presence of drug induced parkinsonism and extrapyramidal side effects, and evaluates symptom severity. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0 to 4 scale with 0=normal and 4=extreme description of the particular side effect. The total range is 0=no side effects observed to 40 = extreme of each of the 10 side effects.</description>

        <title>Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia Using the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) at Baseline and Days 28, 56, 84 and 106</title>
        <description>The BAS is a scale that detects the presence and severity of any drug induced akathisia. The scale measures objective and subjective effects such as restlessness and awareness of restlessness, respectively. Participants are observed while seated, then while standing and engaged in neutral conversation. Symptoms observed during additional situations, such as participant behavior on the ward, may also be rated. Subjective phenomena should be elicited through direct questioning of the participant. The global clinical assessment is reported on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = absent and 5 = severe akathisia.</description>

        <title>Participants With Suicidal Ideation or Behavior as Identified Using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score at Baseline and Days 28, 56, 84 and 106</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale developed by the National Institute of Mental Health trial group as a counterpart to the FDA's categorization of suicidal events. It was developed by a careful review and consequent categorization of thoughts and behavior that were statistically identified as significantly related to suicidal behavior. The scale captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors throughout lifetime at screening, baseline, and for the time interval since last administration for repeat administrations during a study.
This outcome reports the number of participants with suicidal ideation or behavior.</description>
