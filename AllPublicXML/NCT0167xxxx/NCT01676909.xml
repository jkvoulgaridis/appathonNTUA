      Veterans with schizophrenia, other serious mental illnesses (SMI), and Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) are at elevated risk for co-occurring chronic medical conditions resulting in
      increased risk of disability, high health care spending, reduced quality of life and early
      mortality. Physical wellness is increasingly recognized as a key component of the VA's
      commitment to developing recovery-oriented and Veteran-centered mental health treatment.

      population and two recent adaptations for use with SMI adults in the public health sector
      (including the investigators' own evaluation of an intervention called Living Well), the

      Background:

      Veterans with schizophrenia, other serious mental illnesses (SMI), and Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) are at elevated risk for co-occurring chronic medical conditions resulting in
      increased risk of disability, high health care spending, reduced quality of life and early
      mortality. Physical wellness is increasingly recognized as a key component of the VA's
      commitment to developing recovery-oriented and Veteran-centered mental health treatment.
      There is also growing recognition of the value of interventions that promote and improve
      patient self-management of chronic medical conditions. Building on the established efficacy
      of consumer facilitated medical illness self-management programming used in the general
      population and two recent adaptations for use with SMI adults in the public health sector
      (including the investigators' own evaluation of an intervention called Living Well), the
      investigators propose to complete a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of the Living
      Well intervention and simultaneously conduct a well specified process evaluation to optimize
      knowledge accrual regarding important factors that may improve future adoption,
      implementation and sustainability of the Living Well intervention in the VA system of care.

      Aims:

      Primary AIM 1: Complete a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of the Living Well
      intervention with 242 Veterans with mental illness and at least one co-occurring chronic
      medical condition and evaluate the intervention's effects on functional and service related
      outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that those randomized to the Living Well intervention
      will, in comparison to those randomized to a medical illness education and support group,
      demonstrate improved general health functioning including physical and emotional functioning
      as well as reduced rates of medical emergency room visits for management of a chronic medical
      condition. The investigators will also evaluate intervention effects on more proximal
      attitudinal and behavioral outcomes and assess how these factors mediate improvement in the
      functional and services related outcomes.

      Primary AIM 2: Complete a well specified process evaluation based on the RE-AIM evaluation
      framework to better understand contextual factors that can improve the Reach, Effectiveness,
      Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance which together determine the potential public health
      impact of the Living Well intervention.

      Methods:

      A mix of temporally overlapping quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to maximize
      integration and synthesis of data streams across the two aims to optimize knowledge accrual.

      Impact:

      Despite the growing recognition that self-management strategies hold enormous promise for
      improving quality and outcomes of care for chronic medical illnesses, and the fact that
      self-management is gaining prominence as a mental health recovery oriented treatment focus,
      there are currently no evidence-based peer facilitated medical illness self-management
      interventions available for dissemination within the VA mental health system. The proposed
      study is designed to both generate evidence supporting the effectiveness of a peer
      co-facilitated intervention and to help speed throughput to public health impact by
      collecting important contextual information about factors that may improve future
      dissemination and implementation efforts.

Key topics that will be discussed are medication side effects, how symptoms of mental illness may affect veterans’ ability to manage their medical conditions, effects of substance use on medical and mental health functioning, learning ways to eat healthier and exercise, and how to communicate more effectively with care providers. Groups will meet weekly for 75 minutes for three months (12 sessions). There will be 3 booster sessions after the 12 sessions, once a month for 3 months.</description>

            <groups_desc>A logistic mixed effects model over two 6-month time periods (prior to baseline and between baseline and the 6-month follow-up visit) was used. Terms in the model included group, binary time (pre-f/u versus pre-baseline), and group by time interaction. Two-sided alpha = .05 level tests were used. The hypothesis that the proportion with ER visits would decrease in the Living Well group versus the control group was tests by test of the interaction term.</groups_desc>

The original CDSMP measure has been shown to have strong test-retest reliability and internal consistency as well. This subscale consists of 2 items with possible responses ranging from Never (0) to Always (5). Combined scores from these 2 items may range from 0-10 on this subscale, higher scores indicating greater frequency.</description>

        <description>This questionnaire is based on the items used in the original CDSMP as part of that groups extensive evaluation of the curriculum. The original CDSMP measure has been shown to have adequate psychometric properties; the range of test-retest coefficients for the original illness management scales was .56 to .92, with internal-consistency coefficients ranging from .70 to .75. The Making Better Use of Health Care Subscale consists of 4 items with responses ranging from Never (0) to Always (5).Combined scores from these 4 items may range from 0-20 on this subscale, higher scores indicating greater frequency of using the behavior indicating greater self-management behavior.</description>

        <description>This questionnaire is based on the items used in the original CDSMP as part of that groups extensive evaluation of the curriculum. The original CDSMP measure has been shown to have adequate psychometric properties; the range of test-retest coefficients for the original illness management scales was .56 to .92, with internal-consistency coefficients ranging from .70 to .75. The Physical Activity Subscale consists of 2 items with responses ranging from Never (0) to Always (5). Combined scores from these 2 items may range from 0-10 on this subscale, higher scores indicating greater frequency of using the behavior indicating greater self-management behavior.</description>

This subscale consists of 2 items with possible responses ranging from Never (0) to Always (5). Combined scores may range from 0-10 on this subscale, higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy.</description>

        <description>This questionnaire is based on the items used in the original CDSMP as part of that groups extensive evaluation of the curriculum. The original CDSMP measure has been shown to have adequate psychometric properties; the range of test-retest coefficients for the original illness management scales was .56 to .92, with internal-consistency coefficients ranging from .70 to .75. The Making Better Use of Health Care Subscale consists of 4 items with responses ranging from Never (0) to Always (5). Scores may range from 0-20 on this subscale, higher scores indicate greater frequency of behavior indicating greater self-management behavior.</description>

        <description>This questionnaire is based on the items used in the original CDSMP as part of that groups extensive evaluation of the curriculum. The original CDSMP measure has been shown to have adequate psychometric properties; the range of test-retest coefficients for the original illness management scales was .56 to .92, with internal-consistency coefficients ranging from .70 to .75. The Physical Activity Subscale consists of 2 items with responses ranging from Never (0) to Always (5). Combined scores may range from 0-10 on this subscale, higher scores indicate greater frequency of using the behavior indicating greater self-management.</description>

            <groups_desc>The same mixed model used for testing hypothesis 1 was used to test treatment effects on secondary scale outcomes (Hypothesis 3: health-related self-efficacy, patient activation; Hypothesis 4: six subscales of the Measure of Self-Management Behaviors) and several other pre-specified outcomes. To test for a group difference in mean change from baseline to follow-up (hypothesis 5) on all primary and secondary outcomes, the significance test of the group-by-follow-up coefficient was performed.</groups_desc>

          <title>Living Well</title>
          <description>Living Well (LW) will be implemented as a 12-session, peer-led, group intervention (4-8 persons) designed to help veterans with co-occurring Serious Mental Illnesses and Chronic Medical Conditions learn techniques for better health management and ways to live a healthier lifestyle. Key topics that will be discussed are medication side effects, how symptoms of mental illness may affect veterans’ ability to manage their medical conditions, effects of substance use on medical and mental health functioning, learning ways to eat healthier, and how to communicate more effectively with care providers. Groups will meet weekly for 75 minutes for three months (12 sessions). There will be 3 booster sessions after the 12 sessions, once a month for 3 months.</description>

          <title>Medical Illness Education and Support Group</title>
          <description>The comparison condition, Medical Illness Education and Support (MIES) group, will discuss common challenges experienced by those living with a wide range of chronic illnesses and behavioral and lifestyle management techniques that may help veterans to better handle chronic medical conditions. Each of the 12 sessions will follow a basic structure that includes a review of the material presented in the previous session, new education content and discussion.</description>
