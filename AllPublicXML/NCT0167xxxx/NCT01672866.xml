  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether SIM (formerly referred to as
      GS-6624) is effective at preventing the histologic progression of liver fibrosis and the
      clinical progression to cirrhosis in participants with NASH.

      It will consist of 2 phases:

        -  Randomized Double-Blind Phase

        -  Open-Label Phase (optional)

    <description>The EFS was the primary clinical efficacy endpoint and was assessed by the time to progression to cirrhosis. Participants were considered to have become cirrhotic if they had a post-baseline biopsy consistent with cirrhosis or developed overt signs and symptoms of cirrhosis. All overt signs and symptoms went through an adjudication process and were confirmed before they were considered for the EFS analysis.</description>
