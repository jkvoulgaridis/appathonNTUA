      The purpose of this study is to identify biomarkers that can be utilized in the diagnosis of
      chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain is the hallmark of patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), a
      non-bacterial category of prostatitis that is a significant source of morbidity in American
      men. The cause of CPPS is unknown and there is a lack of convenient biomarkers for diagnosis
      of this syndrome. This project will examine the expression of biomarkers in expressed
      prostatic fluid from adult men with and without a diagnosis of CPPS. Thus our specific aim is
      to validate the use of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha and mast cell tryptase as
      biomarkers for CPPS in humans and correlate their levels with CPPS symptoms.

        The Study population will include 176 adult patients diagnosed with CPPS (equal numbers of
        CPPS IIIa and CPPS IIIb) and 88 adult comparator controls, at least 18 years of age,
        recruited from Northwestern urology clinical site practices. All CPPS participants will be
        male and will have pelvic pain symptoms. Men who are at least 18 years of age and who had
        been seen by a physician for symptoms of CP/CPPS within the previous 2 years will comprise
        the patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CP/CPPS group inclusion criteria

        Patients are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria:

          -  Participant has signed and dated the appropriate Informed Consent document.

          -  Agreed to participate in Study procedures.

          -  Participant is at least 18 years of age.

             (SYM-Q, Question #1).

          -  Participant reports pain or discomfort in any of the 8 domains of the Male
             Genitourinary Pain Index (MGUPI) (items 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d).

          -  These CP/CPPS symptoms been present for the majority of the time during any 3 months
             in the previous 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has an on-going symptomatic urethral stricture.

          -  Participant has an on-going neurological disease or disorder affecting the bladder or
             bowel fistula.

        Participant has a history of cystitis caused by tuberculosis, radiation therapy or
        Cytoxan/cyclophosphamide therapy.

             laser procedure.

        Control group exclusion criteria In addition to the exclusion criteria listed above
        additional criteria for control subjects are as follows.

          1. In the past year, symptoms of discomfort or pain in the pelvic region for extended
             periods of time.
