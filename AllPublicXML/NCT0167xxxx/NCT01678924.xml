    <description>The average pain intensity score at each week was the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores reported in the patient's eDiary during each 7-day period, starting with the day of study treatment injection. Patients used the 11-point Likert scale, with anchors at 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 = &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; Baseline was defined as the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores reported during the baseline period for the 7 days immediately prior to the treatment.</description>

        <description>The average pain intensity score at each week was the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores reported in the patient's eDiary during each 7-day period, starting with the day of study treatment injection. Patients used the 11-point Likert scale, with anchors at 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 = &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; Baseline was defined as the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores reported during the baseline period for the 7 days immediately prior to the treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Pain Intensity Score - Cohort 2</title>
        <description>The average pain intensity score at each week was the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores reported in the patient's eDiary during each 7-day period, starting with the day of study treatment injection. patients used the 11-point Likert scale, with anchors at 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 = &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; Baseline was defined as the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores reported during the baseline period for the 7 days immediately prior to the treatment.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>Two cohorts of patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) were randomized to receive 1 treatment of either AGN-214868 (cohort 1: 32.5 or 65 μg; cohort 2: 130 μg) or placebo. Cohort 2 includes 125 patients from the mITT population</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximal Area of Spontaneous Pain - Cohort 2 - Week 2</title>
        <description>The assessment of maximal area of spontaneous pain (MASP) was conducted by a qualified and trained investigator or designee (eg, physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and nurse). This assessment is based on color photographs taken of the patient in which the patient was asked to outline their MASP with a black marker. Areas of pain were quantified at a central reading center.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Area of Allodynia - Cohort 1 - Week 8</title>
        <description>The assessment of maximal area of allodynia was conducted by a qualified and trained investigator or designee (eg, physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and nurse). This assessment is based on color photographs taken of the patient in which the patient was asked to outline their maximal area of skin that feels unpleasant to the touch (allodynic skin) with a red marker. Areas of allodynia were quantified at a central reading center.</description>

        <description>Assessment of evoked pain were conducted by a qualified and trained investigator or designee (eg, physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and nurse). Evoked pain was scored using a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 to100 mm scale with anchors of 0 = No pain and 100 = Worst pain imaginable). The patient was asked to use the VAS to rate the unpleasantness of 3 brush strokes within the center of the area of allodynia and pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Evoked Pain Score in the Area of Allodynia - Cohort 2 - Week 4</title>
        <description>Assessment of evoked pain were conducted by a qualified and trained investigator or designee (eg, physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and nurse). Evoked pain was scored using a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 to100 mm scale with anchors of 0 = No pain and 100 = Worst pain imaginable). The patient was asked to use the VAS to rate the unpleasantness of 3 brush strokes within the center of the area of allodynia and pain.</description>

        <population>The total mITT population of 279 patients, consists of all randomized patients who received treatment and at least 1 post-baseline weekly average pain intensity score assessment. The mITT population for Cohort 2 is 125 patients.</population>
