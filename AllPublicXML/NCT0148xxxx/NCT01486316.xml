  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the feasibility and impact of a diagnostic tool
      that may help clinicians identify when patients are at higher risk of visiting the hospital
      for a heart failure event. The study will use a non-experimental device that is inserted just
      under the skin of the chest, which continuously monitors the heart rhythm in combination with
      an experimental web-based heart failure risk status. Patients with atrial fibrillation and
      heart failure will be evaluated to collect data about the potential of this risk status to
      help improve patient outcome.

    <measure>Correlation of Heart Failure Risk Score (HFRS) With Heart Failure Events</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 months post-implant (HFRS Guided Arm), 0-12 months (Control Arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the HFRS Algorithm prior to Heart Failure (HF) related clinical events among patients with HF and documented or suspected AF. Daily HFRS scores were calculated each day for each patient with an implanted Reveal XT device, and the scores were ordinal, with possible values of &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, and &quot;Very High&quot;. The objective was to assess the association between the daily scores before and after HF events (HF-related hospitalizations, clinic visits) among subjects experiencing such visits. This would only be done during follow-up periods in which physicians were blinded to the scores (see Time Frame). The score could only be generated if the subject performed a CareLink transmission of their device data during follow-up.
Because of the small number of subjects enrolled, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Subjects were partitioned by whether they (1) experienced a HF event, and (2) whether they experienced a High or Very High HFRS score.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of HFRS Status With Actions/Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 18 months post-implant (HFRS Guided Arm), 13-18 months (Control Arm)</time_frame>
    <description>At scheduled visits in which the HFRS scores were available to clinicians, the scores were summarized, along with whether subjects experienced significant weight gain, high blood pressure, or reported heart failure symptoms.
Because of the small number of subjects randomized, no formal statistical analyses were performed.</description>

    <description>Characterize the difference in clinical status measures over time in each arm. Outcomes include Quality of Life (as measured by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, in which scores range from 0 (Best) to 105 (Worst), 6 Minute Hall Walk distance, and New York Heart Association (NYHA, ranging from Class I (Best) to Class IV (Worst))
Because of the small number of patients enrolled, formal statistical analyses were not performed and data were not summarized in aggregate.</description>

    <description>The experimental IDENTIFY-HF Risk Status developed for this study will be used to change standard device data to a heart failure risk status. The risk status and standard device trend data are provided to study doctors for remote management of their patients' heart failure using study specific protocols. The risk status inputs are: night heart rate, heart rate variability, atrial fibrillation burden, ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation, patient activity.
Based on pre-defined thresholds for each of the above inputs, as well as data trends, a heart failure score is derived. The heart failure score is then classified as: &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, or &quot;Very High&quot;.</description>

          <description>Study doctors will have access to the experimental IDENTIFY-HF Risk Status for subjects in the Guided arm between months 6 and 18. At all times during the study, study doctors will also be able to use the standard device diagnostics in the office using the programmer, or by data transmission from the patient's home (or another remote location).
Heart Failure Risk Status Diagnostic: The experimental IDENTIFY-HF Risk Status developed for this study will be used to change standard device data to a heart failure risk status. The risk status inputs are: night heart rate, heart rate variability, atrial fibrillation burden, ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation, patient activity.
Based on pre-defined thresholds for each of the above inputs, as well as data trends, a heart failure score is derived. The heart failure score is then classified as: &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, or &quot;Very High&quot;.</description>

          <title>New York Heart Assocation (NYHA) Functional Classification</title>
          <description>NYHA Class is a measure of a patient's degree of heart failure with 4 possible scores, ranging from I to IV. The classifications and 2015 definitions are as follows:
I: No limitation of physical activity. II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea.
III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest.</description>

        <title>Correlation of Heart Failure Risk Score (HFRS) With Heart Failure Events</title>
        <description>Evaluate the HFRS Algorithm prior to Heart Failure (HF) related clinical events among patients with HF and documented or suspected AF. Daily HFRS scores were calculated each day for each patient with an implanted Reveal XT device, and the scores were ordinal, with possible values of &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, and &quot;Very High&quot;. The objective was to assess the association between the daily scores before and after HF events (HF-related hospitalizations, clinic visits) among subjects experiencing such visits. This would only be done during follow-up periods in which physicians were blinded to the scores (see Time Frame). The score could only be generated if the subject performed a CareLink transmission of their device data during follow-up.
Because of the small number of subjects enrolled, formal statistical analyses were not performed. Subjects were partitioned by whether they (1) experienced a HF event, and (2) whether they experienced a High or Very High HFRS score.</description>
