      The purpose of this study is to (a) determine whether a combined intervention for patients,
      caregivers and physicians improves communication regarding treatment choices and prognosis in
      cancer, (b) to determine whether the intervention improves patient and caregiver well-being,
      quality of life and sense of peace, and (c) to determine whether the intervention affects
      health services utilization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Patient-centered Communication in Advanced Cancer Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We audio recorded the first physician visit after the coaching session (for intervention) or after study entry (control).The primary outcome was a composite of 4 pre-specified communication measures: 1. engaging patients in consultations, responding to patients' emotions, informing patients about prognosis and treatment choices and balanced framing of decisions. Coding of the 4 measures was performed by teams of trained university students who were audited continuously and blinded to study hypotheses and group assignment. We transformed each of the 4 component scores to z scores based on the pre-randomization phase sample means (SDs): z = (Raw Score - Pre-randomization Phase Mean)/Pre-randomization Phase SD. The 4-component z-scores were averaged to form the primary outcome. A higher Z score indicates better communication. The maximum possible Z-score ranged from -0.69 to 20.08.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Mean Prolonged Grief Symptoms as Measured by PG-13</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The prolonged grief (PG-13) instrument was used to measure prolonged grief. The tool is a sum of ten items that measure separation distress, duration of grief, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms and impairment criterion. The range of the score is 10-50 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 1b&amp;c Mean Difference in Reported Expectation of Survival in 2 Years Between Patients and Physicians</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients and physicians were asked what the likelihood of survival in 2 years would be for the patient. They chose from 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 100% chance of survival in two years. A value of 0-6 was assigned to each pair of data. 0 indicating no difference in the reported value between patient and physician and 6 indicating the largest difference. For example if the physician said 100% and the patient said 0% the score was 6. The mean scores were reported by arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 2 Patient Well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Original McGill quality of life and the FACT-G assessment tools were used. For the McGill tool scores range from 1 to 10 with higher scores indicating better outcome. For FACT-G scores range from 0 to 4. Higher score means a better outcome. Different parts of the McGill and FACT-G tools were used to create 5 standardized z scores: McGill QOL Scale single item, McGill Psychological Well-Being sub-scale, McGill Existential Well-Being sub-scale, FACT-G Physical Functioning sub-scale and FACT-G Social Functioning sub-scale. Sum of the five standardized z-scores is the Aggregate QOL score. A higher Z score indicates better outcomes. The maximum possible Z-score ranged from -3.54 to 1.24.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Mean Overall Mental Health as Measured by the SF-12 Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 scores are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care Utilization- Mean Index Score of Aggressive Care at the End of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient charts were audited for 3 outcomes : 1) chemotherapy use, 2) aggressive treatments and 3) emergency department or hospital utilization. The total scores ranged from 0-6 with higher scores indicated worse outcomes. The sums of the means for the 3 outcomes were added to provide the total score.</description>

        <title>Mean Patient-centered Communication in Advanced Cancer Score</title>
        <description>We audio recorded the first physician visit after the coaching session (for intervention) or after study entry (control).The primary outcome was a composite of 4 pre-specified communication measures: 1. engaging patients in consultations, responding to patients' emotions, informing patients about prognosis and treatment choices and balanced framing of decisions. Coding of the 4 measures was performed by teams of trained university students who were audited continuously and blinded to study hypotheses and group assignment. We transformed each of the 4 component scores to z scores based on the pre-randomization phase sample means (SDs): z = (Raw Score - Pre-randomization Phase Mean)/Pre-randomization Phase SD. The 4-component z-scores were averaged to form the primary outcome. A higher Z score indicates better communication. The maximum possible Z-score ranged from -0.69 to 20.08.</description>

They chose from 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 100% chance of survival in two years. A value of 0-6 was assigned to each pair of data. 0 indicating no difference in the reported value between patient and physician and 6 indicating the largest difference. For example if the physician said 100% and the patient said 0% the score was 6. The mean scores were reported by arm.</description>

Sum of the five standardized z-scores is the Aggregate QOL score. A higher Z score indicates better outcomes. The maximum possible Z-score ranged from -3.54 to 1.24.</description>
