    <description>Reported results are change from visit 1 (Month 0) upto end of Extension phase 2 (Month 80) of the study. Time intervals are assigned based on time after first dose. It is possible that a patient answers more than one questionnaire in a single time interval. Overall units analysed = Max no. of questionnaires answered by participants for this endpoint. Overall no. of participants analysed = max no. of participants analysed at each time point. This utility index has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort &amp; anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels where 1 indicates better health state (no problems) and 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed).

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Prophylaxis</title>
          <description>Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg of body weight (BW) of turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP), administered intravenously (IV) every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (investigator's discretion). The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm. This arm is applicable only for the main phase.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>On-demand</title>
          <description>Participants received treatment with N8-GP in case of a bleeding episode. All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20-75 U/kg BW according to the severity and location of the bleeding episode. The dosage (N8-GP units) was calculated by multiplying the participant’s weight in kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5. This arm is applicable only for the main phase.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P3">
          <title>N8-GP 50 U/kg Prophylaxis Q4D</title>
          <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were included in this arm. Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm. This arm was applicable for the extension phase part-1 and part 2.</description>

        <group group_id="P4">
          <title>N8-GP 75 U/kg Prophylaxis Q7D</title>
          <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 3+ bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were randomised to receive one single bolus dose of 75 U/kg BW of N8-GP. Participants received one single bolus dose of 75 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 7th day (Q7D). Based on the bleeding pattern, the investigator could change the dosing frequency from Q7D to Q4D, but not vice versa. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

Evaluation during trial was done by participant and/or parent(s)/caregiver within approximately 8 hours after a single injection as follows: Excellent: Abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hrs after a single injection; Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hrs after a single injection, but possibly requiring more than one injection for complete resolution; Moderate: Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 8 hours after the first injection, but usually requiring more than one injection; None: No improvement, or worsening of symptoms.</description>
        <time_frame>After approximately 19 months</time_frame>
        <population>Results were based on the FAS which included all participants exposed to N8-GP in this trial. Number analysed = Number of bleeds analysed.</population>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in HAEMO-QOL Total Scores (Parents of Patients 13-16 Years Old): After Approx 80 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are change from visit 1 (Month 0) upto end of Extension phase 2 (Month 80) of the study. The questionnaire was completed by parents of the patients in the 13-16 years old age bracket. Time intervals are assigned based on time after first dose. It was possible that a participant could answer more than one questionnaire in a single time interval. The HAEMO-QOL assessment included questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, family, friends, perceived support, other persons, sports and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, and relationships. Scores range for each question was 0-100, with a lower score indicating better quality of life related to haemophilia. Overall number of units analysed = Maximum no of questionnaires answered by participants for this endpoint. Overall number of participants analysed = maximum number of participants contributed to the analysis for each time point.</description>

The HAEM-A-QOL (for adults (&gt;=17 years)) assessment included questions on questions on physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with haemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, and partnership and sexuality. Scores range for each question was 0-100, with a lower score indicating better quality of life related to haemophilia.</description>

            <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were included in this arm. Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in HEMO-SAT (Patients) Scores: After Approx 19 and 25 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are change from baseline (Month 0) measured at end of main phase (Month 19) and change from Month 19 to end of Extension 1 (Month 25) of the study. The HEMO-SAT (Hematology-satisfaction) assessment included questions on treatment aspects including Ease and convenience, efficacy, burden, specialist/nurses, centre/hospital, general satisfaction (reported by patients). Adults completing the questionnaire could achieve a score from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. The scale range for each of the 6 domains was 0-100 with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. A decrease in the score would mean improvement.</description>

            <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were included in this arm. Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

            <description>Participants in this arm received treatment with N8-GP in case of a bleeding episode. All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20-75 U/kg BW according to the severity and location of the bleeding episode. The dosage (N8-GP units) was calculated by multiplying the participant’s weight in kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in HEMO-SAT (Patients) Scores: After Approximately 80 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are change from visit 1 (Month 0) upto end of Extension phase 2 (Month 80) of the study. Time intervals are assigned based on time after first dose. It was possible that a participant could answer more than one questionnaire in a single time interval. Overall number of units analysed = Maximum no of questionnaires answered by participants for this endpoint. Overall number of participants analysed = maximum number of participants contributed to the analysis for each time point. The HEMO-SAT assessment included questions on treatment aspects including Ease and convenience, efficacy, burden, specialist/nurses, centre/hospital, general satisfaction (reported by patients). Adults completing the questionnaire could achieve a score from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. The scale range for each of the 6 domains was 0-100 with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. A decrease in the score would mean improvement.</description>

All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20-75 U/kg BW according to the severity and location of the bleeding episode. The dosage (N8-GP units) was calculated by multiplying the participant’s weight in kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in HEMO-SAT Scores (Parents): After Approx 19 and 25 Months</title>
        <description>The summary of change was based on individual changes observed at visit 13 (approximately 19 months) from visit 2a pre-dose (Month 0). The HEMO-SAT assessment included questions on treatment aspects including Ease and convenience, efficacy, burden, specialist/nurses, centre/hospital, general satisfaction (reported by parents). Adults completing the questionnaire could achieve a score from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. The scale range for each of the 6 domains was 0-100 with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. A decrease in the score would mean improvement.</description>

            <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were included in this arm. Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in HEMO-SAT (Parents) Scores: After Approximately 80 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are from Visit 1 (Month 0), and change from visit 1 upto end of Extension phase 2 (Month 80) of the study. Time intervals are assigned based on time after first dose. It was possible that a participant could answer more than one questionnaire in a single time interval. Overall number of units analysed = Max. no of questionnaires answered by participants for this endpoint. Overall number of participants analysed = max. number of participants contributed to the analysis for each time point. The HEMO-SAT assessment included questions on treatment aspects including Ease and convenience, efficacy, burden, specialist/nurses, centre/hospital, general satisfaction. Adults completing the questionnaire could achieve a score from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. The scale range for each of the 6 domains was 0-100 with lower scores reflecting greater treatment satisfaction. A decrease in the score would mean improvement.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in EQ-5D-VAS Scores: After Approx 19 and 25 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are change from baseline (Month 0) measured at end of main phase (Month 19) and change from Month 19 to end of Extension 1 (Month 25) of the study. The European quality of life visual analogue scale (EQ5D-VAS) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement. EQ-5D-VAS: range 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better self reported health status. A positive change indicates an improvement.</description>

            <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were included in this arm. Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

            <description>Participants in this arm received treatment with N8-GP in case of a bleeding episode. All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20-75 U/kg BW according to the severity and location of the bleeding episode. The dosage (N8-GP units) was calculated by multiplying the participant’s weight in kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in EQ-5D-VAS Scores: After Approximately 80 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are change from visit 1 (Month 0) upto end of Extension phase 2 (Month 80) of the study. Time intervals are assigned based on time after first dose. It was possible that a participant could answer more than one questionnaire in a single time interval. Overall number of units analysed = Maximum no of questionnaires answered by participants for this endpoint. Overall number of participants analysed = maximum number of participants contributed to the analysis for each time point. The EQ5D-VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement. EQ-5D-VAS: range 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better self reported health status. A positive change indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Reported results are change from baseline (Month 0) measured at end of main phase (Month 19) and change from Month 19 to end of Extension 1 (Month 25) of the study. The European quality of life utility index comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels where 1 indicates better health state (no problems) and 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; a positive change indicates an improvement.</description>

The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm.

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes - Change in European Quality of Life Utility Index Scores: After Approximately 80 Months</title>
        <description>Reported results are change from visit 1 (Month 0) upto end of Extension phase 2 (Month 80) of the study. Time intervals are assigned based on time after first dose. It is possible that a patient answers more than one questionnaire in a single time interval. Overall units analysed = Max no. of questionnaires answered by participants for this endpoint. Overall no. of participants analysed = max no. of participants analysed at each time point. This utility index has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort &amp; anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels where 1 indicates better health state (no problems) and 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; a positive change indicates an improvement.</description>

All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20-75 U/kg BW according to the severity and location of the bleeding episode. The dosage (N8-GP units) was calculated by multiplying the participant’s weight in kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5.</description>

Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

          <description>Participants who were on prophylaxis treatment with N8-GP in the main phase and had 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months before entering the extension phase, were included in this arm. Participants received one single bolus dose of 50 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 4th day (96 hours) or twice weekly (at investigator's discretion). The dose was adjusted to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in this arm. The dose was based on phase 1 data from the NN7088-3776 trial in order to ensure a trough level of &gt;1% FVIII:C activity in the majority of participants in the prophylaxis arm.</description>

Participants received one single bolus dose of 75 U/kg BW of N8-GP administered IV every 7th day (Q7D). Based on the bleeding pattern, the investigator could change the dosing frequency from Q7D to Q4D, but not vice versa.

All bleeds were to be treated with doses between 20-75 U/kg BW according to the severity and location of the bleeding episode. The dosage (N8-GP units) was calculated by multiplying the participant’s weight in kilograms by the desired factor level multiplied by 0.5.</description>
