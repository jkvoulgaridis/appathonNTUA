      This study will compare Xeomin®, a botulinum toxin medication, in shorter treatment intervals
      (Short Flex dosing) to the standard interval dosing (Long Flex dosing) to determine if the
      response to treatment is comparable in both how it works and any side effects. Xeomin® is
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      cervical dystonia (CD). The use of Xeomin® is investigational in regards to shorter treatment
      intervals. An investigational use is one that is not approved by the FDA.

    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a movement disorder which is characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle
      contractions which frequently causes twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures
      of the trunk, neck, face, or arms and legs. In focal dystonia, the abnormal movements involve
      a single area of the body. A commonly described form of focal dystonia is cervical dystonia
      (CD). Botulinum toxin treatment can be offered as a treatment option for the treatment of CD.

      The current practice for botulinum toxin injection treatment is to inject patients every 3
      months. However, not all patients receive continuing benefit from botulinum toxin injections
      for an entire 3 months. In a recent survey, approximately 45% of patients report that they
      would prefer a treatment cycle of less than 10 weeks.This study will compare Xeomin®, a
      botulinum toxin treatment, in shorter treatment intervals (Short Flex dosing) to the standard
      interval dosing (Long Flex dosing) to determine if the response to treatment is comparable in
      both how it works and any side effects. Xeomin® is approved by the United States Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CD. The use of Xeomin® is investigational in
      regards to shorter treatment intervals. An investigational use is one that is not approved by
      the FDA.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Short Flex dosing of
      Xeomin® compared to the Long Flex dosing regimen of Xeomin®, using a standard scale completed
      by the doctors and subjects as well as questionnaires that ask subjects to rate symptoms of
      CD.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Severity Subscale Score Based on Blinded Rater Assessment at Week 4 After the 8th Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 after the 8th injection (Week 44 to 68 for Short Flex and Week 84 to 104 for Long Flex)</time_frame>
    <description>The validated assessment scale TWSTRS was used to measure the impact of cervical dystonia (CD) on participants. A blinded rater performed all TWSTRS-Severity subscale assessments for a given participant. TWSTRS-Severity subscale score ranges from 0 (=absence of severity) to 35 points (=maximum severity).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 after the 8th injection (Week 44 to 68 for Short Flex and Week 84 to 104 for Long Flex)</time_frame>
    <description>The validated assessment scale TWSTRS was used to measure the impact of CD on participants. The scale comprised of 3 subscales: Severity, Disability, and Pain, each of which was scored independently. A blinded rater performed all TWSTRS assessments for a given participant. TWSTRS-Severity subscale score ranges from 0 (=absence of severity) to 35 points (=maximum severity); TWSTRS-Disability subscale score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 30 (maximum disability); and TWSTRS-Pain subscale score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 20 (maximum pain). The total of these 3 comprises the TWSTRS total score which is scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 85 (worst symptoms). Higher scores indicate a greater impact of CD on participant.</description>

    <description>Assessment of Clinical Global Impression Severity was scored using a 7-point scale for severity of illness, in response to the question, &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how ill is the participant at this time?&quot; With scores as: 0 (not assessed); 1 (normal, not ill at all); 2 (borderline ill); 3 (mildly ill); 4 (moderately ill); 5 (markedly ill); 6 (severely ill); and 7 (among the most extremely ill participants).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile-58 (CDIP-58) Total Score at Week 4 After the 8th Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 after the 8th injection (Week 44 to 68 for Short Flex and Week 84 to 104 for Long Flex)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDIP-58 assesses the health impact of CD. The CDIP-58 is composed of eight domains: head and neck (6 items; 6 to 30 points), pain and discomfort (5 items; 5 to 25 points), upper limb activities (9 items; 9 to 45 points), walking (9 items; 9 to 45 points), sleep (4 items; 4 to 20 points), annoyance (8 items; 8 to 40 points), mood (7 items; 7 to 35 points), and psychosocial functioning (10 items; 10 to 50 points). Subscale scores were transformed to a common theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 100 (most impact). Transformation to a 0 to 100 scale for the sum scores of the sub- and total scales were done using the following formula (all single items have scores from 1 to 5): S0 to 100 =25 * ([ SO / NI] - 1), S0 to 100 = transformed sum score. SO = sum score of the original sub- / total scale. NI = number of items in the sub- / total scale. Negative changes from the baseline total score indicate improvement in the impact of CD on health whereas positive changes indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>The Offset Questionnaire was a single question: &quot;On most days last week, have you noticed that your CD symptoms are better, worse or the same as the week prior? Time to offset of effect was calculated from date of first onset of effect to date of offset of effects.</description>

        <description>The validated assessment scale TWSTRS was used to measure the impact of CD on participants. The scale comprised of 3 subscales: Severity, Disability, and Pain, each of which was scored independently. A blinded rater performed all TWSTRS assessments for a given participant. TWSTRS-Severity subscale score ranges from 0 (=absence of severity) to 35 points (=maximum severity); TWSTRS-Disability subscale score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 30 (maximum disability); and TWSTRS-Pain subscale score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 20 (maximum pain). The total of these 3 comprises the TWSTRS total score which is scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 85 (worst symptoms). Higher scores indicate a greater impact of CD on participant.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile-58 (CDIP-58) Total Score at Week 4 After the 8th Injection</title>
        <description>The CDIP-58 assesses the health impact of CD. The CDIP-58 is composed of eight domains: head and neck (6 items; 6 to 30 points), pain and discomfort (5 items; 5 to 25 points), upper limb activities (9 items; 9 to 45 points), walking (9 items; 9 to 45 points), sleep (4 items; 4 to 20 points), annoyance (8 items; 8 to 40 points), mood (7 items; 7 to 35 points), and psychosocial functioning (10 items; 10 to 50 points). Subscale scores were transformed to a common theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 100 (most impact). Transformation to a 0 to 100 scale for the sum scores of the sub- and total scales were done using the following formula (all single items have scores from 1 to 5): S0 to 100 =25 * ([ SO / NI] - 1), S0 to 100 = transformed sum score. SO = sum score of the original sub- / total scale. NI = number of items in the sub- / total scale. Negative changes from the baseline total score indicate improvement in the impact of CD on health whereas positive changes indicate worsening.</description>
