      The objectives of this study are to obtain survival and outcome data on the Trabecular Metal
      Humeral Stem when used in primary, total or hemi shoulder arthroplasty. This will be done by
      analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records. Data will be
      collected and analyzed to monitor pain, function, and survivorship and to confirm the
      performance of the Trabecular Metal Humeral Stem.

      Performance will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events as
      well as by assessment of the overall pain and functional performances, survivorship, health
      status and radiographic parameters of all enrolled study subjects who receive the Trabecular
      Metal Humeral Stem.

      Pain and functional performance will be measured using the American Shoulder and Elbow
      Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Assessment and the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE),
      survivorship will be based on removal or intended removal of the device, health status will
      be determined by evaluation of the SF-12 as well as AEs and radiographic parameters by
      analysis of x-rays.
