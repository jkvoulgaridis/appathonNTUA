None: Bleeding due to inadequate therapeutic response with adequate dosing, change of regimen required.</description>

          -  Previous arterial thrombotic events (e.g. myocardial infarction and intracranial
             thrombosis) or previous deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (as defined by

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 26 sites in 13 countries, as follows: Australia (1 site), Denmark (1 site), France (3 sites), Hungary (1 site), Israel (1 site), Italy (2 sites), Japan (2 sites), Malaysia (1 site), Netherlands (1 site), Switzerland (2 sites), Turkey (3 sites), United Kingdom (4 sites) and United States (4 sites).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>36 participants were screened and exposed to the trial product. A total of 53 surgeries were planned in these 36 participants and 49 surgeries were completed. The results are analysed and presented based on the number of surgeries instead of number of participants. Participants in this trial were also enrolled in the NN7088-3859 trial.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>NNC 0129-0000-1003 (Turoctocog Alfa Pegol)</title>
          <description>Subjects (from trial NN7088-3859) undergoing major surgery received bleeding preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) before, during and after surgery. The trial product was administered as a slow bolus intravenous injection. Dosing was done at the investigators’ discretion (except a fixed dose of 50 IU/kg at screening visit). The dose level of N8-GP during this trial was chosen following the coagulation factor 8 (FVIII) activity levels recommended by World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines. The WFH guidelines for desired FVIII levels in major surgery are as follows: pre-surgery (day 0): 80−100%; post-surgery days 1−3: 60−80%; days 4−6: 40−60%; days 7−14: 30−50%. All subjects were treated with doses between 20−75 IU/kg for treatment of a bleeding episode. The maximum dose to be administered to a subject within 24 hours was 200 IU/kg. The total duration of the trial was 2-5 weeks. Upon completion of this trial, subjects returned to trial NN7088-3859.</description>

        <title>Haemostatic Effect During Surgery Evaluated by the Four-point Scale, Assessed by the Investigator/Surgeon at the Day of Surgery - Four-point Response Scale: Excellent, Good, Moderate or None</title>
        <description>Haemostatic effect during surgery was evaluated on a four-point response scale as 'none', 'moderate', 'good' and 'excellent'. This was assessed after completion of surgery (defined as &quot;last stitch&quot;).
Excellent: Better than expected/predicted in this type of procedure. Good: As expected in this type of procedure. Moderate: Less than optimal for the type of procedure but haemostatic response maintained without change of treatment regimen.
None: Bleeding due to inadequate therapeutic response with adequate dosing, change of regimen required.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed by the Investigator/surgeon at the day of surgery</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set included all subjects exposed to the trial drug (N8-GP). 'Number Analyzed' = number of surgeries evaluated. 49 surgeries were evaluated in 35 participants.</population>

            <description>Subjects (from trial NN7088-3859) undergoing major surgery received bleeding preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) before, during and after surgery. The trial product was administered as a slow bolus intravenous injection. Dosing was done at the investigators’ discretion (except a fixed dose of 50 IU/kg at screening visit). The dose level of N8-GP during this trial was chosen following the coagulation factor 8 (FVIII) activity levels recommended by World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines. The WFH guidelines for desired FVIII levels in major surgery are as follows: pre-surgery (day 0): 80−100%; post-surgery days 1−3: 60−80%; days 4−6: 40−60%; days 7−14: 30−50%. All subjects were treated with doses between 20−75 IU/kg for treatment of a bleeding episode. The maximum dose to be administered to a subject within 24 hours was 200 IU/kg. The total duration of the trial was 2-5 weeks. Upon completion of this trial, subjects returned to trial NN7088-3859.</description>

        <title>Haemostatic Effect of N8-GP During the Post-operative Period Days 7-14</title>
        <description>Haemostatic effect during post-operative period days 1-6 and days 7-14 was evaluated on a four-point response scale as 'none', 'moderate', 'good' and 'excellent'.
Excellent: Better than expected/predicted in this type of procedure. Good: As expected in this type of procedure. Moderate: Less than optimal for the type of procedure but haemostatic response maintained without change of treatment regimen.
None: Bleeding due to inadequate therapeutic response with adequate dosing, change of regimen required.</description>
        <time_frame>During the post-operative period, days 7-14</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set included all subjects exposed to the trial drug (N8-GP). 'Number Analyzed' = number of surgeries evaluated. 2 surgeries with 2 bleeding episodes were evaluated in 35 participants.</population>

            <description>Subjects (from trial NN7088-3859) undergoing major surgery received bleeding preventive treatment with turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) before, during and after surgery. The trial product was administered as a slow bolus intravenous injection. Dosing was done at the investigators’ discretion (except a fixed dose of 50 IU/kg at screening visit). The dose level of N8-GP during this trial was chosen following the coagulation factor 8 (FVIII) activity levels recommended by World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines. The WFH guidelines for desired FVIII levels in major surgery are as follows: pre-surgery (day 0): 80−100%; post-surgery days 1−3: 60−80%; days 4−6: 40−60%; days 7−14: 30−50%. All subjects were treated with doses between 20−75 IU/kg for treatment of a bleeding episode. The maximum dose to be administered to a subject within 24 hours was 200 IU/kg. The total duration of the trial was 2-5 weeks. Upon completion of this trial, subjects returned to trial NN7088-3859.</description>

The dose level of N8-GP during this trial was chosen following the coagulation factor 8 (FVIII) activity levels recommended by World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines. The WFH guidelines for desired FVIII levels in major surgery are as follows: pre-surgery (day 0): 80−100%; post-surgery days 1−3: 60−80%; days 4−6: 40−60%; days 7−14: 30−50%. All subjects were treated with doses between 20−75 IU/kg for treatment of a bleeding episode. The maximum dose to be administered to a subject within 24 hours was 200 IU/kg. The total duration of the trial was 2-5 weeks. Upon completion of this trial, subjects returned to trial NN7088-3859.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events were reported for the safety analysis set (SAS) which includes all subjects exposed to trial drug (N8-GP).
As one of the objectives of the trial was to evaluate safety of N8-GP when used for prevention and treatment of bleeding throughout the surgical period, the adverse events are analysed based on the number (units) of surgeries rather than number of participants. Therefore 'the number at risk' in this adverse events section refers to the number of planned surgeries.</desc>
