  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of intensive
      anti-smoking counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy versus intensive anti-smoking
      counseling alone among HIV-infected patients in South Africa, and to concurrently measure the
      prevalence of smoking among HIV-infected patients in South Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is estimated to be responsible for over 5 million deaths globally every year and
      HIV/AIDS kills 2 million worldwide, with persons living in the developing world especially at
      risk. However, the association between tobacco use and HIV is not clearly understood. The
      introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to longer duration of
      survival following HIV-infection in the developed world, and now that HAART is being rolled
      out in the developing world, survival will increase in these highly endemic regions as well.
      Given this increase in survival, more people will die of non-HIV related illnesses for which
      smoking plays an important causal role. Smoking cessation for HIV-infected persons has been
      studied in the US though these studies have had small numbers and limited follow-up. US based
      studies suggest that approaches that combine nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and
      counseling interventions are most successful. Optimal approaches in resource-limited settings
      have not been determined.

      This study will compare intensive counseling plus NRT versus intensive counseling only,
      comparing smoking cessation at 2, 6 and 12 months. At 6 months, patients who are still
      current smokers will be given a second opportunity to receive their group assigned
      intervention, either intensive counseling plus NRT or intensive counseling alone. We will
      relate smoking exposure and cessation to HIV progression as measured by immunologic and viral
      markers, risk of respiratory infections, including tuberculosis, and AIDS-related
      malignancies. The RCT will be performed at the Tshepong HIV Wellness Clinic in Klerksdorp,
      South Africa, associated with the Reproductive Health &amp; HIV Research Unit of the University
      of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.

        <description>A point of care test for measuring carbon monoxide (CO) will be conducted via the piCO Smokerlyzer from OPS Medical, designed specifically for smoking cessation programs and tobacco control programs. Carbon monoxide will be measured in an exhaled breath in parts-per-million (ppm). A reading of ≤ 7ppm will indicate abstinence.</description>
        <time_frame>6 months from baseline</time_frame>

Intensive Counseling: The advice to quit smoking message will follow NCI’s 5A’s model for smoking cessation counseling. This is a simple smoking cessation counseling strategy with 5 discrete components: (1) Ask about smoking at every opportunity; (2) Advise the patient to quit smoking; (3) Assess readiness to quit; (4) Assist the patient in quitting; and (5) Arrange follow-up.
Participants abstinent at 6-month follow-up will be next seen at 12-month follow-up.
