  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of siltuximab compared with
      placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect in a clinical trial) in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma
      (SMM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance), double-blind (neither patient nor
      investigator know which treatment is given), multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of siltuximab compared with placebo in patients with high-risk SMM (defined as bone
      marrow plasma cells &gt;=10% and either serum monoclonal protein &gt;=3 g/dL, or abnormal free
      light chain ratio &lt;0.126 or &gt;8 and serum M-protein &lt;3 g/dL but &gt;=1 g/dL). Approximately 74
      patients will receive either siltuximab or placebo by intravenous (IV, injection into a vein)
      infusion every 4 weeks until progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study (approximately 4 years after
      randomization of the last patient). Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and potential
      biomarkers will be assessed at time points defined in the protocol. Patient reported outcomes
      (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life
      Questionnaire-Core 30, Brief Pain Inventory [worst pain], Non-Chemotherapy Anemia Symptom
      Scale) will be administered before any procedure or treatment at each visit. Patient safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4.7 Years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between randomization and initial documented PD according to the CRAB - International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria or date of death, whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Time to Worsening in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4.7 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to worsening in EORTC-QLQ-C30 (physical function scale) is defined as time between randomization and first documentation of a worsening in EORTC-QLQ-C-30. Worsening in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 is defined as 10 points decrease from baseline. It comprises module with 30 items. Questionnaire includes 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), a global health and quality of life scale, and a number of single items assessing symptoms (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhoea). Instrument contains 28 items using a Likert scale with 4 response options: &quot;Not at All,&quot; &quot;A Little,&quot; &quot;Quite a Bit,&quot; &quot;Very Much&quot; (scored 1-4). Two additional items use response options (1-7): 1=Very Poor, to 7=Excellent. All scale and item scores were linearly transformed to be in range from 0-100. A higher score represents a higher (better) level of functioning, or a higher (worse) level of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Worsening in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Worst Item Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4.7 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to worsening in the BPI worst item is defined as the time between randomization and the first documentation of a worsening in the BPI worst item. It has 2 domains reflecting pain severity and pain interference with domains of functioning and well-being. The selected item refers to the &quot;worst&quot; pain the patient has experienced over the past 24 hours. This item has been found to be most responsive to interference with key domains of functioning and well-being and may be used as a single item. Responses are provided on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Responses are described as mild (1 to 4), moderate (5 to 6) and severe (7 to 10). Worsening in the BPI worst item is defined as 2 points increase from baseline.</description>

        <description>Time to worsening in EORTC-QLQ-C30 (physical function scale) is defined as time between randomization and first documentation of a worsening in EORTC-QLQ-C-30. Worsening in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 is defined as 10 points decrease from baseline. It comprises module with 30 items. Questionnaire includes 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), a global health and quality of life scale, and a number of single items assessing symptoms (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhoea). Instrument contains 28 items using a Likert scale with 4 response options: &quot;Not at All,&quot; &quot;A Little,&quot; &quot;Quite a Bit,&quot; &quot;Very Much&quot; (scored 1-4). Two additional items use response options (1-7): 1=Very Poor, to 7=Excellent. All scale and item scores were linearly transformed to be in range from 0-100. A higher score represents a higher (better) level of functioning, or a higher (worse) level of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Time to Worsening in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Worst Item Scores</title>
        <description>Time to worsening in the BPI worst item is defined as the time between randomization and the first documentation of a worsening in the BPI worst item. It has 2 domains reflecting pain severity and pain interference with domains of functioning and well-being. The selected item refers to the &quot;worst&quot; pain the patient has experienced over the past 24 hours. This item has been found to be most responsive to interference with key domains of functioning and well-being and may be used as a single item. Responses are provided on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Responses are described as mild (1 to 4), moderate (5 to 6) and severe (7 to 10). Worsening in the BPI worst item is defined as 2 points increase from baseline.</description>
