  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether participants who receive V419 (PR5I) at 2, 4, and 11 to 12
      months of age have an acceptable response to the vaccine. This study will also determine
      whether the immune response to V419 is similar to that of participants who received a
      licensed vaccine control. The primary hypothesis is that participants who receive PR5I at 2,
      4, and 11 to 12 months have an acceptable response rate to all PR5I-contained antigens at one
      month after the Toddler dose of PR5I.

    <measure>Acceptability of Antibody (Ab) Response or Seroresponse Rates to All Antigens Contained in PR5I Vaccine One Month After the Toddler Dose of PR5I (11 to 12 Months of Age)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after Toddler dose of PR51 (post-toddler dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability response rates were defined as Ab titre ≥1.0 μg/mL for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (polyribosylribitol phosphate, PRP); ≥10 mIU/mL for Hepatitis (HBsAg); ≥0.1 IU/mL for diphtheria and tetanus; ≥8 (1/dil) for inactive poliovirus type (IPV) 1, 2 &amp; 3, and percentage of pertussis seroresponder participants (Pertussis toxoid [PT], Filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA], Fimbriae types 2 &amp; 3 [FIM] and Pertactin [PRN]) 1 month Post-Toddler dose of PR5I. Seroresponse was defined: (1) If pre-Dose 1 Ab concentration (cc) was &lt;LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation), postvaccination Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, (2) If pre-Dose 1 Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, postvaccination Ab cc was ≥prevaccination levels. Due to the timing of the occurrence of protocol violation or the availability of each antigen serology testing result, the analysis populations may not have been identical for each antigen-specific analysis at each post-vaccination visit.</description>

    <measure>Non-inferiority Ab Response Rates to PR5I Antigens One Month After the Toddler Dose of PR5I (11 to 12 Months of Age) as Compared With INFANRIX Hexa</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after Toddler dose (post-toddler dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with pre-specified Ab titre for PRP, HBsAg, diphtheria, tetanus, IPV1, 2 &amp; 3, and percentage of pertussis seroresponder participants (PT, FHA, FIM and PRN) 1 month post-toddler dose were calculated based on the method by Miettinen and Nurminen stratified by country. Seroresponse was defined: (1) If pre-Dose 1 Ab cc was &lt;LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, (2) If pre-Dose 1 Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab cc was ≥pre-vaccination levels. Due to the timing of the occurrence of protocol violation or the availability of each antigen serology testing result, the analysis populations may not have been identical for each antigen-specific analysis at each post-vaccination visit.</description>

    <measure>Non-inferiority of Rotavirus Response (Geometric Mean Titer, GMT) One Month After the 2nd Dose of Rotarix (4 Months of Age) Administered Concomitantly With PR5I Versus INFANRIX Hexa</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after the 2nd dose of Rotarix, administered concomitantly with PR5I or INFANRIX hexa (Post-Dose 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody titres expressed in units/mL were measured for Rotavirus IgA by Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA), 1 month after the 2nd dose of Rotarix, administered concomitantly with PR5I or INFANRIX hexa (Post-Dose 2). The 95% CI for GMT was based on the t-distribution of the natural log-transformed antibody titer.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE) From Day 1 to Day 15 After Any Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Solicited AEs: up to 5 days (Days 1-5 after any vaccination); unsolicited AEs: up to 15 days (Day 1-15 after any vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Injection-site and systemic AEs were reported daily on the Vaccination Report Card (VRC) by the parent(s) or legal representative from Day 1 (D1) to D15 after each vaccination. Solicited injection site and systemic AEs were reported daily from D1 to D5 after each vaccination. AEs at injection sites were always considered as vaccine-related (V-related) (Injection-Site Reactions [ISRs]). The investigator had to assess whether systemic AEs were related or not to the vaccine. All AEs (related and unrelated) are displayed here.</description>

        <title>Acceptability of Antibody (Ab) Response or Seroresponse Rates to All Antigens Contained in PR5I Vaccine One Month After the Toddler Dose of PR5I (11 to 12 Months of Age)</title>
        <description>Acceptability response rates were defined as Ab titre ≥1.0 μg/mL for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (polyribosylribitol phosphate, PRP); ≥10 mIU/mL for Hepatitis (HBsAg); ≥0.1 IU/mL for diphtheria and tetanus; ≥8 (1/dil) for inactive poliovirus type (IPV) 1, 2 &amp; 3, and percentage of pertussis seroresponder participants (Pertussis toxoid [PT], Filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA], Fimbriae types 2 &amp; 3 [FIM] and Pertactin [PRN]) 1 month Post-Toddler dose of PR5I. Seroresponse was defined: (1) If pre-Dose 1 Ab concentration (cc) was &lt;LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation), postvaccination Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, (2) If pre-Dose 1 Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, postvaccination Ab cc was ≥prevaccination levels. Due to the timing of the occurrence of protocol violation or the availability of each antigen serology testing result, the analysis populations may not have been identical for each antigen-specific analysis at each post-vaccination visit.</description>

        <title>Non-inferiority Ab Response Rates to PR5I Antigens One Month After the Toddler Dose of PR5I (11 to 12 Months of Age) as Compared With INFANRIX Hexa</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with pre-specified Ab titre for PRP, HBsAg, diphtheria, tetanus, IPV1, 2 &amp; 3, and percentage of pertussis seroresponder participants (PT, FHA, FIM and PRN) 1 month post-toddler dose were calculated based on the method by Miettinen and Nurminen stratified by country. Seroresponse was defined: (1) If pre-Dose 1 Ab cc was &lt;LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, (2) If pre-Dose 1 Ab cc was ≥LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab cc was ≥pre-vaccination levels. Due to the timing of the occurrence of protocol violation or the availability of each antigen serology testing result, the analysis populations may not have been identical for each antigen-specific analysis at each post-vaccination visit.</description>
