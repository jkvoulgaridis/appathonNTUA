      This study was designed to examine the effects of speech therapy on ability to produce speech
      sounds in persons with acquired apraxia of speech.

    <textblock>
      This study was designed to investigate the effects of Sound Production Treatment (SPT; a
      treatment for acquired apraxia of speech) on sound production accuracy in persons with
      chronic apraxia of speech (AOS). Organization of practice (blocked practice or randomized
      practice) will be manipulated in an effort to determine the most efficacious application of
      SPT. A combination of group and single-subject experimental designs wasl be completed with 20
      speakers with AOS (2 groups of 10 participants).

    <measure>Speech Production: Effect Size for Treated Items</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre treatment (2-3 week period preceding the start of treatment) vs. 10 weeks post all treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of trained items as measured from baseline to 10 weeks post treatment using effect size calculations as the indicator of magnitude of change; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 10 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (maximum = 100%, minimum = 0% correct). Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment. Positive effect sizes = increases in accuracy &amp; negative effect sizes = decreases in accuracy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech Production: Percent Change in Treated Items</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 10 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of treated items as measured by percent increase in accuracy above the highest baseline measurement; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 10 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). The highest percentage accuracy achieved in pre-treatment probes was subtracted from the percentage accuracy achieved at 10 weeks post-treatment to obtain change in accuracy value - this reflects change from maximum correct performance in baseline (pre-treatment). e.g., if in baseline probes, performance ranged from 10% to 30% accuracy and at post treatment performance was 90% accuracy, the change value would be 60% (90% minus 30%). A greater change value indicates greater change in articulation/production of words. Change could be positive (improved articulation) or negative (poorer articulation).</description>

    <measure>Speech Production: Percent Change in Untrained Items</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 10 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in articulatory accuracy of untrained items measured by change in percent accuracy over highest baseline value; production of words designated to NOT receive treatment (untrained items) was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 10 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (maximum = 100%, minimum = 0% correct). Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment. Positive effect sizes = increases in accuracy &amp; negative effect sizes = decreases in accuracy.</description>

    <measure>Speech Production of Untrained Items: Effect Sizes for Untrained Items</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline vs. 10 weeks post all treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of untrained items as measured by effect sizes reflecting magnitude of change. Production of words designated to not receive treatment (i.e., generalization items) was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 10 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). Change in accuracy of articulation of untrained items was measured from baseline to 10 weeks post treatment using effect size calculations as the indicator of magnitude of change. Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment.</description>

Following a 2 week washout period, participants received Sound Production Treatment - Random (SPT-R) for 20 treatment sessions. SPT is a behavioral treatment that includes clinician modeling, orthographic cueing, integral stimulation (&quot;watch me, listen to me, say it with me&quot;, articulation instruction, repeated practice and feedback. In the Blocked version, treatment targets are practiced by blocking items by sound target - words with the same target are grouped together.

        <title>Speech Production: Effect Size for Treated Items</title>
        <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of trained items as measured from baseline to 10 weeks post treatment using effect size calculations as the indicator of magnitude of change; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 10 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (maximum = 100%, minimum = 0% correct). Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment. Positive effect sizes = increases in accuracy &amp; negative effect sizes = decreases in accuracy.</description>

        <title>Speech Production: Percent Change in Treated Items</title>
        <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of treated items as measured by percent increase in accuracy above the highest baseline measurement; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 10 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). The highest percentage accuracy achieved in pre-treatment probes was subtracted from the percentage accuracy achieved at 10 weeks post-treatment to obtain change in accuracy value - this reflects change from maximum correct performance in baseline (pre-treatment). e.g., if in baseline probes, performance ranged from 10% to 30% accuracy and at post treatment performance was 90% accuracy, the change value would be 60% (90% minus 30%). A greater change value indicates greater change in articulation/production of words. Change could be positive (improved articulation) or negative (poorer articulation).</description>

      <time_frame>Entire course of study which was approximately 30 weeks per participant: pretreatment/baseline period = 4 weeks + 7 weeks Treatment 1 + 2 weeks washout + 7 weeks Treatment 2 + follow-up at 10 weeks.</time_frame>

          <title>All Participants</title>
          <description>All participants received Sound Production Treatment (SPT). Half of the participants received SPT administered in a blocked fashion (SPT-B) first, followed by a 2 week washout period, and then SPT administered in a random fashion (SPT-R). The other half of the participants received both treatments administered in the reverse order. Participants were grouped together for analyses by treatment type; this was due to the fact that all participants received both treatments and were observed in the same way for both treatments regardless of which treatment was received first. There were not adverse events and consequently, no need to examine adverse events by arm.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Two participants, one in each arm, received 10 sessions per phase rather than 20 sessions. This was due to these participants achieving high levels of accuracy very quickly; 20 sessions were not required (reduced burden).</limitations_and_caveats>
