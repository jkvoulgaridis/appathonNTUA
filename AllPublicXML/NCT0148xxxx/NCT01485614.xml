  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of the addition of sitagliptin, and its
      effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in pediatric participants 10-17 years of age with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control. The primary hypothesis for this
      study is that sitagliptin reduces A1C more than placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.

      This trial is of approximately 56 weeks in duration, including a screening period of up to 1
      week, a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a 20-week placebo-controlled, double blind
      treatment period [Phase A] and a 34-week double-blind active controlled treatment period
      [Phase B] during which participants randomized to the placebo arm who have not initiated
      glycemic rescue therapy with metformin during Phase A will receive metformin (in a blinded
      manner). A telephone contact will be performed 14 days after the last dose of study
      medication to assess for any serious adverse events (SAEs).

      Two arms of the study (Metformin, Placebo/Sitagliptin) were removed from the study by a
      protocol amendment.
