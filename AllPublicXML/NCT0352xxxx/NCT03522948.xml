    <textblock>
      This study seeks to develop and provide an initial test of a brief intervention to reduce
      alcohol use and sex risk behavior among among men who have sex with men. The study seeks to
      recruit MSM who are non-monogamous, have engaged in unprotected anal intercourse over the
      past 3 months, and who have engaged in heavy drinking defined as &gt; 14 drinks per week or at
      least 1 heavy drinking episode (5+ drinks on a single occasion) in the past month. All
      participants will complete baseline measures about past month behavior and if eligible will
      be assigned to the intervention condition. This intervention consists of a single brief
      in-person intervention coupled with 4 weeks of text messaging related to individualized goals
      about alcohol use and sexual behavior. Follow-up assessments are scheduled for within 1 week
      of completion of the text messaging component of the intervention. Primary outcomes are
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and message components. Secondary outcomes
      are changes in frequency of unprotected intercourse and heavy drinking episodes.

    <measure>Intervention Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants complete the measure 5-6 weeks following baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>3-item modification of Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. Three 5-point Likert scale is used to assess &quot;intervention satisfaction&quot; [very dissatisfied - very satisfied]; degree to which intervention helped alcohol use [no effect to helped a great deal], and intervention helped sexual behavior decisions [no effect - helped a great deal]. Mean scale range is 1-5. Higher scores reflect a better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of heavy episodic drinking measure from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants report frequency of heavy drinking episodes as part of the AUDIT-C questionnaire. The question is presented at follow-up which occurs 5-6 weeks following baseline. There is no timeframe specified in the question itself.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a 5-point Likert scale item which asks participants to report &quot;How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?&quot; Response options range from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;daily or almost daily.&quot; This measure is completed at baseline and 5 to 6 weeks after baseline. Higher scores reflect worse outcomes. Responses reflect current perceptions of past drinking</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of unprotected anal intercourse.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants rate frequency of unprotected anal intercourse over the past 3 months at baseline and rate frequency of unprotected anal intercourse over the past month at follow-up assessment that occurs 5-6 weeks following baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Single item measure of number of times that individual engaged in unprotected intercourse. Range is 0-90 for baseline and range is 0-30 for follow-up. Higher scores reflect a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Systems Assessment Battery (Karoly &amp; Ruehlman, 1995) for behavior goal of &quot;Using condoms every time you have sex with a partner of unknown HIV status&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure was taken at baseline and at follow-up. There is no specific timeframe indicated on the questions as the measure indicates current goal cognitions. The measure is completed at baseline and 5 to 6 weeks following baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>This GSAB battery consists of 4 subscales comprised of 4 Likert scale items each ranging from 0-4. The subscales indicate value, self-efficacy, planning, and monitoring related to the behavior change goal. The mean subscale range is from 0-4. Higher scores reflect better self-regulatory outcomes</description>
