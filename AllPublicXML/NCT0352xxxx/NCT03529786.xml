  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, is caused by a
      deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) leading to an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans
      (GAGs) in tissues of MPS II patients, resulting in characteristic storage lesions and diverse
      disease sequelae, and in patients with the more severe form of the disease, irreversible
      neurocognitive decline and higher morbidity and mortality than in patients with the
      attenuated form of the disease.

      There is currently limited information on the natural history of MPS II, especially with
      respect to neurocognitive decline in patients with the more severe form of the disease. This
      study is planned to be an observational medical records review study (data collected
      retrospectively and no investigational product treatment or procedures) in subjects with the
      severe form of MPS II. Collectively, the data may inform the design of future MPS II gene
      therapy treatment studies and may be utilized as historical comparative control data.
