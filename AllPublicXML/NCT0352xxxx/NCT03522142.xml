    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        • Male and female participants at least 18 years of age with advanced malignancies who have
        received or been intolerant to standard therapy:

        Parts 1A and 2A:

          -  Histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, HCC,
             melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, soft-tissue sarcoma, SCCHN (recurrent or metastatic), TNBC, or
             urothelial carcinoma. Additional tumor histologies, including MSI-H tumors, may be
             allowed with approval from the medical monitor.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.

        Parts 1B and 2B:

        • Histologic confirmation of the cohort-specific tumor types specified below: Cohort 1 -
        Advanced or metastatic melanoma Cohort 2 - Advanced or metastatic NSCLC Cohort 3 -
        Recurrent or metastatic SCCHN Cohort 4 - Advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma

          -  Cohorts 1-3 must have received 1 prior PD-1/L1 treatment and have experienced PD
             during or after that treatment and have progressed on other SOC therapy(ies); Cohort 4
             must be PD-1/L1 treatment naïve but have progressed on SOC therapy(ies).

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Must be willing to submit to a fresh baseline tumor biopsy and an on-treatment biopsy
             between Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1.

          -  Care should be taken to biopsy the same lesion for the baseline and on-treatment
             samples. If a participant has a solitary target lesion, this should not be biopsied.

        Part 1C:

          -  Participants with relapsed/refractory AML following standard therapy; acute
             promyelocytic leukemia (M3) and therapy-related AML are excluded.

          -  FLT3-ITD and IDH1/2 wild-type or mutated are eligible; appropriate targeted therapy
             for participants with actionable mutations must have been received.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory values not within the protocol-defined range.

          -  History of retinal disease as defined in the protocol.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease as per protocol-defined criteria.

          -  History or presence of an ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically
             meaningful as per protocol-defined criteria.

          -  Untreated brain or central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain or CNS metastases
             that have progressed as per protocol-defined criteria.

          -  Active or inactive autoimmune disease or syndrome that has required systemic treatment
             in the past 2 years or receiving systemic therapy for an autoimmune or inflammatory
             disease.

          -  Prior Grade 3 or higher immune-related AEs or any ocular toxicity on prior
             immunotherapy as per protocol-defined criteria.

          -  Receipt of any vitamin K antagonists, systemic corticosteroids, live vaccines, or
             treatment with any anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the
             protocol-defined intervals.

          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or
             complications from prior surgical intervention before starting study treatment.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection or risk of reactivation.

          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
