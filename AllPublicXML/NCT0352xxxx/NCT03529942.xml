      This is an open-label study assessing the effect of the administration of a single
      intra-articular (IA) injection of FX006 32 mg on synovial volume in patients with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study will be conducted in male and female patients who
      are ≥ 40 years of age.

      Eligible patients who provide written consent and meet all entry criteria will undergo
      initial ultrasound examination and MRI with contrast of the index knee, and then receive a
      single IA injection of FX006 administered to the index knee at Baseline/Day 1. Patients will
      return to the clinic at Weeks 6 and 24 for an MRI with contrast of the index knee and other
      assessments. Patients must also have a blood sample drawn for Estimated Glomerular Filtration
      Rate (eGFR) testing within 30 days prior to the scheduled MRIs. In addition, a patient
      questionnaire will be administered and adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication
      updates will be collected via telephone at Weeks 12 and 18.
