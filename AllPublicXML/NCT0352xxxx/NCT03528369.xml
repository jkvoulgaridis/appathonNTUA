  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to examine the comparative
      effects on OAKP of CGS-200-1 (1% Capsaicin content) (N=40), CGS-200-5 (5% Capsaicin content)
      (N=40), and CGS-200 Vehicle (no Capsaicin) (N=40) in subjects with OA of the knees according
      to the 1986 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Assigned doses will be applied
      at the clinic for 60 minutes on each of four consecutive days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the three Arms in this study: CGS-200-1 or CGS-200-5 or
      CGS-200 Vehicle (CGS-200-0). All subjects will receive 4 consecutive days of treatment and
      will then be followed up until the Day 94 visit.

      Even though both knee(s) will receive application of study test materials, with regard to
      reduction in WOMAC pain and VAS pain score associated with study treatments, only one knee
      will be indicated as the &quot;Study Knee&quot;. This will be the knee with the highest WOMAC pain
      score at screening. If both knees have equal WOMAC pain scores at baseline, then the right
      knee will be considered the &quot;Study Knee&quot; with regard to WOMAC pain and VAS pain score
      reduction.

      Data will be collected from Day 1 through Day 5 and then again on Days 19, 35, 64 and 94 for
      efficacy, tolerability, and safety measures. The Investigators, all site staff and Clinical
      Research Organization (CRO) personnel (except the Medical Monitor providing safety oversight)
      directly involved in the study will remain blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the
      trial.

    <time_frame>35 days after the last dose of study drug on Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Efficacy endpoint of this study will be to examine the extent of change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score, relative to baseline, provided by once daily, one-hour application of Vehicle (CGS-200-0), CGS-200-1 and CGS-200-5 at Baseline (&lt; 30 minutes prior to first daily application) and Day 35 (31 days after fourth daily application).
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score is 5 questions relating to pain that the subject responds to using a 100mm visual analogue scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 500. Reduction in pain is expressed as a difference from baseline to Study Day 35. Positive numbers indicate increases and negative numbers indicate decreases. .</description>

Subjects who had a clinical response at no more than one of the post Day 5 visits were considered to have a durable response through the last day at which reduction in WOMAC pain score is at least 50%. Subjects who had less than 50% WOMAC pain score reduction on two or more of the post Day 5 visits were considered to have failed to achieve a durable clinical response.</description>

        <title>Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Score From Baseline to Day 35</title>
        <description>The Primary Efficacy endpoint of this study will be to examine the extent of change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score, relative to baseline, provided by once daily, one-hour application of Vehicle (CGS-200-0), CGS-200-1 and CGS-200-5 at Baseline (&lt; 30 minutes prior to first daily application) and Day 35 (31 days after fourth daily application).
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score is 5 questions relating to pain that the subject responds to using a 100mm visual analogue scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 500. Reduction in pain is expressed as a difference from baseline to Study Day 35. Positive numbers indicate increases and negative numbers indicate decreases. .</description>

        <title>Secondary Efficacy Endpoint #1: Extent of Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Score From Baseline to Day 5, 19, 64 and 94.</title>
        <description>The extent of change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score, relative to baseline, provided by once daily, one-hour application of CGS-200-0, CGS-200-1 and CGS-200-5 from Baseline to Day 5, 19, 64 and Day 94.
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score is 5 questions relating to pain that the subject responds to using a 100mm visual analogue scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 500. Positive numbers indicate increases and negative numbers indicate decreases.</description>

        <description>Day 5, 19, 35, 64 and 94 Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index Stiffness Scores.
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score is 2 questions relating to stiffness that the subject responds to using a 100mm visual analogue scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 200. Positive numbers indicate increases and negative numbers indicate decreases.</description>
