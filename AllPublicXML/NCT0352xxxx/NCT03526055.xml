      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pulse widths &lt;500 µS and &gt;1000 µS on
      clinical outcomes during a temporary SCS trial.

    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, single-center, two arm, randomized, crossover design to
      be conducted at The Ohio Pain Clinic. The study will enroll up to 15 subjects in order to
      include up to 10 subjects in the study. Subjects selected to participate in the trial have
      back and/or leg pain, have been evaluated as a candidate for SCS and have agreed to undergo a
      temporary SCS trial using the Algostim system with percutaneous leads. Each subject will be
      followed during the trial period of approximately 7 days.

      The study will end when the last subject has completed the trial period. exited. The expected
      enrollment period for this study is approximately three months. After exit from the clinical
      study, subjects will continue to be followed by their physician per usual care. All device
      and procedure-related AEs will be collected and reported per the study protocol.

    <description>The study used a pain relief scale (similar to a brief pain inventory). The scale assessed pain relief using a percent relief rating in 10% increments, where a higher number represents greater pain relief than a lower number for the pain scale. A higher number is considered better for pain relief scale. The scale range is from 0%, which is no relief of pain to 100%, which is complete relief of pain. Subjects are asked to rate their pain by marking the box beside the number that best describes their pain in the last 24 hours.</description>

          <description>The study used a pain relief scale (similar to a brief pain inventory). The scale assessed pain relief using a percent relief rating in 10% increments, where a higher number represents greater pain relief than a lower number for the pain scale. A higher number is considered better for pain relief scale. The scale range is from 0%, which is no relief of pain to 100%, which is complete relief of pain. Subjects are asked to rate their pain by marking the box beside the number that best describes their pain in the last 24 hours.</description>
