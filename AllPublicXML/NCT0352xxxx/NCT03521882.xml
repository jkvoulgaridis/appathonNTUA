  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is caused by sudden changes in blood flow in the brain. This can be fatal or can
      result in permanent disability. A fast diagnosis is essential to initiate effective
      interventions and optimize benefits to patients. There are other diseases that can look like
      a stroke and these are called &quot;stroke mimics&quot;. The quicker that stroke mimics can be ruled
      out the faster a stroke can be diagnosed and treatment can be given. The investigators may be
      able to use chemicals in the blood to rapidly confirm that a person has had a stroke. One
      such chemical is called eotaxin. Eotaxin has been found to be changed in sufferers of a
      stroke but not in those with stroke mimics. However, more research is needed to confirm the
      usefulness of eotaxin. This feasibility study aims to provide the foundations to allow a
      large scale trial of this test. The study aims to recruit participants that have had a stroke
      or a stroke mimic from the Acute Stroke Unit and Stroke clinic at the Royal Devon and Exeter
      Hospital. Up to 6 blood samples will be taken from each participant at different times over
      one week. Eotaxin will be measured in these samples and in participant's leftover samples
      taken for clinical care. This is needed because the investigators know that the amount of
      eotaxin changes in the blood after a stroke but we do not know how quickly this change
      happens and for how long the change occurs. The study will also allow the investigators to
      understand how many participants will be needed for a large scale trial and the challenges
      that may be faced in recruiting participants.
