  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study examines the impact of ParentCorps in high-poverty Early Education Centers
      in New York City (NYC). The study is conducted within the context of the NYC Department of
      Education (DOE) Pre-K Thrive initiative. As part of this initiative, the Center for Early
      Childhood Health and Development (CEHD) at NYU Langone Health is implementing services to
      strengthen family engagement and support parents and teachers in building safe, nurturing and
      predictable environments for young children. Services include resources to support social
      emotional learning (SEL) and family engagement (FE) for all Pre-K for All (PKFA) programs and
      all PKFA families; Professional Learning to support the use of evidence-based SEL and FE
      practices for teachers and leaders from 350 PKFA programs; and ParentCorps programs for PKFA
      children and families in 50 PKFA programs (which is a subset of PKFA programs receiving
      Professional Learning). The current study evaluates the relative value of Thrive Professional
      Learning plus ParentCorps compared to Thrive Professional Learning.

      This study will include 158 pre-K teachers (teachers and teaching assistants) across 23
      Centers (12 Centers receiving Thrive Professional Learning plus ParentCorps, 11 Centers
      receiving Thrive Professional Learning only). All teachers in the 23 Centers will be invited
      to complete 2 self-report surveys over a two-year period. A sub-set of teachers will be
      randomly selected to participate in 2 interviews during this period. In addition, teachers in
      sites randomized to ParentCorps (12 Centers) will be invited to consent to the use of weekly
      implementation surveys, observational data and semi-structured interviews about experiences
      with implementation, collected as part of standard implementation practice of ParentCorps,
      for the purposes of this study.
