  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III study of Napabucasin plus bi-weekly
      FOLFIRI (Arm 1) vs. Napabucasin (Arm 2) for adult patients with metastatic CRC who have
      failed standard chemotherapy regimens. For patients who have failed bevacizumab with
      irinotecan-based chemotherapies (treatment failure is defined as radiologic progression of
      disease during or within 3 months following the last dose), bevacizumab maybe administered in
      combination with FOLFIRI to patients randomized to Arm 1.

    <description>Napabucasin 240 mg will be administered orally, twice daily, with doses separated by approximately 8~12 hours. For patients who have failed bevacizumab with irinotecan-based chemotherapies, bevacizumab may be administered with FOLFIRI. FOLFIRI infusion will start at least 2 hours following the first daily dose of napabucasin and will be administered every 2 weeks, starting on C1D1. If bevacizumab is added to FOLFIRI, bevacizumab infusion should start at least 2 hours following the first daily dose of napabucasin and will be administered every 2 weeks. Irinotecan/leucovorin infusion will follow bevacizumab infusion. 5-FU 400 mg/ m^2 bolus will be administered intravenously immediately following irinotecan/leucovorin infusion, followed by 5-FU 1200 mg/ m^2/day continuous infusion. For patients who could not tolerate FOLFIRI at the full dose previously, FOLFIRI should be started at the same dose level the patient tolerated FOLFIRI previously.</description>
