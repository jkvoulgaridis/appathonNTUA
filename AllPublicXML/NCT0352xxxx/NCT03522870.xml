  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, multi-center, parallel-group, efficacy and safety study with a
      26-weeks follow- up(after 2-week recruitment). The study aims to: 1)compare the effects of
      novel flash glucose monitoring system (FGMS) and conventional Self Measurement of Blood
      Glucose (SMBG); and 2) optimize integrated management for glycaemic control in adult patients
      with type 1 diabetes who are sub-optimally controlled.

    <textblock>
      Subjects with Type 1 diabetes who meet criteria will be enrolled at up to eight clinical
      research sites in China. Subjects will be randomized to either flash glucose monitoring
      system(Freestyle Libre®;Abbott Diabetes Care,Witney, Oxon,UK) or conventional Self
      Measurement of Blood Glucose (Bayer®)alone at least three times per day. Primary outcome
      variable is the difference in HbA1c which will be analyzed in a central laboratory between
      baseline and the 26weeks follow-up. Secondary outcome variables such as time-in-range,
      frequency and duration of and hyperglycemic episodes etc. will be assessed at baseline (Week
      0 to 2), Week 12-14 and Week 24-26 via professional continuous glucose system (Ipro2®;
      Medtronic). At the same time, demographic factors, clinical data, patient reported outcome
      (PROs) will be collected. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self-reporting at each
      visit and/or phone call. All patients will receive same ordinary diabetes education.

    <description>The Chinese version of the Diabetes Distress Scale is to evaluate diabetes-related emotional distress in Chinses diabetic patients. The scale consists of 17 items, contains four domains including emotional burden sub-scale, physician-related distress subscale, regimen-related distress subscale, and diabetes-related interpersonal distress. Each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 1(no problem) to 6(serious problem). An average score ≥3 is the cut-off point which is considered to more than moderate problem. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>The Chinses version of Hypoglycemia Fear Survey II- Worry Scale (CHFSII-WS) is to evaluate psychological status for diabetic patients. Change in Hypoglycemia Fear Scale (HFS) score will be assessed in week 14 and week 26 adjusted for baseline(week0). These validated surveys consist of 18 questions which measure dimensions of anxiety and fear surrounding hypoglycemia. Each item is rated on 5-point Likert scale from 0(never related) to 4(very related). &quot;Never relative&quot; scores 1, and so on and so forth, and &quot;very related&quot; scores 4. Patients with higher scores are considered with more anxieties and fear of hypoglycemia. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,week 14 and week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of the EQ-5D-5L is widely used to evaluate quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L is converted to a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches weights to each of the levels in each dimension. The formula is based on the valuation of EQ-5D health states from general population samples. It contains the health description system and Visual Analogue Score (VAS). The health description system includes 5 dimensions including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each item is rated on 5 levels from 1(no problems) to 5(extreme problem). And the EQ-VAS is to evaluate the health condition assessed by patients. The top score (100) means the best health conditions and the bottom one (0) means the worst. Administration time is approximately 3minutes. Difference in EQ-5D-5Ls assessed in week 14 and week26 adjusted for baseline(week0-2).</description>
