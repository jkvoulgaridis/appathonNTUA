  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostatic artery embolization with Embosphere Microspheres is a relatively new procedure. The
      goal of this post market study is to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness in a 'real
      world' setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label post market study to evaluate the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) using Embosphere Microspheres. Up to
      1,000 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH) will be enrolled in this single arm post market study. All patients at sites who meet
      eligibility criteria will be offered participation. Long term effectiveness of PAE on LUTS
      will be evaluated by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at baseline, 3 months, 12
      months, 24 months and 36 months. Safety will be assessed by evaluating treatment related
      adverse events at the same time points, plus at 4 weeks following embolization. Erectile
      function will be assessed at baseline and 12 months by Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM)
      score. Additional treatments for refractory or recurrent LUTS due to BPH post prostatic
      artery embolization will also be recorded.

      Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria

        -  Patient has signed informed consent

        -  Patient age is 18 years or older at time of informed consent

        -  Patient will undergo PAE with Embosphere Microspheres for the treatment of symptomatic
           BPH with LUTS

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  Patient is unable or unwilling to provide follow-up information

        -  Patient is undergoing PAE for reasons that do not include symptomatic BPH with LUTS

        -  Any other reason the investigator deems cause for exclusion

      A treatment-related adverse event is defined in this post market study as any event that
      began on or after the date of the PAE procedure and is considered related to the study
      procedure by the investigator. All related events must be reported in the case report form
      and followed until resolution.Any treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE) that occurs
      on or after the date of the PAE or worsened in severity or frequency after the PAE must be
      reported to the Sponsor immediately (not to exceed 24 hours within site notification of the
      event) in the case report form or via email. It is the responsibility of Investigators to
      inform their Review Board/ Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of complications or serious injury as
      required by their Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) procedure and/or
      federal law.

      After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from
      either the patient or his guardian or legal representative prior to any study procedures. The
      method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent will
      comply with International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and
      all applicable regulatory requirement(s).
