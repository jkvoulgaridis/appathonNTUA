      The aim of this work is to study nephroprotective effects of nitric oxide (NO)
      supplementation to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit during cardiac surgery with
      normothermic CPB in adult patients. The prospective randomized study is performed in the
      settings of Federal Cardiology Center. A total of 96 adult patients who underwent cardiac
      surgery with CPB are enrolled in the study. Patients are randomized to two groups: main group
      receive NO treatment; control group undergoes sham procedure. In the main group, NO is
      supplied to the CPB line in a dose of 40 ppm throughout the entire CPB period. The primary
      endpoint is the frequency of acute kidney injury (AKI). The secondary endpoints are urine
      output during CPB; uNGAL level 4 h after surgery; plasma concentration of free hemoglobin
      (Hb); concentrations of NO metabolites (nitrite (NO2−) and nitrate (NO3−)) and the total
      concentration of metabolites of NO (NOx, μM/mL) in blood plasma in the intraoperative period;
      concentration of proinflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, -6, and -8) and anti-inflammatory mediators
      (IL-1ra, IL-4) in blood plasma in the intraoperative period. Cumulative fluid balance,
      diuresis, and Lasix doses are assessed within the first 48 h of the postoperative period. The
      dynamics of serum creatinine is assessed during the first week following the intervention.

    <description>The presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is assessed during 48 hours after surgery. AKI is defined as follows: an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 μM/L) during 48 hours after surgery; an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 1.5 times compared with the initial preoperative level for seven days after intervention; and urine output &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours during the first 48 h after surgery.</description>
