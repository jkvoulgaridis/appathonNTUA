  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study described within this protocol is designed to test a single hormone closed-loop
      algorithm for managing blood glucose in type 1 diabetes using insulin only and a new device
      for measuring glucose continuously in the immediate vicinity of subcutaneous insulin
      delivery. Subjects will undergo one all day closed loop study using insulin only. The closed
      loop insulin only system includes a Dexcom G5 transmitter, a Nexus 5 smart phone and two
      Tandem tslim pumps connected to two Pacific Diabetes Technologies glucose sensing cannulas.
      The closed loop system will be started after G5 2 hour sensor start-up with an IV catheter
      for frequent blood withdrawal for 10 hours.

      Subjects will undergo one 12 hour inpatient study. During this intervention visit, subjects
      will wear the single hormone closed loop system which includes two t:slim insulin pumps to
      deliver insulin or saline through two investigational PDT glucose sensing cannulas, and a
      Dexcom G5 CGM to measure glucose. The subject will come to the research center at
      approximately 7am for the inpatient visit. The Dexcom G5 sensor and PDT glucose sensing
      cannulas will be placed after arrival. An 18-22 gauge IV catheter will be placed for blood
      sampling every 15 minutes after sensor warm-up is complete for measuring blood glucose
      concentration. After a 2 hour warm-up period for the G5 sensor, glucose will be controlled
      using the FMPD single hormone mode. The single hormone mode of the controller determines
      insulin delivery rates based on proportional and derivative error through one t:slim insulin
      pump. The second t:slim insulin pump will deliver normal saline at the same delivery rates as
      the insulin. Subjects will eat breakfast and lunch at approximately 11 am and 3 pm
      respectively. Subjects will have the ability to complete light exercise on a treadmill. The
      closed loop system will be stopped at approximately 6pm with removal of all devices.

      During the study, the subject will wear one subcutaneous DexcomTM G5 continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) system. The CGM system will provide sensed glucose data every 5 minutes. The
      accuracy of the sensed data will be obtained by reference measurements of two YSI venous
      blood glucose values to calibrate the sensor at the beginning of the closed loop study.
      Sensed glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) from the
      Dexcom G5 transmitter to the Nexus 5 master controller every five minutes. The controller is
      a Google Nexus 5 phone. The smart phone will wirelessly communicate via BTLE to two Tandem
      t:slim insulin pumps, one for automated insulin delivery and one of automated saline
      delivery.

    <description>Assess the average score on the visual analog scale at 15 minutes after insertion of the PDT glucose sensor. This scale will be used to measure sensor site discomfort from the PDT glucose sensing cannula. The subject completes the visual analog scale by drawing a single vertical line through a 100 mm line corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of discomfort from the insertion of the sensors. Subjects will be instructed to mark their line starting on the left side over to the right side. If subjects are feeling no discomfort, they would circle the vertical line on the left end of the scale. If subjects are currently feeling the worst discomfort possible, they would circle the vertical line on the right side of the scale. One staff member will measure all scales and document score as a measurement of 0-100.</description>

            <description>Subjects will have glucose managed using the Artificial Pancreas Control system (APC) using insulin only. Insulin will be infused through the Pacific Diabetes Technologies CGM Insulin Infusion system.
Artificial Pancreas Control system (APC): This intervention is a single hormone closed loop system including a Nexus 5 smart phone, two tslim insulin pumps, a Dexcom G5 CGM and two PDT glucose sensing cannulas that together make up a new experimental, investigational device system. The algorithm included in the APC is an automated version of the Fading Memory Proportional Derivative (FMPD) insulin and glucagon control algorithm.

        <description>Assess the average score on the visual analog scale at 15 minutes after insertion of the PDT glucose sensor. This scale will be used to measure sensor site discomfort from the PDT glucose sensing cannula. The subject completes the visual analog scale by drawing a single vertical line through a 100 mm line corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of discomfort from the insertion of the sensors. Subjects will be instructed to mark their line starting on the left side over to the right side. If subjects are feeling no discomfort, they would circle the vertical line on the left end of the scale. If subjects are currently feeling the worst discomfort possible, they would circle the vertical line on the right side of the scale. One staff member will measure all scales and document score as a measurement of 0-100.</description>

The investigator discharging the subject will inspect each PDT glucose sensing cannula insertion site and rate the level of redness (erythema) and swelling (edema). Both the left and right insertion sites will be inspected. Erythema will be measured from 0-4. A score of 0 indicates no erythema, a score of 1 indicates very slight, barely perceptible erythema, a score of 2 indicates well defined erythema, a score of 3 indicates moderate erythema, and a score of 4 indicates severe erythema, beet redness to slight eschar formation. Edema will be measured from a score of 0-4. A score of 0 indicates no edema, a score of 1 indicates very slight, barely perceptible edema, a score of 2 indicates well defined edema, a score of 3 indicates moderate edema, raised approximately 1 mm, and a score of 4 indicates severe edema, raised greater than 1 mm and beyond exposure area.</description>

        <title>Mean Draize Scale for Edema for the Left Sensing Cannula at End of Study for All Subjects</title>
        <description>Assess the average score on the Draize scale at the end of the study of the PDT glucose sensor. The investigator discharging the subject will inspect each PDT glucose sensing cannula insertion site and rate the level of redness (erythema) and swelling (edema). Both the left and right insertion sites will be inspected. Erythema will be measured from 0-4. A score of 0 indicates no erythema, a score of 1 indicates very slight, barely perceptible erythema, a score of 2 indicates well defined erythema, a score of 3 indicates moderate erythema, and a score of 4 indicates severe erythema, beet redness to slight eschar formation. Edema will be measured from a score of 0-4. A score of 0 indicates no edema, a score of 1 indicates very slight, barely perceptible edema, a score of 2 indicates well defined edema, a score of 3 indicates moderate edema, raised approximately 1 mm, and a score of 4 indicates severe edema, raised greater than 1 mm and beyond exposure area.</description>

            <description>Subjects will have glucose managed using the Artificial Pancreas Control system (APC) using insulin only. Insulin will be infused through the Pacific Diabetes Technologies CGM Insulin Infusion system.
Artificial Pancreas Control system (APC): This intervention is a single hormone closed loop system including a Nexus 5 smart phone, two tslim insulin pumps, a Dexcom G5 CGM and two PDT glucose sensing cannulas that together make up a new experimental, investigational device system. The algorithm included in the APC is an automated version of the Fading Memory Proportional Derivative (FMPD) insulin and glucagon control algorithm.
