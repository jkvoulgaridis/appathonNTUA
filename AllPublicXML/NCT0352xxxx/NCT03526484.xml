      The primary focus of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the usefulness of urinalysis
      prior to in-office urology procedures.

      OVERVIEW:

      Current urology practice requires every patient to have a urinalysis lab done prior to any
      in-office procedures. If the patient's urinalysis is positive, they are then required to have
      a urine culture done, which takes 1-3 days to show results, and they may also be prescribed
      antibiotics. This practice may cause diagnostic delays, unnecessary cancellations of
      procedures, and the overuse of antibiotics. The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness
      of urinalysis labs and urine cultures in patients prior to in-office cystoscopies,
      intravesical BCG treatments, and prostate biopsies. We predict there is no difference in the
      number of cases of urinary tract infections in patients that undergo in-office procedures
      with or without a prior urinalysis. We purpose a change in protocol could allow for improved
      clinical efficiency, antibiotic stewardship, and be economically advantageous.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive standard of care before their
      procedure or have their procedure conducted by their provider without consulting the
      urinalysis results beforehand. Participants will have follow up questionnaires seven days and
      thirty days after their procedure.

    <description>The control group will have a urine sample taken for a urinalysis prior to their procedure, which will have a reflex urine culture done if urinalysis results are positive. The results of the urinalysis will be reported to the doctor performing the procedure. The provider may require participants to take antibiotics and/or delay their procedure as a result of the urinalysis.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The experimental group will have a urine sample taken for a urinalysis prior to their procedure, which will have a reflex urine culture done if urinalysis results are positive. The results of the urinalysis will NOT be reported to the doctor performing the procedure. Instead, the provider will conduct the procedure without looking at or acting upon the results of the urinalysis. The urinalysis and urine culture results will be monitored by the research team, and the participant will be informed if the urine culture results are positive for an infection.</description>
