      The proposed study is a 3-site, 12-week, novel, feasibility, investigation of patients who
      have co-occurring diagnoses of schizophrenia and current substance use disorder (alcohol,
      cocaine, heroin, or cannabis). Eighty patients will be randomly assigned to switch to
      brexpiprazole (the brexpiprazole group) or remain on the same antipsychotic treatment (the
      control group). The study will be conducted at 3 sites in the US. The investigators expect to
      enroll 80 subjects across 3 sites. UMass Medical School, Worcester MA is the lead site.
      Sub-sites include Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of North Carolina
      at Chapel Hill (UNC).

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      The primary objectives of the study include:

        1. examine the effect of brexpiprazole treatment on the number of days of substance use in
           the past week as measured by the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) assessment;

        2. examine the effect of brexpiprazole treatment on substance craving using 100-mm visual
           analogue scale (VAS).

      The secondary objectives are to examine the effect of brexpiprazole treatment on:

        1. the dollar amount spent on substances in the past week;

        2. the psychiatric symptoms as measured using PANSS

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A scale used to measure weekly substance use starting 30 days prior to the screening until the end of the 12-week study period. Measurement values for the scale vary based on substance used (i.e. alcohol = number of standard drinks/ day; Cannabis = number of joints/ day; cocaine and heroine = did you use this day), but for our purposes data collected will be reduced to whether or not a subject used on a particular day.
For this study, a decrease in the number of days of substance use over a 7-day period will be considered an improved outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measure to assess craving for substances. Subjects will make a mark on an unlabeled 100 millimeter line indicating their desire to use a particular substance over the past 7-days. A score of 0 indicates no desire to use and 100 indicating the strongest desire to use possible.
This assessment will be taken on a weekly basis throughout the 12-week study. Every substance that a subject has a substance use disorder for will be measured separately.
For this study a decreased score represents an improved outcome.</description>

    <description>The amount of money spent on substances over a 7-day period will also be recorded as part of each weekly visit. Decreased money spent on substances over a 7-day period will also be considered an improved outcome.</description>
