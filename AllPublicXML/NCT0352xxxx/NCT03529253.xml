  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify whether additional administration of Alirocumab exerts
      a stronger stabilizing effect on the vulnerable plaque in CAD, compared with statin alone
      administration in patients receiving PCI. Therefore, the change in maxLCBI (4 mm) of the
      coronary artery 9 months after administration by addition administration of Alirocumab is
      evaluated as the main evaluation item as compared with statin administration alone for
      patients who have CAD and received PCI. Also, change of plaque properties is compared with
      baseline and evaluated. This study is a single-center, randomized, open-label study, using
      alirocumab, rosuvastatin as test drugs. Based on the findings obtained in this study, it is
      possible to clarify the mechanism of stabilization of the plaque in a patient with coronary
      artery disease, which in turn suppresses the progress of plaque in coronary artery disease,
      resulting in primary or secondary There is a possibility that it can contribute to
      prevention.

      The investigators investigate the change in the maxLCBI (4 mm) value calculated by NIRS-IVUS
      at the time of PCI and at the treatment evaluation after 9 months compared with the group of
      Alirocumab(Alirocumab75mg/2week+losuvastatin10mg/daily) and standard treatment
      (losuvastatin10mg/daily alone). And also the investigators evaluate LCBI(lesion), Angle of a
      lipid core, EEM CSA, Lumen CSA, Minimum lumen diameter, Plaque burden, Lesion length by
      NIRS-IVUS.
