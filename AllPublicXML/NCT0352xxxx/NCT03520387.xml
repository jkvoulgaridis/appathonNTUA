  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is the #1 contributor to disability in the United States (US), and second only to
      hearing problems as a reason for new Veteran disability compensation. The societal burden of
      back pain is driven mainly by chronic low back pain (CLBP), defined as low back pain
      persisting for 3 months. Since most individual treatments for CLBP have only small effects on
      functional recovery, combining CLBP treatments has recently been recommended as a priority
      area for research. However, few prior studies of CLBP have been properly designed to evaluate
      the effects of treatment combinations. Large effects on functional recovery from CLBP may
      require combining interventions that each target different points on a theoretical pathway to
      functional recovery. Procedural treatments for CLBP aim primarily to address early stages in
      the pathway to functional recovery, such as problems with the lumbar spinal structures or low
      back pain itself. In contrast, behavioral interventions for CLBP generally have effects not
      only on pain itself, but also work by mitigating the degree to which the sensation of low
      back pain impacts function, well-being, and quality of life. These represent later stages in
      the pathway to functional recovery from CLBP. Combining procedural and behavioral treatments
      may have great potential for achieving large magnitude treatment effects for CLBP in
      Veterans.

      The proposed research assesses the feasibility of using a 2 x 2 factorial randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) design to examine the individual and combined effects of 1) lumbar
      medial branch nerve radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), a commonly used procedural intervention
      to target low back pain severity, and 2) a novel video telehealth tablet- and personal
      computer (PC)-based Activity Tracker-Informed Video-Enabled Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      program (&quot;AcTIVE-CBT&quot;), a behavioral intervention designed primarily to target functional
      limitations both secondary to, and independent of, improvements in pain. The LRFA treatment
      to be used in the proposed study addresses the major patient selection, procedural/technical,
      methodologic and reporting limitations of prior studies. AcTIVE-CBT addresses problems with
      Veteran access and compliance associated with conventional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      delivered in clinic, and uses currently available activity tracking technology to better
      promote activity and behavior change as compared to conventional CBT. This pilot RCT involves
      recruitment of up to 30 Veterans with CLBP who will be followed to evaluate functional
      recovery for up to 3 months, to reach a goal of 20 Veterans completing the 3-month primary
      outcome. The primary outcome is participant-reported back-related functional limitations
      (mobility and ADLs) at 3 months, as measured by the validated Roland-Morris Disability
      Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include activity tracker-assessed step counts, back pain
      intensity, reduction in opioid use, and quality of life. Although the proposed pilot study is
      unlikely to definitively address whether these treatments alone or in combination have
      significant effects on functional recovery, it will inform a future large-scale multicenter
      RCT to determine the efficacy of LRFA, AcTIVE-CBT, or combined LRFA + AcTIVE-CBT, for
      Veterans with CLBP.

      The proposed research assesses the feasibility of using an innovative application of the 2 x
      2 factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to examine the individual and combined
      effects of 1) lumbar medial branch nerve radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), a commonly used
      procedural intervention to target low back pain severity, and 2) a novel video telehealth
      tablet- and personal computer (PC)-based Activity Tracker-Informed Video-Enabled Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy program (&quot;AcTIVE-CBT&quot;), a behavioral intervention designed primarily to
      target functional limitations both secondary to, and independent of, improvements in pain.
      The LRFA treatment to be used in the proposed study addresses the major patient selection,
      procedural/technical, methodologic and reporting limitations of prior studies. AcTIVE-CBT
      addresses problems with Veteran access and compliance associated with conventional cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered in clinic, and uses currently available activity tracking
      technology to better promote activity and behavior change as compared to conventional CBT.
      This pilot RCT involves recruitment of up to 30 Veterans with CLBP who will be followed to
      evaluate functional recovery for up to 3 months, to reach a goal of 20 Veterans completing
      the 3-month primary outcome. The primary outcome is participant-reported back-related
      functional limitations (mobility and ADLs) at 3 months, as measured by the validated
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include activity tracker-assessed
      step counts, back pain intensity, reduction in opioid use, and quality of life. The
      investigators hypothesize that 1) each individual treatment will result in improvements in
      back-related functional limitations and secondary outcomes compared to control, and 2)
      combined treatment will produce greater treatment effects than each of the individual
      treatments alone. Although the proposed pilot study is unlikely to definitively address
      whether these treatments alone or in combination have significant effects on functional
      recovery, it will inform a future large-scale multicenter RCT to determine the efficacy of
      LRFA, AcTIVE-CBT, or combined LRFA + AcTIVE-CBT, for Veterans with CLBP.
