  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the level of emotional intelligence in patients diagnosed with
      substance use disorder and to evaluate the benefits in emotional skills after a brief
      intervention based on emotional intelligence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited by consecutive non-probabilistic sampling in the Addictions Day
      Hospital of the Addictions Unit of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona. The
      level of emotional intelligence will be assessed through the following measurement
      instruments: MSCEIT for the objective emotional intelligence coefficient and the TMMS-24 for
      the perceived emotional intelligence. Patients will attend 9 sessions of brief group
      intervention based on emotional intelligence and pre-post intervention differences in
      participants' TMMS-24 scores will be analyzed

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived emotional intelligence, measured with the Spanish version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (Fernandez-Berrocal, Extremera &amp; Ramos, 2004).</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline scores at 2-months scores</time_frame>
    <description>The Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) is a 24-item self-report instrument with three subscales measuring three key aspects of perceived emotional intelligence: Attention, Clarity and Repair. Each of these three subscales consists of eight items with a 5-point Likert response format (ranging from 1 to 5). Subscale total scores are obtained by summing responses to all items and thus range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater level of the characteristic assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on an ability measure of emotional intelligence, the Spanish version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (Extremera &amp; Fernández-Berrocal, 2016).</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention only</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) consists of 141 items that yield an overall emotional intelligence (EI) score and two EI area scores: the Experiential EI and Strategic EI scores. The aforementioned scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15, with higher scores indicating greater emotional intelligence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-esteem, measured with the Spanish version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Martin-Albo, Núñez, Navarro &amp; Grijalvo, 2007).</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline scores at 2-months scores</time_frame>
    <description>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is a self-report measure of global self-esteem. It consists of ten items with a 4-point Likert response format (ranging from 1 to 4). The RSES total score is obtained by summing responses to all items and thus ranges from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater self-esteem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective happiness, measured with the Spanish version of the Subjective Happiness Scale (Extremera &amp; Fernández-Berrocal, 2013).</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline scores at 2-months scores</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) is a self-report measure of global subjective happiness. It consists of four items with a 7-point Likert response format (ranging from 1 to 7). The SHS total score is obtained by averaging responses to all items and thus ranges from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater happiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in life satisfaction, measured with the Spanish version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Vásquez, Duque &amp; Hervás, 2013).</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline scores at 2-months scores</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a self-report measure of life satisfaction. It consists of five items with a 7-point Likert response format (ranging from 1 to 7). The SWLS total score is obtained by summing responses to all items and thus ranges from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating greater life satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety levels, measured with the Spanish version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State subscale (Spielberger, Gorsuch &amp; Lushene, 2011).</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline scores at 2-months scores</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State subscale (STAI-S) is a self-report measure of state anxiety. It consists of 20 items with a 4-point Likert response format (ranging from 0 to 3). The STAI-S total direct score is obtained by summing responses to all items and thus ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater levels of state anxiety.</description>

    <description>Patient's emotional abilities will be stimulated by means of a brief intervention in a group format (nine sessions). In these sessions we will use both projective and guided-fantasy techniques for the emotional diagnosis, as well as psychoeducational workshops of both emotional education and emotional intelligence development.</description>
