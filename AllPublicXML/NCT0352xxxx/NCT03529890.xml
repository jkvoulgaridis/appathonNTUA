      A prospective, single arm, multicenter, Phase II-Trial to assess safety and efficacy of
      preoperative Radiation therapy before radical CystEctomy combined with ImmunoTherapy in
      locally advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced bladder cancer have a poor prognosis despite radical surgical
      therapy. The addition of perioperative combination chemotherapy did not add significant
      benefit to surgery alone. There is data indicating a synergistic effect of radiation and
      immunotherapy. Therefore, combined application of radiotherapy with Nivolumab before radical
      cystectomy might lead to improved cure rates and local control in this poor prognosis group
      with locally advanced bladder cancer. The aim of this phase-II study is to assess feasibility
      and safety of immunotherapy combined with neoadjuvant radiation before radical cystectomy.

          8. Informed consent:

               1. Participants must have signed and dated an IEC approved written informed consent
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not
                  part of normal participant care.

               2. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
                  schedule, laboratory tests, and other requirements of the study

          9. Body weight 35 kg - 160 kg

         10. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to start of trial.

             must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year (see
             Appendix 15.7). These patients will be instructed to adhere to contraception for the
             period between inclusion into the study and surgery (which leads to sterility). Women
             who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically
             sterile) as well as sterile men do not require contraception. If patients do not
             undergo surgery or in the rare case of fertility preserving cystectomy , effective
             contraception should be used for at least 5 months following the last dose of
             Nivolumab. In the latter instance serum pregnancy testing is required in WOCBP at the
             end of the 5 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Metastatic disease defined as distant metastasis or suspicious lymph nodes (&gt; 10mm
             short axis) outside the pelvis (clearly above aortic bifurcation) using RECIST 1.1
             criteria. Enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvis below or at aortic bifurcation are NO
             exclusion criterion irrespective of size.

          2. Prior chemotherapy before treatment (not including intravesical chemotherapy)

          3. Prior radiation therapy of the pelvis

             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger)

          5. Immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids or other drugs within 14 days of
             study drug administration (not including: inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal
             replacement doses are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease)

          6. Experimental therapy or clinical trial at time of inclusion or the previous 4 weeks

          7. Previous treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or immune
             checkpoint pathways (not including BCG therapy)

             failure, unstable or poorly controlled angina, uncontrolled hypertension, serious
             arrhythmia or myocardial infarction in previous 12 months before inclusion; ii)

             detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxic.

          9. End-stage kidney disease defined as GFR &lt; 15ml/min or need for dialysis in absence of
             hydronephrosis. In case of hydronephrosis, drainage should be performed prior to
             inclusion preferably by nephrostomy, alternatively by ureteral stent placement.

         10. Thromboembolic events like pulmonary embolism or apoplexy in previous 3 months

         11. Other active tumor disease (not including basal cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix and incidental prostate carcinoma). Tumor is regarded non active

             by the authorities [§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 4 AMG].

         17. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature,
             significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a
             rational intention in the light of the facts [§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 3a AMG].

         18. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male/female patients of
             childbearing potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control
             (failure rate of less than 1% per year). [Acceptable methods of contraception are:

             the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation, study
             drug administration, or would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol
             therapy

         25. Gastrointestinal disorders, particularly those with high risk of perforation or
             fistula formation including i) active peptic ulcer disease or active inflammatory
             bowel disease (incl. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), diverticulitis,
