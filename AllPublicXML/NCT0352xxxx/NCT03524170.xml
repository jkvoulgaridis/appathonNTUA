      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion
      protein M7824 (M7824) when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with
      hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the
      body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. M7824
      is a drug that targets specific proteins on immune cells in order to activate immune
      responses against tumor cells. Giving M7824 together with radiation therapy may work better
      in treating patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of M7824 and radiation therapy in
      patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (-) breast cancer.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 and radiation therapy in patients with
      metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses, specifically percentage (%) change in
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) pre and post therapy to M7824 and radiation therapy in
      patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To explore progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to power future
      definitive trial.

      III. To evaluate the in-field and abscopal effect of treatment with anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap
      (M7824) and radiation therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the effect of anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) and radiation therapy on
      immune biomarkers including PD-L1 expression and fibrosis changes in tumor microenvironment
      in tumor tissue obtained from subjects pre- and post-treatment.

      II. To characterize circulating immune cell populations and cytokine profiles in tumor and
      circulation following treatment with M7824.

      III. To conduct ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq), RNA Scope, whole exome sequencing (WES)
      targeted sequencing and tissue IO gene expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive M7824 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 14 days. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 3 days
      after second dose of M7824, patients undergo radiation therapy once a day (QD) for 5-10 days
      depending on the site of disease in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 90 days.

Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined by &quot;3+3&quot; design, and the recommended phase II dose is defined when 6 patients have been treated on that dose with no more than 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT will be evaluated within 6 weeks after first administration of anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824). Detailed information collected for each adverse event (AE) will include a description of the event, duration, severity, relationship to study treatment, action taken, and clinical outcome. Severity of AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE v 4.0. Summary of AEs will include only AEs that started or worsened during the on-treatment period, the treatment-emergent AEs. However, all safety data (including those from the pre- and post-treatment periods) will be listed and those collected during the pre- and post-treatment are to be flagged.</description>
