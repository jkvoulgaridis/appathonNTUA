  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) require dual antiplatelet
      therapy (DAPT). Preliminary assessment of the PRECISE-DAPT score is mandatory in order to
      assess the risk of bleeding while on DAPT. The score takes into consideration age, creatinine
      clearance, haemoglobin, white-blood-cell count and previous spontaneous bleeding. One should
      consider, however, that some of the variables included in the PRECISE-DAPT score might change
      with time. As a consequence, the PRECISE-DAPT score should not be considered a static score
      as it might vary after the initial computation. It remains unknown, however, if the delta
      PRECISE-SCORE, reflecting the change in score between baseline and follow-up, might predict
      more reliably the long-term bleeding risk of PCI patients.

      The RE-SCORE registry is a multicenter study aimed at comparing the predictive value of the
      PRECISE-DAPT score assessed at time of discharge vs. the Delta PRECISE-DAPT score, as
      assessed every 3 months in PCI patients receiving DAPT.

      The primary end-point of the study is the occurrence of bleeding, as defined according to the
      criteria of the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC).
