  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate, in patients affected by early breast
      cancer, safety and feasibility of single fraction radiotherapy with Cyberknife R in
      preoperative setting, and to identify factors predictive for outcome based on biologic and
      clinical parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monocentric, open-label, single-arm phase II study evaluating safety and efficacy of
      neoadjuvant radiotherapy in early breast cancer patients. Patients eligible are women aged 50
      or more years old, affected by histologically proven invasive breast cancer, with positive
      hormonal receptors, grading 1 or 2, HER-2 negative, without lymphovascular invasion, and
      tumour size up to 2 cm (measured on mammography, ultrasound or magnetic resonance), negative
      clinical nodal status, eligible for BCS.
