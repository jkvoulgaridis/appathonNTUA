  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy and accounts for 1 percentage (%) of all
      cancers and for 10% of all hematologic malignancies. Participants with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma (RRMM) will be included in this study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of GSK2857916 monotherapy. Participants will be treated with GSK2857916 monotherapy until
      disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity and will be followed for Progression Free
      Survival and Overall survival. The participants will be randomized to receive either frozen
      GSK2857916 at the dose of 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 3.4 mg/kg Intravenous (IV).
      There will be an independent cohort of participants who will receive a lyophilized
      configuration of GSK2857916. The participants who discontinued from the study other than
      Progressive disease (PD), disease evaluation will continue to be performed at 3-week
      intervals until confirmed PD, death, start of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of
      consent, or end of the study whichever occurs first.

The assay involved screening, confirmation and titration steps. If serum samples tested positive in the screening assay, they were considered 'potentially positive' and were further analyzed for the specificity using the confirmation assay. Samples that confirmed positive in the confirmation assay were reported as 'positive'. Confirmed positive ADA samples were further characterized in the titration assay to quasi-quantitate the amount of ADA in the sample. Additionally, confirmed positive ADA samples were also tested in a validated neutralizing antibody assay to determine the potential neutralizing activity of the ADA.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The NEI-VFQ-25 consisted of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related constructs, plus an additional single-item general health rating question to assess the impact of ocular toxicity on visual function. Items were coded to a 0 to 100 scale and averaged to calculate domains. Domain scores ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores are better. Therefore, increase in score means improvement. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30-items with single and multi-item scales. These included five functional scales (physical functioning [PF], role functioning [RF], cognitive functioning [CF], emotional functioning [EF] and social functioning [SF]), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting [N/V]), a global health status (GHS)/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, appetite loss [AL] and financial difficulties [FD]). Response options are 1 to 4. Scores were averaged and transformed to 0 to 100, a high score for functional scales/ GHS/QoL represent better functioning ability or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales/ single items represent significant symptomatology. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. The module comprised of 20 questions that addressed four myeloma-specific HRQoL domains: disease symptoms (DS), side effects of treatment (SET), future perspective (FP) and body image (BI). Responses are 1 to 4. Scores were averaged and scales were transformed to 0 to 100 scale. A high score for disease symptoms and side effects of treatment represented a high level of symptomatology or problems, whereas a high score for future perspective and body image represented better outcomes. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocyte count (Lymph), neutrophil count (Neutro), platelet count (PC), and leukocyte count (leuko). The laboratory parameters were graded according to National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented. Only those participants with increase to grade 3 and increase to grade 4 have been presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters With Respect to the Normal Range</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: bicarbonate, direct bilirubin(D.Bil), calcium, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), total protein, urea or blood urea nitrogen(BUN),estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Baseline is latest pre-dose assessment(Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Number of participants with worst case clinical chemistry change from Baseline with respect to normal range are presented. Data was categorized as decrease to low (value below the lower LNR), increase to high (value above the upper LNR) and change to normal or NC. If values were unchanged (example: high to high), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the change to normal or NC category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had both decreased to low and increased to high during post Baseline. 3 out of 221participants did not receive any study treatment, were excluded from FSP.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters With Respect to the Normal Range</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: bicarbonate, direct bilirubin(D.Bil), calcium, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), total protein, urea or blood urea nitrogen(BUN),estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Baseline is latest pre-dose assessment(Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Number of participants with worst case clinical chemistry change from Baseline with respect to normal range are presented. Data was categorized as decrease to low (value below the lower LNR), increase to high (value above the upper LNR) and change to normal or NC. If values were unchanged (example: high to high), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the change to normal or NC category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had both decreased to low and increased to high during post Baseline. 3 out of 221participants did not receive any study treatment, were excluded from FSP.</description>
          <population>Full Safety Population. All the participants in the study were included in the analysis (95, 99 and 24 Participants), but only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: glucose(Gl), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), total bilirubin(T.Bil), creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), potassium (Pot), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Sod), phosphate (Ph) and urate. Values (Hyper and hypo) for Gl, Pot, Mg and Sod is presented. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. Grade1: mild; Grade2: moderate; Grade3: severe or medically significant; Grade4: life-threatening consequences. Baseline is latest pre-dose assessment(Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Data for worst-case PB is presented. Only those participants with increase to grade3 and increase to grade4 have been presented. 3 out of 221participants did not receive any study treatment, were excluded from FSP.</description>

Grade1: mild; Grade2: moderate; Grade3: severe or medically significant; Grade4: life-threatening consequences. Baseline is latest pre-dose assessment(Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Data for worst-case PB is presented. Only those participants with increase to grade3 and increase to grade4 have been presented. 3 out of 221participants did not receive any study treatment, were excluded from FSP.</description>
          <population>Full Safety Population. All the participants in the study were included in the analysis (95, 99 and 24 Participants), but only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</population>

        <description>Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Number of participants with worst case change from Baseline in pulse rate is presented. Data is categorized as: pulse rate 'decrease to &lt;60 beats per minute [bpm]', 'increase to &gt;100 bpm' and 'change to normal or no change'. If values were unchanged (example: increase to &gt;100 bpm to increase to &gt;100 bpm), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'change to normal or no change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had both 'decreased to &lt;60 bpm' and 'increased to &gt;100 bpm' during post Baseline. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Number of participants with worst case change from Baseline in body temperature are presented. Data is categorized as: body temperature 'decrease to &lt;=35 degrees celsius', 'increase to &gt;=38 degrees celsius' and 'change to normal or no change'. If values were unchanged (example: increase to &gt;=38 to increase to &gt;=38 degrees celsius), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'change to normal or no change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had both 'decreased to &lt;=35' and 'increased to &gt;=38 degrees celsius' during post Baseline. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Test Scores</title>
        <description>Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. BCVA score was assessed individually for each eye. BCVA test scores were categorized as no change/improved vision, possible worsened vision and definite worsened vision. No change/improved vision was defined as a change from Baseline &lt;0.12 Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) score; a possible worsened vision was defined as a change from Baseline &gt;=0.12 to &lt;0.3 logMAR score; a definite worsened vision was defined as a change from Baseline &gt;=0.3 logMAR score. Data for worst-case change from Baseline is presented. 3 participants out of 221 participants did not receive any study treatment and thus, were excluded from the Full Safety Population.</description>

        <description>Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Corneal epithelium findings like active edema, active opacity, corneal neovascularization (CN), corneal ulcer, epithelial microcystic edema (EME) and subepithelial were performed using a slit lamp. Number of participants with shift in corneal epithelium findings from no (Baseline) to yes (worst post-Baseline) are presented. 3 participants out of 221 participants did not receive any study treatment and thus, were excluded from the Full Safety Population.</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected for the determination of anti-GSK2857916 antibodies (ADA) using a validated electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay. The assay involved screening, confirmation and titration steps. If serum samples tested positive in the screening assay, they were considered 'potentially positive' and were further analyzed for the specificity using the confirmation assay. Samples that confirmed positive in the confirmation assay were reported as 'positive'. Confirmed positive ADA samples were further characterized in the titration assay to quasi-quantitate the amount of ADA in the sample. Additionally, confirmed positive ADA samples were also tested in a validated neutralizing antibody assay to determine the potential neutralizing activity of the ADA.</description>

        <description>The PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in participants on cancer clinical trials. It included symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE like blurred vision (BV), chills, constipation, decreased appetite (DA), fatigue, general pain (GP), heart palpitations (HP), mouth/throat (M/T) sores, nausea, nosebleed, shortness of breath (SB), vomiting and watery eyes (WE). Items were scored individually on a 0 to 4 scale for severity, frequency and interference. Number of participants with symptomatic AEs (those who had a maximum post-Baseline rating greater than 0, example; 1, 2, 3, or 4) measured by PRO-CTCAE are presented.</description>

        <title>Worst Change From Baseline in National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) Overall Composite Score</title>
        <description>The NEI-VFQ-25 consisted of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related constructs, plus an additional single-item general health rating question to assess the impact of ocular toxicity on visual function. Items were coded to a 0 to 100 scale and averaged to calculate domains. Domain scores ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores are better. Therefore, increase in score means improvement. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Worst Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a 12-item questionnaire designed to assess both the frequency of dry eye symptoms and their impact on vision-related functioning. The total OSDI score was calculated as (sum of scores for all questions answered*100) divided by (total number of questions answered*4). Domain scores ranged from 0 to 100; lower scores are better. Therefore, decrease in score from Baseline means improvement. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30-items with single and multi-item scales. These included five functional scales (physical functioning [PF], role functioning [RF], cognitive functioning [CF], emotional functioning [EF] and social functioning [SF]), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting [N/V]), a global health status (GHS)/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, appetite loss [AL] and financial difficulties [FD]). Response options are 1 to 4. Scores were averaged and transformed to 0 to 100, a high score for functional scales/ GHS/QoL represent better functioning ability or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales/ single items represent significant symptomatology. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ 20-item Multiple Myeloma Module (MY20) Score</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. The module comprised of 20 questions that addressed four myeloma-specific HRQoL domains: disease symptoms (DS), side effects of treatment (SET), future perspective (FP) and body image (BI). Responses are 1 to 4. Scores were averaged and scales were transformed to 0 to 100 scale. A high score for disease symptoms and side effects of treatment represented a high level of symptomatology or problems, whereas a high score for future perspective and body image represented better outcomes. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>
