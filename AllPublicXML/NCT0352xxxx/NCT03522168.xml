  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the long-term pathologic weight changes associated with multi-year
      risperidone or aripiprazole therapy in 3 - &lt;18-year-old children, who have varying durations
      of prior antipsychotic drug exposure from the start of study Month 0 (M0). This is critical
      because children appear to have greater vulnerability to antipsychotic-associated weight gain
      than adults, and obesity has significant effects on morbidity and mortality.

      Prospective, multi-site, Phase 4, longitudinal observational study designed to systematically
      collect robust longitudinal post-marketing safety and quality of life data about multi-year
      pediatric treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Screening may occur for up to 37 days
      prior to enrollment. Assessments will occur at in-person visits planned at months 0, 6, 12,
      18 and 24, and at unscheduled, in-person visits that study staff request when the participant
      switches or stops antipsychotic monotherapy with risperidone or aripiprazole, adds or stops
      treatment with a weight modifying agent, becomes pregnant, chooses to withdraw from the study
      prematurely or, has an ongoing Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that requires further assessment.
      Monthly remote interim contacts occurring between in-person visits will monitor for changes
      (other than dose related) in antipsychotic therapy or weight modifying treatments, potential
      SAEs, and potential pregnancy. The participant, his/her parent/guardian, and the
      participant's personal psychotropic- prescribing medical provider (PPPMP) will make any and
      all decisions related to antipsychotic medications; any other medications; and the
      participant's current mental state, developmental/psychiatric condition, and level of risk
      for potential harm to self or others independent of the study procedures and assessments.
      Study staff (SS) will share all lab results and changes in the participant's AEs or clinical
      presentation, which the study medical clinician (SMC) considers medically concerning based on
      the participant's assessment during in-person visits, with the participant's PPPMP. If an
      emergency safety concern is evident during an in-person visit, the SMC will immediately
      assess the participant, following medical standard-of- care procedures, to determine whether
      the participant is safe to leave the clinic or requires additional emergency care. If new or
      worsening symptoms are reported by the participant or parent/guardian during remote interim
      contacts, the participant and/or parent/guardian will be instructed to contact the PPPMP
      directly.

The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were designed to measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization in individuals aged 2 years and older. The main scales include physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Summary scores can also be utilized to measure change over time on a five point scale for 0 = &quot;Never a Problem&quot; to 5 = &quot;Almost Always a Problem&quot;. The guardian will be asked to complete the parent version for reporting on their child's quality of life.</description>

    <description>Relationship of risperidone or aripiprazole therapy to adaptive functioning and quality of life as assessed ) by the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and changes in the intensity or frequency of pre-existing behavioral problems indicated at M0 (baseline). This is a 21-item questionnaire with a categorical scale ranging from 1 (not at all a problem) to 5 (very much a problem) that assesses the caregiver's quality of life. It asks specifically about the caregiver's quality of life by assessing the impact of caring for a child with emotional and behavioral problems. The questions include information about disruption of family life and relationships; demands on time; negative, mental, and physical health effects for any family member; financial strain; feelings of sacrifice; disruption of social/community life; worry/guilt; fatigue/strain; and embarrassment.</description>

    <description>Relationship of risperidone or aripiprazole therapy to adaptive functioning and quality of life as assessed by the Delighted-Terrible Faces Scale (DTFS) and changes in the intensity or frequency of pre-existing behavioral problems indicated at M0 (baseline). The DTFS is a uni-dimensional, single item scale that will be used to assess the participant's perceived life quality. Faces expressing various feelings are depicted, and the participant is asked which face comes closest to expressing how he/she feels about his/her life over the past month. The participant can then select from the range of seven categorical faces depicting from one-delighted to seven-terrible expressions. This scale is included because it can be easily completed by participants with limited verbal and cognitive abilities as well as by very young children.</description>
