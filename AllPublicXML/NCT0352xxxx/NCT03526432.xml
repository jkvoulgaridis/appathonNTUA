    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, Phase II study using the combination of atezolizumab and bevicacizumab
      in women with advanced, recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. Safety and futility of
      this drug combination will be assessed to see what effect this treatment has on this patient
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study using atezolizumab and bevacizumab aims to study the objective tumor
      response in women with recurrent endometrial cancer. Drugs will be administered via IV every
      21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or loss of clinical benefit as
      determined by investigator. Subjects will receive routine cancer care as well as tests and
      procedures required for the purposes of this study. It is expected this combination will be
      produce an anti-cancer effect with manageable toxicities in this patient population.

             measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must
             be ≥ 10 mm in long axis when measured by CT, MRI, or caliper measurement by clinical
             exam. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.
