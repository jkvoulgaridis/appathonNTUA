      This phase 1b trial studies the side effects and best dose of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839
      hydrochloride (CB-839) in combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating
      participants with IDH-mutated diffuse or anaplastic astrocytoma. CB-839 may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or stopping them from spreading. Giving CB-839 with
      radiation therapy and temozolomide may work better in treating participants with IDH-mutated
      diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      CB-839 hydrochloride (HCl) when combined with radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ)
      in patients with newly diagnosed IDH-mutated diffuse astrocytoma (DA) and anaplastic
      astrocytoma (AA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Determine the safety and tolerability of
      RT/TMZ/CB-839 HCl in patients based on physician reported adverse event (AE) data.

      III. Estimate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS2) of RT/TMZ/CB-839 HCl in patients
      with IDH-mutated glioma based on the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria.

      IV. Estimate the 2-year overall survival (OS2) of RT/TMZ/CB-839 HCl in patients with
      IDH-mutated glioma based on RANO criteria.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the patient-reported tolerability of RT/TMZ/CB-839 HCl using the MD Anderson
      Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) instrument to measure self-reported symptom severity
      and interference with daily activities.

      II. Determine the neurocognitive impact of CB-839 HCl when used in combination with RT/TMZ.

      III. Determine the effect of CB-839 HCl/RT/TMZ on plasma oncometabolite levels of glutamine,
      glutamate, aspartate, asparagine, and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in patients with IDH-mutated
      glioma and associate the changes with disease response.

      IV. Determine the effect of CB-839 HCl/RT/TMZ on tumor 2-HG, glutamine, and glutamate MRS
      signals in patients with IDH-mutated glioma and associate the signal with disease response.

      V. Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CB-839 HCl when used alone and in combination with
      TMZ.

      VI. To perform molecular profiling assays on archived tumor tissue and peripheral blood,
      including, but not limited to, low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing
      (WES), and messenger RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in order to identify potential predictive and
      prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by which treatment may be assigned, and
      identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and ribonucleic
      acid (RNA)-based assessment platforms.

      VII. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.

      VIII. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA
      analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical
      Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of CB-839.

      Participants receive CB-839 PO twice daily (BID) 7 days a week, temozolomide PO once daily
      (QD) 7 days a week, and undergo RT 5 days a week for up to 5.5 weeks (diffuse astrocytoma) or
      6.5 weeks (anaplastic astrocytoma) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

             prior to start of trial treatment. The effects of CB-839 HCl on the developing human
             fetus are unknown. For this reason and because alkylating agents as well as TMZ are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for
             the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of CB-839 HCl
             administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to CB-839 HCl or TMZ.

          -  Patient must not have received prior radiation therapy to the brain. Prior radiation
             therapy to the head and neck is also excluded if radiation fields overlap.

          -  No prior use of Gliadel wafers.

          -  Patient must have no evidence of either infratentorial or spinal involvement with
             tumor.

          -  Patients who are unable to swallow tablets.

          -  Patients who are at risk for impaired absorption of oral medication including, but not
             limited to, refractory vomiting, gastric resection/bypass, and duodenal/jejunal
             resection.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they
             have completed therapy and are free of disease for more than 3 years.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CB-839 HCl is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             CB-839 HCl, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CB-839
             HCl. These potential risks may also apply to TMZ.
