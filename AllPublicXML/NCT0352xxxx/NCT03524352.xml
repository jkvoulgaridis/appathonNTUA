  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory digestive (IBD) disease medically treated
      with corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and biologics. Almost one third of
      UC patients will require surgical interventions because of fulminant colitis, dysplasia,
      cancer, or medical refractory diseases. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis (IPAA) is the current standard surgical intervention. Anastomotic leak, pouch
      failure, pelvic sepsis, and pouch ischemia can occur after the procedure, but the most common
      long-term complication is pouchitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition involving the ileal
      reservoir. Symptoms of pouchitis are increased stool frequency, urgency, incontinence, bloody
      stools, abdominal or pelvic discomfort, fatigue, malaise, and fever. The prevalence of
      pouchitis ranges from 23 to 46 %, with an annual incidence up to 40 %. Though the majority of
      initial cases of pouchitis are easily managed with a short course of antibiotics, in about 5
      to 15 % of cases, inflammation of the pouch becomes chronic with very few treatments
      available.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel therapy to transfer normal intestinal flora
      from a healthy donor to a patient with a medical condition potentially caused by disrupted
      homeostasis of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis. FMT has been widely used in refractory
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and recently it has gained popularity for treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous studies suggested that manipulating the
      composition of intestinal flora through antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotic achieved
      significant results for treating acute episodes of UC-associated pouchitis. However,
      currently there is no established effective treatment for chronic antibiotic dependent
      pouchitis. Our project aims to evaluate the delay of relapse in chronic recurrent pouchitis
      after FMT versus sham transplantation.
