  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and survival in the United Kingdom
      (UK) remains amongst the lowest in Europe. Surgery is the main method of managing early stage
      disease and is traditionally undertaken via conventional open surgery. However, over the last
      decade there has been a surge in the number of minimal access resections performed using
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). However, there remains a need for well-designed
      and conducted randomised controlled trial (RCT) to provide the evidence base for the wide
      spread uptake and delivery of this surgical approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uptake of surgery for lung cancer in the UK is low and minimal access surgery may be
      regarded as a more acceptable intervention (compared to open surgery) by patients, referring
      respiratory physicians and oncologists. However, a large multi-centre RCT is essential to
      inform patient and clinician decision making and influence surgical practice in the UK.

      The VIOLET study will compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of VATS
      lobectomy versus open surgery for treatment of lung cancer and will test the hypothesis that
      VATS surgery is superior to open surgery with respect to self-reported physical function five
      weeks after randomisation (approx. one month after surgery).

      Specific objectives are to estimate:

      A. The difference between groups in the average self-reported physical function at five
      weeks.

      B. The difference between groups with respect to a range of secondary outcomes including
      assessment of efficacy (hospital stay, pain, proportion and time to uptake of chemotherapy),
      measures of safety (adverse health events), oncological outcomes (proportion of patients
      upstaged to pN2 disease and disease free survival) and overall survival.

      C. The cost effectiveness of VATs and open surgery.

    <description>3 types of scales. Functioning scales which include physical functioning, role functioning, emotional function, cognitive functioning and social functioning. Symptom scales which include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dysponea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, financial difficulties.
An overall global health status/QoL All scales range between 0 and 100. For functioning scales, a high score indicates a high level of functioning. Similarly, a high global health status/QoL score indicates a high quality of life. For symptom scales, a high score indicates a high level of symptoms.</description>

    <description>VATS lobectomy is undertaken through one to four keyhole incisions without rib spreading. The use of 'rib spreading' is prohibited as this is the key intra-operative manoeuvre which disrupts tissues and causes pain (and is used in open surgery). The procedure is performed with videoscopic visualisation without direct vision. The hilar structures are dissected, stapled and divided. Endoscopic ligation of pulmonary arterial branches may be performed. The fissure is completed and the lobe of lung resected. Lymph node management is the same as described for open surgery. The incisions are closed in layers and may involve muscle, fat and skin layers. This definition of VATS lobectomy is a modification of CALGB 39802.</description>

    <description>Conventional open surgery is undertaken through a single incision +/- rib resection and with rib spreading. The operation is performed under direct vision with isolation of the hilar structures (vein, artery and bronchus) which are dissected, ligated and divided in sequence and the lobe of lung resected. The procedures may be undertaken using ligatures, over sewing or with staplers. Lymph node management is undertaken in accordance with the International Association of the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) recommendations where a minimal of 6 nodes / stations are removed, of which 3 are from the mediastinum that includes the subcarinal station. The thoracotomy is closed in layers starting from pericostal sutures over the ribs, muscle, fat and skin layers.</description>
