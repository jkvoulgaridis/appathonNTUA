  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of trastuzumab deruxtecan, which was approved by the FDA (in December 2019)
      for the treatment of HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer following two or
      more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.

      Participants will receive this study drug along with a cancer drug, an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor, anti-PD1, called nivolumab.

      The study will be done in two parts:

        -  Part 1 is to identify the recommended dose to use for treatment.

        -  Part 2 is to find out how well the combination works, and how safe and tolerable it is.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 1b (Part 1, Part 2) study is to assess the combination of a test
      drug (trastuzumab deruxtecan) with nivolumab in participants with HER2-expressing breast and
      urothelial cancer who had disease progression during or after prior therapies, did not
      respond to standard therapies, or for whom no standard therapy is available.

      The study will be performed in 2 parts.

        -  Part 1 is to test different doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan when given along with a
           fixed dose of nivolumab, and establish the most effective and the maximum/recommended
           tolerated dose, when used in combination with nivolumab

        -  Part 2 is to assess the efficacy and safety of this dose combination.

    <description>Part 1 will enroll participants meeting the eligibility criteria set up for any of the 4 cohorts of Part 2 specified below using a 3 + 3 + 3 design. Escalating/de-escalating doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan in combination with a flat dose of nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.
The recommended dose for expansion (RDE) will be calculated using data collected from this population in the first two cycles. These participants may continue to receive study treatment in subsequent cycles.</description>
