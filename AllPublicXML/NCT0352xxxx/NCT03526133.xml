  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and largely underdiagnosed disease. The standard
      method for the diagnosis of OSA is a complete night polysomnography (PSG). Simple methods for
      OSA diagnosis are necessary. The overnight oximetry with the oxygen desaturation index (ODI)
      has been largely investigated as a diagnostic test for OSA but its accuracy remains
      undefined. The aim of our study is to evaluate if an wireless polygraph (Oxistar) is accurate
      to diagnosis OSA in patients referred to a Sleep Lab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients referred to the sleep laboratory with suspected diagnosis of OSA
      underwent in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and simultaneously wireless polygraph. The PSG
      oximeter and the wireless polygraph were worn on different fingers of the same hand. All
      sleep studies were reviewed by one blind investigator according the 2017 American Academy of
      Sleep Medicine recommendations. The number of desaturations from wireless polygraph at the 3
      predefined threshold levels (of ODI-2%, ODI-3%, or ODI-4%) was derived automatically using
      proprietary algorithm. Moderate to severe OSA was defined as AHI â‰¥ 15 events/h. The
      diagnostic accuracy of ODI-2%, 3%, and 4% for the diagnosis of moderate-severe OSA were
      calculated for cut-off values from 1 to 20 desaturation events/h. The sleep actimetry was
      compared with the sleep stages from PSG, most of the statistical metrics applied for
      diagnosis were used to evaluate the applicability of this proposed method. Finally, the
      snoring events computed by the smartphone application were compared with the events heard by
      a specialist and the statistical comparison metrics were evaluated.

    <description>Actigraphy is the continuous measurement of activity or movement with the use of a small device called an actigraph. Periods of movement suggest wakefulness while those of relative stillness would likely correspond to sleep or quiescence. The Oxistar has a embeded actigraph whose data will be compared with the sleep stage scoring from polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep assessment. Epoch-by-epoch (30 seconds) agreement between the actigraph and PSG will be assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), Bland-Altman graph and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC)</description>

    <time_frame>Night during the polysomnography exam</time_frame>
    <description>Snoring is one of the signs suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea and has recently been considered as having great diagnostic potential. The smartphone application (app) through microphone performs the recording and the characteristics extraction of the patient's audio during sleep (register time). A multilayer perceptron (MPL) neural network classifies the event as snoring or non-snoring. Lastly, the amount of snoring occured is accounted and divided by the register time leading to the number of snoring/h. The agreement between snoring/h measured by the app and the heard by a specialist will be assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC).</description>
