      To determine the feasibility and safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, using a cell
      product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories, in subjects with
      metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior therapy
      with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist used alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4. Additionally, a
      second cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed
      after receiving prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist alone or in combination with
      anti-CTLA-4 will receive anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab.

      The objectives of this study have been expanded since its original registration to inlcude an
      additional cohort of patients (now designated Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Cohort 1 is the
      original group of patients described in the initial registration of the study.

      Cohort 1 Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility and safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, using a
           cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories, in subjects
           with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior
           therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist used alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4.

        -  To assess for evidence of clinical activity.

        -  To conduct a preliminary assessment of the TCR clonotypes present in marker positive
           CD8+ cells (4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1) versus marker-negative CD8+ T-cells early in the
           expansion cultures and compare to clonotypes late in the final product and in peripheral
           blood lymphocytes (PBL) 1 and 2 months post infusion.

      Cohort 2 Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility and safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, using a
           cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories, followed by
           anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in subjects with
           metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior
           therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of TIL/IL-2 therapy in combination with subsequent anti-PD-1
           Nivolumab and anti-CTLA-4 Ipilimumab by assessing the objective response rate by
           immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).

        -  To conduct a preliminary assessment of the TCR clonotypes present in marker positive
           CD8+ cells (e.g. 4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1) versus marker-negative CD8+ T-cells early in
           the expansion cultures and compare to clonotypes late in the final product and in
           peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) 1 and 2 months post infusion.
