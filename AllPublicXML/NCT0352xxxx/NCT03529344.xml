  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elderly population have and increased risk of loss of both muscle mass and function and
      is therefore recommended a higher protein intake than the healthy adult population. These
      age-related changes in muscle function may be explained by chronic low-grade inflammation and
      insulin resistance. Despite the recommendation of a higher protein intake, little is known
      about how different protein sources may affect the metabolic health in this population.
      Analysis of amino acid composition show that fish can be a good protein source for humans.
      Many fish species are today used as feed ingredients, rather than a protein source for
      humans. A few studies conducted in humans and rats show that proteins from fish may improve
      glucose tolerance, reduce inflammation and improve lipid metabolism, indicating that proteins
      from fish may not only serve as a valuable nutrient but could also hold specific health
      promoting properties.

      The present study will investigate the effects of a protein hydrolysate from blue whiting, a
      fish species normally used to produce fish meal for aquaculture industry, on glucose
      homeostasis, inflammation and serum lipids in elderly nursing home residents.
