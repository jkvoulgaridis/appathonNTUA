  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precision Care (PC) interventions, developed with guidance from a Community Advisory Board
      (CAB), will be piloted in a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) of approximately 100 eligible,
      consenting daily smokers in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) who are willing to
      make a quit attempt with medication and who reside in TN or MS. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 groups; (1) group one informs selection of medication with
      information on nicotine metabolism; (2) group two offers a genetically-informed lung cancer
      risk score, and (3) group 3 is Guideline-Based Care (GBC). All groups will be followed for 6
      months. All RCT participants will receive FDA-approved smoking cessation medication, be
      referred to the shared TN/MS state quitline, and be offered the NCI &quot;Clearing the Air&quot;
      standard intervention. The primary outcome is feasibility of delivering the precision
      interventions in the SCCS population, as evidenced by ability to recruit, engage, and retain
      participants through end of study. Secondary outcomes, for which the study is not powered,
      will include risk perceptions, use of quit aids, lung cancer screening among those who are
      eligible, and smoking cessation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of cancer and improved cessation
      strategies are needed. Biologically-informed precision treatment could benefit smokers but is
      understudied.

      Tennessee and Mississippi Smokers that responded to a previous survey indicating willingness
      to be contacted for a smoking cessation clinical trial will be assessed for eligibility via
      phone and, if eligible, provide verbal consent and administer a baseline survey. These
      participants will then mail in written consent, upon receipt of which their SCCS stored blood
      samples will be analyzed. During lab processing, a study tobacco counselor will call enrolled
      participants to assist with their quit plan and inform them of randomization status.
      Participants will complete telephone surveys at 1, 3, and 6 months. During the 6 month
      follow-up call, participants will also be given their previously-unreported lab results
      (i.e., information on nicotine metabolism or lung cancer risk). After receiving lab results,
      participants will complete a final brief questionnaire.
