      The Synovate Study is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study
      in patients with unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic New York esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) positive synovial sarcoma following first-line systemic
      anti-cancer therapy.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, whichever comes first, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Next Treatment (TTNT)</measure>
    <time_frame>From last dose of CMB305 to initiation of new therapy, assessed up to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>TTNT is defined as the time from randomization to the start of post-study treatment subsequent intervention: [TTNT = start date of subsequent intervention - randomization date + 1]. Subsequent intervention includes anticancer therapy, cancer-related surgery and local regional therapy. Participants who do not start any post-study treatment intervention will be censored at their last known date of being alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant Metastasis Free Survival (DMFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>DMFS is defined as the time from randomization to evidence of a new distant metastasis not documented at time of randomization: [DMFS = a new distant metastasis documented date - randomization date + 1]. Participants who do not have any new distant metastasis will be censored at their last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression, assessed up to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR defined by RECIST v1.1 will be summarized by the number and percent of subjects who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the investigator's assessment. ORR will be compared between treatment arms using a logistic regression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, assessed up to approximately 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed primarily based on reported adverse events (AEs), Medical Events of Interest (MEOIs), laboratory values, and concomitant medications reported from initiation of treatment with CMB305 or placebo.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL): EuroQol 5-Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) and EuroQol 5-Dimension Youth (EQ-5D-Y) Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L for participants ≥18 years of age or using the EQ-5D-Y for participants 12 to &lt;18 years of age. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system is comprised of 5 dimensions-mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort &amp; anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: not at all (level 1), mild (level 2), moderate (level 3), severe (level 4), extreme/leading to incapacity (level 5), with highest level corresponding to worst outcome. Participants indicated their health state by choosing the appropriate level from each dimension. The 5 digit health states thus obtained for each dimension were then converted into a single median index value using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group. In the EQ-VAS, participants recorded their health state on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>

        <title>Quality of Life (QoL): EuroQol 5-Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) and EuroQol 5-Dimension Youth (EQ-5D-Y) Questionnaires</title>
        <description>QoL evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L for participants ≥18 years of age or using the EQ-5D-Y for participants 12 to &lt;18 years of age. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system is comprised of 5 dimensions-mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort &amp; anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: not at all (level 1), mild (level 2), moderate (level 3), severe (level 4), extreme/leading to incapacity (level 5), with highest level corresponding to worst outcome. Participants indicated their health state by choosing the appropriate level from each dimension. The 5 digit health states thus obtained for each dimension were then converted into a single median index value using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group. In the EQ-VAS, participants recorded their health state on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
