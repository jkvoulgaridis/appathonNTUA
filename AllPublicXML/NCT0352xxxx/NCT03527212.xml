    <textblock>
      A double-masked, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adult
      patients with Dry Eye Disease (DED). Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either
      SJP-0035 0.001% or placebo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no approved products available anywhere worldwide for the treatment of
      Dry Eye Disease (DED) that directly affect the corneal epithelium. This study will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of SJP-0035 0.001%, compared with a placebo, on corneal healing.
      Patients meeting the requirements of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will administer 1 drop
      of the study drug/placebo 4 times per day for 4 weeks.
