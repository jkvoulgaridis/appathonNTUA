  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative depression symptom (PDS) is one of the common mental comorbidity, and
      influences the clinical outcomes and prognosis. However, there is no rapid acting treatment
      to deal with it during the limited hospital stay. This study aims to determine whether
      ketamine could improve the depressive symptom of peirioperative patients. It will also
      examine the safety for administrating ketamine as an antidepressant intraoperatively.
      Meanwhile, it will show if ketamine could improve anxiety, postoperative pain or delirium.
      This trial also will bring great concerns on patients with perioperative mental health and
      explore the measures to improve their psycho-related prognosis.
