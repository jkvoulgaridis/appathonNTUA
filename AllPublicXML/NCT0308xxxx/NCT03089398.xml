    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn which treatment option is better for patients who have
      multi-vessel coronary artery disease (blockages in more than one vessel supplying blood to
      the heart muscle). The treatment options this study will compare are: (1) Hybrid Coronary
      Revascularization [HCR] (a combination of surgery and catheter procedures to open up clogged
      heart arteries) and (2) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [PCI] (catheter procedures alone
      to open up clogged heart arteries). There are no new or &quot;experimental&quot; procedures being
      tested in this study: both HCR and PCI are well-established procedures and are regularly
      performed in patients who have coronary artery disease. But, the FDA has not approved the
      drug-eluting stents used in PCI for all types of coronary artery disease. We have received an
      Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA to use the drug-eluting stents in this trial in
      the same way that they are used in clinical practice. The study being proposed here will use
      rigorous scientific methods and should result in a very high level of certainty about which
      procedure is best for patients with coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), advances in coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and concomitant medical
      therapy, and the costs of revascularization have resulted in rising interest regarding the
      appropriate indications and alternatives for coronary revascularization.

      Hybrid coronary revascularization is the intended combination of CABG and PCI. The HCR
      strategy combines grafting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) coronary artery using
      the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and PCI of non-LAD coronary stenoses. Essentially,
      stents are substituted for saphenous vein grafts (SVG) for non-LAD lesions, and the surgical
      LIMA to LAD bypass is performed, ideally through a limited access, minimally traumatic
      approach.

      Unfortunately, the published data to date on HCR must be considered limited and hypothesis
      generating. Clinicians, payers, and patients are interested in the specific benefits of
      revascularization alternatives. HCR as a scientifically validated approach would have a major
      healthcare impact. The ability to deliver a new therapy for CAD that provides durability, but
      without the obligatory trauma and prolonged recovery time characteristic of conventional CABG
      would be a major advance in the field of cardiovascular medicine. The NHLBI-funded Hybrid
      Observational Study demonstrated that equipoise exists between the two coronary
      revascularization paradigms; however, a rigorously designed randomized clinical trial is now
      needed to provide sufficient evidence to guide clinical decision making for this important
      patient population.

      This trial is a prospective, multi-center randomized comparative effectiveness trial of HCR
      compared to multi-vessel PCI in patients with multi-vessel CAD involving the LAD or LM
      territories. The trial is designed as a &quot;large, simple&quot; trial, and some baseline,
      procedure-related and short-term outcomes data collection will be extracted from existing
      registry data (Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] Data Registry). The overall objective of
      this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Hybrid Coronary Revascularization
      (HCR) compared to multi-vessel PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with
      multi-vessel coronary artery disease involving the Left Main and/or Left Anterior Descending
      arteries.

      The primary objective the trial is to determine whether hybrid coronary revascularization is
      associated with a reduction in Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events [MACCE]
      compared to PCI with DES.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the impact of HCR compared to PCI on health status
      and quality of life.

    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The current sample size of 200 patients will not provide sufficient power to test the original null hypothesis of the trial. However, it will allow for an estimate of the MACCE rate in the two groups. A 2-year follow-up will be used to capture and understand the difference in MACCE between the two procedures. This reasoning is based on the NHLBI-funded Hybrid Revascularization Observational Study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01121263), which enrolled 200 HCR and 98 multi-vessel PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES) patients, and demonstrated similar risk-adjusted MACCE rates over the first 12 months following the intervention but divergence by approximately 18 months of followup.
Therefore, it is important to continue the follow-up of the 200 randomized patients to at least 24 months. Of note, some patients who were enrolled early in the trial will have up to 3 years of follow-up data collected by the time the final patient randomized completes the 2-year time point.</description>

    <measure>Safety Evaluation</measure>

    <description>We will compare pre- and post-revascularization values between the two groups: Hemoglobin (g/dL), Creatinine (mg/dL), CK-MB (IU/L) and/or Troponin I or T (ng/mL) (some data from the STS Registry). Antiplatelets and anticoagulants, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists and statins used prior to, during and within 24 hours of the procedure will be analyzed. Data on intra- and peri-procedural AEs in the PCI and HCR groups, including bleeding, will also be available. Information about the index procedure(s) and hospitalization for patients receiving HCR will be extracted from STS, including LOS, transfusions, repeat procedures, and discharge disposition. Data on MACCE events that occur during study-procedure related hospitalizations will be extracted from STS. The Imaging Core Laboratory will analyze the pre and post procedural angiograms. Patients randomized to the HCR procedure and received CABG first will also have data on the patency of the LIMA to LAD graft.</description>

               -  Multivessel CAD involving the LAD (proximal or mid) and/or LM (ostial, mid-shaft
                  or distal) with at least 1 other epicardial coronary artery requiring treatment
                  (LCX or RCA), OR

               -  Single vessel disease involving the LAD and a major diagonal, with both requiring
                  independent revascularization with at least one stent if randomized to HCR and
                  stents for both the LAD and diagonal if randomized to multivessel PCI Note: If
                  the patient qualifies based only on a LM lesion, then there must be involvement
                  of the distal bifurcation (Medina 1,1,1) intended for treatment with a 2-stent
                  approach (separate stents into the LAD and LCX) if randomized to PCI. However, if
                  the patient also has non-LM disease in the RCA and/or non-ostial LAD and/or
                  non-ostial LCX that requires separate treatment, any LM lesion is a valid
                  criterion for enrollment, whether LM ostial, shaft or distal bifurcation disease,
                  and any strategy of treating the LM may be employed, including not treating the

                  lesion in the RCA or LCX that also requires treatment, the LAD-Dg disease can
                  then be treated in any fashion (2-stents, a provisional approach, or the Dg not
