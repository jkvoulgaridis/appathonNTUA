  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether laser laryngeal surgery can be safely and
      potentially more effectively performed without the use of tracheal intubation or jet
      ventilation, under completely tubeless conditions. The patient's gas exchange will be
      supported by rapid insufflation of high-flow oxygen through specialized nasal cannula: the so
      called Transnasal Humidified Rapid- Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE).
