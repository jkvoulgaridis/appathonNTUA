    <textblock>
      GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to
      develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this study is to validate the
      ability of the pre-specified GRAIL Test to detect breast cancer and other invasive cancers,
      including hematologic malignancies, that will occur within one year of the first study blood
      draw.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detection of early stage cancer may be possible through analysis of circulating cell-free
      nucleic acids (cfNAs) shed into the blood by tumors. GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing
      (based on broad genomic coverage and deep sequencing) of cfNAs, combined with machine
      learning, to develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this prospective,
      multi-center, observational cohort study is to validate an assay for the early detection of
      breast cancer and other invasive cancers, including hematologic malignancies. The study will
      collect blood samples from participants within 28 days of their screening mammogram.
      Additional blood samples will also be collected for a subset of participants. For
      participants who receive a cancer diagnosis during the study, archival tissue samples will be
      collected.

    <description>This is a prospectively enrolling cohort study with a pre-specified molecular analysis plan. A stratified case-cohort design will be employed to select cancer cases and non-cancer subjects who will be assayed. All cases of cancer (breast and non-breast cancer) will be selected. A random subset of the overall study cohort will also be selected.</description>
