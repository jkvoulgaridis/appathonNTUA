  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study represents a crucial and important stage in translating basic research to
      strategies for treating nicotine dependence. The investigation addresses an important public
      health issue by testing an intervention - informed by basic research - that may lead to a
      more effective and efficient treatment for smokers. The expected findings should provide
      initial effect size data for the addition of isradipine to an integrated
      psychosocial/behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention for smokers, and
      thus provide the necessary data for a large-scale follow-up trial.

      The current protocol will apply a pharmacologic augmentation strategy informed by basic
      research in animal models of addiction. Our goal is to evaluate the enhancing effect of
      isradipine, an FDA-approved calcium channel blocker, on the extinction of craving—a key
      mechanism of drug relapse after periods of abstinence. To activate craving robustly in human
      participants, we will use multimodal smoking cues including novel 360° video environments
      developed for this project and delivered through consumer virtual reality headsets. Adult
      smokers will take either isradipine or placebo and complete the cue exposure protocol in a
      double-blind randomized control trial. In order to test the hypothesis that isradipine will
      enhance retention of craving extinction, participants will repeat cue exposure in a
      medication-free state 24 h later. The study will be implemented in a primary care setting
      where adult smokers receive healthcare, and smoking behavior will be tracked throughout the
      trial with ecological momentary assessment.
