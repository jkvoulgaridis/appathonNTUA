  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab versus Cyclophosphamide in
      Subjects with Idiopathic Refractory Scleritis.

      The term scleritis describes a chronic inflammation that involves the outermost cost and
      skeleton of the eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as either anterior or posterior
      based on the principal location of the inflammation. Thirty to forty percent of scleritis
      cases are associated with systemic autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Infectious causes including herpes virus and varicella
      zoster account for 5 to 10% of patients. The remaining 50% of cases are classified as
      idiopathic.

      CIRIS, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing infliximab to
      cyclophosphamide in refractory idiopathic scleritis. There is no firm evidence or randomized
      controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory
      idiopathic scleritis. If left untreated or insufficiently treated, scleritis can progress to
      peripheral ulcerative keratitis, uveitis and glaucoma. Visual loss occurs in approximately
      10% of patients with anterior scleritis and in up to 75% of patients with posterior
      scleritis. The incidence of burden in ocular inflammation (uveitis and scleritis) has been
      dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of
      whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious
      scleritis. Contrasting with other immunosuppressors, cyclophosphamide and infliximab act
      rapidly and are highly effective in steroid's sparing.

      Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in idiopathic refractory
      scleritis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or
      dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any study-specific
             procedures

          2. Male or female, subject aged &gt; or = 18 at Screening

          3. Weight 40 - 120 kg at Screening

          4. Diagnosis of anterior idiopathic scleritis or anterior and posterior idiopathic
             scleritis at least one eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as anterior based on
             the principal location of the inflammation. Clinically, anterior scleritis can be
             divided into diffuse, nodular or necrotizing types.

          5. Active disease: Currently uncontrolled scleritis disease. Uncontrolled scleritis
             disease is defined as (at least) a 2 in sclera inflammation, according to the grading
             system defined by Sene for sclera inflammation (gradings from 0 to 4).

          6. Refractory disease: At screening, subjects must be receiving oral corticosteroids (&gt;10
             mg/day prednisone equivalent and &lt;80 mg/day) and at least one other immunosuppressive
             for more than 4 months (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetyl,
             cyclosporine, leflunomide) or be intolerant to such immunosuppressive therapies.

          7. Topical corticosteroids and/or NSAIDs are permitted provided the dose regimen has been
             stable for 2 weeks prior to Screening and remains stable throughout the study. Topical
             treatment for cycloplegia is permitted.

             Page 40 sur 129

          8. Chest X-ray results (postero-anterior and lateral) within 12 weeks prior to the
             randomization visit with no evidence of active Tuberculosis, active infection, or
             malignancy.

          9. For female subjects of child-bearing age, a negative serum pregnancy test. A woman is
             considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until
             becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods
             include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
             medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal
             range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal
             contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of
             amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient (definition of the Clinical Trial
             Facilitation Group).

         10. For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use adequate contraceptive
             measures to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during
             the study. For women in period of childbearing adequate contraceptive measures include
             hormonal methods used for two or more cycles prior to Screening and 6 months after the
             last dose treatment should be used (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive
             patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge,
             diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly, or condom used in
             conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine devices (IUD),
             sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized
             partner), and abstinence. For men who are sexually active with a women in period of
             childbearing adequate contraceptive measures from screening to 6 months after the last
             dose treatment should be used (For men: barrier methods (condom used in conjunction
             with contraceptive foam or jelly), sterilization (vasectomy) and abstinence. For his
             partner: hormonal methods (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, or
             contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm
             used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine devices (IUD),
             sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation)).

         11. A negative QuantiFERONÂ®-Tuberculosis (TB) test result or, in the event that their
             QuantiFERONÂ®-TB test result at Screening is positive, all subjects must agree to
             complete an INH treatment course of at least 6 months.

         12. Affiliated to the French social security system.

        Exclusion Criteria:
