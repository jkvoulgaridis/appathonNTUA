  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and North America. The aim of the trial is to compare
      the effect of semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once-weekly versus placebo as add-on to sodium glucose
      co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) monotherapy or in combination with either metformin or
      sulfonylurea on glycaemic control after 30 weeks of treatment in subjects with type 2
      diabetes. Subjects will remain on their pre-trial medication.

    <measure>Change in Scores for Selected Patient Reported Outcomes: Short-form Health Survey (SF-36v2TM): Total Scores (Physical Component and Mental Component) and Scores From the 8 Domains</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire, SF-36v2TM was evaluated at week 30. The SF-36v2â„¢ questionnaire was used to assess the overall health related quality of life of participants. This questionnaire contains 36 items and measures the individual overall health related quality of life on 8 domains: 1) Physical functioning, 2) Role functioning, 3) Bodily pain, 4) General health, 5) Vitality, 6) Social functioning, 7) Role emotional and 8) Mental health. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 to either 2, 3, 5, or 6; each item score is then converted to a scale of 0-100, representing the percentage of total possible score achieved and with higher scores indicating a higher health status; items on the same scale are then averaged to obtain the 8 scale scores. Physical component summary (PCS) includes domains 1-4 and mental component summary (MCS) includes domains 5-8. Higher PCS and MCS scores on a scale of 0-100 indicate a higher health status.</description>

Each item is scored on a 7- point Likert scale ranging from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied). Items evaluating 6 aspects (items 3-8) of treatment satisfaction are summed to produce a total treatment satisfaction score; DTSQ status total scores range from 0-36, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction; the perceived frequency of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia items are scored separately, with lower scores indicating better perceived blood glucose control.</description>

        <title>Change in Scores for Selected Patient Reported Outcomes: Short-form Health Survey (SF-36v2TM): Total Scores (Physical Component and Mental Component) and Scores From the 8 Domains</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire, SF-36v2TM was evaluated at week 30. The SF-36v2â„¢ questionnaire was used to assess the overall health related quality of life of participants. This questionnaire contains 36 items and measures the individual overall health related quality of life on 8 domains: 1) Physical functioning, 2) Role functioning, 3) Bodily pain, 4) General health, 5) Vitality, 6) Social functioning, 7) Role emotional and 8) Mental health. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 to either 2, 3, 5, or 6; each item score is then converted to a scale of 0-100, representing the percentage of total possible score achieved and with higher scores indicating a higher health status; items on the same scale are then averaged to obtain the 8 scale scores. Physical component summary (PCS) includes domains 1-4 and mental component summary (MCS) includes domains 5-8. Higher PCS and MCS scores on a scale of 0-100 indicate a higher health status.</description>

        <title>Change in Scores for Selected Patient Reported Outcomes: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ): Treatment Satisfaction Score (Sum of 6 of 8 Items) and the 8 Items Separately</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in PRO questionnaire, DTSQ was evaluated at week 30. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period. The DTSQ measures satisfaction with diabetes treatment. The DTSQ consists of 8 items evaluating 6 aspects of treatment satisfaction and 2 perceived recent event rates of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia. Each item is scored on a 7- point Likert scale ranging from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied). Items evaluating 6 aspects (items 3-8) of treatment satisfaction are summed to produce a total treatment satisfaction score; DTSQ status total scores range from 0-36, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction; the perceived frequency of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia items are scored separately, with lower scores indicating better perceived blood glucose control.</description>

      <time_frame>Week 0 to week 30 (treatment period) + 42 days (follow-up period). All the reported adverse events (AEs) are TEAEs.</time_frame>
      <desc>Results are based on the SAS. Treatment with semaglutide or placebo followed a fixed dose escalation. The maintenance dose of semaglutide 1.0 mg was reached after 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.25 mg, followed by 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.5 mg. The same fixed dose escalation scheme was followed for placebo, with respective dose matching volume. Hence, the adverse events are combinedly presented under 2 respective reporting groups, â€˜semaglutide 1.0 mg and placeboâ€™.</desc>
