  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy for the treatment
      of dry eye disease. One eye of the participant will be randomized to receive the IPL
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) affects tears and the front surface of the eye. Patients who have DED
      can experience symptoms of discomfort, blurry vision, redness, and pain. DED can also cause
      tears to become unstable which could result in damage to the front surface of the eye.

      There are two types of DED. The one the investigators are studying is called evaporative dry
      eye disease. This type of DED occurs because the pores on the eyelids are not functioning
      properly. In preliminary studies, a new treatment called Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) has shown
      promise to reduce signs and symptoms of evaporative DED. IPL is a non-invasive and non-laser
      light treatment that was approved in 1995 by the FDA for dermatology. It is commonly used for
      treatment of facial rosacea, acne, and hair, wrinkle and lesion removal. It is not currently
      approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. This treatment is thought to provide relief of
      evaporative DED symptoms and improve the expression of the pores on the edge of the eyelid.

    <measure>Change in Scores of the Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire at each visit before they received the IPL and sham treatments. The questionnaire is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 meaning normal and the higher scores representing greater dry eye disease severity. This questionnaire has been validated to assess ocular symptoms for a patient but cannot be separated by eye. Therefore, the results cannot be given by treatment vs. sham, but for the participant overall.</description>

    <description>Participants will have one eye randomized to receive the intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy treatment while their other eye will receive the sham treatment.

    <description>Participants will have the other eye randomized to receive a sham treatment. The sham treatment will be conducted by placing the intense pulsed light (IPL) device to approximately 15 areas around the eye, lower eyelid, cheek, side of nose and temple without delivery of the light. The sham treatment will mimic the IPL treatment but no light will be delivered. Sham treatment will be administered 4 times throughout the study.</description>

            <description>Participants had one eye randomized to receive the intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy treatment in the right or left eye, while their other eye received the sham treatment. 14 eyes received IPL, and 14 eyes received the sham treatment. Throughout the study, the IPL treatment eye was always the same for each individual.
Participants received approximately 15 light spots to areas around the eye, lower eyelid, cheek, side of the nose and temple. The energy level was based on skin type. IPL was administered 4 times throughout the study.
Intense Pulsed Light Therapy: Intense pulsed light therapy is a non-invasive and non-laser light treatment that was approved in 1995 by the FDA for dermatology. Participants received a total of 4 treatments over the course of the study.</description>

            <groups_desc>The primary study outcome of pre to post change in TBUT within the treated eye and also the untreated, control eye dictated the use of a paired statistical approach to sample size estimation. Clinically relevant pre to post TBUT increase of 3 seconds with a standard deviation of 4.5 seconds was used. Type I and II error estimates used were standard for a non-pivotal study, 0.05 &amp; 0.20. The estimated the sample size needed detect this difference in TBUT is 27 subjects.</groups_desc>

The null hypothesis to be tested is one of no change from pre- to post treatment, with a Type I error probability of 0.05 for the primary outcome assessment. The pattern of change over the 4 treatment visits in these continuous variables will be assessed using mixed, linear regression.

        <description>Patients completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire at each visit before they received the IPL and sham treatments. The questionnaire is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 meaning normal and the higher scores representing greater dry eye disease severity. This questionnaire has been validated to assess ocular symptoms for a patient but cannot be separated by eye. Therefore, the results cannot be given by treatment vs. sham, but for the participant overall.</description>
