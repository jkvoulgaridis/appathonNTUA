  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMP-001-002 is a Phase 1b study of CMP-001 administered to participants with advanced
      melanoma who are either receiving pembrolizumab, or who have previously received an
      anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy
      for advanced melanoma, and who have not responded (that is, immunotherapy resistant).

      This study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase

        -  Dose Escalation Phase will be conducted to assess and identify a recommended phase 2
           dose (RP2D) of CMP-001 for subcutaneous (SC) administration

        -  The Dose Expansion Phase is intended to further characterize the safety,
           pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the RP2D of CMP-001
           administered SC in combination with pembrolizumab

      Part 2 will assess the safety and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of CMP-001,
      administered both SC and intratumoral (IT) when given in combination with pembrolizumab.

      Participants will continue treatment with CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab as long
      as they do not experience unacceptable toxicities and when continued treatment, is in the
      participant's best interest according to the Investigator.

        are not feasible and in whom, based on the Investigator's judgement, SC injection is the
        only viable route of CMP-001 administration. Participants with lesions that are easily
        accessible for IT injections are not eligible to participate in Part 1. Participants
        enrolled into Part 2 must have at least one tumor lesion with a longest diameter of &gt;/= 0.5
        cm amenable for IT injection of CMP-001.

                  millimeter (mm^3), platelet count &gt;/=75,000/mm^3 and hemoglobin concentration &gt;/=
                  8.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL).

               2. Liver function: total bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5 times the upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) of each institution, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
                  aminotransferase &lt;=3 times the ULN range of each institution.

               3. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &lt;=2.0 times the ULN range of each institution.

               4. Renal function: serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 times the ULN range of each institution.

          -  The participant must sign a written informed consent form prior to the initiation of
             any study procedures. Adult participants unable to provide written informed consent on
             their own behalf will not be eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received investigational therapy (that is, small molecule or biologic) within 30 days
             prior to the start of CMP-001 dosing on Week 1 Day 1. However, if an investigational
             drug has a short half-life, a reduced wash out period may be acceptable upon
             permission given by the Sponsor.

          -  Received treatment with anti- cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
             (anti-CTLA-4) antibody within 30 days prior to the start of CMP-001 dosing on Week 1
             Day 1.

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV).

          -  Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Participants
             who developed autoimmune disorders of Grade &lt;=3 may enroll if the disorder has
             resolved to Grade &lt;=1 and the participant has been off systemic steroids at doses
             greater than (&gt;) 10 milligrams per day (mg/day) for at least 2 weeks.

             10 mg/day prednisone; replacement doses, topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational
             steroids are permitted. Participants who have a history of adrenal insufficiency and
             are receiving greater than 10 mg/day systemic steroids may be eligible but only after
             Sponsor consultation. Participants who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of
             &lt;=10 mg/day do not need to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment.

          -  Active (that is, symptomatic or growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
             Participants with CNS metastases are eligible for the trial if: a) the metastases have

             &gt;10 mg/day and is neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening; c)

          -  Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the participant unable to
             cooperate or participate in the trial.

          -  Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of screening, including but not
             limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
