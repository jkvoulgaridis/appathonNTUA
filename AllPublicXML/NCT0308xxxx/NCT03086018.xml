  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of the hearing aid under laboratory
      as well as everyday conditions. In addition, the performance data of the hearing aid are
      compared with a Bernafon hearing aid already available on the market.

      The hearing aids are adapted according to the user requirements. The data collected in the
      study is intended to show that the benefit of the hearing aid being examined is identical or
      better than the current CE-marked hearing aid. A further aim is to improve the adaptation of
      the hearing device in such a way that the benefit for people with hearing impairments can be
      increased.

    <textblock>
      The reason for this study is to evaluate a new hearing aid. The goal is to evaluate the
      audiological performance and usability as well as features and functions in comparison to the
      hearing aid already CE marked. Furthermore, it is important to identify unexpected or
      unwanted behavior from the devices. This clinical investigation is a validation testing and
      is designed to evaluate the new hearing instrument system. As human subjects are involved,
      this validation test falls under the definition of a clinical investigation. The validation
      addresses the performance of the device with new functionality, and additionally addresses
      whether the end user can understand speech as well as with the current marketed device.

      End users will be tested in the lab with speech tests and usability tests. They will also
      participate in field tests after which they will answer questionnaires concerning their
      experience with the instruments. Evaluating the overall performance of the hearing instrument
      is important to verify that the end user is satisfied with the device and that all user
      requirements are fulfilled. Many of the features available in the new device have already
      been validated and are used in devices currently on the market.

      The purpose of this research is to show that the performance of the new device is as good as
      or better than the current device. Furthermore, speech should not be negatively affected with
      the addition of new features, the usability of the devices (that end users are able to handle
      the devices) should be as good as the current device, and there should be no artifacts or
      unwanted noises. Some measurements serve as quality control prior to product launch.

    <measure>Speech Intelligibility Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour period of speech testing during a lab appointment after wearing the devices for approximately 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Speech test scores will be measured with speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of speech in noise in three conditions: unaided, aided with the current device, and aided with the new device. The score is measured by the the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which 50% of words in a sentence list are correctly repeated. The speech is always presented at 65 dB and the background noise varies to maintain the 50% correct. A lower SNR score indicates a better score. The maximum score will be 15 dB and the minimum will be -5 dB.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Performance of Aided Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>A 2 week time period during which they will wear the devices and answer questionnaires about the experience.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective performance for the new device will be measured with the APHAB questionnaire (Abbreviated Hearing Aid Benefit Profile). The questionnaire is a list of 24 statement that the subjects must agree or disagree with using a scale of units from A to G (A being Always and G being Never). Each letter has a corresponding score used for the calculation: A receives 99, B receives 87, C receives 75, D receives 50, E receives 25, F recevies 12, and G receives 1.
An average for each subscale is calculated, and a global or overall score can be calculated by taking the mean of the three positive subscales (Ease of communication, Background noise, and Reverberation). For these three subscales a higher score indicates a better performance. The highest possible score is 99 and the lowest is 1. The fourth scale (Aversiveness) is a negative scale meaning that a higher score means a worse performance. The highest possible score is 99 and the lowest is 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech Intelligibility Performance With New Feature</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour period of speech testing during a lab appointment after wearing the devices for approximately 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Word recognition test scores will be measured with two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels in percent correct in two conditions, with the new feature on and the new feature off.
The test is a speech test with the words stated in noise at either a 5 dB SNR or a 15 dB SNR. The subject is presented with 5 rhyming words and must choose which word they heard. It is a forced choice meaning that the test will not continue with the next word until they've made a selection. They cannot leave any blank and are not penalized for wrong answers. The score is a percentage of words correct with the maximum score being 100% and the minimum being 0%. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Handling/Usability Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour period of usability testing with tasks and questionnaires.</time_frame>
    <description>The usability of the new device will be measured with a 3-point rating scale used by the tester to evaluate tasks performed by the end user as well as questionnaires and interviews.
The questionnaire asks subjects to perform tasks, and the clinician rates the ease with which they complete the tasks. 2 is the highest score meaning that they could complete without help, 1 means that they required some assistance, and 0 means that they could not complete the task. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Events</measure>
    <time_frame>A 2 hour period of interviews and questionnaires after having worn the devices for approximately 2 weeks and keeping a diary to make notes of device behavior.</time_frame>
    <description>Events will be measured by the reporting of unexpected sounds or behavior of the device through questionnaires, diaries, and interviews. The number of events reported including AEs related to the device will be used to measure the outcome. Less events is a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Speech Intelligibility Performance</title>
        <description>Speech test scores will be measured with speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of speech in noise in three conditions: unaided, aided with the current device, and aided with the new device. The score is measured by the the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which 50% of words in a sentence list are correctly repeated. The speech is always presented at 65 dB and the background noise varies to maintain the 50% correct. A lower SNR score indicates a better score. The maximum score will be 15 dB and the minimum will be -5 dB.</description>

        <title>Subjective Performance of Aided Benefit</title>
        <description>The subjective performance for the new device will be measured with the APHAB questionnaire (Abbreviated Hearing Aid Benefit Profile). The questionnaire is a list of 24 statement that the subjects must agree or disagree with using a scale of units from A to G (A being Always and G being Never). Each letter has a corresponding score used for the calculation: A receives 99, B receives 87, C receives 75, D receives 50, E receives 25, F recevies 12, and G receives 1.
An average for each subscale is calculated, and a global or overall score can be calculated by taking the mean of the three positive subscales (Ease of communication, Background noise, and Reverberation). For these three subscales a higher score indicates a better performance. The highest possible score is 99 and the lowest is 1. The fourth scale (Aversiveness) is a negative scale meaning that a higher score means a worse performance. The highest possible score is 99 and the lowest is 1.</description>

        <description>Word recognition test scores will be measured with two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels in percent correct in two conditions, with the new feature on and the new feature off.
The test is a speech test with the words stated in noise at either a 5 dB SNR or a 15 dB SNR. The subject is presented with 5 rhyming words and must choose which word they heard. It is a forced choice meaning that the test will not continue with the next word until they've made a selection. They cannot leave any blank and are not penalized for wrong answers. The score is a percentage of words correct with the maximum score being 100% and the minimum being 0%. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
