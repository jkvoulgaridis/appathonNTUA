  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in treating advanced
      esophageal cancer. Blood or tissue samples will also be collected for research purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical study of ex-vivo selected, engineered, and expanded PD-1
      knockout T cells from autologous origin. 16 advanced esophageal cancer patients are planned
      to receive two cycles of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells infusion. Immunological markers are
      analyzed as well.

    <description>Peripheral blood lymphocytes will be collected and Programmed cell death 1(PD-1) gene will be knocked out by CRISPR Cas9 in the laboratory (PD-1 Knockout T cells). The lymphocytes will be selected and expanded ex vivo and reinfused back into patients. To avoid allergic reactions, 50 mg hydrocortisone was intravenously injected into the patient 30 min before cells infusion every time. Best supportive care was also provided for patients.
A total of 1 to 10 x 10^9 PD-1 Knockout T cells will be infused each cycle. Patients continued receiving treatment unless they had unacceptable adverse effects, or progressive disease confirmed by CT or they withdrew consent.</description>
