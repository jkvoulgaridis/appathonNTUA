      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Zelegent, Inc. Elevo™ Kit Snoring Intervention Device
      (a minimally invasive, barbed, absorbable suture implant) in the reduction of simple snoring
      through subjective evaluation of snoring and objective snoring sound analysis.

      The Zelegent, Inc. Elevo™ Kit Snoring Intervention Device is intended to reduce or eliminate
      simple snoring in the target patient population via minimally invasive implantation of
      specialized barbed, absorbable sutures in the soft palate for the purpose of stiffening by
      way of shortening and lifting the soft palate thereby addressing the root cause of snoring.

    <time_frame>Thirty (30) days post device intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between the two following parameters: (1) Percent (%) of snoring events comprised of the sum of types (I + II) and comprised of the sum of types (III + IV + WL) pre-treatment (2) Percent (%) of snoring events comprised of the sum of types (I + II) and comprised of the sum of types (III + IV + WL) post-treatment.
Key to Snoring Event Types (as categorized by SNAP Diagnostics, Inc.) Type I: Mostly Palate Type II: Mostly Palate + tongue Type III: Sound, but no particular pattern, can originate from lungs or from upper airway Type IV: High pitch, more diffuse, similar to asthma Type WL: Wheezing-like. Resulting value of Measure #1 is in percents (%). Note: Measure #1 will be repeated via Home Sleep Study at Day 90 post-treatment and will be repeated via Home Sleep Study at Day 180 post-treatment.</description>

    <description>Difference between the two following parameters: (1) Average loudness ratio (loudness is measured in decibels [dB]) of events comprised of the sum of types (I + II) and comprised of the sum of types (III + IV + WL) pre-treatment (2) Average loudness ratio of events comprised of the sum of types (I + II) and comprised of the sum of types (III + IV + WL) post-treatment.

    <measure>Mean within-subject change of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) from pre-treatment with the device (&quot;Elevo Kit&quot;) to post-treatment with the device (&quot;Elevo Kit&quot;).</measure>
    <time_frame>Thirty (30) days post device intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between the two following parameters: (1) PSQI Score pre-treatment (2) PSQI Score post-treatment. Resulting value is an absolute number. The PSQI is a self-report (i.e., patient-reported outcome) questionnaire that is comprised of nineteen (19) individual items that create seven (7) components that produce one (1) global score. The PSQI takes 5 - 10 minutes to complete. Note: the PSQI questionnaire will be repeat-administered at Day 90 post device intervention and will be repeat-administered at Day 180 post device intervention.</description>

    <measure>Mean within-subject change of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) from pre-treatment with the device (&quot;Elevo Kit&quot;) to post-treatment with the device (&quot;Elevo Kit&quot;).</measure>
    <time_frame>Thirty (30) days post device intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between the two following parameters: (1) ESS Score pre-treatment (2) ESS Score post-treatment. Resulting value is an absolute number. The ESS is a self-report (i.e., patient-reported outcome) scale that is intended to measure daytime sleepiness and that is measured by use of a very short questionnaire. Note: the ESS questionnaire will be repeat-administered at Day 90 post device intervention and will be repeat-administered at Day 180 post device intervention.</description>
