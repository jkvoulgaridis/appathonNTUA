      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of MIRA in classifying women with
      dense breast tissue for supplemental breast MRI. To assess the effectiveness of MIRA for
      correctly classifying women with breast cancer and to evaluate the safety of the device.

      In women above 30 years old who are undergoing MRI or are scheduled for image-guided needle
      biopsy due to lesions detected by other imaging modalities.

    <description>The positive predictive value (and the amount of false-positive diagnoses) of MIRA will be determined using positive MRI (MRI BI-RADS &gt;= 3) as a reference test in cohort of women with negative (Mammography BI-RADS 1 or 2).
The positive predictive value (and the amount of false-positive diagnoses) of MIRA will be determined using the histological diagnosis as the reference test in ALL women participated in the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are between 30 to 70 years of age and who are asymptomatic and scheduled to
             undergo routine breast cancer screening (MRI and/or mammography) OR

          -  Women who are between 30 to 79 years of age and scheduled for image-guided needle
             biopsy as a result of findings obtained during standard of care imaging modalities
             (mammography, ultrasound and/or MRI) performed at the clinical site that participates
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             procedure.

          3. Subjects who have had mammography, ultrasound or MRI examination performed on the day
             of the study prior to MIRA scan.

          4. Subjects who have significant existing breast trauma.

          5. Subjects who have undergone lumpectomy/mastectomy.

          6. Subjects who have undergone breast reduction or breast augmentation.

          9. Subjects who have undergone a breast needle biopsy within the 6-month period prior to
             their intended enrollment into the study.

         10. Subjects who have a temperature &gt; 37.8C degrees on the day of the MIRA imaging.

             to sit in the system chair for the required imaging session.

         15. Subjects with implanted pacemaker/defibrillator, implanted venous access device
             (portacath) or other implanted devices.

         16. Inmates or mentally disabled individuals.
