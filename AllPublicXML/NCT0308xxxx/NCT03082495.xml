  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate if aerobic exercise during and after neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) can improve outcomes for rectal cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EXERT trial is a single-center, prospective, two-armed, phase II randomized controlled
      trial designed to test the preliminary efficacy of exercise training in this clinical setting
      and to further evaluate its feasibility and safety. Participants will be 60 rectal cancer
      patients scheduled to receive long-course NACRT followed by total mesorectal excision.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to exercise training or usual care. Participants in
      the exercise training group will be asked to complete three supervised, high-intensity
      interval training sessions/week during NACRT and ≥ 150 min/week of unsupervised,
      moderate-to-vigorous-intensity, continuous exercise training after NACRT prior to surgery.
      Participants in the usual care group will be asked not to increase their exercise from
      baseline. Assessments will be completed pre NACRT, post NACRT, and pre surgery. The primary
      endpoint will be cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) at the post-NACRT time point assessed
      by a graded exercise test. Secondary endpoints will include functional fitness, quality of
      life, and symptom management. Exploratory clinical endpoints will include treatment
      toxicities, treatment completion, treatment response, and surgical complications.
