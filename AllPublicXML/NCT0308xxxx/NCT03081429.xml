  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of population aging, the incidence of covert stroke and cognitive
      dysfunction gradually increased. Currently, there is still lack of prospective cohort study
      with large sample size on the relationship between perioperative covert stroke and
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The investigators will perform a prospective cohort
      study. The aim of the study is to determine whether there is an association between
      perioperative covert stroke and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients
      undergoing noncardiac surgery.

    <measure>Postoperative cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before surgery; and 3 months, 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive assessment will be conducted by trained research members who are blinded to the clinical diagnosis, treatment and MRI. The Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment-basic (MoCA-B) will be used to assess the cognitive function. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is defined as at least 2 standard deviation reduction in either assessment of MMSE or MoCA-B.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit scale (CAM-ICU) will be applied to assess delirium.</description>

    <measure>Recovery quality</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before surgery; and 30 days, 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale (IADL) will be applied to assess the recovery quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma hypersensitive C-reactive protein, neurofilament light chain, and β Amyloid level</measure>
    <time_frame>At anesthesia induction and at the end of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral artery blood samples (4 ml) will be taken at anesthesia induction and at the end of surgery respectively. The blood samples will be stored in vacutainer tubes containing the anticoagulant EDTA and centrifuged at 4°C. Then, the blood samples will be centrifugated for 8 minutes at 3000 revolutions per minute, and then plasma will be pipetted into Eppendorf tubes (Becton Dickinson). The plasma samples will be stored at -80°C. All plasma samples will be analyzed in a single run in the laboratory of Beijing Tiantan Hospital by board-certified laboratory technicians blind to clinical data using a single batch of reagents for each assay. A multiplex panel consisting of hs-CRP, NFL, and β Amyloid will be applied. The cytokines will be quantified using an in-house assay and a sensitive electrochemiluminescence-based platform (Quickplex, Meso-Scale Discovery®, MD).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression state</measure>
