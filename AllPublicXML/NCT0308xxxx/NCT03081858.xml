  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase 1/2a study of formulated paclitaxel in subjects with low-grade,
      noninvasive papillary carcinoma (stage Ta) of the bladder.

      Part 1 of the study will enroll 6 subjects (3 per cohort) with low-grade, stage Ta
      transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder who will receive escalating doses of
      paclitaxel formulated as TSD-001 every 2 weeks for 6 treatments until Dose Limiting Toxicity
      (or until the Maximum Deliverable Dose) is observed (Maximum Tolerated Dose established).

      Part 2 of the study will enroll an additional 10 subjects with low-grade, stage Ta (uni-or
      multifocal) TCC of the bladder who will receive weekly TSD-001 for 6 weeks at the highest
      nontoxic dose (i.e., MTD) established in part 1 of the study. May meet definition of low
      grade without histological tissue diagnosis if on cystoscopic assessment they have a solitary
      papillary tumor.

      Part 3 of the study will continue to track subjects enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 to determine
      rates of disease-free survival.

    <description>Part 1, Cohort 1: For the first 3 subjects enrolled, the initial dose will be 10 mg in Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI). TSD-001 will be retained in the bladder for 2 hours (1 hour or more will be acceptable, depending on subject's tolerability of the procedure). If Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT) does not develop, intravesical instillation 14 days later will be titrated up according to the schedule (25, 50, 75, 100, 150 mg in SWFI) until DLT (defined as any grade 3 or 4 toxicity or prolonged [greater than 14 days] grade 2 toxicity) is observed.</description>

TSD-001 will be retained in the bladder for 2 hours (1 hour or more will be acceptable, depending on subject's tolerability of the procedure). If DLT does not develop, intravesical instillation 14 days later will be titrated up according to the schedule (180, 270, 360, 450, and 540 mg in SWFI) until DLT (defined as any grade 3 or 4 toxicity or prolonged [greater than 14 days] grade 2 toxicity) is observed.
