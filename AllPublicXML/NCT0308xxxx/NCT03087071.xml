  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well panitumumab with or without trametinib works in
      treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,
      such as panitumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving panitumumab with or
      without trametinib may work better in treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were
      initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy
      and subsequently have detectable EGFR ectodomain mutation post-progression in circulating
      free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior
      anti-EGFR therapy and subsequently have detectable levels of KRAS, NRAS, and/or BRAF mutation
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.

      III. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were
      initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy
      and subsequently do not have detectable KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or EGFR ectodomain mutation
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy.

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who progressed on prior
      anti-EGFR therapy, developed detectable EGFR ectodomain mutations, and progress through
      retreatment with panitumumab.

      III. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who progressed on prior
      anti-EGFR therapy, did not develop detectable mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or EGFR
      ectodomain, and progress through retreatment with panitumumab.

      IV. To evaluate clinical outcomes with panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were initially
      KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy and
      subsequently have detectable EGFR ectodomain mutation post-progression in circulating free
      tumor DNA.

      V. To evaluate clinical outcomes with panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior
      anti-EGFR therapy and subsequently have detectable levels of KRAS, NRAS, and/or BRAF mutation
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.

      VI. To evaluate clinical outcomes with panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were initially
      KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy and
      subsequently do not have detectable KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or EGFR ectodomain mutation
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.

      VII. To study the biological basis of development of primary and secondary resistance to
      anti-EGFR antibodies and MEK inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT 1: Patients with EGFR ectodomain mutation receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may crossover to Cohort 2.

      COHORT 2: Patients with KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation receive trametinib orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 1-14 and panitumumab as in Cohort 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT 3: Patients without EGFR ectodomain, KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation receive panitumumab
      as in Cohort 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may crossover to Cohort 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 24 months.
