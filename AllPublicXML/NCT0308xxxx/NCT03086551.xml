    <textblock>
      This study uses a form on non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic
      stimulation to understand 1) understand how the brain learns post-stroke and 2) assess
      non-invasive brain stimulation as an addition to current stroke rehabilitation approaches. In
      two study arms the investigators will compare the effect of active transcranial magnetic
      stimulation paired with motor practice with placebo (or sham) transcranial magnetic
      stimulation paired with the same motor practice.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in the United States. In the absence of
      treatments to restore the lost tissue, clinical scientists have focused upon repetitive
      forced used of the paretic limb to promote neural reorganization in preserved tissue and
      reduce disability. However, forced use interventions are time intensive and the extent of
      functional recovery is variable. One potential contributor to this variability is the
      potential trade-off between compensatory cognitive motor control strategies and the extent of
      procedural learning that can occur. Compensatory strategies adopted by patients may produce
      quick short-term increases in performance but retard slower sustained improvements by
      interfering with development of procedural learning. Consistent with this hypothesis, the
      investigators' previous work documents an increased reliance upon dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex during performance of learned skills post-stoke. However, the investigators' previous
      work also demonstrates that the effect of increased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex may limit reorganization in important areas involved in the consolidation of practice
      thereby limiting functional recovery post-stroke.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation offers a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship
      between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and consolidation of motor
      practice/rehabilitaion post-stroke. Here the investigators' objective is to determine whether
      suppression of the contralesional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with continuous theta burst
      transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (cTBS), a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation,
      prior to motor practice enhances brain reorganization in critical areas and leads to greater
      sustained improvements in motor ability over time.

      The proposed work will enhance the understanding of motor learning post-stroke and provide
      preliminary evidence for the benefits of dorsolateral prefrontal cTBS as an adjunct to
      current rehabilitation interventions.

    <description>Aggregate time to complete movements between a six sequential targets presented on a computer touch screen in front of the participant. The mean of ten sequences was calculated prior to any practice and at a delayed retention test (e.g. no warm up or preceding practice) post-intervention. Change between the baseline average and post-intervention average was also calculated by subtracting post-intervention score from pre-intervention score. Positive numbers represent improvement in ability.</description>

    <description>The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test is comprised of a series of unimanual tasks required for activities of daily living. Time to complete the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test was assessed at baseline and post-intervention by taking the aggregate time to complete each activity. Change in time to complete the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test between the baseline and post-intervention tests was derived by subtracting post-intervention score from baseline score. Positive scores indicate improvement in functional motor ability.</description>

    <description>Aggregate time to complete movements between a six sequential targets presented on a computer touch screen in front of the participant. The mean of ten sequences was calculated prior to application of Active+Motor Practice or Sham+Motor Practice for each intervention session and the first ten sequences of practice immediately following the specific form of non-invasive brain stimulation within each session. Change within a session was calculated by subtracting the post-stimulation score from the pre-stimulation score within a session. Positive values represent improved ability.</description>

        <description>Aggregate time to complete movements between a six sequential targets presented on a computer touch screen in front of the participant. The mean of ten sequences was calculated prior to any practice and at a delayed retention test (e.g. no warm up or preceding practice) post-intervention. Change between the baseline average and post-intervention average was also calculated by subtracting post-intervention score from pre-intervention score. Positive numbers represent improvement in ability.</description>

        <description>Aggregate time to complete movements between a six sequential targets presented on a computer touch screen in front of the participant. The mean of ten sequences was calculated prior to application of Active+Motor Practice or Sham+Motor Practice for each intervention session and the first ten sequences of practice immediately following the specific form of non-invasive brain stimulation within each session. Change within a session was calculated by subtracting the post-stimulation score from the pre-stimulation score within a session. Positive values represent improved ability.</description>
