  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early initiation of treatment for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can prevent several of the long
      term problems associated with the condition. However, many RA patients develop lung
      inflammation and scarring, called 'interstitial lung disease' (RA-ILD), contributing to early
      death in 1 in 5 people. There is no proven treatment for these patients and some medications
      for RA can in fact worsen their lung disease. There is a need therefore to find safe
      medications that can not only control RA joint disease, but also prevent progression of
      RA-ILD. Abatacept is an approved drug for treating RA and is used widely. It is a newer RA
      medication, with a unique mechanism of action, and it has been shown to prevent progression
      of joint damage and improve physical function. The investigators aim to assess the safety of
      this medication in patients with RA-ILD and improve our understanding of the mechanism of
      lung damage in rheumatoid disease.

      The investigators will perform a small clinical trial to assess the feasibility of performing
      a larger randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 patients with RA-ILD will be treated with
      abatacept infusions fortnightly for the first month, then every 4 weeks for a total of 20
      weeks. In order to be eligible for the study, a patient must be able to provide written
      informed consent, be aged ≥18 years, and have interstitial lung disease that has not
      responded to or progressed over 6 months despite conventional immunosuppression. Change in
      lung function (forced vital capacity) at 24 weeks will be evaluated. To assess the mechanisms
      that may be involved with the development of ILD, the investigators will assess the effects
      of abatacept on biomarkers obtained from the blood and the lung (bronchoalveolar lavage),
      including markers of infection (the lung microbiome).

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will perform a small clinical trial to assess the feasibility of performing a larger randomised controlled trial.
Thirty participants with RA-ILD will be treated with abatacept infusions, which will be given fortnightly for the first 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks.
Participants will sign informed consent at visit 1 (screening visit). There is then a 28 day window before treatment starts at visit 2 (baseline). Each participants participation in the trial is estimated to last 28 weeks from visit 1.</intervention_model_description>
