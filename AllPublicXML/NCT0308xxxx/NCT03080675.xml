      To demonstrate the beneficial effects of 1-year intervention with a nutritional blend of
      ingredients on blood levels of nutritional biomarkers known to be linked with cognitive
      decline in non-demented adults with subjective memory concerns aged 70+ years
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter trial will be a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, 2 parallel
      groups study. The subjects will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (placebo
      or nutrition product). The duration of the intervention is 1 year.

      The total sample size at baseline is 364 subjects, consisting of non-demented adults with
      subjective memory concerns aged 70+ years.
