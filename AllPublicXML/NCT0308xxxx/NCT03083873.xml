  <brief_summary>

      Multicenter, multicohort, non-randomized, prospective, open label, interventional study
      evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
      infusion (LN-145/LN-145-S1) followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion
      preparative regimen for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145/LN-145-S1 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL
      manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with
      recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The cell transfer
      therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative
      regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen
      of IL-2.
