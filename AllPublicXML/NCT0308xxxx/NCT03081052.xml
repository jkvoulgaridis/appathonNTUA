      1. to conduct a clinical investigation to determine if inhaled epoprostenol (Veletri速, iEPO)
      and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) will have similar impact on outcomes in adult patients
      undergoing durable LVAD placement, heart transplantation, or lung transplantation 2. to
      conduct a cost-capture analysis on the expense each drug incurs per patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adult cardiothoracic surgical patients, iNO is used to treat precapillary pulmonary
      hypertension (PH), right-sided heart failure (RHF), and ventilation-to-perfusion (V:Q)
      mismatch. Adult patients who undergo durable LVAD implantation (e.g. Heartware速, Heartmate
      2速, or Heartmate 3速), cardiac transplantation for HFrEF, or those that have endured lung
      transplantation as a result of end-stage lung disease, compose the largest subpopulation
      which receives iPVD therapy at Duke University Hospital. iEPO may display an equivalent
      efficacy profile to iNO for pulmonary vasodilation and oxygenation and have a similar impact
      on clinical outcomes.

      424 informed and consented subjects undergoing LVAD placement or heart transplantation
      (N=224) or lung transplantation (N=200) will be prospectively enrolled over a three-year
      period (one-year for follow-up). Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 according to
      stratified randomization blocking either iNO or iEPO. Additional study procedures will
      involve data collection, blood, and tissue sampling.
