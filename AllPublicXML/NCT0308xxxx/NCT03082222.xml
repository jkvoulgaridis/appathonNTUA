  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non interventional prospective study. Centers will enroll adult participants with
      partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation for whom the clinician has
      decided to initiate eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) as an adjunctive therapy or monotherapy
      prior to the decision to take part in this study. Participants to be enrolled into the study
      will receive ESL either as an adjunctive therapy to one baseline antiepileptic drug (AED) or
      to at least two baseline AEDs or as monotherapy. Participants will be seen at baseline and at
      a follow-up visit after approximately 6 months to assess retention, efficacy, tolerability,
      quality of life (optional), and cognitive performances (optional).
