  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, open-label trial will compare the safety of MTT delivered by
      rectal catheter enema in participants 12-60 months of age with malnutrition (moderate acute
      malnutrition [MAM] or severe acute malnutrition [SAM]) who are in the rehabilitative phase of
      treatment and have failed to respond to at least 4 weeks of standard therapy. Participants
      must meet inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria prior to randomization. Participants will
      then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio at each site to 1 of 2 treatment groups:

        -  MTT by rectal catheter enema: 10mL/kg (maximum 150mL, +/- 5ml) of healthy donor human
           intestinal microbiota will be infused.

        -  Standard of care treatment for malnutrition as prescribed by local and national
           Department of Health Guidelines Participants will be evaluated through 56 days (±3)
           after randomization for primary outcomes (safety) as well as secondary outcomes
           (nutritional, clinical and microbiological response).

      Participant blood and urine samples will be collected at enrollment and day 56. Participant
      stool samples will be collected at enrollment and through days 3, 7, 21 and 56, thereafter, 3
      months, 4 months, and 6 months. A caregiver stool sample will be collected at enrollment and
      day 56. Samples will be used for microbiome determination and other exploratory
      microbiological endpoints. An aliquot of donor stool will also be stored for microbiome
      determination and other exploratory microbiological endpoints and assessment of newly
      acquired infectious agents.

        Participants eligible to participate in this study must meet the following inclusion
        criteria:
