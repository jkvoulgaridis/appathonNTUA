  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to compare the effects of a 12-week CircleCare on
      physical functioning of family caregivers of the elderly with AD. Effects on cognition,
      psychosocial and frailty-related aspects (secondary objective). The acute effect of one
      circle dance session on mood states (tertiary objective). This randomized controlled trial
      will involve 40 family caregivers over 50 years old allocated into a control group or an
      intervention group of 12-weeks (twice a week, 60 min per session) of CircleCare. Primary
      outcomes will include balance, speed of gait, lower limb muscle strength, functional mobility
      and risk of falls. Secondary outcomes will include cognition, burden, stress, depression,
      quality of life and frailty. Mood states will be a tertiary outcome. The effects of
      CircleCare will be verified with an ANOVA two-way test and a multiple comparison test when
      necessary. The analyzes will follow an intention-to-treat approach. The change in moods will
      be evaluated by the paired t-test. The level of significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. This
      study may guide professionals and health policymakers in deciding whether to implement this
      type of intervention. If positive effects are demonstrated, this program can be offered in
      public health services to other groups, given its low cost.

    <measure>Brazilian Version of the Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Battery tests that evaluate the static balance; the speed of gait and lower limb muscle strength. Each test ranges from zero to four points, and the total score is obtained by summing the score of each test, ranging from zero to 12 points. The result can receive the following graduation: 0 to 3 points: incapacity or very poor performance; 4 to 6 points: low performance; 7 to 9 points: moderate performance; 10 to 12 points: good performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Test that evaluates the basic functional mobility through the time spent to get up from a chair with arms, walk 3 meters and return to the chair, as well as the number of steps required to perform the activity. The shorter the time to perform the task, the better the mobility index. The 12.47 second cutoff point will be used as an indicator of the risk of falls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Portuguese version of the Instrument that evaluates the global cognitive function through individual tests of orientation and attention (18 points), memory (26 points), verbal fluency (14 points), language (26 points) and spatial visibility skills (16 points). The overall score ranges from zero to 100 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument that evaluates the physical, psychological and social impact of the task of caring for a patient with mental illness. The scale is composed of 22 questions, whose scores can range from 0 to 88 points. A score below 21 points is classified as no burden; of 21 and 40 points indicate a moderate burden; between 41 to 60, moderate to severe burden and ≥ 61 points, a severe burden.</description>

    <measure>Brazilian Perceived Stress Scale (BPSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>PSS-10 is used to assess the level of stress perceived by older adults in the last month. The final score ranges from 0 to 40, with higher scores denoting a greater degree of perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>

    <description>Scale structured in three versions that relate to the quality of life of the elderly, careAn instrument adapted, translated and validated for the Brazilian culture to assess the quality of life of caregivers and elderly with AD. In this version the caregiver to assess his/her own quality of life. The score ranges from 13 to 52 points and the lower the score worse is the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Frailty Phenotype</measure>

    <description>A battery of tests proposed by Fried et al. (2001) that asses unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in the past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Participants with three or more criteria will be classified as frail. Those with one or two criteria, pre-frail. &quot;No frail&quot; will correspond to the absence of these criteria.</description>

    <ipd_description>At the end of the study, caregivers will be individually informed about their performance in the assessments, but your personal data will not be shared with others, respecting your privacy and anonymity. However, the analyzed results will be published in papers, reported in congresses and special interest groups such as groups of Alzheimer's caregivers and health units interested in implementing the circle dances as a health promotion activity.</ipd_description>
