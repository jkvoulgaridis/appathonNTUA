      This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and
      to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HLX02 and European Union (EU)-sourced Herceptin®
      in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, recurrent or
      previously untreated metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will be assessed centrally
      for HER2 status and the presence of at least one measurable target lesion before
      randomization. Patients will undergo a tumor assessment for evaluation of response according
      to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks up to
      24 weeks (regardless of the number of cycles actually given); thereafter, assessments will be
      done every 9 weeks (after Cycles 11, 14, and 17) or earlier in the case of clinical signs of
      progression.

             disease with an indication for a taxane-containing therapy.

          -  Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block from the primary
             tumor, or a metastatic lesion, to confirm HER2-positivity by the central laboratory,
             based on FISH amplification ratio ≥2.0 or IHC score 3+, and for hormone status
             (ER/PgR) determination (local or central laboratory). If not possible, a fresh biopsy
             is required.

          -  No prior systemic anticancer agent such as chemotherapy, biological or targeted agent
             for metastatic disease with the exception of hormonal therapy, which must be stopped
             at least 2 weeks before randomization. Use of herbal remedies or traditional Chinese
             medicines for anticancer, hematologic or liver function, or anti-infective treatment
             must be stopped at the time of the ICF signature (at least 2 weeks before
             randomization).

          -  For patients with recurrent disease, prior neo-/adjuvant therapy containing
             trastuzumab and/or lapatinib must have been stopped at least 12 months before the
             diagnosis of recurrent (local or metastatic) disease. If trastuzumab/lapatinib was not
             used, prior neo‑/adjuvant therapy with a taxane must have been stopped at least 6
             months before the diagnosis of recurrent (local or metastatic) disease. If only other
             cytotoxics were given, they must be stopped at least 4 weeks before randomization. Any
             hormonal therapy must be stopped at the time of the ICF signature.

          -  Measurable disease (at least one measurable target lesion assessed by CIR; bone-only
             or central nervous system [CNS]-only metastases are not allowed).

             mL/min, calculated according to Cockroft-Gault formula

          -  Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (unless the patient has documented ·Gilbert's
             syndrome) without any medical support within 14 days

          -  Serum aspartate aminotransferase/glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) or serum
             alanine aminotransferase/glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x
             ULN in the case of liver metastases) provided alkaline phosphatase (ALK) is ≤2.5 x
             ULN. In the case of bone metastasis, serum ALK can be &gt;2.5 x ULN if AST and ALT are

             injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. Chronic daily use of
