  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to study the impacts of self-thoracic spine and rib mobilization on sleep
      quality in patients who present to UTSW physicians with shoulder pain. The investigators plan
      to randomize participants into treatment and control groups, but the investigators will
      provide education on sleep hygiene for each group. The treatment group will also receive
      instruction to mobilize their thoracic spine and ribs each night before going to sleep.

      Subjects with a chief complaint of musculoskeletal pain will be recruited from clinics in the
      Departments of Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, and Orthopedic Surgery. Subjects will be
      randomized into either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive
      education on sleep hygiene and instruction to use a foam roller to mobilize the thoracic
      spine and ribs just before the subject goes to sleep. The control group will receive
      education on sleep hygiene. Valid and reliable measures will be used to assess sleep quality
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), and function (SF-36 and
      ASES), as well as a sleep diary. Measures will be taken at baseline as well as two weeks
      after the subject's enrollment in the study.
