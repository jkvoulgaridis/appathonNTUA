  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to determine if an accelerated &quot;Bexsero® (Multicomponent
      meningococcal B vaccine)&quot; schedule compared to a standard schedule is immunogenic, safe, and
      tolerable, in order to increase capacity for rapid outbreak control. In this pilot study no
      formal hypothesis is tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a rapid clinical trial at the time of a
      meningococcal B outbreak, comparing an accelerated schedule of 4CMen B (0, 3 weeks) to the 0,
      2 months schedule, to determine if the more compressed schedule is immunogenic, safe and
      tolerable. A shorter schedule offers the potential benefit of more rapid direct and indirect
      protection, and use of fewer public health resources for implementation.
