  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, optic pathway gliomas (OPG) are detected based on abnormal findings made during
      annual ophthalmologic exams. However, because these exams are annual, it is possible for
      healthcare providers to miss the point at which a child's vision begins to decline
      (potentially indicating an OPG). If at-risk children are screened for hypotonia early in
      life, those children who are hypotonic may undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
      evaluate for OPG before they are showing ophthalmologic symptoms. This would enable
      healthcare providers to discover vision loss earlier and treat symptomatic OPGs earlier,
      thereby allowing us a better chance of preventing further vision loss in children with OPGs.

    <measure>Predictive accuracy of clinical diagnosis of hypotonia as an indicator of OPG in children with NF1</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of MRI (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>A pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) or a pediatric physician specializing in NF1, and physical therapist will screen the children for hypotonia.
The MRI scan will show hypotonia if the children have thickening or enlargement of any portion of the optic nerve, optic chiasm, or optic tracts.
The data analysis for this will be descriptive in nature.</description>

    <measure>Other features that may be indicatory of OPG in children with NF1</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of MRI (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>MRI findings may include other brain tumors or T2 hyperintensities.
The data analysis will be descriptive in nature.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if a physical therapist (PT) can train another clinical professional to accurately diagnose hypotonia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>-PTs use subjective muscle tone, a pull-to-sit test, and the presence or absence of head lag to determine hypotonia.</description>
