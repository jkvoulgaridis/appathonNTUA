      To evaluate the no-inferiority of the ketoconazole20mg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.64
      mg/g association (Candicort®) cream versus clotrimazole 10mg and dexamethasone acetate 0.443
      mg/g association (Baycuten N®) cream, general relief of signs and symptoms (erythema,
      maceration, peeling, blistering / papules / pustules, itching and burning / stinging) 06 (±

      Candicort® presents formulation with agents that act both etiological agent of superficial
      mycosis, with coverage for dermatophytes and more frequent yeast; as inflammation generated
      by the infectious process or prior to it, in cases of secondary fungal infection in wet or
      potentially infected eczema fungal dermatitis (atopic dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis,
      intertrigo, dyshidrosis, contact dermatitis).

      The active ingredients ketoconazole and betamethasone act, respectively, on the etiologic
      agent of the infection and the inflammation generated by the process, and the association of
      both showed a positive therapeutic response in dermatitis with confirmed secondary infections
      or potential yeast (analysis carried out in association with sulfate neomycin, aimed to cover
      bacterial infections together).

      160 participants that meet all the inclusion criteria and are not classified in any of the
      exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups(Candicort® or
      Baycuten N®) of the study.

    <description>Percentage change in the total score of signs and symptoms (erythema, maceration, peeling, blistering /papules /pustules, itching and burning/ stinging) in 6 (±1) days after onset first stage of treatment in relation to the basal.
The total score will be established by the sum of individual scores of the signs and symptoms assessed by the four-point categorical scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), ranging from 0 to 18 points.
The percentage change in the total score of signs and symptoms will be calculated by the following expression:
VTSS(%) = [(TSS0 -TSS6)/ TSS0]*100
TSS0: total score of signs and symptoms (erythema, maceration, peeling, blistering /papules /pustules, itching and burning/ stinging) in 0 day.
TSS6: total score of signs and symptoms (erythema, maceration, peeling, blistering /papules /pustules, itching and burning/ stinging) in 6 (±1) days after onset first stage of treatment</description>
