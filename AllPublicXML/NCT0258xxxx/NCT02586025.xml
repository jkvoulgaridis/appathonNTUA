    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Total Pathologic Complete Response (tpCR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At surgery (Cycle 4 Days 22-35)</time_frame>
    <description>This tpCR was assessed by the independent review committee (IRC). tpCR is defined as the absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery (that is, ypT0/is, ypN0, in accordance with the current American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging system). The analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with participants grouped by the treatment assigned at the time of randomization. Participants whose tpCR assessment was missing or invalid were counted as not achieving tpCR. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days; the administration of therapy in Cycle 5 should not occur until 2 weeks after surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to EFS event or date last known to be alive and event-free (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate the percentage of participants with 3 years of event-free survival (EFS). EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of one of the following events: Disease progression (before surgery) as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 Any evidence of contralateral disease in situ was not identified as progressive disease; Disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral) after surgery; Death from any cause. After treatment completion/discontinuation, follow-up data will be collected every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression or recurrence or until 5 years after randomization of the last participant, whichever occurs first. Participants who do not have an EFS event at the time of the analysis are planned to be censored as of the date they are last known to be alive and event-free.</description>

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate the percentage of participants with 3 years of disease-free survival (DFS). DFS was defined as the time from first date of no disease (i.e., date of surgery) to first documentation of one of the following events: Disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral) after surgery. Any evidence of contralateral disease in situ was not identified as disease recurrence; Death from any cause. After treatment completion/discontinuation, follow-up data will be collected every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression or recurrence or until 5 years after randomization of the last participant, whichever occurs first. Participants were considered to be disease-free if they underwent surgery and no recurrence of disease was reported thereafter. Data from participants who do not have an event at analysis are planned to be censored as of the date they are last known to be alive and event-free.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With At Least One Adverse Event During the Adjuvant Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Cycle 5 up to Cycle 20 (1 cycle = 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who experienced at least one adverse event during the adjuvant period is reported here. The adjuvant treatment period began after primary surgery, upon receiving the first dose of any of the adjuvant study medications. It ended 42 days after the last dose of adjuvant study treatment upon treatment completion or discontinuation. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days; the administration of therapy in Cycle 5 should not occur until 2 weeks after surgery. At the clinical cut-off date for the primary analysis (23-Oct-2017), the majority of participants had not completed the adjuvant treatment. Limited data were collected during the adjuvant period; full data will be reported at study completion.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Total Pathologic Complete Response (tpCR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</title>
        <description>This tpCR was assessed by the independent review committee (IRC). tpCR is defined as the absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery (that is, ypT0/is, ypN0, in accordance with the current American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging system). The analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with participants grouped by the treatment assigned at the time of randomization. Participants whose tpCR assessment was missing or invalid were counted as not achieving tpCR. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days; the administration of therapy in Cycle 5 should not occur until 2 weeks after surgery.</description>

          <description>This tpCR was assessed by the independent review committee (IRC). tpCR is defined as the absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery (that is, ypT0/is, ypN0, in accordance with the current American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging system). The analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with participants grouped by the treatment assigned at the time of randomization. Participants whose tpCR assessment was missing or invalid were counted as not achieving tpCR. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days; the administration of therapy in Cycle 5 should not occur until 2 weeks after surgery.</description>

          <description>Clinical responses that include the percentage of participants with a Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, or Progressive Disease were determined by the investigator during Cycles 1‒4 (prior to surgery) on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Only participants with measurable disease at baseline were included in the analysis. The analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with participants grouped by the treatment assigned at the time of randomization. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days; the administration of therapy in Cycle 5 should not occur until 2 weeks after surgery.</description>

        <description>The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate the percentage of participants with 3 years of event-free survival (EFS). EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of one of the following events: Disease progression (before surgery) as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 Any evidence of contralateral disease in situ was not identified as progressive disease; Disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral) after surgery; Death from any cause. After treatment completion/discontinuation, follow-up data will be collected every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression or recurrence or until 5 years after randomization of the last participant, whichever occurs first. Participants who do not have an EFS event at the time of the analysis are planned to be censored as of the date they are last known to be alive and event-free.</description>

        <description>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. A normal LVEF ranges from 55% to 70%, as measured by echocardiogram (preferred) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan. The same method should be used throughout the study for each participant and preferably performed and evaluated by the same assessor. Here, we report the maximum change from baseline in LVEF at any point during the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Over Time</title>
        <description>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. A normal LVEF ranges from 55% to 70%, as measured by echocardiogram (preferred) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan. The same method should be used throughout the study for each participant and preferably performed and evaluated by the same assessor. Here, we report the change from baseline in LVEF over time.</description>
