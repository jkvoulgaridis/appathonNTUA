    <textblock>
      A Phase 3 global study comparing avelumab alone to avelumab plus PLD and to PLD alone to
      demonstrate that avelumab given alone or in combination with PLD is superior to PLD alone in
      prolonging Overall Survival in patients with platinum resistant/platinum refractory ovarian

OR is defined as a complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR, &gt;=30% decrease under the baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions) according to the RECIST (version 1.1) recorded from randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause. Both CR and PR must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met and before the first documentation of disease progression. Only tumor assessments performed on or before the start date of any further anti-cancer therapies are considered in the assessment of best overall response.</description>

Treatment emergent AEs are those events with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period for the first time, or if the worsening of an event is during the on-treatment period.</description>
