    <textblock>
      The SABR-ATAC trial (Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and anti-TGFB Antibody Combination)
      is a phase I/II trial that studies the side effects and efficacy of fresolimumab, an
      anti-transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) antibody, when given with stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy in patients with stage IA-IB non-small cell lung cancer. Fresolimumab may
      inhibit radiation side effects and block tumor growth through multiple mechanisms.
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT), is a specialized form of radiation therapy that precisely delivers high dose
      radiation directly to tumors, thus killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal
      tissue. Giving fresolimumab with SABR may work better in treating patients with early stage
      non-small cell lung cancer than treating with SABR alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Phase 1: Evaluate the safe dose of fresolimumab in combination with stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy (SABR) in patients.

      Phase 2. Evaluate the rate of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus
      fresolimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase I)
      II. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary function. (Phase I) III. Evaluate recurrence
      rates and progression free survival. (Phase I) IV. Assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      fresolimumab in combination with SABR (optional for patient). (Phase I) V. Evaluate the rate
      and severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase I)
      VI. Evaluate the severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus
      fresolimumab. (Phase II) VII. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving
      fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase II) VIII. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary
      function. (Phase II) IX. Evaluate recurrence rates and progression free survival. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of fresolimumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive fresolimumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4
      fractions between days 8 and 12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
