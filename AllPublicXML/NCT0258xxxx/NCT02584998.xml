  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main study aim is to develop, implement and disseminate a pilot population-based mailed
      FIT outreach screening program in the Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on
      having an office visit, by conducting a proof-of-concept 3-arm parallel-design pragmatic
      randomized trial to (1) Compare the effects of usual care (UC), screening invitation +
      reminder (invitation-reminder), or screening invitation + mailed FIT kit + reminder
      (mailed-FIT); (2) Explore whether the FIT completion rate varies by age or race/ethnicity;
      and (3) Explore barriers to use of mailed outreach screening for Veterans.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the foundation to systematically study and improve the delivery
      and effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the VA by developing, implementing
      and disseminating a pilot mailed-FIT screening outreach program that does not rely on having
      a clinical office visit. The investigators specifically address the need to identify and
      remediate potential failures to identify and offer screening to eligible Veterans through
      multilevel interventions. The investigators will also create electronic data linkages to, in
      future studies, enable evaluation of FIT performance characteristics and help close critical
      evidence gaps for optimizing screening among Veterans. As this is a pilot study, the focus is
      to assess feasibility of a population-based screening outreach approach through the
      development, implementation and dissemination of a mailed FIT outreach program in the
      Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on having an office visit.

The letter will inform participants that a telephone reminder will follow in 4 weeks from invitation letter if screening is not completed.

    <description>The FIT is analyzed at the Philadelphia VAMC by an auto-analyzer system that provides quantitative results corresponding to the concentration of hemoglobin in the collected sample. Specimens will be analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions to minimize potential degradation of hemoglobin. Results are provided as positive if the hemoglobin concentration is 100ng/dL. The machine records (but does not report) the quantitative results of the hemoglobin concentration in the sample, which we will seek to obtain from the laboratory for future studies.</description>

A sample size of 500 (250/arm) will give 80% power for UC vs. screening invitation-reminder, and 152/arm will give a power of 80% for the screening invitation-reminder vs. mailed-FIT. Accounting for the possibility that up to 20% of participants could be ineligible post-randomization, we concluded that we should enroll 783 patients, 261 per arm, for this trial.</groups_desc>
