  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the optimal use, efficacy, and safety of a Treat-and-Extend
      regimen with aflibercept in subjects with nAMD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The T&amp;E dosing regimen for nAMD has emerged as a preferred regimen for many treating
      physicians aiming at maximizing outcomes by proactively treating the subject at each visit
      and by extending the treatment interval (if extension criteria are met), thus limiting
      visits, monitoring, and injections.

      To this day, there is limited evidence available addressing the question of what are useful
      intervals for treating and monitoring, how do they differ among subjects, and how are
      retreatment criteria applied to achieve long-term desirable outcomes in real-life practice.
      This study is designed to evaluate the optimal use, efficacy, and safety of the T&amp;E regimen
      with intravitreal aflibercept in subjects with nAMD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women ≥ 50 years of age.

          -  Active primary subfoveal CNV lesions secondary to nAMD, including juxtafoveal lesions
             that affect the fovea as evidenced by FA in the study eye. Patients with polypoidal
             choroidal vasculopathy or retinal angiomatous proliferation are eligible to
             participate in the study, and their condition should be captured in the eCRF.

          -  ETDRS BCVA of 73 to 25 letters (20/40 to 20/320 Snellen equivalent) in the study eye.

          -  The area of CNV must occupy at least 50% of the total lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior ocular (in the study eye) or systemic treatment or surgery for nAMD, except
             dietary supplements or vitamins.

          -  Any prior or concomitant therapy with another investigational agent to treat nAMD in
             the study eye.

          -  Prior treatment with anti-VEGF agents as follows:

          -  Prior treatment with anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye is not allowed

          -  Prior treatment with anti-VEGF therapy in the fellow eye with an investigational agent
             (not approved, e.g. bevacizumab) within the last 3 months before the first dose in the
             study. Such treatment will also not be allowed during the study. Prior treatment with
             an approved anti-VEGF therapy in the fellow eye is allowed.

          -  Prior systemic anti-VEGF therapy, investigational or approved, within the last 3
             months before the first dose in the study, and such treatment will not be allowed
             during the study.

          -  Total lesion size &gt;12 disc areas (30.5 mm2, including blood, scars and
             neovascularization) as assessed by FA in the study eye.

          -  Subretinal hemorrhages that are either 50% or more of the total lesion area, or if the
             blood is under the fovea and is 1 or more disc areas in size in the study eye. (If the
             blood is under the fovea, then the fovea must be surrounded by 270 degrees by visible
             CNV).

          -  Scar or fibrosis making up &gt;50% of the total lesion in the study eye.

          -  Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy involving the center of the fovea in the study eye.

          -  Presence of retinal pigment epithelial tears or rips involving the macula in the study
             eye.

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted from 19-Nov-2015 (First Patient First Visit) to 26-Apr-2019 (Last Patient Last Visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 443 participants were screened in this study. Of these, 156 participants were screening failures and did not enter the treatment period. Of the 287 treated participants, 16 were treated during the initiation phase, but were not randomized to a treatment arm after the initiation phase.</pre_assignment_details>
