    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well capmatinib, ceritinib, regorafenib, or entrectinib work
      in treating patients with BRAF/NRAS wild-type stage III-IV melanoma. Capmatinib, ceritinib,
      regorafenib, or entrectinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors matched to the
      tumor-specific fusion kinase in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate tumor stability in melanoma patients treated with kinase inhibitors matched to
      the tumor-specific fusion kinase.

      II. To estimate survival in melanoma patients treated with kinase inhibitors matched to the
      tumor-specific fusion kinase.

      III. To examine the safety and tolerability of kinase inhibitors in patients with melanoma
      with a fusion kinase.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore molecular mechanisms of resistance for patients who progress on therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients with MET fusion receive capmatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients with ALK fusion receive ceritinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients with RET or BRAF fusion receive regorafenib PO QD on day 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients with NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, or ROS1 fusion receive entrectinib PO QD on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then
      periodically.

          -  CAPMATINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients on unstable or increasing doses of
             corticosteroids; if patients are on corticosteroids for endocrine deficiencies or
             tumor-associated symptoms other than CNS related, dose must have been stabilized or
             decreasing for at least 5 days before first dose of capmatinib

          -  CAPMATINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Presence or history of carcinomatous meningitis

          -  CAPMATINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring increasing
             doses of steroid to manage CNS symptoms within 2 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases may be enrolled at the discretion of
                  the sponsor as long as the patient is stable and has not required increasing dose
                  of steroids to manage CNS symptoms for at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment

               -  Patients requiring seizure prophylaxis must be taking non-enzyme-inducing
