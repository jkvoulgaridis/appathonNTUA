    <textblock>
      This study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung
      cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for
      subjects who have a blood test positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01,
      HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 protein and a tumor test positive for NY-ESO-1 expression. The
      study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood,
      and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be
      the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and
      destroying cancer cells. The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T
      cells will be given back to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this
      study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any,
      they have in subjects with lung cancer. Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study
      Physician right after receiving their T cells back. Subjects will then be entered into a
      long-term follow up in order to monitor the subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by
      their Study Physician for the first 5 years after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are
      found in the blood at five years, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year
      until the T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells
      are no longer found in the blood at 5 years, then the subject will be contacted by the Study
      Physician for the next 10 years.

      This is a single-arm study of genetically engineered NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells in HLA-A*02:01,
      HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC.
      Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health, performance status and
      disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility will undergo a
      large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹ TCR
      bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will receive
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine . Subjects will visit the
      clinic for safety and efficacy assessments daily from T cell infusion (Day 1) through Day 5,
      Days 8, 10, 12, and then weekly until week 6 and then at 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, and
      every 3 months until 2 years and then every 6 months until progression of their disease (or
      withdrawal of consent for the interventional portion of the study). Subjects who have a
      confirmed response (or have stable disease for &gt;4 months) but subsequent disease progression
      following the initial infusion and whose tumor continues to express the appropriate antigen
      target may be eligible for a second infusion. All subjects, completing or withdrawing from
      the interventional portion of the study, will enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for
      observation of delayed adverse events. All subjects will continue to be followed for overall
      survival during the long-term follow-up phase.
