    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (PASI 75) Scores at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, arms, trunk, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and thickness in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no disease to 72 for the most severe disease. Each of the body areas was scored by itself, and then the 4 scores were combined into the final PASI score. Participants achieving PASI 75 are defined as having an improvement (reduction) of at least 75% in the Week 16 PASI score compared to the score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response of Clear or Almost Clear on the Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had achieved a clear or almost clear response on the 6-point sPGA scale. The sPGA was the physician's determination of the participant's psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. Overall lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. For the analysis of responses, the participant's psoriasis was assessed at a given time point on a 6-point scale on which 0 = cleared, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = very severe.</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life During Treatment: Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI score was calculated by summing the individual scores of each question at a given time point, resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. For the analysis of responses, the participant's results were assessed on a scoring scale on which 3 = very much or yes (applicable to question 7 only), 2 = a lot, 1 = a little, 0 = not at all or not relevant. Interpretation of DLQI scoring can be taken as 0 - 1 = no effect at all on participant's life, 2 - 5 = small effect on participant's life, 6 - 10 = moderate effect on participant's life, 11 - 20 = very large effect on participant's life, and 21 - 30 = extremely large effect on participant's life.</description>

        <description>The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, arms, trunk, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and thickness in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no disease to 72 for the most severe disease. Each of the body areas was scored by itself, and then the 4 scores were combined into the final PASI score. Participants achieving PASI 75 are defined as having an improvement (reduction) of at least 75% in the Week 16 PASI score compared to the score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The sPGA response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had achieved a clear or almost clear response on the 6-point sPGA scale. The sPGA was the physician's determination of the participant's psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. Overall lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. For the analysis of responses, the participant's psoriasis was assessed at a given time point on a 6-point scale on which 0 = cleared, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = very severe.</description>

        <description>The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, arms, trunk, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and thickness in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no disease to 72 for the most severe disease. Each of the body areas was scored by itself, and then the 4 scores were combined into the final PASI score. Participants achieving PASI 50 are defined as having an improvement (reduction) of at least 50% compared to Baseline.</description>

        <title>Absolute PASI Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, arms, trunk, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and thickness in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no disease to 72 for the most severe disease. Each of the body areas was scored by itself, and then the 4 scores were combined into the final PASI score.</description>

        <title>Health-Related Quality of Life During Treatment: Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>The DLQI score was calculated by summing the individual scores of each question at a given time point, resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. For the analysis of responses, the participant's results were assessed on a scoring scale on which 3 = very much or yes (applicable to question 7 only), 2 = a lot, 1 = a little, 0 = not at all or not relevant. Interpretation of DLQI scoring can be taken as 0 - 1 = no effect at all on participant's life, 2 - 5 = small effect on participant's life, 6 - 10 = moderate effect on participant's life, 11 - 20 = very large effect on participant's life, and 21 - 30 = extremely large effect on participant's life.</description>

        <title>Health-Related Quality of Life During Treatment: DLQI Score at Week 48 (Completion/Termination Visit)</title>
        <description>The DLQI score was calculated by summing the individual scores of each question at a given time point, resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. For the analysis of responses, the participant's results were assessed on a scoring scale on which 3 = very much or yes (applicable to question 7 only), 2 = a lot, 1 = a little, 0 = not at all or not relevant. Interpretation of DLQI scoring can be taken as 0 - 1 = no effect at all on participant's life, 2 - 5 = small effect on participant's life, 6 - 10 = moderate effect on participant's life, 11 - 20 = very large effect on participant's life, and 21 - 30 = extremely large effect on participant's life.</description>

          <description>Laboratory results included hematology [Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelet count, Mean cell volume, White blood cell count (total leucocytes), Neutrophils absolute, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes absolute, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils absolute, and Eosinophils], chemistry (Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Gamma glutamyl transferase, Creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Total protein, Potassium, Urea, Creatinine, Phosphate, Glucose, and Uric acid) and urinalysis [Specific Gravity] parameters. Laboratory results of a few hematology (Red Blood Cell Count and Monocytes absolute), chemistry (Alkaline Phosphatase, Total bilirubin, Sodium, Chloride, and Albumin), and urinalysis (pH) parameters were not assessed at Baseline and Week 16. Clinically meaningful changes were classified as such by the Investigator and reported as adverse events.</description>

        <description>Laboratory results included hematology [Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelet count, Mean cell volume, White blood cell count (total leucocytes), Neutrophils absolute, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes absolute, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils absolute, and Eosinophils], chemistry (Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Gamma glutamyl transferase, Creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Total protein, Potassium, Urea, Creatinine, Phosphate, Glucose, and Uric acid) and urinalysis [Specific Gravity] parameters. Laboratory results of a few hematology (Red Blood Cell Count and Monocytes absolute), chemistry (Alkaline Phosphatase, Total bilirubin, Sodium, Chloride, and Albumin), and urinalysis (pH) parameters were not assessed at Baseline and Week 16. Clinically meaningful changes were classified as such by the Investigator and reported as adverse events.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Laboratory Parameters at Week 16</title>
          <description>Laboratory results included hematology [Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelet count, Mean cell volume, White blood cell count (total leucocytes), Neutrophils absolute, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes absolute, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils absolute, and Eosinophils], chemistry (Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Gamma glutamyl transferase, Creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Total protein, Potassium, Urea, Creatinine, Phosphate, Glucose, and Uric acid) and urinalysis [Specific Gravity] parameters. Laboratory results of a few hematology (Red Blood Cell Count and Monocytes absolute), chemistry (Alkaline Phosphatase, Total bilirubin, Sodium, Chloride, and Albumin), and urinalysis (pH) parameters were not assessed at Baseline and Week 16. Clinically meaningful changes were classified as such by the Investigator and reported as adverse events.</description>

        <description>The M923 confirmation assay was evaluated only if the EU Humira confirmation assay was negative. Overall Result: a participant was considered to be positive if a confirmed positive result was observed at any assay (including predose; if a participant had either a negative result in the screening assay or a positive result at screening followed by a negative result in all confirmation tiers, the overall result was negative. Overall Status: a participant was considered to have developed ADA or neutralizing ADAs if a confirmed positive result was observed at any time during the treatment period inclusive of the predose results; the designation of negative required either a negative screening assay or a negative confirmation result at each sampling time. The same convention applied for the neutralizing assay results.</description>

        <description>The M923 confirmation assay was evaluated only if the EU Humira confirmation assay was negative. Overall Result: a participant was considered to be positive if a confirmed positive result was observed at any assay (including predose; if a participant had either a negative result in the screening assay or a positive result at screening followed by a negative result in all confirmation tiers, the overall result was negative. Overall Status: a participant was considered to have developed ADA or neutralizing ADAs if a confirmed positive result was observed at any time during the treatment period inclusive of the predose results; the designation of negative required either a negative screening assay or a negative confirmation result at each sampling time.

        <title>Immunogenicity: Number of Participants With ADA and nADA by Titer at Baseline</title>
        <description>The M923 confirmation assay was evaluated only if the EU Humira confirmation assay was negative. Overall Result: a participant was considered to be positive if a confirmed positive result was observed at any assay (including predose); if a participant had either a negative result in the screening assay or a positive result at screening followed by a negative result in all confirmation tiers, the overall result was negative. Overall Status: a participant was considered to have developed ADA or neutralizing ADAs if a confirmed positive result was observed at any time during the treatment period inclusive of the predose results; the designation of negative required either a negative screening assay or a negative confirmation result at each sampling time.

        <title>Immunogenicity: Number of Participants With ADA and nADA by Titer at Week 52 (Completion/Termination Visit)</title>
        <description>The M923 confirmation assay was evaluated only if the EU Humira confirmation assay was negative. Overall Result: a participant was considered to be positive if a confirmed positive result was observed at any assay (including predose); if a participant had either a negative result in the screening assay or a positive result at screening followed by a negative result in all confirmation tiers, the overall result was negative. Overall Status: a participant was considered to have developed ADA or neutralizing ADAs if a confirmed positive result was observed at any time during the treatment period inclusive of the predose results; the designation of negative required either a negative screening assay or a negative confirmation result at each sampling time. In confirmed positive samples, an assay was used to determine the relative titer of the ADA; a subsequent neutralizing antibodies assay was used to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies.</description>
