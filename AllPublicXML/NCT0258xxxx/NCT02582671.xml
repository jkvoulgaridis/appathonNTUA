  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interferon-free combination regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without
      dasabuvir (ABBVIE REGIMEN) ± ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC)
      has been shown to be safe and effective in randomized controlled clinical trials with strict
      inclusion and exclusion criteria under well-controlled conditions. This observational study
      was the first effectiveness research examining the ABBVIE REGIMEN ± RBV, used according to
      the local label, under real world conditions in Ireland in a clinical practice patient
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, multi-center observational study in participants receiving the
      interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN ± RBV in Ireland. The prescription of a treatment regimen was
      at the discretion of the physician in accordance with local clinical practice and label, was
      made independently from this observational study and preceded the decision to offer the
      participant the opportunity to participate in this study. Adults chronically infected with
      HCV, receiving the interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN, were offered the opportunity to
      participate in this study during a routine clinical visit at the participating sites.
      Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures, and diagnostic methods followed physicians' routine
      clinical practice. Data were collected at the following time windows: baseline, early
      on-treatment visit, mid-treatment visit (for participants with a treatment duration of 24
      weeks), end of treatment (EoT), early post- treatment and 12 and 24 weeks after the end of
      treatment (representing sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment
      [SVR12] and sustained virologic response 24 weeks after the end of treatment [SVR24]).

    <time_frame>12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than 50 IU/mL 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug. The core population (CP) consisted of participants who met all inclusion criteria and were adequately treated according to the standard of care and within local label recommendations for their specific disease characteristics (cirrhotic status, genotype). The core population with sufficient follow-up data 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug (CPSFU12) was defined as all CP participants who fulfilled one of the following criteria:
evaluable HCV RNA data ≥70 days after the last actual dose of the ABBVIE REGIMEN
an HCV RNA value ≥50 IU/mL at the last measurement post-baseline
HCV RNA &lt;50 IU/mL at the last measurement post-baseline, but no HCV RNA measurement ≥70 days after the last actual dose of the ABBVIE REGIMEN due to reasons related to safety (e.g. dropped out due to AE) or virologic failure</description>

        <description>SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than 50 IU/mL 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug. The core population (CP) consisted of participants who met all inclusion criteria and were adequately treated according to the standard of care and within local label recommendations for their specific disease characteristics (cirrhotic status, genotype). The core population with sufficient follow-up data 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug (CPSFU12) was defined as all CP participants who fulfilled one of the following criteria:
evaluable HCV RNA data ≥70 days after the last actual dose of the ABBVIE REGIMEN
an HCV RNA value ≥50 IU/mL at the last measurement post-baseline
HCV RNA &lt;50 IU/mL at the last measurement post-baseline, but no HCV RNA measurement ≥70 days after the last actual dose of the ABBVIE REGIMEN due to reasons related to safety (e.g. dropped out due to AE) or virologic failure</description>
