  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with stage IV
      melanoma of the skin that has not responded to previous treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate rate of objective response (OR: complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      to ibrutinib administered as single agent in patients with immune checkpoint
      inhibitor-refractory, or immune checkpoint inhibitor ineligible and mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) inhibitor-refractory (if B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase
      [BRAF]V600-mutant) or MAPK inhibitor-intolerant distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months after initiation of ibrutinib in
      patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory or immune checkpoint ineligible and MAPK
      inhibitor-refractory (if BRAFV600-mutant) or MAPK inhibitor-intolerant distant metastatic
      cutaneous melanoma.

      II. Estimate overall survival (OS) after initiation of ibrutinib in patients with immune
      checkpoint inhibitor-refractory or immune checkpoint ineligible and MAPK inhibitor-refractory
      (if BRAFV600-mutant) or MAPK inhibitor-intolerant distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

      III. Explore the association of ITK protein expression with OR and PFS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore association between other putative targets of ibrutinib (e.g. Tec, ErbB4, Hck,
      Yes, BTK) in melanoma cells, as assessed by 2-color immunofluorescence (IF) in representative
      tissue sections obtained from pretreatment archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
      tumor blocks or FFPE blocks obtained from fresh tissue biopsy from enrolled patients, with
      overall response (OR) and PFS.

      II. Explore ibrutinib-mediated effect(s) on immune cell subsets associated with
      immunomodulation by performing multiparameter flow cytometric analysis in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMC) obtained prior to treatment, on day 29 (i.e., predose day 1 of cycle
      2) following initiation of treatment with ibrutinib, and at the time of disease progression
      (3 time points).

      III. Determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib following daily dosing at 840 mg on day 8
      of cycle 1 (Css).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

    <description>Antitumor response defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). CR is the disappearance of all target lesions.

             previously ineligible to receive systemic immunotherapies for melanoma) are allowed on
             condition that they do not receive more than 20 mg of daily dose methylprednisolone,
             prednisone, or its equivalent; this does not include autoimmune diseases caused by
             previous immunotherapy treatments for melanoma that require ongoing treatment with
             corticosteroids (e.g. autoimmune colitis or autoimmune hepatitis receiving
             corticosteroids)

          -  Willing to consent to allow access to known archival tumor tissue (NOTE: designated
             pathologist from participating site OR lead principal investigator must sign-off to
             ensure &quot;sufficient&quot; tumor should be available for support of tumor imaging studies
             [multi-color immunofluorescence])

          -  If archival tumor tissue from a metastatic melanoma lesion is unavailable OR
             designated pathologist from participating site cannot sign-off to ensure that
             &quot;sufficient&quot; tumor is available from existing archival tumor block for support of
             tumor imaging studies, patients must be willing to consent to undergo a biopsy to
             collect metastatic tumor tissue; collection of fresh biopsy tissue does not guarantee
             enrollment, unless the pathologist from the participating site signs-off that
             &quot;sufficient&quot; tumor has been collected

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Subjects who are unable to tolerate BRAF inhibitor and/or MEK inhibitor therapy due to
             grade &gt;= 2 toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version
             [v]4.0) from these agents, irrespective of antitumor response, are eligible on
             condition that: (a) toxicities persisted despite change from doublet to singlet
             therapy (i.e. from concurrent BRAF inhibition plus MEK inhibition to BRAF inhibition
             alone), (b) toxicities are attributed to a class effect, and therefore switch from one
             drug to another is expected to induce the same type of toxicity (e.g. ocular
             toxicities or cardiac dysfunction from MEK inhibitor), (c) drug-specific toxicities
             that do not resolve with switch from one BRAF inhibitor to another (i.e. dabrafenib to
             vemurafenib, or vice versa), will be eligible for enrollment in 9922; in other words,
             patients will be allowed to enroll into the NCI9922 study despite lack of progression
             to MAPK inhibitor treatments, on condition that grade 2 or higher toxicities
             attributed to MAPK inhibitors resolve to grade 1, or less, at the time of study
             enrollment

          -  Received anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, or equivalent vitamin K antagonists,
             within the last 28 days prior to day 1 of ibrutinib; patients with familial
             coagulopathic diseases (e.g. hemophilia, von Willebrand disease) are also excluded; if
             applicable, subjects must discontinue fish oil and vitamin E supplements within 7 days
             prior to initiating ibrutinib therapy

          -  Subjects with known hepatic insufficiency (i.e. Child-Pugh score A [mild], Child-Pugh
             score B [moderate] or Child-Pugh score C [severe]) according to Child-Pugh criteria

          -  Subjects who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor within 7 days prior
             to the first dose of ibrutinib or subjects who require continuous treatment with a
             strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor

        <description>Assessed by IHC and 2-color IF and analyzed by Aperio imaging. Exploratory analysis will also be performed to assess the predictive ability of each tissue biomarker by fitting logistic model or Cox model with biomarker as a covariate. Antitumor response rate or PFS information will be used to investigate possible cut-points for the biomarker. Logistic regression analysis will be conducted to assess whether a profile of immune response in tumor biopsies (or in peripheral blood) can be developed that distinguishes patients who respond to treatment versus those who do not.</description>
