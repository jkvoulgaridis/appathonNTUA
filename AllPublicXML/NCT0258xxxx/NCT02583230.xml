    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and pilot a mobile smartphone delivered intervention
      that will improve antidepressant medication care by providing medication adherence monitoring
      and support to the patient, feedback on patient adherence and response to treatment to the
      primary care team, and information to both patients and providers on guideline-congruent care
      personalized to the patient's response to antidepressant medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and imposes a very high societal burden in terms of
      cost, morbidity, suffering, and mortality. While primary care is the de facto site for
      treatment of MDD, outcomes in primary care are poor. Two principal reasons for the poor
      outcomes in primary care are poor patient adherence to antidepressant medications (ADMs) and
      the failure of physicians to provide guideline-congruent care. This problem is aggravated by
      a lack of communication between patients and the care team.

      A growing body of research indicates that primary care-centered strategies aimed at enhancing
      guideline-congruent care have not been effective. Interventions aimed at improving adherence
      in the patient have been successful in changing patient adherence behavior; however these
      frequently fail to improve depression outcomes, particularly when there is no intervention on
      the physician side to encourage optimization of ADMs. Recent developments in information and
      communications technologies (ICT) have opened new opportunities to improve health and mental
      health care, and to link patients and their providers. This study harnesses these advances to
      develop and pilot a system where ADM adherence will be passively measured using an electronic
      pill dispenser. The dispenser is connected to a mobile smartphone via Global System for
      Mobile Communications (GSM), so that targeted, timely reminders can be provided when the
      patient fails to take the ADM. When the patient is adherent, the patient will not be bothered
      with reminders. Depressive symptoms and side-effects will be periodically monitored weekly
      via the phone. Every 4 weeks, or if indicated (e.g intolerable side effects or urgent
      situations), primary care teams will receive notifications via the electronic medical record
      that include a summary of patient data on treatment response and side effects,
      guideline-congruent treatment recommendations based on patient data and a recommendation to
      contact the patient, if indicated. Simultaneously, a similar message will be provided to the
      patient, including feedback, possible treatment options, and a recommendation to contact the
      physician's office. Thus, both the patient and care team will be activated to provide,
      request and adhere to guideline-congruent care.

      The aim of this 8 week field trial is to develop and pilot the MedLink system. Development
      will employ an iterative user-centered approach. Primary outcome will be patient adherence;
      secondary outcomes will be depression, system use, and usability and satisfaction.

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>

    <description>The PHQ-9 measures degree of depression severity. Possible range of scores for the PHQ-9 is 0-27. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Specifically, scores of 0-4 indicate minimal or no depression; 5-9 is mild; 10-14 is moderate; 15-19 is moderately severe; and 20-27 is severe.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician Rating (QIDS-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses depressive symptom severity. The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each of the nine symptom domains of the DSM-IV MDD (major depressive disorder) criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes (Rush et al. 2003). Sixteen items are used to rate the nine criterion symptom domains of a major depressive episode. Each item is rated 0-3. For symptom domains that require more than one item, the highest score of the item relevant for each domain is taken. The total score ranges from 0-27. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Specifically, scores of 0-5 indicate no depression; 6-10 is mild; 11-15 is moderate; 16-20 is severe; and 21-27 is very severe.</description>

        <title>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician Rating (QIDS-C)</title>
        <description>This measure assesses depressive symptom severity. The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each of the nine symptom domains of the DSM-IV MDD (major depressive disorder) criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes (Rush et al. 2003). Sixteen items are used to rate the nine criterion symptom domains of a major depressive episode. Each item is rated 0-3. For symptom domains that require more than one item, the highest score of the item relevant for each domain is taken. The total score ranges from 0-27. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Specifically, scores of 0-5 indicate no depression; 6-10 is mild; 11-15 is moderate; 16-20 is severe; and 21-27 is very severe.</description>
