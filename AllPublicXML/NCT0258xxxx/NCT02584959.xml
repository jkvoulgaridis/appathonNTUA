    <measure>Cumulative Attack Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 to 14 for treatment period 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of the angioedema attack sign/symptom was characterized as None: no symptom; Mild: noticeable symptom but easily tolerated by the participant and did not interfere with routine activities; Moderate: symptom interfered with the participant's ability to attend school or participate in family life and social/recreational activities; Severe: symptom significantly limited the participant's ability to attend school or participate in family life and social/recreational activities.
Symptom severity score was assigned as Mild = 1, Moderate = 2 and Severe = 3. Cumulative attack severity score was the sum of the maximum symptom severity scores recorded for each angioedema attack in a treatment period.
Cumulative attack-severity score normalized per month [(raw score/number of days of participation in that treatment period)*30.4] was reported here. Cumulative attack-severity score normalized per month ranged from 0 to 19.83 and higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Assess Disease Activity as Measured by the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) Normalized Per Month</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 to 14 for treatment period 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity was measured using a 98-day Angioedema Activity Score (AAS). The AAS collects information of disease activity in the last 24 hours. The following items are assessed: experience of swelling, severity of the swelling, timing of the swelling, extent of discomfort due to the swelling, extent that the swelling caused limitations in daily life, and feelings of being disfigured by the swelling. The instrument uses a binary response option for the first item and a three-point response scale for the 5 items thereafter. The daily AAS was the sum of the AAS items per day. Total daily ASS scores range between 0 and 15 points. Higher values stand for higher disease activity. The normalized 98-day AAS per month for a participant is calculated by (the sum of daily AAS within a treatment period/the number of days that a subject has AAS records within the treatment period)*30.4.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Scores From Baseline to Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 13 for treatment period 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>The AE-QoL is a questionnaire on the quality of life of patients suffering from recurrent angioedema. It consists of 17 specific questions that are associated with work, physical activity, free time, social relations, and food. Each of the 17 questions has a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The AE-QoL consists of 4 dimensions (functioning=4 questions(qns) fatigue/mood=5 qns, fears/shame=6 qns, nutrition=2 qns) and a total score (all 17 questions).All scores were calculated by using the following formula: (Σ items - min Σ items / max Σ items - min Σ items) x 100. Σ items=sum of response by participant, min Σ items=minimum response possible, max Σ items=maximum response possible. Scores range from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Absolute change calculated as visit score at week 13 minus score at baseline per period.</description>

        assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequences. Each patient will undergo 2 14-week treatment
        periods for a total of 28 weeks (Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2). After
        completing the 2 treatment periods, patients will enter a 1-month follow-up period.

          <title>Proportion of Participants Meeting at Least a 50% Reduction in NNA (Normalized Number of Angioedema Attacks) During the Experimental Injection Treatment Period Relative to the Placebo Period Excluding the First 2 Weeks of Each Treatment Period.</title>
          <description>The angioedema attacks were recorded in the electronic patient diary. The investigator completed a separate angioedema eCRF for each attack based on the review of the patients diary. Time-Normalized Number of Attacks was expressed as the number of attacks per month (ie, 30.4 days) of exposure. NNA = 30.4 x (number of attacks during treatment period) / (days of treatment period).</description>
          <population>Analysis done on participants from the crossover sequences (Experimental/Placebo, Placebo/Experimental) who were dosed in both treatment periods. As the measure is implicitly a within subject comparison of the two arms the full analysis set is reported here. Participants with 0 attacks in the placebo period were excluded as %-reduct. not calculated</population>

        <description>Severity of the angioedema attack sign/symptom was characterized as None: no symptom; Mild: noticeable symptom but easily tolerated by the participant and did not interfere with routine activities; Moderate: symptom interfered with the participant's ability to attend school or participate in family life and social/recreational activities; Severe: symptom significantly limited the participant's ability to attend school or participate in family life and social/recreational activities.
Symptom severity score was assigned as Mild = 1, Moderate = 2 and Severe = 3. Cumulative attack severity score was the sum of the maximum symptom severity scores recorded for each angioedema attack in a treatment period.
Cumulative attack-severity score normalized per month [(raw score/number of days of participation in that treatment period)*30.4] was reported here. Cumulative attack-severity score normalized per month ranged from 0 to 19.83 and higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Assess Disease Activity as Measured by the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) Normalized Per Month</title>
        <description>Disease activity was measured using a 98-day Angioedema Activity Score (AAS). The AAS collects information of disease activity in the last 24 hours. The following items are assessed: experience of swelling, severity of the swelling, timing of the swelling, extent of discomfort due to the swelling, extent that the swelling caused limitations in daily life, and feelings of being disfigured by the swelling. The instrument uses a binary response option for the first item and a three-point response scale for the 5 items thereafter. The daily AAS was the sum of the AAS items per day. Total daily ASS scores range between 0 and 15 points. Higher values stand for higher disease activity. The normalized 98-day AAS per month for a participant is calculated by (the sum of daily AAS within a treatment period/the number of days that a subject has AAS records within the treatment period)*30.4.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Scores From Baseline to Week 13</title>
        <description>The AE-QoL is a questionnaire on the quality of life of patients suffering from recurrent angioedema. It consists of 17 specific questions that are associated with work, physical activity, free time, social relations, and food. Each of the 17 questions has a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The AE-QoL consists of 4 dimensions (functioning=4 questions(qns) fatigue/mood=5 qns, fears/shame=6 qns, nutrition=2 qns) and a total score (all 17 questions).All scores were calculated by using the following formula: (Σ items - min Σ items / max Σ items - min Σ items) x 100. Σ items=sum of response by participant, min Σ items=minimum response possible, max Σ items=maximum response possible. Scores range from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Absolute change calculated as visit score at week 13 minus score at baseline per period.</description>
