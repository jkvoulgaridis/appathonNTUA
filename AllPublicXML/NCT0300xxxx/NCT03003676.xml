  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, phase I pilot study of sequential ONCOS-102 and pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma progressing after PD1 blockade. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine the safety of sequential treatment with ONCOS-102
      followed by pembrolizumab. The protocol aims to enroll patients into two cohorts: Part I: up
      to 12 patients will receive sequential treatment with ONCOS-102 followed by pembrolizumab.
      Part II: up to 12 patients will receive an initial treatment phase with ONCOS-102 followed by
      a treatment phase with ONCOS-102 in combination with pembrolizumab.

    <description>Part I: Patients will receive 3 doses of intratumoral (i.t.) injection of ONCOS-102 (days 1, 4, and 8) at 3x10^11 viral particles (VP), preceded by intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide priming 1-3 days prior to day 1.

Part II: Patients will receive 4 doses of intratumoral (i.t.) injection of ONCOS-102 (days 1, 4, 8 and 15) at 3x10^11 viral particles (VP), preceded by intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide priming 1-3 days prior to day 1. ONCOS-102 will be given in combination with Pembrolizumab starting on Day 22/Week 3 and every three weeks thereafter until Day 169/Week 24 or until unacceptable toxicity or clinically relevant disease progression, whichever occurs first.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A concomitant medical condition requiring receipt of a therapeutic anticoagulant that
             in the opinion of the treating physician cannot safely allow for therapeutic injection

             Lower dose steroids for conditions such as hypophysitis are allowed.

          -  Any prior severe adverse event attributed to prior anti-PD1 therapy that, in the
             Principal investigator's opinion, would contraindicate pembrolizumab administration

               -  Grade 4 AST or ALT elevation

               -  Grade 3 or higher colitis attributable to PD1 blockade; note that colitis

          -  Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy apart from

             daily equivalent of &gt;10 mg).

          -  Brain metastases that are clinically unstable (e.g. showing unequivocal growth on
             imaging, requiring radiation therapy, or steroids &gt;10mg of prednisone equivalent)
             within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.

          -  Known severe congenital or acquired cellular or humoral immunodeficiency such as
             common variable immunodeficiency.

          -  For US sites: Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding currently or are planning to
