  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2981278 is an inverse agonist of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)
      gamma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, clinical effect, and
      systemic exposure potential of topically applied GSK2981278 ointment in subjects with plaque
      psoriasis by treating all plaques on the body for 8 weeks. This single-center study will be
      conducted in two parts. Part A will be an open-label, single arm study and part B will be a
      double-blind, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study. In Part A, 8 adult
      subjects and in Part B, 18 adult subjects with chronic stable plaque psoriasis will be
      enrolled. Total duration of study will be approximately 14 weeks. The results of this study
      will provide preliminary information about safety and efficacy of the drug and will help in
      providing the guidance for further development strategy.

             confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral Oophorectomy
             (surgical menopause); b) Post-menopausal women including Females 60 years of age or
             older, A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an
             appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, more than 45 years, in the
             absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medical suppression of the menstrual
             cycle (e.g., leuprolide treatment). In questionable cases for women less than 60 years
             of age, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol
             falling into the central laboratory's post-menopausal reference range is confirmatory
             (these levels need to be adjusted for specific laboratories/assays. Females fewer than
             60 years of age, who are on HRT and wish to continue, and whose menopausal status is
             in doubt, should not be enrolled in this study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can enroll into the study and
             resume use of HRT.

             psoriasis erythroderma or pustular psoriasis).

          -  Current evidence of another ongoing or any acute cutaneous infection, history of
             repeated or chronic significant skin infections (unless irrelevant in the opinion of

          -  Clinically-relevant skin disease or other skin pathologies, that may, in the opinion
             of the investigator, contraindicate participation or interfere with skin evaluations.

          -  ALT more than 2x Upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin more than 1.5x ULN
             (isolated bilirubin more than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and
             direct bilirubin less than 35 percent).

             or QTcB more than 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. The QTcB should be
             based on single QTcB values of ECG obtained over a brief recording period. If QTcB is
             outside the threshold value, triplicate ECGs may be performed with the QTcB values
             averaged.

          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject at
             un-acceptable risk for the participation in the trial.

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years prior to dosing, except adequately treated
             non-invasive cancer of the skin (basal or squamous cell).

             before the Day 1 visit and during the trial

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, influence the outcome of the trial in the 4 weeks before baseline visit
             and during the trial.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  For Part B only-the subject has participated in Part A of this study.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 4 weeks, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
             (e.g., exposure to sunlight other than that associated with usual daily activities,
             use of tanning booth, etc.) within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit or intention to
             have such exposure during the study, thought by the investigator likely to modify the
             subject's psoriasis.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             subject should not participate in the clinical trial, e.g. due to probable
             noncompliance, inability to understand the trial and give adequately informed consent,
             or inability to complete the Psoriasis Symptom Diary.

          -  Close affiliation with the investigator (e.g. a close relative) or persons working at
             bioskin GmbH or subject is an employee of sponsor.

        <description>The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic. A pH greater than 7 is basic. Urine samples were collected from participants and urine pH levels were assessed at Baseline, Day 15, Day 29 and Day 57. Last observation values collected prior to the first application of study treatment were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth effect, other situations and is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function. The analysis was performed on Safety analysis set Population which comprised of all participants exposed to at least 1 application of study medication.

It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. The 5-point scale ranges from 0=clear to 4=severe. Last observation values collected prior to the first application of study treatment were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated as by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from baseline value by Baseline value and multiplying it by 100.

        <title>Mean Percent Change in PASI From Baseline to Week 8: Part B</title>
        <description>The PASI is a standard tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that considers the overall severity of erythema, thickness, and scale, and the extent of body surface area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0=none to 4=severe) and the percent BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0= 0% skin with psoriasis to 6=&gt;=90% skin with psoriasis). The individual scores are multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region; the sum of these scores gives the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Last observation values collected were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from baseline value by Baseline value and multiplying it by 100. This analysis was planned but not performed for Part B as the study was terminated during Part A.</description>

          <title>Mean Percent Change in PASI From Baseline to Week 8: Part B</title>
          <description>The PASI is a standard tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that considers the overall severity of erythema, thickness, and scale, and the extent of body surface area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0=none to 4=severe) and the percent BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0= 0% skin with psoriasis to 6=&gt;=90% skin with psoriasis). The individual scores are multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region; the sum of these scores gives the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Last observation values collected were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from baseline value by Baseline value and multiplying it by 100. This analysis was planned but not performed for Part B as the study was terminated during Part A.</description>

        <description>The TPSS is the measure of clinical effect of GSK2981278. A target lesion of at least 9 centimeter square (cm^2) with a TPSS &gt;=5 and an induration sub score &gt;=2 was selected at Baseline. TPSS Total score was calculated by adding the individual scores of erythema, scaling, and induration (plaque thickness), assessed by the investigator on a 5-point scale ranging from 0=none to 4=very marked. Last observation values collected prior to the first application of study treatment were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from Baseline value by Baseline value and multiplying it by 100. The analysis was performed on per protocol (PP) analysis Population which comprised of all participants eligible for treatment phase and who comply closely with the protocol.</description>

        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant's psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. The 5-point scale ranges from 0=clear to 4=severe. Last observation values collected prior to the first application of study treatment were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from baseline value by Baseline value and multiplying it by 100.</description>
