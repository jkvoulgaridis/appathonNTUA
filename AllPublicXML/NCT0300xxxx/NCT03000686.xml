  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to examine how GSK2586881, a recombinant human ACE2 peptide,
      modulates the acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) response in healthy volunteers.
      The study will be single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled and double blind (sponsor
      open). Subjects will be randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of GSK2586881 or
      placebo (saline) in a crossover design. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      effect of a single IV dose of GSK2586881 on the HPV response in healthy volunteers during
      exercise under hypoxic conditions. Approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled for a maximum
      of 56 days.

    <measure>Change From Baseline of Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure (PASP) Measured Via Echocardiography-Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day1, predose) and 15 minutes post-infusion, 60 minutes post-chamber entry, immediately post-exercise and 30 minutes post-chamber exit in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Echocardiograms (Echo) were obtained at indicated time points with the participant resting supine or lying on their left side. PASP was determined by measuring maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity and applying the modified Bernoulli equation to convert this value into pressure values. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian repeated measures model adjusting for: participant-level and period-adjusted Baselines, treatment, time and period. Time by treatment and time by period-adjusted Baseline interactions were included. Participant-level Baseline is the mean of two period-specific Baselines. Period-adjusted Baseline is the difference between the period-specific Baseline and participant-level Baseline for each period. No transformation has been applied to the data. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is presented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 40 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion
             criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included
             only if the investigator [in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required] agree
             and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures. Note: Screened subjects with laboratory
             values outside of the normal range may be repeated once for inclusion into the study
             at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Screening echocardiogram of good quality, without clinically significant
             abnormalities, and with mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation sufficient for the
             reliable estimation of PASP, as determined by the echocardiography core laboratory or
             responsible cardiologist. Screening PASP within the normal range according to site
             standards.

          -  Subjects have not resided at an altitude &gt;1500 meter (m) for more than 7 days in the
             last 4 month

          -  Able to complete all study procedures.

          -  Any contraindication (orthopedic, cardiac etc.) to perform exercise on a bicycle
             ergometer.

          -  Body weight 50 to 100 kilogram (kg) (inclusive).

          -  Male or female (non Child Bearing Potential): Male subjects with female partners of
             child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from
             the time of first dose of study medication until at least five half-lives of study
             medication OR for a cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal half-lives after
             the last dose of study medication. a. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. b.
             Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options (Contraceptive
             subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Oral Contraceptive-
             either combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal
             ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches). This is an all-inclusive list of those
             methods that meet the following GSK definition of highly effective: having a failure
             rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when
             applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non-product methods (e.g., male
             sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK
             definition is based on the definition provided by the International Conference on
             Harmonization (ICH).The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects
             understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. A female subject is
             eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human
             chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and the following condition
             applies: Non-reproductive potential defined as, 1. Pre-menopausal females with one of
             the following (Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy,
             Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy). 2. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause
             (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels)]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. The investigator is responsible for
             ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

        <title>Change From Baseline of Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure (PASP) Measured Via Echocardiography-Part 1</title>
        <description>Echocardiograms (Echo) were obtained at indicated time points with the participant resting supine or lying on their left side. PASP was determined by measuring maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity and applying the modified Bernoulli equation to convert this value into pressure values. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian repeated measures model adjusting for: participant-level and period-adjusted Baselines, treatment, time and period. Time by treatment and time by period-adjusted Baseline interactions were included. Participant-level Baseline is the mean of two period-specific Baselines. Period-adjusted Baseline is the difference between the period-specific Baseline and participant-level Baseline for each period. No transformation has been applied to the data. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is presented.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered a single IV dose of placebo in either treatment period 1 or 2 during Part 1 of the study. During each period, approximately 30 minutes after administration of study treatment, the participants entered the hypoxia chamber and were inside the chamber for approximately 80 minutes, during which they were under the full 4000 meters ± 10% hypoxic conditions. Participants then performed an exercise challenge at 70% of maximum VO2 uptake on an upright cycle ergometer within the hypoxia chamber for 10 minutes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of PASP Measured Via Echocardiography-Part 2</title>
        <description>Echocardiograms were obtained with participant resting supine or lying on their left side. Echo during exercise challenge was conducted with participant on a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer tilted by 30 to 40 degrees. PASP was determined by measuring maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity and applying modified Bernoulli equation to convert this value into pressure values. Change from Baseline is the post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian repeated measures model adjusting for: participant-level and period-adjusted Baselines, treatment, time and period. Time by treatment and time by period-adjusted Baseline interactions were included. Participant-level Baseline is the mean of the two period-specific Baselines. Period-adjusted Baseline is the difference between the period-specific Baseline and participant-level Baseline for each period. No transformation has been applied to the data. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is presented.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered a single IV dose of placebo in either treatment period 1 or 2 during Part 2 of the study. During each period, approximately 30 minutes after administration of the study treatment, participants entered the hypoxia chamber and were inside the chamber for approximately 80 minutes, during which they were under the full 5000 meters ± 10% hypoxic conditions. Participants then performed an exercise challenge at 50% of maximum VO2 uptake on a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer within the hypoxia chamber for 10 minutes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)-Part 1</title>
        <description>SBP and DBP were measured in a semi-supine position after 5 minutes of rest for the participant. Baseline is defined as the measurement taken pre-dose during each treatment period (Day1, pre-dose). Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered a single IV dose of placebo in either treatment period 1 or 2 during Part 1 of the study. During each period, approximately 30 minutes after administration of study treatment, the participants entered the hypoxia chamber and were inside the chamber for approximately 80 minutes, during which they were under the full 4000 meters ± 10% hypoxic conditions. Participants then performed an exercise challenge at 70% of maximum VO2 uptake on an upright cycle ergometer within the hypoxia chamber for 10 minutes.</description>

        <description>Oxygen saturation was monitored continuously using pulse oximetry. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian repeated measures model adjusting for: participant-level and period-adjusted Baselines, treatment, time and period. Time by treatment and time by period-adjusted baseline interactions were included. Participant-level Baseline is defined as the mean of the two period-specific baselines. Period-adjusted baseline is defined as the difference between the period-specific baseline and participant-level baseline for each period. No transformation has been applied to the data. Non-informative priors used. Baseline is defined as the measurement taken pre-dose during each treatment period (Day1, pre-dose). Change from Baseline is the post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Oxygen Saturation-Part 2</title>
        <description>Oxygen saturation was monitored continuously using pulse oximetry. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian repeated measures model adjusting for: participant-level and period-adjusted Baselines, treatment, time and period. Time by treatment and time by period-adjusted baseline interactions were included. Participant-level Baseline is defined as the mean of the two period-specific baselines. Period-adjusted baseline is defined as the difference between the period-specific baseline and participant-level baseline for each period. No transformation has been applied to the data. Non-informative priors used. Baseline is defined as the measurement taken pre-dose during each treatment period (Day1, pre-dose). Change from Baseline is the post-dose visit value minus Baseline value. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is presented.</description>

ECG was measured in a semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. Clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) abnormal ECG findings have been presented. CS abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal ECG Findings-Part 2</title>
        <description>Twelve lead ECGs were obtained using an automated ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR, QRS, QT and QTc intervals. ECG was measured in a semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. Clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) abnormal ECG findings have been presented. CS abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>
