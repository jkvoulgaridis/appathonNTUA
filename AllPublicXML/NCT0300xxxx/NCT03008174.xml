  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with tracheostomy who are on and off of mechanical ventilation initially lose the
      ability to speak, and the use of one-way speaking valves (OWSV) is one method of restoring
      speech in these patients. Patients with tracheostomy who experience loss of speech report
      frustration and feelings of confinement from patients' communication impairment, therefore
      investigators would like to restore speech in these patients as soon as it is safe to do so.
      However, there is currently little known in the literature about the timing of the use of
      OWSV in patients with tracheostomy. Therefore, the investigators propose a pre-test post-test
      clinical trial pilot study to investigate the safety of early use of OWSV in patients
      undergoing a percutaneous tracheostomy. Study aims are to identify patients who would benefit
      from the early use of OWSV and to determine the effects of early use of OWSV on speech and
      clinical outcomes. To achieve these aims, patients who undergo percutaneous tracheostomy will
      be screened, and patients meeting screening criteria will be randomized into intervention and
      control groups. The intervention group will receive early speech-language pathology (SLP)
      evaluation and OWSV trial at 12-24 hours following tracheostomy procedure, and the control
      group will receive standard SLP evaluation and OWSV trial at 48-60 hours following
      tracheostomy procedure. Intervention and control groups will been compared on speech and
      clinical outcomes measures from pre-test at 12-24 hours following tracheostomy and post-test
      at 48-60 hours following tracheostomy and characteristics of patients who successfully
      tolerate early OWSV use will be identified.

          <title>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score</title>
          <description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is a scoring system that assesses the performance of several organ systems in the body (neurologic, blood, liver, kidney, and blood pressure/hemodynamics) and assigns a score based on the data obtained in each category. SOFA scores will be reported on a scale of 0 - 24. The lower the score, the patient is not sick and the higher the score, the patient is sicker.</description>
