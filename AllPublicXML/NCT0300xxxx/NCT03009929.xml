    <textblock>
      Whereas there are several validated systems for reporting postoperative complications, there
      are only a few and not prospectively validated systems for reporting intraoperative
      complications. The investigators developed a definition and CLASSification for Intraoperative
      Complications CLASSIC within a Delphi study involving international interdisciplinary
      experts. As both surgery and anaesthesia may be involved in complications in the
      perioperative period, all patient-related intraoperative complications occurring between skin
      incision and closure are considered in this reporting system. CLASSIC was updated to
      ClassIntra® v1·0, by encompassing five severity grades to align with the validated
      Clavien-Dindo Classification for grading postoperative complications.

      The aim of this international multicentre observational cohort study is to assess the
      validity and practicability of this newly derived and updated classification system
      ClassIntra® in patient undergoing an in-hospital surgical procedure. Providing an easy
      applicable and internationally validated classification system is a contribution to improve
      quality of health care and patient safety.
