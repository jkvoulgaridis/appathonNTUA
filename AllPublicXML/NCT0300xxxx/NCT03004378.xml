  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether the short-term use of activity tracking devices improves
      short-term weight loss in adolescents. The investigators will evaluate whether weight loss
      translates into a change in obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent obesity. In
      addition, the investigators will report outcomes after the implementation of activity
      tracking devices in conjunction with an intense adolescent weight loss program.

      This study will evaluate the short-term use of activity tracking devices and their effects on
      short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents. The investigators plan to establish whether
      weight loss translates into a change in obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent
      obesity. Each participant with an activity tracking device will have the goal of reaching
      10,000 steps per day, in addition to their individual fitness plan.
