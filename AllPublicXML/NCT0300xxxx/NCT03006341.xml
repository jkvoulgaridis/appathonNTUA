  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are, first, to identify select clinical covariates from
      electronic medical records (EMR) that might be associated with initiation of oral
      anticoagulant medications (dabigatran or warfarin) in patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF) at risk for stroke; second, to quantify the association between EMR-based
      clinical characteristics and patterns of insurance claims; third, to assess the potential for
      unmeasured confounding in dabigatran vs warfarin comparative effectiveness and safety studies
      based on administrative claims databases.

The patients with light to moderate, heavy and unknown quantity of alcohol consumption are considered. The results are provided before and after propensity score (PS) matching. Before PS matching: all patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria successfully linked to EMR whose data were available; After PS matching: all patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria successfully linked to EMR, 1:1 propensity score matched, whose data were available.</description>
          <population>Two sets of results are provided, before and after PS matching. Rivaroxaban and Apixaban correspond to post-hoc analyses not pre-specified in the protocol and hence not included in the outcome measures.</population>

Response was considered to be truly absent if not recorded in the EMR. The results are provided before and after propensity score (PS) matching.
