      This trial will be a double-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SAN021 study drug when administered for up
      to 42 days to adults between the ages of 18 to 65 years who have a clinical diagnosis of
      mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis.

      Patients will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent and photographic consent
      process has been completed. Patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, as defined by a
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score between 2 and 12, appropriate for topical
      treatment that covers a minimum of 1.0% and a maximum of 10% BSA, in the permitted treatment
      areas, and who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      Once subject eligibility is confirmed and the screening procedures completed, all enrolled
      subjects will start the Treatment Period of the study. All enrolled subjects will receive
      either 10% SAN021 or placebo serum (randomized in a 2:1 ratio) with the first dose applied at
      the Day 1 Study Visit. Subjects will be instructed on how to apply the study medication twice
      daily for 42 days.

      Subjects will return to the clinic for study-related assessments on Study Days 7, 14, 28 and
      a final visit on Day 42. On Study Day 49, subject will receive a Follow-up phone call and be
      queried for condition status since going off study.
