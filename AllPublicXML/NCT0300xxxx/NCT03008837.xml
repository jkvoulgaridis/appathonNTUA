  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given recent increasing opioid-related deaths and evidence showing against the use of opioids
      for non-malignant chronic pain, there is growing need for non-narcotic pain management.
      Fibromyalgia is a difficult to treat chronic pain condition that is often treated with
      opioids despite existing evidence. The prevalence of fibromyalgia is increased among Veterans
      returning from the gulf war and is already a significant burden in senior Veterans who may
      have suffered with chronic pain for decades already. Many treatment options for fibromyalgia
      carry intolerable side effects. PENFS (percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation) is a
      FDA-approved, non-pharmacologic therapy that is currently utilized within the military and VA
      system, but sufficient evidence regarding its outcomes and neural mechanisms have not been
      adequately investigated. An understanding of its neural underpinnings and analgesic effects
      could lead to 1) improvements in pain management and quality of life, 2) cost-savings and 3)
      development of new techniques to address pain.

      BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that consists of chronic widespread pain,
      decreased physical function, fatigue, psychoemotional/sleep disturbances, and various somatic
      complaints, affecting anywhere from 5-10 million Americans, with ~1,500 Veterans carrying a
      diagnosis of fibromyalgia seen per year at the Atlanta VAMC alone. It is estimated that
      fibromyalgia costs the American population over $20 billion/year in lost wages and
      disability. Initial therapies often include complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
      therapies, which are generally considered safe, although their efficacy has not been
      thoroughly evaluated for fibromyalgia. Thus, non-pharmacologic alternatives require more
      rigorous scientific investigation for the treatment of fibromyalgia. There is evidence to
      support the use of percutaneous electrical neural stimulation (PENS) in the treatment of pain
      conditions, which may have increased effects relative to acupuncture based on systematic
      reviews. While fMRI data for acupuncture and fibromyalgia exists, no such data exists for
      PENS treatment. An evolved form of PENS, percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation
      (PENFS) of the auricle is already used in the military and VA systems for the treatment of
      chronic pain, but evidence regarding its mechanisms and effects is lacking. Stimulation of
      the vagus nerve, which has auricular branches, has been previously studied for pain relief in
      fibromyalgia. However, application of PENS-type stimulation to the auricle has not been
      previously studied with fMRI, and this type of therapy may lead to neural changes worthy of
      further exploration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of using fMRI as a biomarker for
      the neural substrates of pain and functional changes following PENFS treatments. HYPOTHESIS:
      PENFS will result in decreased functional connectivity between the insula and default mode
      network as evaluated by fMRI, which will correlate to more significant improvements in pain
      and function relative to standard therapy for fibromyalgia. METHODS: Subjects who meet study
      criteria will receive baseline assessments including resting state fMRI, collection of
      biobehavioural information such as cognitive and psychological assessments on standardized
      forms, eating, sleeping and drinking habits, Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS),
      arm curl, 30-s chair stand, and pain interference scores. Subjects will be stratified based
      on age and gender and then divided into standard therapy control (medication management and
      physical therapy) or PENFS (series of 4, weekly) treatments and assessed for fMRI changes 2
      weeks after the final treatment. Pain and function will also be assessed at the 2 weeks, 6
      weeks and 12 weeks following the final treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Auricular PENFS has not
      been studied with fMRI. Stimulation of the auricle may produce neural changes that differ
      from traditional therapies. Understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of auricular PENFS
      could assist in developing targeted treatments for fibromyalgia and chronic pain. Further, if
      PENFS can significantly improve pain relief and function over standard therapies, it could
      decrease the need for opioid analgesics and their associated risks, which is a primary
      objective of the VA Opioid Safety Initiative. The present investigation will not only serve
      to elucidate neural changes with PENFS, but could be directly applicable to our Veterans
      suffering from fibromyalgia by providing evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of
      this already clinically-employed non-pharmacologic treatment (or lack thereof), and result in
      evidence-based implementation and potential cost savings to the VA system.

    <description>2 weeks following the final treatment, subjects in the PENFS group were be evaluated for changes in functional connectivity between the right posterior insula seed and other areas of the DMN as evaluated by fcMRI relative to standard treatment controls, using whole brain analysis. The measurement is increase/decrease of signal in a given region, thresholded at p &lt;0.05, summarized into a value representing 'size of region of increase' or 'size of region of decrease' after subjects scans were combined/mapped onto a standard MNI brain. Only clusters of over 40 voxels were included, and the size of the region is reported in voxel size. The averaged brains for baseline fcMRI was subtracted from post-treatment for each group, and then these averaged differences were subtracted from each other. While other areas of the brain met threshold criteria in the analysis, only areas belonging to the DMN are reported.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must not be currently pregnant, since effects of fMRI and electrical current
             on the developing fetus are not well-known.

          -  Subjects must not have an implanted electrical device such as a vagal stimulator,
             pacemaker, or spinal pain pump, which are not compatible with MRI.

          -  Subjects must not have a history of seizures or neurologic condition that may alter
             the structure of the brain.

          -  Subjects must not have a history of drug abuse or severe, uncontrolled psychiatric
             illness such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation.

        <title>fcMRI as a Biomarker to Investigate Functionally Correlated Neural Substrates of Pain in Patients Undergoing PENFS</title>
        <description>2 weeks following the final treatment, subjects in the PENFS group were be evaluated for changes in functional connectivity between the right posterior insula seed and other areas of the DMN as evaluated by fcMRI relative to standard treatment controls, using whole brain analysis. The measurement is increase/decrease of signal in a given region, thresholded at p &lt;0.05, summarized into a value representing 'size of region of increase' or 'size of region of decrease' after subjects scans were combined/mapped onto a standard MNI brain. Only clusters of over 40 voxels were included, and the size of the region is reported in voxel size. The averaged brains for baseline fcMRI was subtracted from post-treatment for each group, and then these averaged differences were subtracted from each other. While other areas of the brain met threshold criteria in the analysis, only areas belonging to the DMN are reported.</description>

        <description>For fibromyalgia patients, pain will be assessed in the PENFS group relative to standard treatment controls, as indicated by analgesic Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) at 2, 6 and 12 weeks follow-up. This is a validated pain measure that includes a 0-10 scale where 0 means no pain and 10 means greatest pain imaginable. Higher scores indicate worse reported pain outcomes.</description>

            <description>Veterans with fibromyalgia who meet study criteria and are randomized to the experimental group will receive standard therapy in addition to percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation (PENFS), which involves placement of small electrodes through a similar process to ear acupuncture to the ear. These electrodes are attached to a battery pack that is taped behind the ear and worn for 5-day intervals. The intention of this FDA-approved device is to relieve pain, though data on its effectiveness is still limited. Device placement (series of 4, weekly) will be performed by an Anesthesiology Pain Clinic provider. fMRI evaluation of neural changes, assessment of function and quality of life improvements will be performed at the beginning and end of the study.

        <title>Change in Pain Interference With &quot;Activity,&quot; &quot;Sleep,&quot; &quot;Mood&quot;, and &quot;Stress&quot; From Baseline</title>
        <description>Pain interference scores were measured using supplemental questions on the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS). Participants were asked to evaluate on a scale of 0-10 the level to which pain interfered with their &quot;activity,&quot; &quot;sleep,&quot; &quot;mood&quot;, and &quot;stress,&quot; with 10 being the worst interference, and 0 being no interference.</description>
        <time_frame>2, 6 and 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
        <population>Not all individuals presented for all follow-up visits, but all participants included in the analysis were present for baseline assessments, pre- and post- imaging studies, and at least one follow-up visit. Missing data was not imputed and not used for analysis in order to avoid distortions related to imputation in the small sample size.</population>

            <title>PENFS</title>
            <description>Veterans with fibromyalgia who meet study criteria and are randomized to the experimental group will receive standard therapy in addition to percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation (PENFS), which involves placement of small electrodes through a similar process to ear acupuncture to the ear. These electrodes are attached to a battery pack that is taped behind the ear and worn for 5-day intervals. The intention of this FDA-approved device is to relieve pain, though data on its effectiveness is still limited. Device placement (series of 4, weekly) will be performed by an Anesthesiology Pain Clinic provider. fMRI evaluation of neural changes, assessment of function and quality of life improvements will be performed at the beginning and end of the study.

            <description>Veterans with fibromyalgia who meet study criteria and are randomized to the experimental group will receive standard therapy in addition to percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation (PENFS), which involves placement of small electrodes through a similar process to ear acupuncture to the ear. These electrodes are attached to a battery pack that is taped behind the ear and worn for 5-day intervals. The intention of this FDA-approved device is to relieve pain, though data on its effectiveness is still limited. Device placement (series of 4, weekly) will be performed by an Anesthesiology Pain Clinic provider. fMRI evaluation of neural changes, assessment of function and quality of life improvements will be performed at the beginning and end of the study.</description>

          <title>PENFS</title>
          <description>Veterans with fibromyalgia who meet study criteria and are randomized to the experimental group will receive standard therapy in addition to percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation (PENFS), which involves placement of small electrodes through a similar process to ear acupuncture to the ear. These electrodes are attached to a battery pack that is taped behind the ear and worn for 5-day intervals. The intention of this FDA-approved device is to relieve pain, though data on its effectiveness is still limited. Device placement (series of 4, weekly) will be performed by an Anesthesiology Pain Clinic provider. fMRI evaluation of neural changes, assessment of function and quality of life improvements will be performed at the beginning and end of the study.</description>
