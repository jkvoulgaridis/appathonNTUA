      This study is an open-label, baseline-controlled, single-center study to measure the change
      in skin elasticity after combined radio frequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field
      (PEMF) treatment. Forty-five adult females will undergo weekly treatments over a period of 8
      weeks. Skin elasticity will be measured by a Cutometer® prior to beginning treatment, week 7
      and 3 months after completion of treatment. Photographs will be taken prior to treatment, at
      week 4, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment. Patient discomfort/pain and
      satisfaction questionnaires will be completed before, during and after treatment.

    <time_frame>20 weeks after the last study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A Cutometer® will be used to measure the change in gross elasticity (R2) of the facial skin as calculated by Ua/Uf which is a ratio of maximum recovery (Ua) and skin distensibility (Uf). The value is expressed as a percentage, the closer the value is to 1 (100%), the more elastic the skin.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Subject Satisfaction With Facial Skin Laxity Compared to Baseline as Measured by the 5-point Likert Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks and 20 weeks post study treatments</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will assign a score that best represents the level of satisfaction they have in their appearance as a result of the study treatment. The scale reports five categories - 4 - very satisfied; 3 - satisfied; 2 - having no opinion; 1 - unsatisfied and 0 - very unsatisfied. The higher the score, the more satisfaction with the treatment that a subject reports.</description>

    <measure>General Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks and 20 weeks post study treatments.</time_frame>
    <description>Subject to assess their general improvement in appearance at 7 and 20 weeks post-intervention using a 7 category scale: 3 - very much improved; 2 - much improved; 1 - improved; 0 - no change; -1 - worse; -2 - much worse and -3 very much worse. The higher the positive score, the more the subject feels their appearance has changed for the better.</description>

        <title>Change in Facial Skin Elasticity</title>
        <description>A Cutometer® will be used to measure the change in gross elasticity (R2) of the facial skin as calculated by Ua/Uf which is a ratio of maximum recovery (Ua) and skin distensibility (Uf). The value is expressed as a percentage, the closer the value is to 1 (100%), the more elastic the skin.</description>

The study treatment consists of Glide (medical grade glycerin) being applied thoroughly to the study treatment area (face). The energy will be delivered by the Diamondpolar applicator attached to the Venus Versa, a medical device approved by health regulatory authorities, to deliver combined radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) energies. Change in skin elasticity will be measured by Cutometer. Change in appearance will be assessed by independent reviewer using photographs.
Cutometer: Skin elasticity will be measured by a Cutometer prior to beginning treatment, week 7 and 3 months after completion of the treatment.
Photographs: Photographs will be taken prior to beginning treatment, week 7 and 3 months after completion of the treatment.</description>

        <description>Subject will assign a score that best represents the level of satisfaction they have in their appearance as a result of the study treatment. The scale reports five categories - 4 - very satisfied; 3 - satisfied; 2 - having no opinion; 1 - unsatisfied and 0 - very unsatisfied.
