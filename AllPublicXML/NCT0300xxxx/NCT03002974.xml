  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how anakinra relieves pain for patients with acute
      gout that cannot take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine. The
      patients will be divided in different treatment groups to compare anakinra to the available
      drug triamcinolone.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to treatment at their first gout flare in the study. The first
      treatment period will be followed by an extension period during which the patients will
      receive the same treatment for any subsequent flares within 52 weeks of randomization of last
      patient in the study. The extension period for the individual patient in the study will be
      maximum two years (104 weeks). Each new flare treated will initiate a new series of study
      visits and assessments according to specified schedule of events. Only if a patient
      experience a new flare after Day 15 of the latest flare they can start a new treatment
      period. The comparison of primary interest is between anakinra (100 mg and 200 mg combined)
      and 40 mg triamcinolone, and as a secondary objective the 2 different doses of anakinra will
      be evaluated as well as assessment for subsequent flares.

    <measure>Percent Impairment While Working During Last Week Due to Gout During the First Flare and Subsequent Flares</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded up to Day 15 for the first flare and subsequent flares treated during the extension period</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI yeilds four types of scores of which Work productivity loss is one.
SHP is derived from WPAI as follows:
The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity as follows:
Questions:
Q1 = currently employed Q2 = hours missed due to specified problem Q3 = hours missed other reasons Q4 = hours actually worked Q5 = degree problem affected productivity while working Q6 = degree problem affected regular activities
Scores:
Multiply scores by 100 to express in percentages. Percent impairment while working due to problem: Q5/10 The answer on Q5 is given on a scale from 0 (PROBLEM had no effect on work) to 10 (PROBLEM completely prevented me from working).
Thus the analysis values from which mean and SD have been calculated and reported are the outcomes from Q5 (ranging from 0 to 10) multiplied with 100 and divided by 10.</description>

        <description>Exploratory objective. The EQ-5D-5L, a self-report questionnaire, is a descriptive system of Health related quality of life (HRQL) states consisting of 5 dimensions (Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/Depression), each of which can have 5 responses. The responses record 5 levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension.</description>

        <title>Percent Impairment While Working During Last Week Due to Gout During the First Flare and Subsequent Flares</title>
        <description>The WPAI yeilds four types of scores of which Work productivity loss is one.
SHP is derived from WPAI as follows:
The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity as follows:
Questions:
Q1 = currently employed Q2 = hours missed due to specified problem Q3 = hours missed other reasons Q4 = hours actually worked Q5 = degree problem affected productivity while working Q6 = degree problem affected regular activities
Scores:
Multiply scores by 100 to express in percentages. Percent impairment while working due to problem: Q5/10 The answer on Q5 is given on a scale from 0 (PROBLEM had no effect on work) to 10 (PROBLEM completely prevented me from working).
Thus the analysis values from which mean and SD have been calculated and reported are the outcomes from Q5 (ranging from 0 to 10) multiplied with 100 and divided by 10.</description>
