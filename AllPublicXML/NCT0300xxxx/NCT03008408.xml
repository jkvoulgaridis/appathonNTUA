  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well everolimus and letrozole with or without ribociclib work
      in treating participants with endometrial cancer that has spread to other areas of the body
      or has come back. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as everolimus and letrozole,
      work in different ways to sop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib,
      everolimus, and letrozole may work better than everolimus and letrozole in treating
      participants with endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the addition of ribociclib (LEE011) to everolimus and letrozole improves
      progression free survival in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine clinical benefit and the median duration of progression-free survival (PFS)
      and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma
      treated with ribociclib (LEE011), everolimus and letrozole versus everolimus and letrozole
      alone.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with ribociclib
      (LEE011), everolimus (RAD001), and letrozole in this cohort of patients.

      III. To determine the presence of a CTNNB1 mutation is associated with response to ribociclib
      (LEE011), everolimus (RAD001), and letrozole.

      IV. To determine if liquid biopsies at baseline and 8 weeks correlate with presence of a
      tissue mutation or response to therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ribociclib in patients with
      advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD), everolimus PO QD, and
      letrozole PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus PO QD and letrozole PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has signed the informed consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being
             performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid and
             mixed endometrioid tumors, any grade).

          -  Patients must have advanced or recurrent disease that is refractory to curative
             treatment based on imaging or clinical exam.

          -  Patient must consent to allow for a baseline tumor biopsy. Tumor material from
             biopsies done before the screening period are acceptable if the biopsy was performed
             within 3 months prior to the planned treatment start and no other systemic cancer
             therapy was administered in the interim. If a biopsy is performed and the specimen is
             considered non-diagnostic, does not have enough tissue, or the biopsy is deemed
             infeasible to perform, this does not prevent the patient from proceeding with the
             treatment

          -  Patients must have had no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for recurrent
             endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation
             as a radio-sensitizer is not counted as a prior treatment for recurrent or advanced
             disease.

          -  Prior radiation therapy of any kind is allowed.

          -  Prior treatment with letrozole is allowed if the patient meets the washout period of
             10 days.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 defined as at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (&gt;= 10 mm longest dimension to be
             recorded; Lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm per short axis). Each lesion must be &gt; 20 mm
             when measured by palpation or conventional imaging techniques (computed tomography
             [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] - based on primary physician preference) or &gt;
             10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice
             thickness in millimeters. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented. Ascites and
             pleural effusions are not considered measurable disease. If the measurable disease is
             confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by
             cytology/histology.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential. Patients
             are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they
             have undergone a total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for greater than 12 months (if patient is
             uncertain of amenorrhea for 12 months, a pregnancy test will be done to confirm
             pregnancy status). Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously
             menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol &lt; 10 pm/mL to
             confirm ovarian senescence.

          -  Patients must be off all other anti-tumor therapies (including immunologic agents) for
             at least four weeks prior to study registration. Patients on hormonal agents require a
             washout for 10 days.

          -  Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L (at screening).

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L (at screening).

             aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). If the patient has liver
             metastases, ALT and AST &lt; 5 x ULN (at screening).

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; ULN; or total bilirubin =&lt; 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x
             ULN in patients with well-documented Gilbert's syndrome (at screening).

          -  Fasting serum cholesterol =&lt; 240 mg/dL or =&lt; 7.75 mmol/L and fasting triglycerides =&lt;
             2.5 x ULN (at screening).

               -  NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only
                  be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication.

          -  Patient with available standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) with the following
             parameters at screening: a. Corrected QT interval by Fridericia's formula (QTcF)

          -  Patient has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to
             National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)

             taxane-induced neuropathy, any grade of alopecia, amenorrhea or other toxicities not
             considered a safety risk for the patient as per investigator's discretion are allowed
             to enter the study).

          -  Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not
             recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).

          -  Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that
             would, in the investigator's judgment, may cause unacceptable safety risks,
             contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance
             with the protocol (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active
             untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.).
