    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib when giving together
      with doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with soft tissue sarcomas that has spread
      to other places or that cannot be removed by surgery (advanced). Ribociclib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Giving ribociclib and doxorubicin hydrochloride may work better in treating
      patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ribociclib in combination with
      doxorubicin in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin in
      subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas.

      II. To characterize the safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with
      doxorubicin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ribociclib.

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily on days 1-7, and doxorubicin hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on day 10. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients without disease progression after 6 cycles receive ribociclib PO daily
      on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every
      12 weeks for 12 months.
