  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention and control of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) are most important
      in treatment of cancer patients. CINV is one of the most distressing severe side effects of
      cancer treatment and can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. The
      chemotherapy agents that cause the worst degree of nausea and vomiting are categorized into
      two groups: moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and highly emetogenic chemotherapy
      (HEC). Nausea and vomiting that occurs within the first day of the administration of
      chemotherapy agents is considered acute CINV, while nausea and vomiting following 24 hours of
      the administration of chemotherapy agents is considered delayed CINV. Refractory CINV occurs
      when patients develop CINV during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy when drugs preventing
      vomiting and nausea (antiemetic prophylaxis) has not been successful in controlling CINV in
      earlier cycles. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Akynzeo in the
      treatment of refractory CINV

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-center, single-arm, open-label, feasibility trial using a fixed
      dose combination of netupitant and palonosetron (Akynzeo®) in the treatment of refractory
      CINV. The primary aim of this study is feasibility, defined as 70% completion rate of all
      study procedures over 7 days.

      Eligible subjects will be identified in weekly palliative care patient triage meetings.
      Patients who are 18 years of age or older, have histologically confirmed cancer, and
      confirmed refractory CINV will be eligible. After obtaining written informed consent and
      verifying that the study subject meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will be enrolled
      in the study through the University California San Diego (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center Clinical
      Trials Office. Subjects will be allowed to participate only once in the study. Study Day 1
      will be the day of Akynzeo® dosing. Subjects will receive a single capsule of Akynzeo® (300
      mg of netupitant and 0.5 mg of palonosetron) on Study 1. Study drug may be taken with or
      without food. Subjects will complete a study drug diary to document date and time of Akynzeo®
      administration. On Study Day 1, the study coordinator will educate the subject on how to
      complete the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Antiemesis Tool,
      and Functional Living Index Emesis (FLIE) scale, and medication diary and each of these
      documents will be completed for that day. An adequate number of copies of each subject
      questionnaire and diary will be provided to the subject on Study Day 1 for completion at home
      during the post-treatment observation portion of the study (Study Days 2-7) as needed.

          <title>Number of Participants Completed All Study Procedures Over Seven Days</title>
          <description>The proposed study is a prospective, single-center, feasibility trial. The primary aim of this study is feasibility - specifically feasibility will be defined as completion of all study procedures over seven days.
For the primary aim, we assume an acceptable completion rate from strata of MEC/HEC or tumor types of all study-related procedures would be at least 70%. Assuming a true completion rate of 85%, a sample size of 50 patients would have an 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 15% at Type I error 0.05.</description>
