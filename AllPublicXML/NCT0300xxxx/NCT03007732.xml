      This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral
      SD-101 in patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab,
      and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist
      SD-101 in treating patients with prostate cancer and cancer in all oligometastatic sites that
      has spread to other places in the body. Androgen can cause the growth of tumor cells.
      Androgen deprivation therapy, such as leuprolide acetate, prednisone, and abiraterone acetate
      may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic
      body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the
      tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.
      Colony-stimulating factors, such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, may increase the production of blood
      cells. It is not yet known whether giving androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and
      stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without TLR9 agonist SD-101 may work better in
      treating patients with prostate cancer and cancer in all oligometastatic sites.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Cohort 1 (No longer recruiting)

           --To assess the safety associated with giving RT and pembrolizumab with or without
           intratumoral SD-101.

        -  Cohort 2

             -  To continue to assess the safety associated with giving RT and pembrolizumab with
                or without intratumoral SD-101.

             -  To assess if the rate of PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL at 15 months in patients with
                non-castrate levels of testosterone is greater than the historical control in each
                study arm.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To determine the rate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling in each study arm in cohort 2.
           Testosterone-PSA uncoupling is defined as PSA &lt; 50% baseline and &lt; 20ng/mL for at least
           3 months after testosterone recovers to &gt;150 ng/dL. In patients with metastatic hormone
           sensitive prostate cancer off hormonal therapy, &gt;90% patient are expected to have PSA
           increase to &gt; 50% baseline after 3 months of testosterone recovery.

        -  To estimate time to clinical progression

        -  To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in each study arm

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE

        -  To assess peripheral and tumor-based biomarkers of response and resistance in both
           cohorts.

        -  To define the treatment-induced effects on circulating immune cells in both cohorts.

        -  To explore remodeling of circulating T cell repertoire in both cohorts.

        -  To explore the concordance of PSMA-PET scanning with conventional imaging in
           oligometastatic prostate cancer patients in both cohorts.

    <description>Only patients in cohort 2, who achieve testosterone recovery to non-castrate levels (&gt;150 ng/dL) at 15 months, will be analyzed for the primary endpoint. The rate of PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL at 15 months from the start of radiotherapy and cycle 1, day 1 of pembrolizumab, among patients whose testosterone recovers to non-castrate levels (&gt;150 ng/dL). The point estimate of the rate of PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL will be obtained with its 95% confidence interval for participants by arm in cohort 2 and compared to the historical control rate by one sample binomial test. All patients who receive any part of a dose of RT, SD-101 or pembrolizumab will be analyzed for efficacy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling (Cohort 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Testosterone-PSA uncoupling is defined as PSA &lt; 50% baseline and &lt; 20ng/mL for at least 3 months after testosterone recovers to &gt;150 ng/dL. In patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer off hormonal therapy, &gt;90% patients are expected to have PSA increase to &gt; 50% baseline after 3 months of testosterone recovery. Therefore, the presence of PSA testosterone uncoupling in this study may serve as a surrogate of immunotherapeutic responses induced by pembrolizumab combined with RT (arm 1), or RT with SD-101 (arm 2), if a prolonged PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL is not achieved. The point estimate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling rate will be obtained with its 95% confidence interval for each arm in cohort 2.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Be &gt;=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Oligometastatic disease. In order to be eligible, the patient must have a total of &lt;4
             metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node sites based on bone and/or soft tissue
             lesions as defined by any of the following:

               1. Bone metastases will be defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium
                  bone scan, and/or sodium fluoride (NaF) PET performed, either study may be used
                  for documenting metastases; both scans do not need to show the number of
                  metastases required for study entry. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA
                  avid lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of
                  metastasis.

               2. Distant metastatic lymph node disease. A lymph node ≥1 cm in shortest dimension
                  will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be
                  determined as any lymph nodes outside the confines of the true pelvis. For
                  patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with
                  metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.

               3. Any other soft tissue lesion deemed by the physician to be consistent with
                  distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid
                  lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate consistent with metastasis will be
                  counted as a site of metastasis.

             case prednisone =&lt;10mg/day or its equivalent is allowed.

          -  Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis (TB)

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

          -  Note: Subjects with &lt;= Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may
             qualify for the study.

          -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include carcinoid, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ
             cervical cancer.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.
             This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless
             of clinical stability.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Expecting to father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with
             the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial
             treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (HCV) (i.e. HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 30 days.
