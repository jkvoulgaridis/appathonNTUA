      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 4 sites in the USA between 23Jan2017 and 02Nov2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 91 participants were screened, of which 32 participants were randomized in a 6:2 ratio to receive MEDI6012 or placebo in 4 cohorts (8 participants in each cohort). For Cohort 4, randomization happened in a 7:1 ratio to receive MEDI6012 or placebo due to an interactive voice/web response system programming issue.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience(immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are the events between first dose of study drug and up to 56 days after last dose of study drug (Day 66 for Cohort 4 and placebo IV push arm and Day 71 for Cohorts 1 to 3 and placebo arm) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Concentration for Total LCAT Activity</title>
        <description>Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a plasma enzyme secreted by the liver. Serum LCAT activity was estimated to provide an alternative measure to LCAT mass in establishing the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MEDI6012. Change in LCAT activity from baseline (pre-dose of each dose) to post doses was reported (concentration at Days 8, 15, and 22 for Cohorts 1 to 3 and placebo; Concentration at Days 3, 10, and 17 for Cohort 4 and placebo IV push arm).</description>
        <time_frame>Seven days post-dose following Doses 1 to 3 in Cohorts 1 to 3 and placebo arm (Days 8, 15, 22); 2 days post-dose following Dose 1 (Day 3) and 7 days post-dose following Doses 2 and 3 (Days 10, 17) in Cohort 4 and placbo IV push.</time_frame>
        <population>PK population included all participants in the as-treated population who had at least one detectable LCAT serum concentration measurement. LCAT activity at Day 3 and Day 17 were not collected for Cohort 4. The overall number of participants analyzed denotes the number of participants evaluated specific for this outcome measure.</population>
