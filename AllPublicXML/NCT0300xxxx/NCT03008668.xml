  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to undertake a rigorous multicentre randomised controlled trial,
      comparing acupuncture on sensitized acupoints with low/non-sensitive points or no acupuncture
      (waiting-list), to test if acupuncture on sensitized acupoints may result in improved
      treatment outcomes in patients with Knee osteoarthritis (KOA).The current pilot study aimed
      to assess the feasibility of performing the definitive randomised controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the intervention group received acupuncture treatment on the 5 most sensitized
      points/ acupoints.Patients in the control group received acupuncture treatment on the 5 least
      /non-sensitized points. All other treatment settings were the same as in the intervention
      group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index total score from baseline to 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 16 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 24 items assessing the knee osteoarthritis patients pain, stiffness, and physical function. Each of the 24 items will be graded on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting more pain, stiffness and poorer physical function</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Short Form (SF)-12 health survey score from baseline to 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 16 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 12 items: 2 items on physical functioning, 2 items on role limitations because of physical health problems,
1 item on bodily pain, 1 item on general health perceptions, 1 item on vitality (energy/fatigue), 1 item on social functioning, 2 items on role limitations because of emotional problems, and 2 items on general mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at 4 weeks after the acupuncture treatment and followed at 8, 12 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Expected adverse events (AEs) of the acupuncture interventions include bleeding, nausea/vomiting, fainting, bruising at needle sites, feeling hot/burning, and transient pain at needle sites. We defined serious adverse events (SAEs) as: death, hospitalization, significant disability or incapacity, any life-threatening situations or any other medically significant events that were potentially related to the trial procedures or acupuncture treatments. The AEs or SAEs were identified by the certified treating acupuncturists.</description>
