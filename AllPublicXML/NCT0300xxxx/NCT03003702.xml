  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, long term condition of the lungs
      that is usually caused by cigarette smoking. In addition to daily symptoms and limitation in
      activities, patients are prone to developing chest infections called 'exacerbations'.
      Exacerbations are a big problem: unpleasant for patients, and sometimes severe enough to
      cause hospital admission (and therefore health facilities pressures) and death. Reducing the
      impact of exacerbations is very important. Investigators have previously shown that earlier
      treatment of COPD exacerbations results in faster recovery, and reduced chance of hospital
      admission. Helping patients to detect exacerbations early is therefore important.
      Investigators have also recently shown that monitoring heart rate and oxygen saturation via a
      finger probe may assist in this. However, measuring these variables when the patient is awake
      means they can be affected by other things, such as exercise and anxiety. Our new idea is
      that measuring heart rate and oxygen level overnight, when a patient is asleep, will give the
      best chance of detecting COPD exacerbations early and our study will test that. Investigators
      will randomly allocate 77 patients with COPD recruited from our service in London to standard
      monitoring, or overnight monitoring, for up to six months or the first exacerbation,
      whichever is sooner. Investigators will then analyse whether overnight monitoring was able to
      detect exacerbations earlier, and therefore could be used to help patients get treatment
      earlier. A subset of participants will also wear an activity monitor overnight for the first
      two weeks, so that Investigators can assess the effect (if any) of overnight awake periods
      (such as trips to the bathroom) on the heart rate and saturation recording.
