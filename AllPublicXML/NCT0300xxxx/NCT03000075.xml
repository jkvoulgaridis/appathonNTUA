  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo controlled, parallel design study
      that is being performed to assess the safety and efficacy of BI 655066 (risankizumab).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized to receive either placebo, risankizumab 75 mg, or risankizumab
      150 mg in Part A. All participants received 2 injections to maintain the blind: the placebo
      arm received 2 injections of placebo, the risankizumab 75 mg arm received one injection of
      risankizumab 75 mg and one injection of placebo, and the risankizumab 150 mg arm received 2
      injections of risankizumab 75 mg. Participants who received placebo in Part A switched to
      risankizumab in Part B; participants who received risankizumab (75 mg or 150 mg) in Part A
      continued to receive the same treatment (risankizumab 75 mg or 150 mg) in Part B.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI90) at Week 16 (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear or Almost Clear at Week 16 (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear (1) = mean &gt;0, &lt;1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, &lt;2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, &lt;3.5; and Severe (4) = mean ≥3.5.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score (PASI90) at Week 16 (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI90 at Week 52 (Part B)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75% Improvement in PASI Score (PASI75) at Week 16 (Part A)</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI100 at Week 52 (Part B)</title>
          <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI100 is defined as a 100% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data.</description>
