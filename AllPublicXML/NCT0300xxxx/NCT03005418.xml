  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of the Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in adults with vascular
      trauma below the neck who are undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery. There will be a
      torso cohort and a limb cohort. All subjects will be implanted with a HAV as an interposition
      vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical techniques. There is no control arm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi cohort, non-randomized phase 2 study in up to 40
      adult patients with life or limb threatening vascular trauma which requires surgical repair.
      There will be a limb cohort and a torso cohort. The limb cohort will include patients who
      require repair of a vessel contained to the upper or lower extremity. The torso cohort
      includes patients who require repair of vessels within the thorax (excluding the heart),
      abdomen, and retroperitoneum. Subjects will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular
      Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical
      techniques. There is no control arm.

      The active study duration for each study participant will be 36 months from HAV implantation
      or until HAV failure/ removal/ death if earlier. Follow up after month 12 will involve the
      capture of information on assessments performed at &quot;standard of care&quot; routine clinic visits
      or by telephone follow up with the patient or his/her physician with physical exam and
      ultrasound at month 24 and month 36

      The total expected duration of the clinical study is 61 months (24 months of enrollment and
      36 months of follow up).

    <description>The investigational medicinal product (IMP) is a Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV), which is a tissue-engineered vascular prosthesis for arterial bypass or reconstruction in patients with peripheral arterial disease or peripheral arterial trauma. It is a sterile, non-pyrogenic acellular tubular vessel composed of human collagen types I and III and other extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and vitronectin. The vessel is 6 mm in diameter and approximately 42 cm in length. The product is supplied on a silicone mandrel immersed in sterile phosphate buffered saline in a sealed and labeled plastic container. The Humacyte HAV is implanted using standard vascular surgical techniques similar to placement of predicate peripheral vascular prostheses.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with life or limb threatening traumatic injury to an arterial vessel in the
             limb or torso, other than the heart, which requires replacement or reconstruction

          2. Preoperative imaging or clinical examination indicates the damaged vessel has a defect
             length of â‰¤ 38cm and is appropriately size matched to the 6mm Human Acellular Vessel
             (HAV) per the judgment of the treating surgeon taking into account vasoconstriction
             and situational inflow and outflow considerations.

          3. Autologous vein graft is either not feasible in the judgment of the treating surgeon
             (e.g. because of lack of availability of suitable conduit, presence of severe venous
             insufficiency) or is not desirable because of the urgency of revascularization

          4. Aged 18 to 85 years old, inclusive

          5. Able to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, and able to comply with
             entire study procedures. If the patient is unconscious, then information from a
             reliable witness indicates that the patient would normally be able to comply with
             study procedures

          6. Patient or relative is able, willing and competent to give informed consent

          7. Life expectancy of at least 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) of â‰¥ 7

          2. Limb at high risk of amputation despite vascular reconstruction (e.g., because of
             crush injury)

          3. Catastrophic injuries that make survival unlikely (e.g. Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)
             &gt; 5 or Injury Severity Score (ISS) &gt;60)

          4. HAV may not be used for coronary artery repair

          5. Known pregnant women

          6. Known medical condition which would preclude long term antiplatelet therapy after
             resolution of acute injuries

          7. Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the HAV

          8. Previous exposure to HAV

          9. Known participation in any investigational study within the last 30 days

         10. Employees of the sponsor or patients who are employees or relatives of the
             investigator
