  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of local injection of botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B)
      against digital ulcers (DUs) and Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in patients with systemic
      sclerosis (SSc).

      In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated clinical trial
      (phase II), 10 patients with SSc and RP-related DUs were randomly and evenly assigned to a
      placebo control group or treatment group taking BTX-B injections. The degree of improvement
      in DU, change in size, number of new DUs, improvement in symptoms of RP, and adverse events
      were recorded.

    <time_frame>8 weeks after administration</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point was the percentage of subjects with complete disappearance of index ulcer 8 weeks after administration. The index ulcer was defined as the largest DUs in the hand. The size of DU was measured as both the longest diameter of the ulcer and the diameter perpendicular to the center of the ulcer's diameter. Complete disappearance is defined as the disappearance of the area of the ulcer that has become epithelialized and covered by the epidermis from the periphery of the ulcer and continued coverage of the ulcer surface area that has been restored.</description>

    <measure>the changes in RP severity were assessed using Raynaud's Condition Score [RCS]</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after administration</time_frame>
    <description>the changes in RP severity were assessed using Raynaud's Condition Score [RCS]. RCS is a daily self-assessment of RP activity using a 0-10 ordinal scale. RCS incorporates the cumulative daily frequency, duration, severity, and effect of RP attacks. RCS was averaged over a 7-day period preceding the baseline and each subsequent visit.</description>

Three locations between the second and third fingers, the third and fourth fingers, and the fourth and fifth fingers were injected with 400 U (0.2 ml) of BTX-B. In addition, the radial and ulnar sides of the first finger, the radial side of the second finger, and the ulnar side of the fifth finger were injected with half a dose of BTX-B (200 units; 0.1 ml). A total of 2000 U (1.0 ml) of BTX-B was injected into one hand. Injections were performed using a 30-gauge needle.</description>

             toxin

          5. Patients who received botulinum toxin formulation within 4 months before study drug
             administration or who have continued efficacy of botulinum toxin at the time of
             administration of investigational drug even when administered more than 4 months ago

          6. Patients who received endothelin receptor antagonist within 60 days before study drug
             administration

          7. Patients who received the following medications within 14 days prior to study drug
