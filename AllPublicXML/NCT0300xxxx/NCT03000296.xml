      This study evaluates the safety and clinical benefits of a therapeutic approach using the
      cyclophosphamide (Cy) + thymoglobulin® (ATG) + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
      conditioning regimen followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      rescue in the treatment of refractory Crohn's disease. Adverse events, and clinical and
      endoscopic conditions will be assessed at different short and long-term time points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, refractory inflammatory bowel disease that affects the
      entire digestive tract associated with intestinal and extra intestinal manifestations or
      other autoimmune diseases. Conventional therapy for Crohn's disease includes
      anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant and/or biologic drugs/corticosteroids. This treatment
      benefits the majority of patients. However, a proportion of patients fail to achieve complete
      and long-term disease control and often require multiple intestinal surgeries with a risk of
      developing short bowel syndrome.

      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been proposed to cause lymphoablation and
      reset of the immune system as an alternative strategy to induce long-term disease control in
      this high-risk population.

      This study enrolled Crohn's disease patients not responsive to conventional therapy.

      Initially safety and the clinical outcome will be evaluated. The selected patients will be
      admitted to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit for the mobilization regimen using
      cyclophosphamide (Cy - 60 mg/kg) and G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/day) from the 5th day after Cy
      administration until harvesting progenitor cells from peripheral blood by leukapheresis.

      After seven days of rest, the conditioning regimen consists of Cy (200 mg/kg total dose for
      four days), rabbit antithymocyte globulin (6.5 mg/kg total dose for four days) and
      methylprednisolone (500 mg/day).

      The clinical course of patients with refractory Crohn´s disease will be evaluated to
      determine the efficacy of HSCT as a therapeutic tool including the adverse aspects of the
      procedure, clinical outcome and quality of life.

    <ipd_description>The main objective is to observe the safety and clinical benefit of autologous HSCT therapy in refractory patients with Crohn's disease. Evaluation during transplant period and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplant. Safety be evaluated by the amount of treatment-related adverse events. Record adverse events in a standardized way. Secondary outcome measures will be disease remission: 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplant both clinical and endoscopic remission. The percentage of patients in sustained disease remission at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post HSCT will be determined. Sustained disease remission is defined as a CDAI &lt; 150; HBI &lt;4, CCSI&lt; 16, without the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressant or biologic agents. Mucosal healing will be assessed during ileocolonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months following HSCT using SES, CDEIS and Rutgeerts endoscopy index. Heath Quality life, Short Form 36 and IBDQ at 1 3 6 12 and 24 months post-Transplant.</ipd_description>
