      Sixteen week open label study of apremilast in combination with topical steroids with a four
      week safety follow up visit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 16 week study of apremilast in combination with topical
      corticosteroids (TCS). Twenty qualified subjects will be enrolled. Visits will consist of
      Baseline, 8 week, 16 week and a 20 week safety follow up after 4 weeks off treatment.
      Subjects will dose with apremilast as per label. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) will be used
      for up to Week 4 as per label and then will be used on an as needed basis until Week 16.
      Assessments will include Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA), Psoriasis Area Severity
      Index (PASI), Psoriatic Body Surface Area (BSA), Dermatology Life Quality Index
      (DLQI),Assessment of Pruritus, Patient Satisfaction questionnaire. and Patient Global
      Assessment (PtGA)

    <measure>Mean Change in Product of BSA (Body Surface Affected by Psoriasis) and sPGA (Static Physician Global Assessment) From Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The area of body surface affected by psoriasis (BSA) will be estimated by the Investigator as a percentage of the subject's total body surface area wherein the area of the subject's palm will be considered as 1% of total BSA. Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of disease severity is measured by the Investigator on a 6-point scale wherein 0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, 5=Very Severe. The product of these values offers a more specific assessment of the severity of psoriasis. This product can yield a result between 0 (no disease) and 500 (most severe disease) By reporting the percent change as well as the absolute value change, the reader may be better able to appreciate the impact on disease severity of the medication under study.</description>

    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-question survey administered to subjects in order to ascertain the extent to which psoriasis has affected the patient's life in the week prior to completing the questionnaire. The score is a sum of the value of each answer wherein Very Much=3, A lot=2, A little=1 and Not at all=0. 0 is the lowest possible score and indicates no impact of disease on quality of life. 30 is the highest possible score and indicates the most negative impact of disease on quality of life.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Product of BSA (Body Surface Affected by Psoriasis) and sPGA (Static Physician Global Assessment) From Baseline to Week 16</title>
        <description>The area of body surface affected by psoriasis (BSA) will be estimated by the Investigator as a percentage of the subject's total body surface area wherein the area of the subject's palm will be considered as 1% of total BSA. Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of disease severity is measured by the Investigator on a 6-point scale wherein 0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, 5=Very Severe. The product of these values offers a more specific assessment of the severity of psoriasis. This product can yield a result between 0 (no disease) and 500 (most severe disease) By reporting the percent change as well as the absolute value change, the reader may be better able to appreciate the impact on disease severity of the medication under study.</description>
