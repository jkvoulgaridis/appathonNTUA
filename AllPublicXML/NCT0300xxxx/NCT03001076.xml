    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were drawn after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed) at pre-specified intervals. Samples were collected and analyzed for LDL-C. Baseline was defined as the mean of the LDL-C values from the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1. Percent change from baseline was calculated as: ([LDL-C value at Week 12 minus Baseline value] divided by [Baseline Value]) multiplied by 100. Bempedoic Acid = BA. Percent change from Baseline in LDL-C was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate. In the ANCOVA model, missing LDL-C data at Week 12 were imputed using multiple imputation method taking into account adherence to treatment.</description>

Percent change from baseline was calculated as: ([non-HDL-C value at Week 12 minus Baseline value] divided by [Baseline Value]) multiplied by 100. Percent change from Baseline in non-HDL-C was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate.

Baseline was defined as the mean of the TC values from the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1. Percent change from baseline was calculated as: ([TC value at Week 12 minus Baseline value] divided by [Baseline Value]) multiplied by 100. Percent change from Baseline in TC was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate. In the ANCOVA model, missing TC data at Week 12 were imputed using multiple imputation method taking into account adherence to treatment.</description>

Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value on or prior to Day 1. Percent change from baseline was calculated as: [(apoB value at Week 12 minus Baseline value) divided by (Baseline Value)] multiplied by 100. Percent change from Baseline in apoB was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate.

          <description>Concomitant medications were defined as medications that started prior to, on or after the first dose of double-blind IMP and started no later than 30 days following end of double-blind IMP, and ended on or after the date of first dose of double-blind IMP or were ongoing at the end of the study. Other LMT included fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, omega-3 fatty acids, salmon oil, and sitosterol. Participants received ezetimibe 10 mg/day as background therapy throughout the study. Participants who took at least one concomitant LMT have been reported.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed) at pre-specified intervals. Samples were collected and analyzed for LDL-C. Baseline was defined as the mean of the LDL-C values from the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1. Percent change from baseline was calculated as: ([LDL-C value at Week 12 minus Baseline value] divided by [Baseline Value]) multiplied by 100. Bempedoic Acid = BA. Percent change from Baseline in LDL-C was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate. In the ANCOVA model, missing LDL-C data at Week 12 were imputed using multiple imputation method taking into account adherence to treatment.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Weeks 4 and 8 in LDL-C</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed) at pre-specified intervals. Samples were collected and analyzed for LDL-C. Baseline was defined as the mean of the LDL-C values from the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1. Percent change from baseline was calculated as: [(LDL-C value at Week 4 or 8 minus Baseline value) divided by (Baseline Value)] multiplied by 100. Percent change from Baseline in LDL-C was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Weeks 4 and 8 in TGs</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed) at pre-specified intervals. Samples were collected and analysed for TGs. Baseline was defined as the mean of the TGs values from the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1. Percent change from baseline was calculated as: [(TGs value at Week 4 or 8 minus Baseline value) divided by (Baseline Value)] multiplied by 100. Percent change from Baseline in TGs was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with percent change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment as a fixed effects and Baseline as a covariate.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were drawn after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed) at pre-specified intervals. Samples were collected and analysed for LDL-C. Baseline was defined as the mean of the LDL-C values from the last two non-missing values on or prior to Day 1. Absolute change from baseline was calculated as: LDL-C value at Week 4, 8, or 12 minus Baseline value.</description>
