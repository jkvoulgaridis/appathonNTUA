      The PREVENTER Trial aims to compare the use of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis
      (subcutaneous heparin) with intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) to the use of
      IPCs alone for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy
      (RP).

      The PREVENTER Trial aims to compare the use of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis
      (subcutaneous heparin) with intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) to the use of
      IPCs alone for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy
      (RP). Currently, there is no standard practice for VTE prophylaxis after RP with the American
      Urological Association recommending &quot;pharmacological or pneumatic mechanical prophylaxis&quot; for
      high risk patients. Prior studies showed 30% of patients in the United States received no
      perioperative prophylaxis and less than 20% received pharmacologic agents, compared to 98% of
      patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom. Some urologists prescribe
      patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after discharge for up to 30 days after surgery.
      Additionally, there are no established risks of pharmacologic prophylaxis for RP patients,
      but some urologists express concern about the potential impact of prophylaxis on the rate of
      postoperative lymphoceles or hematomas. At Johns Hopkins, patients do not routinely receive
      pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in the perioperative setting for RP. Given the lack of standard
      practice and implications for patient safety, the investigators propose a prospective,
      stratified randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of perioperative pharmacologic
      prophylaxis on VTE following RP hypothesizing that it will prevent VTE events without
      significantly impacting the rate of postoperative bleeding or lymphoceles. The potential
      impact of surveillance bias with differential imaging between arms, effect of lymphadenectomy
      (yes/no and number of noted removed) or surgical approach (robotic and open), and differences
      by patients risk (comorbidity and VTE risk based on components of the Caprini score) or
      demographics will be assessed.

Randomization will be stratified into four groups by procedure approach (open or robotic) and whether patients elect to undergo a screening 30-day lower extremity Duplex (ultrasound or no ultrasound). Patients will then be randomized, within each of the strata, to the two arms (subcutaneous heparin versus no subcutaneous heparin).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease that includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The primary outcome is diagnosis of DVT or PE within 30 days after surgery due to imaging (any method, most commonly lower extremity ultrasound or computed tomography scan with pulmonary embolus protocol) prompted by symptoms of a DVT (lower extremity swelling, pain, fever of unknown origin) or PE (chest pain, shortness of breath, hypoxemia, tachycardia or fever of unknown origin, productive cough with bloody sputum).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Symptomatic Postoperative Fluid Collection</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is defined as a surgical or pelvic fluid collection diagnosed as a hematoma (blood collection, with or without infection) or lymphocele (collection of lymph fluid in the pelvis) due to symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, anemia, high surgical drain output) within 30 days after surgery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Major Postoperative Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This additional primary outcome includes the development and diagnosis of any major clinically recognized bleeding event within 30 days after surgery requiring &gt;1 unit of packed red blood cell transfusion, intervention to stop bleeding, or return to the operating room.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Occurrence of Any Venous Thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>DVT or PE diagnosed for any reason within 30 days after surgery. This includes any diagnosed DVT or PE as described in the primary outcome plus any additional DVTs or PEs diagnosed at 30 day screening lower extremity ultrasound for patients opting to undergo screening bilateral lower extremity Duplex ultrasound at 30 days who do not have symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical Drain Output After Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Over length of stay in hospital (usually 1 to 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The total output in milliliters from any surgical drain left in place (not all patients will necessarily have a surgical drain) after surgery and until discharge from the hospital (usually 1 to 2 days). Drain output, if one is left in place after discharge, will not count toward this secondary outcome.</description>
