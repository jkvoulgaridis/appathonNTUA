  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed registration study is designed as a phase III open-label, controlled,
      randomized, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of StrataGraft skin tissue
      in promoting autologous skin tissue regeneration of complex skin defects due to thermal
      burns. The proposed study will include patients with 3-49% total body surface area (TBSA)
      complex skin defects due to thermal burns with intact dermal elements for which excision and
      autografting are clinically indicated. The study has been designed to focus on the evaluation
      of efficacy and safety of StrataGraft skin tissue, while also assessing the potential for
      StrataGraft skin tissue to promote healing of complex skin defects due to thermal burns as an
      alternative to donor site harvesting and autografting. Targeted enrollment for this study is
      approximately 70 subjects with complex skin defects caused by thermal burns that containing
      intact dermal elements and for which surgical excision and autografts are clinically
      indicated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After surgical excision of nonviable tissue, two comparable areas of comparable depth on each
      subject will be identified and the areas will be randomized to receive StrataGraft skin
      tissue or a surgically harvested autograft as the intrapatient comparator.
