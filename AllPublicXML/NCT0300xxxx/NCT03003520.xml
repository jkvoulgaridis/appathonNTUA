  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, two-arm, open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, clinical
      activity, and predictive biomarkers of durvalumab in combination with R-CHOP or R2-CHOP,
      followed by durvalumab consolidation therapy in previously untreated subjects with high-risk
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Induction treatment with R-CHOP (± lenalidomide) will
      last for a total of up to 6 to 8 treatment cycles (21 day cycles), and the total time on
      study treatment, including durvalumab consolidation, will last up to 12 months.

      On 05-Sep-2017, the US FDA has issued a Partial Clinical Hold on this study resulting in the
      discontinuation of enrollment into Arm B (Durvalumab + Lenalidomide + R-CHOP). After the US
      FDA Partial Clinical Hold, new eligible participants have been enrolled in Arm A (Durvalumab
      + R-CHOP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is conducted in participants with previously untreated, high-risk diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients with high-risk DLBCL typically have insufficient
      therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, the addition of novel agents to the currently used induction
      therapy (R-CHOP) is a rational approach to improve therapeutic outcomes in this disease
      setting.

      Based on pre-clinical and clinical observations, it is hypothesized that durvalumab will have
      activity in DLBCL because the PD 1/PD L1 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of DLBCL.
      In particular, the addition of durvalumab may augment the anti-tumor activity of R-CHOP
      against high-risk DLBCL sub-types.

      The safety of durvalumab has already been explored. However, as there is limited clinical
      experience with durvalumab in DLBCL, the study is divided into two stages:

        -  A Safety Run-in Stage to evaluate the safety of the treatment combinations until at
           least 10 subjects are included in each of the two treatment arms

        -  An Expansion Stage to analyze the clinical activity of the treatment combinations

      Results posted following Primary Outcome Completion date are based on a database cut-off of
      August 2, 2018.

    <description>The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the complete response rate (CRR) at the end of the induction therapy in the efficacy evaluable population in a comparative manner against historical control. The response to treatment was assessed according to the 2014 International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) (Cheson, 2014). CR was defined as a complete metabolic response and radiographic evidence showing target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in longest diameter, no new lesions, regression of lymph nodes to normal size, absence of splenomegaly, and absence of bone marrow involvement. Clopper-Pearson two-sided 95% confidence interval is reported. Null hypothesis for the primary endpoint was rejected if the lower limit of the confidence interval for the complete response rate at the completion of the induction therapy in the efficacy evaluable population is above 55%.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of the first dose of study drug to within 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or 28 days after the last dose of any investigational product (IP) whichever is greater. Day 1 up to Week 54 at time of database cutoff date.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during a study. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening; • Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Constitutes an important medical event. The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study drug and graded the severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03): - Grade 1 = Mild (no limitation in activity or intervention); - Grade 2 = Moderate (some limitation in activity; no/minimal medical intervention required); - Grade 3 = Severe (marked limitation in activity; medical intervention required, hospitalization possible); - Grade 4 = Life-threatening; - Grade 5 = Death. Relation to IP is determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response (CR) at the End of Induction Therapy</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the complete response rate (CRR) at the end of the induction therapy in the efficacy evaluable population in a comparative manner against historical control. The response to treatment was assessed according to the 2014 International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) (Cheson, 2014). CR was defined as a complete metabolic response and radiographic evidence showing target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in longest diameter, no new lesions, regression of lymph nodes to normal size, absence of splenomegaly, and absence of bone marrow involvement. Clopper-Pearson two-sided 95% confidence interval is reported. Null hypothesis for the primary endpoint was rejected if the lower limit of the confidence interval for the complete response rate at the completion of the induction therapy in the efficacy evaluable population is above 55%.</description>

        <description>Data in the analysis include all participants who received durvalumab, irrespective of the study arm in which they enrolled, because the selected biomarkers have been associated with response in other anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 studies, such as durvalumab. IHC analysis was performed on the baseline tumor biopsy to quantify CD8 T-cell density. Participants with 'high' values, i.e. above the threshold defined as the median value of 774 cells/mm^2 found in commercial DLBCL samples using matched analytical methods, were predicted to be responders to treatment with durvalumab. The definition of a complete response was that used in the primary outcome.</description>

        <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during a study. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening; • Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Constitutes an important medical event. The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study drug and graded the severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03): - Grade 1 = Mild (no limitation in activity or intervention); - Grade 2 = Moderate (some limitation in activity; no/minimal medical intervention required); - Grade 3 = Severe (marked limitation in activity; medical intervention required, hospitalization possible); - Grade 4 = Life-threatening; - Grade 5 = Death. Relation to IP is determined by the investigator.</description>
        <time_frame>From the date of the first dose of study drug to within 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or 28 days after the last dose of any investigational product (IP) whichever is greater. Day 1 up to Week 54 at time of database cutoff date.</time_frame>

          <description>Participants start the study on durvalumab in combination with R-CHOP (as described in Arm DUR + R-CHOP). Based on their DLBCL Cell-of-Origin subtype (test typically done between cycles 1 and 2), participants with ABC subtype continue the study taking durvalumab in combination with R2-CHOP. On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, participants received durvalumab 1125 mg IV followed by R-CHOP. In addition, participants receive oral lenalidomide 15 mg by mouth on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day cycle. Induction treatment continued for a total of 6-8 cycles. Participants who achieve a complete response or partial response continue with consolidation therapy treatment and receive durvalumab monotherapy 1500 mg by IV on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for up to a total of 12 months.
