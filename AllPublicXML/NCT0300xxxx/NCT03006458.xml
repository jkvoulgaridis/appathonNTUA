  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the clinical performance and subjective acceptance of the
      comfilcon A and the omafilcon B soft contact lenses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, subject-masked, crossover, bilateral study, controlled by cross
      comparison. Thirty subjects will use each lens type for two weeks in random sequence.
      Follow-up visits for each lens will be performed after two weeks of wear. Lenses will be worn
      on a daily wear basis.

      The final optical design of comfilcon A contact lens was optimized to improve the quality and
      two further studies (CV-18-10 and CV-18-11) were conducted after completion of this study to
      evaluate the modified optical design.

               4. They have successfully completed the non-dispensing study (C16-597) as the lenses
                  to be worn on this study (C16-599) are predetermined from their participation on

               5. They have a contact lens spherical prescription between +10.00 to -10.00D
                  (Diopters) (inclusive).

               6. They have astigmatism between of -0.75 and -5.75DC (based on the calculated
                  ocular refraction) in each eye.

               7. They have an Add component to their spectacle refraction (between +0.75 and

                  +2.50DS).

               8. They can be satisfactorily fitted with the study lenses.

               9. They can attain at least 0.30 logMAR binocular distance high contrast visual

                  study.

              13. They own a wearable pair of spectacles.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will not be eligible to take part in the study if:

               1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens
                  wear.

               2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens
                  wear.

               3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

               4. They have had cataract surgery.

               5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

               6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear
                  or have keratoconus.

               7. They are pregnant or breast-feeding.

               8. They have any clinically meaningful slit lamp findings contraindicating contact
                  lens wear (e.g. ≥ Grade 3 finding of oedema, corneal neovascularisation, corneal
                  staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection, blepharitis/meibomian
                  gland dysfunction) on the Efron classification scale or any other ocular
                  abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would contraindicate contact
                  lens wear.

               9. They have any infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis) which would, in the opinion of
                  the investigator, contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study
                  personnel; or they have any immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV).

              10. They have a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction.

              11. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
                  research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
