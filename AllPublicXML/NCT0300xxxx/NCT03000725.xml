      The purpose of this study is to adapt Project UPLIFT for Hispanic adults with epilepsy and
      depression. Project UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) is a
      home-based intervention that teaches cognitive and mindfulness skills to people with epilepsy
      by phone to reduce their depression and improve quality of life (QOL); it was developed at
      Emory University with CDC funding. The purpose of this study is to adapt Project UPLIFT for
      Hispanic adults with epilepsy and depression. Project UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to
      Increase Favorable Thoughts) is a home-based intervention that teaches cognitive and
      mindfulness skills to people with epilepsy by phone to reduce their depression and improve

      The goal of this study is to adapt Project UPLIFT for Hispanic adults with epilepsy and
      depression. A 2-arm randomized control trial will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility,
      acceptability and effects of Project UPLIFT versus usual care (UC) in Hispanic patients with
      epilepsy.

      The specific aim of this study is: To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and short- and
      long-term effects of the adapted intervention on depression and other outcomes in 72 English-
      and Spanish-speaking Hispanic epilepsy patients.
