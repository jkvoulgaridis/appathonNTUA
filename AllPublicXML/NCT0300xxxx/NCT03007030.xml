    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well brentuximab vedotin works in treating patients with CD30
      positive (+) malignant mesothelioma that cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as brentuximab vedotin, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess 4-month disease control rate (DCR) in pre-treated patients with unresectable
      malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with brentuximab vedotin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate, progression-free and overall survival, and safety/toxicity
      of brentuximab vedotin in CD30+ malignant mesothelioma.

      II. To prospectively evaluate the incidence of CD30+ expression in malignant mesothelioma
      during the screening process.

      III. To determine whether CD30+ expression levels in tumor tissue correlate to response to
      brentuximab vedotin.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect archival or new tissue and blood for correlative studies. II. Next generation
      sequencing (NGS) will be conducted on adequate tumor tissue specimens.

      III. Exploratory analysis: Bank peripheral blood at baseline for subsequent cytokine or
      reverse phase protein array (RPPA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months
      and then every 6 months thereafter.

    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR) defined as proportion of patients who had complete response, partial response or stable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 4.1</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A DCR of 50% or higher is considered as clinically significant. If the trial is not stopped early and all 50 patients are accrued, point estimate along with 95% credible interval will be provided. Logistic regression model will be utilized to assess the effect of patient prognostic factors on the response status if sufficient number of patients with stable disease or better response to the treatment are observed.</description>

    <measure>Tumor characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' demographic and tumor characteristics will be analyzed, with categorical variables summarized in frequency tables while continuous variables summarized using mean (plus or minus standard deviation) and median (range). The student t-test/Wilcoxon test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Kruskal-Wallis test will be used to compare continuous variables between different patient groups. The chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test will be applied to assess the association between two categorical variables.</description>

    <description>The distribution of time-to-event endpoints will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Comparison of time-to-event endpoints by important patient characteristics will be made using the log-rank test.
