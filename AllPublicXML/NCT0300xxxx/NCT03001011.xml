      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of serum phosphorus in
      hyperphosphatemia in participants with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of serum lipids (total
      cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]).

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of calcium-phosphorus product.

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of intact parathyroid hormone
      (iPTH).

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in proportion of participants reaching the target
      serum phosphorus level 4.6 milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL) (1.47 millimoles per litre
      [mmol/L], inclusive).

      To evaluate safety of Renvela tablets.

    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an Adverse Event (AE) without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during TEAE period. On-treatment period was defined as the (time from the first dose of IMP to the last dose of IMP+3 days). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study was conducted at 38 centers in China. A total of 482 participants were screened between 07 June 2017 &amp; 30 May 2019, of which 280 participants were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to serum phosphorus level greater than or equal to &gt;=5.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (1.78 millimoles per litre [mmol/L]) at screening visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 202 participants were randomized in the study. Randomization was stratified according to screening serum phosphorus level (&gt;=5.5 – 6.0 mg/dL [1.78 – 1.94 mmol/L] and &gt;6.0 mg/dL [1.94 mmol/L]). Assignment to arms was done centrally using interactive voice/web response system in 1:1 ratio (Renvela [sevelamer carbonate]: placebo).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an Adverse Event (AE) without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during TEAE period. On-treatment period was defined as the (time from the first dose of IMP to the last dose of IMP+3 days). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
