    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2
      dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile of budigalimab. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      budigalimab in combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine and budigalimab in combination with
      venetoclax. The study will consist of 3 parts: budigalimab monotherapy dose escalation and
      expansion, budigalimab in combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine and budigalimab in
      combination with venetoclax.

    <description>ABBV-181 will be administered at escalating dose levels in 28-day dosing cycles (2 doses per cycle). Based on available safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data from the dose-escalation part of the study, participants will be enrolled in dose-expansion cohorts to further evaluate ABBV-181 at a dose level which is at or below the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In the Monotherapy Expansion portion of the study, ABBV-181 will be administered in 28-day dosing cycles at either 1 dose per cycle or 2 doses per cycle. Based on available safety, PK and PD data from the single agent dose-escalation part of the study, a dose for ABBV-181 will be selected to evaluate in combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine or venetoclax.</description>

             resection or other approved therapeutic regimen known to provide clinical benefit. For
             dose escalation, the participant may have been previously treated with a programmed
             cell death 1 (PD-I) targeting agent. For dose expansion, the participant must be
             PD-I/PD-L1 targeting agent naïve. For Part 2 budigalimab in combination with
             rovalpituzumab tesirine, the participant must have SCLC with progressive disease and
             have failed platinum containing therapy and be PD-1/PD-L1 targeting agent naïve. For
             Part 3 budigalimab in combination with venetoclax, the participant must have locally
             advanced or metastatic NSCLC and received 1 to 4 prior lines of therapy in the
             advanced or metastatic setting including 1 regimen that included a PD-1 or PD-L1
             targeting agent which was discontinued following disease progression. Participants who
             are naïve to treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 targeting agent OR who have received more
             than 1 regimen containing a PD-1/PD-L1 targeting agent are NOT eligible for Part 3.

          -  Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0
             to 2 for the monotherapy cohort and an ECOG 0 to 1 for budigalimab in combination with

             (HCV) RNA after anti-viral therapy may be enrolled.

          -  Participant has known history or inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonitis, or known
             uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) (with certain exceptions).

          -  Participants with a history of or ongoing pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease are
             also excluded.

          -  For budigalimab plus venetoclax therapy (Part 3), participant must not receive a
             strong or moderate inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A within 7 days
             before first venetoclax dose.

          -  For budigalimab plus venetoclax therapy (Part 3), participants with a known
             gastrointestinal disorder (i.e.: malabsorption syndrome), complication (i.e.:
