    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants with symptoms of common cold assessing if
      1146A nasal spray reduces the severity of symptoms of the common cold compared to placebo.
      The study will also evaluate the safety of 1146A compared to placebo.

    <measure>Average Nasal Symptom Score Over Days 1-4 (ANSS1-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 4 (Day 1 to 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The nasal symptom score (NSS) was calculated as the sum score of the nasal symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose and sneezing). The participants self-assessed each individual sign/symptom which was scored using the following 4-point scale: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping);score range (Min-Max): 0-9 . The average nasal symptom score (ANSS) on days 1 to 4 was calculated as the mean of the 4 daily NSS across study days 1 to 4. A lower score reflects better nasal symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Average Total Symptom Score Over Days 1-4 (ATSS1-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 4 (Day 1 to 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The total symptom scores (TSS) were calculated as the sum score of the nasal symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose and sneezing) and other symptoms (headache, muscle ache, chills, sore throat and cough). The participants self-assessed each individual sign/symptom which was scored using the following 4 point scale: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping);Score range (Min-Max):0-24. Average Total Symptom Score (ATSS) on days 1 to 4 were derived as the mean of all TSS across study Days 1 to 4. A lower score reflects better nasal symptoms.</description>

          -  F. Uncontrolled cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             hematological, endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune, neurological, psychiatric or other

        <title>Average Nasal Symptom Score Over Days 1-4 (ANSS1-4)</title>
        <description>The nasal symptom score (NSS) was calculated as the sum score of the nasal symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose and sneezing). The participants self-assessed each individual sign/symptom which was scored using the following 4-point scale: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping);score range (Min-Max): 0-9 . The average nasal symptom score (ANSS) on days 1 to 4 was calculated as the mean of the 4 daily NSS across study days 1 to 4. A lower score reflects better nasal symptoms.</description>

          <title>Average Nasal Symptom Score Over Days 1-7 (ANSS1-7)</title>
          <description>The nasal symptom score (NSS) was calculated as the sum score of the nasal symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose and sneezing). The participants self-assessed each individual sign/symptom which was scored using the following 4-point scale: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping);score range (Min-Max): 0-9 . The average nasal symptom score (ANSS) on days 1 to 7 was calculated as the mean of the 7 daily NSS across study days 1 to 7. A lower score reflects better nasal symptoms.</description>
          <population>Modified Intent-to-Treat(mITT) population was the primary population of analysis. The mITT (N=165) population was defined as participants who received at least one dose of study medication and have at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment.</population>

        <description>The total symptom scores (TSS) were calculated as the sum score of the nasal symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose and sneezing) and other symptoms (headache, muscle ache, chills, sore throat and cough). The participants self-assessed each individual sign/symptom which was scored using the following 4 point scale: 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident), 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping);Score range (Min-Max):0-24. Average Total Symptom Score (ATSS) on days 1 to 4 were derived as the mean of all TSS across study Days 1 to 4. A lower score reflects better nasal symptoms.</description>
