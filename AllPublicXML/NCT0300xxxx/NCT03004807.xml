  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies for a variety of reasons and
      have an increased demand for many of these micronutrients. Multivitamin/multimineral
      supplement offer a simple way for adults to improve nutrient intake, but their ability to
      measurably affect micronutrient status in older adults has never been explored. This study
      intends to recruit healthy, non-smoking men aged 70 years or older. After meeting entry
      criteria, subjects will be required to restrict the use of supplements and/or fortified
      foods. Two months after these restrictions have begun, subjects will come to the clinical
      research center to take cognitive tests, undergo activity monitoring, provide blood samples
      for nutrition testing, and take food frequency questionnaires. Subjects will then be
      randomized into one of two groups - one consuming a multivitamin/multimineral supplement
      (Centrum Silver Mens Formula); another consuming an inert placebo tablet. Subjects will
      consume 1 tablet each day for six months. After this period, subjects will return to the
      clinical research center and repeat cognitive tests, activity monitor, blood sampling, and
      food frequency questionnaires. These data will be assessed to determine if multivitamin
      consumption results in changes in various nutrients versus taking a placebo (primary
      outcomes), and may results in changes lipid and lipoprotein profiles, metabolic health,
      inflammation, blood pressure or cognitive function (secondary outcomes). The investigators
      expect that results of this study will add to the general understanding if
      multivitamin/multimineral formulas can improve nutrition status of older adults, and
      therefore have the capacity of altering markers of health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at increased risk of various chronic diseases, in which inadequate levels of
      vitamins and minerals may play a significant role, including cardiovascular disease,
      Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, and cancer. Most adults in the United States do not meet
      the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Adequate Intake (AI) of many vitamins and
      nutritionally-essential minerals from diet alone, including vitamins A, C, D, E and K,
      calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Older adults are particularly susceptible to micronutrient
      inadequacies because of limited absorption, increased requirements, or - in the case of
      vitamin D - decreased synthetic capacity in the skin. Thus, there is a strong rationale for
      supplementing the diets of older adults with a multivitamin/multimineral supplement, such as
      Centrum® Silver®. However, little is currently known about the bioavailability of the
      Centrum® Silver® formula in this age demographic.

      Epidemiological studies and recent clinical trials have shown that use of
      multivitamin/mineral supplements has beneficial effects on disease risk in men, including
      those of advanced age. It is assumed that these benefits of multivitamin/mineral supplements
      are achieved through changes in nutrition status. However, it has never been documented if
      there are concomitant changes in micronutrient levels in individuals who consume these
      supplements. Furthermore, changes in nutritional status in older individuals taking
      multivitamin/multimineral supplements are a subject that has yet to be explored.

      Therefore, this study seeks to recruit men who are in generally good health, 70 years of age
      or older, to assess their vitamin and mineral status before and after six months
      (approximately 24 weeks) of supplementation with Centrum® Silver®. The investigators
      hypothesize that consuming multivitamin/multimineral supplements everyday will result in
      measurable increases in the status of one or more vitamins or minerals in the body.
      Concentrations of several vitamins and minerals in blood samples will be performed, along
      with a general assessment of micronutrient status in white blood cells (primary outcomes). To
      see if these changes in nutrition status impact other aspects of human health, changes in
      lipid and lipoprotein profiles, antioxidant status, metabolic health, and inflammation and
      treatment differences in cognitive function will be assessed (secondary outcomes). Centrum®
      Silver® supplementation may or may not have any effect on these secondary outcomes, when
      compared to a placebo, unless there are measurable changes in the primary outcomes.

      The expectation is that the results of this research will add to a general understanding of
      multivitamin/mineral supplements and how well they can improve the nutritional status of
      older adults. By employing direct and functional methods to assay for nutritional content,
      this study will determine how well these methods correlate and by using both assay methods
      unique insight into the mechanism(s) whereby multivitamin/multimineral supplements might or
      might not lead to improvements in health may be ascertained.

Plasma levels of beta carotene, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), cobalamin (vitamin B12), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), 25-hydroxy vitamin D, α- tocopherol (vitamin E), and phylloquinone/menaquinones (vitamin K) will be determined.

The individual test scores are based on time and accuracy, will be normalized to scaled scores, and averaged to obtain a Fluid Cognition Composite score, as calculated by the NIH Toolbox scoring algorithms. Significant changes in total score after intervention, or between intervention and control groups will be recorded. Logical Memory will be tested with recall of narrative story both immediate and delayed as described in WMS-IV Protocol. Additionally, a &quot;Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders Task&quot; that combines physical activity with processing speed and accuracy will also be assessed at the completion of each session.</description>
