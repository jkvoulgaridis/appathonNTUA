  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b study designed to evaluate the tolerability and safety of
      lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). The Expansion part of the study will evaluate objective response rate and duration of
      response by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) for HCC and
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on independent imaging review
      (IIR).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product.
