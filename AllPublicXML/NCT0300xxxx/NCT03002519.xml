             ≤1000/mm3, attributed to graft failure as a major contributor, as evident by
             hypocellular bone marrow.

             Cytopenia should be confirmed by at least 2 consecutive blood counts, at least one of
             them within 28 days prior to treatment (higher transient levels following occasional

        6. General performance status evaluated by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-2 scale.

        7. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria

          1. Evidence of developing malignancy since the HCT, or any evidence of malignancy at the
             time of screening.

          2. Current active infection requiring systemic treatment (if infection resolved but
             antibiotic coverage continues, patient may be included).

          3. Acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) Grade III or IV, or severe chronic GvHD at the
             time of screening.

             within 6 months prior to treatment, or any other cell therapy within 3 months prior to
             treatment.

          5. History of malignancy (other than the disease that required the HCT) within 2 years
