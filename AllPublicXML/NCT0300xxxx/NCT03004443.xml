  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of
      neuropsychiatric illnesses including mood disorders, which affect almost 30 million adults in
      the United States alone. One mechanism by which inflammation may alter behavior is through
      increasing brain glutamate, a neurotransmitter that in excess has been implicated in neuronal
      toxicity and resistance to conventional antidepressant therapy. The goal of the proposed
      research is to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters behavior through increasing
      glutamate in specific brain regions, ultimately leading to behavioral changes.

      The proposed research is designed to determine the cause and effect relationship between
      inflammation and CNS glutamate as well as the relationship between CNS glutamate and specific
      symptoms. To accomplish these aims, investigators will administer a single infusion of either
      the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab or placebo (n=30 per group) to patients
      with high inflammation (CRP&gt;3mg/L). A CRP&gt;3mg/L was chosen because it is considered high
      inflammation according to guidelines by the American Heart Association. Moreover, a CRP&gt;3mg/L
      is associated with significantly increased basal ganglia glutamate and with a clinical
      response to infliximab. Inflammatory biomarkers, basal ganglia glutamate as measured by MRS,
      and motivation and psychomotor activity will be assessed at baseline and days 1 and 3 and
      weeks 1 and 2 following infliximab or placebo administration.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that increased inflammation causes increased basal
      ganglia glutamate and consequently anhedonia and psychomotor retardation in patients with
      major depressive disorder (MDD). Excessive inflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity are two
      pathways that have received increasing attention regarding the pathophysiology of
      neuropsychiatric disease including mood disorders. Patients with depression exhibit increased
      peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) markers of inflammation as well as altered CNS
      glutamate as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In addition, drugs that block
      either inflammation or glutamate signaling can reverse depressive symptoms, especially in
      depressed patients with treatment resistance.

      Inflammatory cytokines are known to inhibit glutamate reuptake and increase glutamate release
      from astrocytes, and glutamate antagonists have been shown to block inflammation-induced
      depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, using MRS, data has shown that administration of
      the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-alpha significantly increases glutamate in the
      basal ganglia in association with IFN-alpha-induced anhedonia and psychomotor slowing. In
      addition, increased inflammation as reflected by peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP) is
      correlated with increased basal ganglia glutamate in association with decreased motivation
      and psychomotor speed in patients with MDD. Nevertheless, the data to date has been
      correlational, and whether increased inflammation causes increased glutamate in the basal
      ganglia, which in turn contributes to behavioral changes in patients with depression has not
      been established.

      To test this hypothesis, investigators plan to determine the cause and effect relationship
      between increased inflammation and increased CNS glutamate by blocking inflammation in
      depressed patients with high inflammation (CRP&gt;3mg/L) using the highly specific tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab (n=30) versus placebo (n=30). In addition, the
      study team will examine whether changes in basal ganglia glutamate are linked to changes in
      behaviors related to the basal ganglia including anhedonia and psychomotor retardation.

    <measure>Change in Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a self-administered, paper-pencil questionnaire with 14 items assessing four domains of pleasure response/hedonic experience: interest/pastimes, social interaction, sensory experience, and food/drink. Either of the Disagree responses receives a score of 1 and either of the Agree responses receives a score of 0. The SHAPS is scored as the sum of the 14 items so that total scores ranged from 0 to 14. A higher total SHAPS score indicated higher levels of anhedonia. A cut-off score of 2 provides the best discrimination between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; level of hedonic tone.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gamble Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Gamble Task will examine the relationship between chosen certain rewards the expected values of chosen gambles, the difference between experienced and predicted rewards and happiness. Participants will have the option of selecting between a certain choice and a gamble choice, with equal probabilities of the two outcomes. There will between 50 and 150 trials with an equal proportion of three trial types: mixed (a certain amount of $0 with a gain and loss amount), gain (with a certain gain or a gamble with $0 and a larger loss), and loss (with a certain loss or a gain of $0 and a greater loss). Further, participants will be asked to rate their current level of happiness after every three trials. Also, before and after the task is complete, participants will be asked to measure their life happiness. Previous studies have demonstrated that this technique can be used to establish a relationship between task earnings and happiness. This task takes between 10-20 minutes per session.</description>

    <measure>Change in Go No-Go Variant Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>One of four possible fractal images is briefly presented to the subject, each representing the combination between action (either &quot;go&quot; or &quot;no-go&quot;, by button pressing or withholding button pressing), and valance at outcome (either win or lose). Action is required in response to a circle that follows the fractal image. In go trials, subjects will indicate which side of the screen the circle appeared on. In no-go trials, subjects will simply be asked to withhold any response. A green upward symbol indicates a win of $1, a red downward symbol indicates a loss of $1, and a horizontal bar indicates an absence of win or loss. In &quot;go to win&quot; trials, a correct button press is rewarded. In &quot;go to avoid losing&quot; trials, a correctly avoided button press avoids punishment. In &quot;no-go to&quot; win trials, withholding the button press leads to reward. In &quot;no-go to avoid losing&quot; trials, withholding a button press avoids punishment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reinforcement Learning Task (RLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Trials for this task involve a 1-3s cue presentation during which subjects choose between two abstract stimuli, and then a 3s feedback presentation with positive (monetary win), negative (monetary loss) or neutral outcomes. Behavioral responses will be analyzed by fitting a standard reinforcement learning (Q-learning) model to each subject's sequence of choices. Based on individual choices and outcomes for each trial, the Q-learning algorithm will compute the expected values (Q) of choosing a given stimulus: Qt = Qt-1 + alpha*RPEt, where RPEt = Rewardt - Qt-1 and alpha represents the learning rate. This task will include between 80-120 trials and will take approximately 10-15 minutes in length.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Value Task (SLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>In this task, subjects will repeatedly choose between two options to obtain a monetary reward. Each option will consist of a horizontal bar (representing reward magnitude) with a percentage written underneath it (representing reward probability). Options will be presented then a question mark will appear, to prompt participants to press a button to indicate their choice. The outcome (reward or no reward) will be indicated by the bars turning green or red, respectively. Outcomes are then followed by an intertrial interval. A &quot;prize bar&quot; will be displayed between the options and will grow by the width of the reward bar when a subject options a reward. The subject's goal will be to move the prize bar across a target line to win a certain amount of money. Once this goal is achieved, the prize bar will be reset and the subject will begin again. This task will last a maximum of 20 minutes.</description>
