    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Resolution Among Who Received SHP640 or Placebo on Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical resolution was defined as absence (score=0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge in the study eye. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern) - 4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Ocular conjunctival discharge was assessed based on 0 (No evidence of discharge in conjunctiva) - 3 (Abundant quantity of mucopurulent or purulent discharge) scale. The study eye was defined as an eye with score of at least 1 for both ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness at baseline. Data analysis was performed in SHP640 and placebo reporting groups only but not in PVP-I 0.6%.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Bacterial Eradication Among Who Received SHP640 or Placebo on Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Bacterial eradication was defined as absence of all bacterial species present at or above pathological threshold at baseline in the study eye. Bacterial species were identified by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry, using their unique protein patterns. Pathological threshold for individual bacterial species was based on colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL threshold levels established by Cagle and modified by Leibowitz for different ocular bacterial species found in the specimens collected from each participant. Data analysis was performed in SHP640 and placebo reporting groups only but not in PVP-I 0.6%.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Resolution Among Who Received SHP640 or Placebo on Day 5</title>
        <description>Clinical resolution was defined as absence (score=0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge in the study eye. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern) - 4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Ocular conjunctival discharge was assessed based on 0 (No evidence of discharge in conjunctiva) - 3 (Abundant quantity of mucopurulent or purulent discharge) scale. The study eye was defined as an eye with score of at least 1 for both ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness at baseline. Data analysis was performed in SHP640 and placebo reporting groups only but not in PVP-I 0.6%.</description>

Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern) - 4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Ocular conjunctival discharge was assessed based on 0 (No evidence of discharge in conjunctiva) - 3 (Abundant quantity of mucopurulent or purulent discharge) scale. The study eye was defined as an eye with score of at least 1 for both ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness at baseline. Data analysis was performed in SHP640 and placebo reporting groups only but not in PVP-I 0.6%.</description>
          <population>Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included participants who received at least one dose of investigational product (IP) and had a positive bacterial culture (presence of one or more bacterial species at or above pathological threshold) at baseline in the study.

        <description>Bacterial eradication was defined as absence of all bacterial species present at or above pathological threshold at baseline in the study eye. Bacterial species were identified by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry, using their unique protein patterns. Pathological threshold for individual bacterial species was based on colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL threshold levels established by Cagle and modified by Leibowitz for different ocular bacterial species found in the specimens collected from each participant.

Ocular conjunctival discharge was assessed based on 0 (No evidence of discharge in conjunctiva) - 3 (Abundant quantity of mucopurulent or purulent discharge) scale. The study eye was defined as an eye with a score of at least 1 for both ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Global Clinical Score</title>
        <description>Global clinical score was defined as the sum of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge scores. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern) - 4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from VBR scale. Ocular conjunctival discharge was assessed based on 0 (No evidence of discharge in conjunctiva) - 3 (Abundant quantity of mucopurulent or purulent discharge) scale. The study eye was defined as an eye with a score of at least 1 for both ocular conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness at baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, 5, 8 and 12</time_frame>
        <population>mITT population included participants who received at least one dose of IP and had a positive bacterial culture (presence of one or more bacterial species at or above pathological threshold) at baseline in the study. Here, the number of participants analyzed refer to the participants evaluable for this outcome at specified time point.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Expanded Clinical Resolution</title>
        <description>Expanded clinical resolution was defined as a global clinical score of 0, 1, or 2 with neither injection nor discharge having a score of 2. Global clinical score was defined as the sum of bulbar conjunctival injection and ocular conjunctival discharge scores. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern) - 4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from VBR scale. Ocular conjunctival discharge was assessed based on 0 (No evidence of discharge in conjunctiva) - 3 (Abundant quantity of mucopurulent or purulent discharge) scale.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 3, 5, 8 and 12</time_frame>
        <population>mITT population included participants who received at least one dose of IP and had a positive bacterial culture (presence of one or more bacterial species at or above pathological threshold) at baseline in the study. Here, the number of participants analyzed refer to the participants evaluable for this outcome at specified time point.</population>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Any AE that occured after the first dose of investigational product instillation was considered a TEAE.</description>
