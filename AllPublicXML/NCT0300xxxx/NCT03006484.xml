    <textblock>
      Little is known about the long-term neurological outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest
      (IHCA). It is also not known whether withdrawal of life-sustaining measures will influence
      rates of survivors with poor neurological status. Currently, withdrawal of care in comatose
      patients after cardiac arrest is strongly forbidden by law in Korea. However, a new
      legislation on allowing withdrawal of care will come into effect since early 2018 in Korea.
      The investigators aim to determine 1) long-term neurological outcomes in patients who
      developed IHCA, 2) whether early neurological status can predict late neurological status
      after IHCA, and 3) whether the proportion of IHCA survivors with good neurological outcomes
      will change since implementation of new legislation on withdrawal of care.

    <measure>Cerebral Performance Category(CPC) score of 1-2</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest(IHCA)</time_frame>
    <description>CPC score is the most universal index to assess neurological outcome following cardiac arrest. CPC score is classified according to the point. Good neurological outcome is defined as CPC 1-2 and poor is CPC 3-5.
CPC score will be evaluated by neurological examination and the results of other exam.
Neurological examination: Neurologist will perform directly until the point of CPC score 1 is confirmed.
mental status: ACDU score, FOUR score and Glasgow Coma Scale
brain stem reflex: Light reflexes by pupillometer(the NeurOptics® NPi™-100 (Neuroptics Inc., Irvine, CA, USA)) and corneal reflexes
motor status
Responsive state: Medical Research Council grade
Unresponsive state: motor response to painful stimuli)
seizure evaluation: status myoclonus , seizure, status epilepticus
The result of other examinations in accordance with medical treatment guideline will be evaluated as well. (e.g. Finding MRI of the brain, EEG, neuron specific enolase)</description>
