    <textblock>
      This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) oral ETEC vaccine (ACE527).
      ACE527 is a live attenuated vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which causes watery diarrhea, largely in children
      living in developing countries and in travelers to those countries. This research study is
      also testing an investigational adjuvant called dmLT. An adjuvant is something that is added
      to a vaccine to make it work better. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, Part A
      aims to find out if the vaccine by itself or the vaccine combined with the adjuvant is safe,
      tolerable, and initiates an immune response. Second, Part B aims to find out if the vaccine
      by itself or the vaccine combined with the adjuvant prevents diarrheal disease when
      challenged with ETEC H10407. About 60 healthy adults, ages 18-50, will participate in Part A,
      and they will be required to stay in the research facility for several nights for the first
      dose, but will not be required to stay overnight for the second and third doses. Participants
      will be assigned to receive either the vaccine alone, the vaccine with adjuvant, or placebo
      by mouth. Study procedures include: stool samples, blood samples, and documentation of side
      effects. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 8 months.

      Interested volunteers from Part A will along with volunteers who were never vaccinated in
      Part A will return to participate in Part B. These volunteers will be required to stay
      overnight in the research facility for several nights after challenge, after which they will
      be treated with antibiotics and sent home. Study procedures include stool samples, blood
      samples, and documentation of infection with ETEC H10407. If the vaccine with/without
      adjuvant is effective, the volunteers should not development diarrhea, but if the vaccine
      with/without adjuvant is not effective, the volunteers will have diarrhea for a few days.

      This study is a clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity and efficacy of a live attenuated ETEC vaccine, ACE527, with and without a
      mucosal adjuvant, dmLT. This study was designed initially as a single site, Phase 1,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated ETEC vaccine, ACE527, with and
      without a mucosal adjuvant, dmLT (Part A). The addition of a challenge step provides a unique
      opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of the new lyophilized formulation of ACE527 vaccine,
      given in a two or three dose regimen, with and without dmLT, against wild type ETEC strain
      H10407 challenge (designated as Part B: Phase 2b Open Label Challenge Study). In addition,
      challenging the volunteers may allow for the identification of immune correlates of
      protection, taking advantage of newly available technologies (immune proteomics,
      transcriptomics, etc.)

      ACE527 comprises three genetically attenuated and engineered strains of E. coli, with antigen
      profiles covering a wide range of ETEC surface colonization factor antigens (CFA/I, CFA/II
      [CS1, CS2, CS3] and CFA/IV [CS5, CS6]) and also expressing LT-B, the inactive subunit of LT
      (ETEC heat labile toxin). LT(R192G/L211A), or dmLT, is a derivative of wild-type
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin that has been genetically modified
      by replacing the arginine at amino acid position 192 with glycine and the leucine at amino
      acid position 211 with alanine.

      Volunteers were enrolled in Part A into each of two separate Cohorts. Cohort 1 and 2
      volunteers received 10^10 colony-forming units (cfu) total dose of ACE527, 10^10 cfu total
      dose of ACE527 with 25 µg dmLT, or placebo at 0, 1, and 2 months. Enrollment and dosing of
      Cohort 2 was dependent on an acceptable safety profile of the first dose of Cohort 1, based
      on evaluation of data up until Day 3 by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The first
      immunization of each Cohort was administered in the Center for Immunization Research (CIR)
      Inpatient Unit, followed by 72 hours of direct post-immunization observation. The SRC met
      after the first dose of cohort to determine continuation of volunteer dosing on an outpatient
      basis, and enrollment of Cohort 2. The SRC met again after the first dose of Cohort 2 after
      concluding that the first dose appeared safe and well tolerated, subsequent doses would be
      administered on an outpatient basis. Safety was assessed by solicited symptoms/subject memory
      aid and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events (AE)s were graded according to standardized
      criteria. The immunogenicity outcome measures of interest include serum immunoglobulin G
      (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      against all vaccine antigens, cytokine assays, B and T cell memory responses, shedding
      profile of ACE527, and vaccine specific mucosal IgA responses.

      Part B challenge cohorts were recruited among those participating in Part A; plus additional
      unvaccinated control volunteers sufficient to enroll up to a total of 60 recruited, as
      needed. Volunteers in the Phase 2b study were enrolled and challenged in 2-4 cohorts due to
      the CIR Inpatient Unit capacity of 30 beds. A minimum of 8-10 controls were challenged with
      each cohort of vaccinees to ensure comparability of attack rates across challenge cohorts.
      Volunteers were admitted as inpatients and challenged, with approximately 2 x 10^7 cfu of the
      fully virulent ETEC strain, H10407, followed by 5 days of direct observation. A Data Review
      Committee (DRC) will be convened to review the clinical data for all challenged volunteers
      and verify all outcomes per protocol definitions before any vaccine efficacy assessments were
      made.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female healthy adults between 18 and 50 years of age at the time of
             enrollment.

          2. General good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of PI.

          3. Negative pregnancy test at screening and before the first (V0), second (V28), and
             third vaccinations (V56) for female volunteers of childbearing potential. Females of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an efficacious hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female volunteers unable to
             bear children must have this documented (e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or must
             have negative pregnancy tests.

          4. Willingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been
             explained and written informed consent obtained.

          5. Completion of a training session and demonstrated comprehension of the protocol
             procedures and knowledge of ETEC associated illness by passing a written examination
             (70% pass score).

          6. Availability for the study duration, including all planned follow-up visits.

          7. Received at least 2 doses of ACE527 vaccine alone or in combination with 25 ug dmLT
             4-6 months prior to challenge (Part B only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator precludes participation in the study. Some medical conditions which are
             adequately treated and stable would not preclude entry into the study. These
             conditions might include stable asthma controlled with inhalers or mild hypertension
             stably controlled with a single agent.

          2. Significant abnormalities in screening hematology, or serum chemistry as determined by
             PI or PI in consultation with the Medical Officer and sponsor.

          3. Presence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBsAg, or HCV antibody.

          4. Evidence of IgA deficiency (serum IgA &lt; 7 mg/dl or limit of detection of assay).

          5. Evidence of current excessive alcohol consumption or drug dependence.

          6. Volunteers whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is less than 19.0 or greater than 34.0 (kg/m2)

             of study participation (note: The Red Cross will not allow blood donations for 1 year
             following participation in an investigational research study).

          9. Any other criteria which, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the ability
             of the volunteer to participate in the study, the safety of the study, or the results
             of the study

         10. Working as a food handler, in child-care or as a healthcare worker with direct patient
             contact.

         11. Have household contacts who are &lt;2 years old or &gt;80 years old or infirm or
             immunocompromised (for reasons including corticosteroid therapy, HIV infection, cancer
             chemotherapy, or other chronic debilitating disease).

         12. Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 per week or more than 3 per day).

         13. Regular (≥ weekly) use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach
             acidity.

         14. Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and
             others) within 30 days preceding the first vaccination or planned use during the
             active study period.

         15. Symptoms consistent with Traveler's Diarrhea concurrent with travel to countries where
             ETEC infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to
             dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study.

         16. Vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin within 3 years prior to
             dosing.

         17. Use of antibiotics during the 7 days before dosing or proton pump inhibitors, H2
             blockers or antacids within 48hours prior to dosing.

         18. History of diarrhea in the 7 days prior to vaccination (outpatient diarrhea is defined
             as ≥ 3 unformed (grade 3 or greater) loose stools in 24 hours).

         19. Known allergy to two of the three following antibiotics: Ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin,
             and/or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole

        <title>Part B: Number and Percentage of Subjects Experiencing Severe Diarrhea Following H10407 Challenge Strain</title>
        <description>Severe diarrhea was defined as &gt;800 grams of grade 3-5 stools passed over the 120-hour observation period. For episodes starting at or before 120 hours post-challenge, volunteers were followed to resolution and the total stool output weight was considered in determining whether a specific volunteer met the primary definition of severe diarrhea. The end of a diarrheal episode occurred when a volunteer did not pass any grade 3-5 stool in a 24-hour period.
Grades were defined as follows:
Grade 1: firm, formed (normal) Grade 2: soft, formed (normal) Grade 3: viscous opaque liquid or semi-liquid which assumes the shape of the container Grade 4: watery, non-viscous, opaque liquid which assumes the shape of the container Grade 5: clear or translucent, watery or mucoid liquid which assumes the shape of the container</description>
