    <textblock>
      The study proposes to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PD 0360324 in
      subjects with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis inadequately treated with standard of care
      therapies.

      The trial was terminated prematurely on Mar 24, 2014 due to a business decision. The decision
      to terminate the trial was not based on any clinical safety or efficacy concerns.
