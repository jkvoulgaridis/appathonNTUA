    <textblock>
      In hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) the investigators recently
      discovered the accumulation of two neurotoxic sphingolipids. It appears that these lipids
      arise as the mutant enzyme has a reduced affinity for its normal preferred substrate
      L-serine. The investigators now plan to perform a two year study of L-serine supplementation
      to correct the biochemistry and neurological disease in humans with HSAN1. In the course the
      investigators will also establish correlations between an existing neurological rating scale
      of sensory neuropathy and intraepidermal nerve fiber density.

    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of L-serine in subjects with hereditary
      sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1). Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN1)
      is a progressive and debilitating illness for which currently no treatment exists. The
      investigators recently identified two novel deoxysphingoid bases (DSB) that accumulate in
      plasma of HSAN1 patients and mutant transgenic HSAN1 mice. The disease is caused by missense
      mutations in the SPTLC1 gene encoding a subunit of the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase
      (SPT). In normal circumstances the SPT enzyme catalyzes the reaction of palmitoyl-CoA with
      serine to form sphinganine. The two newly identified DSB, deoxysphinganine and
      deoxymethylsphinganine, arise from condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with alanine and glycine
      respectively, suggesting that HSAN1 mutations alter amino acid selectivity of SPT. In support
      of this hypothesis the investigators have shown that levels of DSB in humans and mice can be
      lowered by supplementation with the enzyme's normal substrate, serine.

      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross over study the investigators will
      enroll 20 research participants with HSAN1 with 10 subjects assigned to L-serine (400mg/kg/d)
      and 10 assigned to placebo who are each treated for 12 months. The 10 subjects assigned to
      placebo will then be crossed over to active L-serine for the remaining 12 months. The
      progression of HSAN1 will be measured by the change in an established clinical rating scale
      and measures of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) on skin biopsy. L-serine levels
      will be measured using 24-hour pharmacokinetic blood sample at 12-month intervals. The
      investigators will assess the percentage of failures (clinical decline of &gt; 1 point on CMTNS
      or &gt; 30% decrease in IENFD) at 6 month intervals. Regardless of CMTNS score, all subjects who
      are on placebo for the first year will be switched to active study drug in year two.

      After the 2 year period subjects will be given the option of being re-consented for the open
      label extension. All consented subjects will then be treated with L-serine (400 mg/kg/d) for
      an additional year.

    <time_frame>48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) is a 0 to 36 point composite scoring assessment that is used to measure disease severity in Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy and other sensory and motor neuropathies. The CMTNS is composed of 9 items that evaluate functions related to disease progression. These 9 parameters include reviewing sensory symptoms, motor symptoms (arms and legs), pinprick sensibility, vibration, leg strength, arm strength, and nerve conduction tests. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, with the lower scores representing less severe symptoms and higher scores representing more severe symptoms.The 9 individual item scores are then totaled to provide a global measure of disease severity. For example the lowest possible total score is 0 which represents an asymptomatic individual and the highest score possible is a 36 which represents an individual with severe disease progression. There are sub scores that can be assessed but sub scores were not utilized in this study</description>

    <time_frame>48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomic Function Testing (AFT) tests the effectiveness of your autonomic nervous system which regulates important functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. AFT results are quantified using the composite autonomic severity score scale (CASS) which is a scale from 0 to 10 that is the sum of three sub scores (cardiovagal, adrenergic, and sudomotor). Cardiovagal is scored from 0 to 3, sudomotor is scored from 0 to 3, and adrenergic is scored from 0 to 4. The tests include deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, head-up tilt, and a sweat test. The three subscores are then summed. This total represents the CASS which classifies autonomic function as normal functioning (total score 0), mild (total score 1-3), moderate (total score 4-6), or severe (total score 7-10).</description>

          <description>The Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) is a 36-point composite scoring assessment that assesses disease severity in neuropathies. It is composed of 9 items that evaluate functions related to disease progression including assessing sensory symptoms, motor symptoms, pinprick sensibility, vibration, leg strength, arm strength, and nerve conduction tests. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 with the lower scores representing less severe symptoms and higher scores representing more severe symptoms.The individual item scores are then totaled to provide a global measure of disease severity</description>

        <title>Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score</title>
        <description>The Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) is a 0 to 36 point composite scoring assessment that is used to measure disease severity in Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy and other sensory and motor neuropathies. The CMTNS is composed of 9 items that evaluate functions related to disease progression. These 9 parameters include reviewing sensory symptoms, motor symptoms (arms and legs), pinprick sensibility, vibration, leg strength, arm strength, and nerve conduction tests. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, with the lower scores representing less severe symptoms and higher scores representing more severe symptoms.The 9 individual item scores are then totaled to provide a global measure of disease severity. For example the lowest possible total score is 0 which represents an asymptomatic individual and the highest score possible is a 36 which represents an individual with severe disease progression. There are sub scores that can be assessed but sub scores were not utilized in this study</description>

        <title>Autonomic Function Testing (AFT) Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS)</title>
        <description>Autonomic Function Testing (AFT) tests the effectiveness of your autonomic nervous system which regulates important functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. AFT results are quantified using the composite autonomic severity score scale (CASS) which is a scale from 0 to 10 that is the sum of three sub scores (cardiovagal, adrenergic, and sudomotor). Cardiovagal is scored from 0 to 3, sudomotor is scored from 0 to 3, and adrenergic is scored from 0 to 4. The tests include deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, head-up tilt, and a sweat test. The three subscores are then summed. This total represents the CASS which classifies autonomic function as normal functioning (total score 0), mild (total score 1-3), moderate (total score 4-6), or severe (total score 7-10).</description>
