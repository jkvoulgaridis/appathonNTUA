      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SAR422459 in patients with Stargardt's
      Macular Degeneration.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess:

        -  Safety

        -  Biological activity

      Patients will be followed for 15 years after completion/early termination from the previous
      TDU13583 study (NCT01367444).

      As the initial TDU13583 study is terminated - recruitment to this LTS13588 study is over with
      27 patients enrolled.
