    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to investigate safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of NNC 0129-0000-1003 (N8-GP)
      in children with severe haemophilia A who have undergone treatment with previous factor VIII
      (FVIII) products.

    <description>The incremental recovery was defined as the increase in plasma FVIII activity per IU/kg of factor administered recorded 60 minutes after end of injection. It was calculated as (Factor VIII procoagulant [FVIII:C] activity measured in plasma 60 min after dosing - FVIII:C activity measured in plasma immediately before dosing) / (dose injected at time 0 min), where the dose was expressed as U FVIII product per kg body weight. A chromogenic assay with normal human plasma (NHP) as calibrator was used.</description>

    <description>The incremental recovery was defined as the peak level recorded 60 min after end of injection and dose-normalised. It was calculated as (FVIII:C activity measured in plasma 60 min after dosing - FVIII:C activity measured in plasma immediately before dosing) / (dose injected at time 0 min), where the dose was expressed as U FVIII product per kg body weight.

    <measure>Terminal Half-life Evaluated for Previous FVIII Product</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 weeks prior to initial dosing with N8-GP and up to 30 hours after administration of previous FVIII product</time_frame>
    <description>t½ = ln(2) / λz, where t½ is terminal half-life and λz is the terminal elimination rate. The terminal elimination rate was planned estimated using linear regression on the terminal part of the time versus log(concentration) curve. A population-based method simultaneously estimating individual t½ values for all patients was applied, including patients with few values above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). This was estimated using time points from 1h to 30h. A chromogenic assay with PSS as calibrator was used.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 36 sites in 15 countries as follows: Canada (1), France (2), Germany (1), Greece (2 sites screened/1 site randomised subjects), Israel (1), Italy (1), Japan (2), Lithuania (1), Malaysia (1), Portugal (1), Switzerland (3), Turkey (3), Ukraine (2), United Kingdom (3), and United States (12).</recruitment_details>

          <title>Younger Children (0 - 5 Years)</title>
          <description>Participants (0 - 5 years) previously treated with FVIII received N8-GP (prophylaxis or treatment of bleeding episodes). Prophylaxis: N8-GP as a single bolus iv injection 60 IU/kg twice weekly. Treatment of bleeding episodes: N8-GP ranging from 20−75 IU/kg, according to severity and location of bleeding episode. The trial consisted of main and extension phase. Duration of main phase for each subject was approximately 26 weeks (50 exposure days). After completion of main phase, subjects could continue until the end of the extension phase, which was defined as LPLV. All subjects continued twice weekly or every third day prophylaxis regimen in extension phase as prescribed for main phase. However, after 12 months treatment with N8-GP (main phase+extension phase) the investigator was permitted to prescribe extra coverage before physical activities.</description>

        <description>t½ = ln(2) / λz, where t½ is terminal half-life and λz is the terminal elimination rate. The terminal elimination rate was planned estimated using linear regression on the terminal part of the time versus log(concentration) curve.
