      Efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate in improving the activities of daily living
      for patients with antibody positive MuSK myasthenia gravis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of amifampridine phosphate in patients with MuSK-MG. In
      addition, a sample of AChR-MG patients will be assess for efficacy and safety of
      amifampridine phosphate. Planned duration of participation for each patient is at least 38
      days, excluding the screening period. Eligible patients will be titrated to an efficacious
      dose of amifampridine phosphate and those who demonstrate improvement will be randomized to
      either placebo or amifampridine, in a double-blind fashion, for 10 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has
             been explained and before the start of any research-related procedures.

          2. Male or female ≥18 years of age.

          3. Positive serologic test for anti-MuSK antibodies or anti-AChR antibodies as confirmed
             at Screening or by previous antibody test, with report available.

          4. Confirmatory EMG or EMG report.

          5. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Class II to IV at Screening.

          6. MG-ADL score of ≥6 at Screening, with more than 50% of this score attributed to
             non-ocular items.

          7. Patients receiving steroids or pyridostigmine should not have any modification of drug
             regimen during the month before Screening.

          8. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] at screening); and must practice an effective,
             reliable contraceptive regimen during the study and for up to 30 days following
             discontinuation of treatment.

          9. Ability to participate in the study based on overall health of the patient and disease
             prognosis, as applicable, in the opinion of the Investigator; and able to comply with
             all requirements of the protocol, including completion of study questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Epilepsy and currently on medication.

          2. Concomitant use of medicinal products with a known potential to cause QTc
             prolongation.

          3. Patients with long QT syndromes.

          4. History of thymectomy within 12 months before Screening.
