  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized controlled trial design to compare the psychological effects of
      surf therapy to hike therapy in active duty service members who have been diagnosed with
      major depressive disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, longitudinal randomized controlled trial will enroll up to 86 active duty
      service members with major depressive disorder who are seeking surf or hike therapy as part
      of their standard medical care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of
      either surf or hike therapy. Assessor-administered and self-report measures will be completed
      at pre- and post-program, as well as three months following program completion. Participants
      also will complete brief, self-report assessments before and after each program activity
      session.
