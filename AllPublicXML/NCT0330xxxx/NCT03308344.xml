  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to contextualize the delivery of mindfulness training for military spouses
      and evaluate its effectiveness on measures of executive functions and psychological
      well-being.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to psychological and physical health challenges that military service members
      face, military deployment is known to have deleterious effects on the entire family unit. The
      January 2010 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine reported medical data from over
      250,000 wives of deployed soldiers. These women suffered from clinically significant levels
      of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and adjustment disorders. Thus, the psychological
      profile of military spouses sadly parallels that of the military servicemembers.
      Unfortunately, the effect of deployment on the psychological health in military spouses is
      largely unstudied, and very few resilience-building programs are available for military
      families.

      Prior research showed that mindfulness training (MT), as a resilience-building program in
      civilian and military servicemembers, can effectively protect against degradation in of
      executive functions (i.e., attention, working memory) and benefit psychological well-being
      over high-demand intervals. While research evidence mounts that MT is beneficial for service
      members, there is almost no research examining the impact of MT on military spouses'
      cognitive functioning and psychological well-being.

      The present study aims to investigate if MT may successfully benefit cognitive functioning
      and psychological well-being in military spouses.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be assigned into three groups: (i) a mindfulness training with spouse trainers (MT-ST, n = 60) that will receive the training from peers who underwent an extensive training practicum; (ii) a mindfulness training with mindfulness expert trainer group (MT-ME, n = 30) that will receive the training from a mindfulness expert trainer; and (ii) a wait-list control group (WLC, n = 30) that will be tested before and after a no-training interval and may receive MT at a later time after their second testing if they are interested.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to post-intervention (testing 2), which is an average of 5 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>SART is used to assess attentional performance and mind wandering. The task uses a continuous performance paradigm involving button presses to frequently presented non-targets (numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) but requires the participants to withhold their motor response to the infrequent target (number 3). The subjective experience of mind wandering during SART is assessed through experience sampling probes randomly presented throughout the task.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Working Memory task (WM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to post-intervention (testing 2), which is an average of 5 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>WMMW is used to assess working memory performance</description>

    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to post-intervention (testing 2), which is an average of 5 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS assesses positive and negative affect. It consists of a list of descriptors of positive (e.g., 'interested', 'enthusiastic') and negative (e.g., 'irritable', 'upset') affects. Items are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely), according to how participants feel. The Positive Affect scale reflects the extent to which a person feels enthusiastic, active, and alert; the Negative Affect scale reflects unpleasant mood states, such as anger, disgust, and fear.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to post-intervention (testing 2), which is an average of 5 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>PSS assesses the degree to which situations in one's life are viewed as stressful within the past month. Individual items assess feelings of stress, nervousness, irritation at life's hassles, and perceptions of one's own coping and control over a situation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-Compassion Scale (SCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to post-intervention (testing 2), which is an average of 5 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Perseverative Thoughts Questionnaire (PTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to post-intervention (testing 2), which is an average of 5 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
