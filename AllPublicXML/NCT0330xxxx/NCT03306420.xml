  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of MS201408-0005A as single
      agent (Part IA only) and in combination with MS201408-0005C or MS201408-0005B (Part IB, Part
      IC).

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early due to lackluster pharmacodynamic data that showed no
    significant reduction of plasma kynurenine at steady state of M4112.

        <title>Part 1A Dose Escalation: Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) as Per National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.03</title>
        <description>DLTs was assessed as per NCI CTCAE v 4.03. DLT defined as any Grade greater than or equal (&gt;=) 3 nonhematological AE or Immune-related adverse event (irAE) assessed by Investigator or Sponsor during first Cycle (first 28 days) of study treatment. Asymptomatic Grade &gt;= 3 lipase or amylase elevation not associated with clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. Any TEAE observed in subsequent cycle. Any Grade 4 neutropenia of &gt;= 5 days duration, Grade &gt;= 3 febrile neutropenia, Grade 3 hemoglobin decrease despite blood transfusion or erythroid growth factor. Grade 4 hemoglobin decrease assessed as related to study drug. Any Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding. Any Grade &gt;= 3 clinical signs and symptoms related to increased QTc.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Each Cycle is of 28 days)</time_frame>
        <population>DLT analysis set included all participants treated in dose escalation cohorts who do not miss greater than (&gt;) 5 planned total daily doses of M4112 in the first cycle (first 28 days) of the dose escalation part for other than DLT.</population>

          <description>DLTs was assessed as per NCI CTCAE v 4.03. DLT defined as any Grade greater than or equal (&gt;=) 3 nonhematological AE or Immune-related adverse event (irAE) assessed by Investigator or Sponsor during first Cycle (first 28 days) of study treatment. Asymptomatic Grade &gt;= 3 lipase or amylase elevation not associated with clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. Any TEAE observed in subsequent cycle. Any Grade 4 neutropenia of &gt;= 5 days duration, Grade &gt;= 3 febrile neutropenia, Grade 3 hemoglobin decrease despite blood transfusion or erythroid growth factor. Grade 4 hemoglobin decrease assessed as related to study drug. Any Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding. Any Grade &gt;= 3 clinical signs and symptoms related to increased QTc.</description>
          <population>DLT analysis set included all participants treated in dose escalation cohorts who do not miss greater than (&gt;) 5 planned total daily doses of M4112 in the first cycle (first 28 days) of the dose escalation part for other than DLT.</population>

        <description>ECOG PS score is widely used by doctors and researchers to assess how a participants' disease is progressing, and is used to assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the participant, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The score ranges from Grade 0 to Grade 4, where Grade 0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction, Grade 1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (like light house work, office work), Grade 2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, Grade 3 = Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours and Grade 4 = Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair. Number of participants with on-treatment shift in ECOG PS Score from 0 to 1 were reported.</description>

          <description>ECOG PS score is widely used by doctors and researchers to assess how a participants' disease is progressing, and is used to assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the participant, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The score ranges from Grade 0 to Grade 4, where Grade 0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction, Grade 1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (like light house work, office work), Grade 2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, Grade 3 = Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours and Grade 4 = Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair. Number of participants with on-treatment shift in ECOG PS Score from 0 to 1 were reported.</description>

        <description>BOR was determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version1.1(RECIST 1.1).Best response obtained among all tumor assessment visits after the date of first study drug administration until documented disease progression. BOR rate is defined as the number of participants with BOR was either confirmed complete response (CR) partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) relative to the number of participants belonging to the study of interest. CR:Disappearance of all target lesions; PR:At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; PD:At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; SD:Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was defined as the presence of at least 1 confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) as judged by RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined for target lesions (TLs) as the disappearance of all lesions, and for non-target lesions (NTLs) as the disappearance of all non-target non-measurable lesions and/or normalization of serum levels of tumor markers. PR was defined for TLs as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline (BL) in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs.</description>

          <title>Part 1A Dose Escalation: Time to Tumor Response</title>
          <description>Tumor response was defined as the presence of at least 1 confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) as judged by RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined for target lesions (TLs) as the disappearance of all lesions, and for non-target lesions (NTLs) as the disappearance of all non-target non-measurable lesions and/or normalization of serum levels of tumor markers. PR was defined for TLs as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline (BL) in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs.</description>
