  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Prematurity rate has increased and is a risk factor for developmental delay.
      Preterm infants with low visual tracking might present deficits in cognition, language, and
      fine motor function in future ages. Few studies applied home stimulation of the visual system
      for preterm infant (PT) at an early age.

      Objective: To compare the effects of early visual stimulation to a standard care group in
      visual function, motor and sensory development.

      Methods: Randomized controlled trial. At home setting. Thirty healthy preterm infants,
      gestational age from 28 to 37 weeks, aged from one to two months of corrected age at the
      entrance of the study, with low visual function, will be evaluated. Participants will be
      randomly allocated to: (1) a standard care group, receiving orientation about general sensory
      and motor development, (2) an early visual stimulation group receiving a 4-week home based
      protocol applied by caregivers additional to standard care. Outcomes will be measured at
      before the beginning of stimulation, at the end of stimulation and at 6 months of corrected
      age. Primary outcome is visual function evaluated by ML Leonhardt Battery of Optotypes.
      Secondary outcomes include motor and sensory development evaluated by scales.

    <masking_description>Two kind of researchers will be part of the study: a) assessors, which are the researchers that will perform assessments and apply stimulation with the caregivers; b) ratters, which are the researchers that will rate the scales from videos. Assessors will not be blind to group allocation. Ratters will be masked to group allocation, since videos analyses will be performed using coded study allocation. The statistician will also be blind to group allocation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Visual function - alertness, fixation, attention, tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>change measure: first day - before intervention; after intervention at home (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity will be assessed with ML Leonhardt Battery of Optotypes (MLLBOS) scale. MLLBOS consists of 8 visual carts, with high-contrast visual images of 12X12cm. The scale evaluates alertness, attention, fixation and visual tracking. The evaluation will be recorded by a digital video camera. The camera will be positioned fixed to the infant's face.</description>

    <measure>Sensory profile</measure>
    <time_frame>change measure: first day - before intervention; after intervention at home (28 days); at 6 months of corrected age</time_frame>
    <description>Infant Sensory Profile Scale (SPS) is a 125 item, norm-referenced, parent-report questionnaire. Sensory processing is divided in six items: general processing, auditory processing, visual processing, tactile processing, vestibular processing and oral sensory processing.</description>

    <measure>Motor Development</measure>
    <time_frame>change measure: first day - before intervention; after intervention at home (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Motor development will be assessed with Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP). It is a functional motor scale for newborn infants and infants under 4 months of age. Twenty-eight Observed Items examine spontaneously emitted movements, such individual finger, ankle and wrist movements. Thirty-one Elicited Items, scored on 5-, 6-, or 7-point ordinal scales, test infant's movement responses to placement in various spatial orientations and to interesting sights and sounds.</description>

    <measure>Motor Development</measure>
    <time_frame>change measure: at 6 months of corrected age</time_frame>
    <description>Motor development will be assessed with Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). The AIMS is a validated and reliable measure of infant's development. The assessors observe the spontaneous repertoire of infant's skills detected through 58 items grouped under four postures: prone (21 items), supine (9 items), sitting (12 items), and standing (16 items)</description>

    <description>Early visual stimulation (EVS) will be implemented by caregivers.
Three phases:
the caregiver will establish eye-to-eye contact with the infant. The caregiver will communicate with the infant talking, singing, changing facial expressions, touching his/her face. Total duration of this part of stimulation is between 2 and 3 minutes
the caregivers will present visual contrast cards at a distance of 15-20 centimetres
the caregiver will present two toys to the infant
Stimulation will last for 28 days (4 weeks) in total, one time a day for 10-15 minutes, all days week.</description>
