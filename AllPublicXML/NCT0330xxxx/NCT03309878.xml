    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of mogamulizumab in combination
      with pembrolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with diffuse large B
      cell lymphoma that have come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not
      respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      mogamulizumab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) when administered in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in
      patients with relapsed, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To assess the
      safety and tolerability of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) when administered in combination with
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with relapsed, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
      (Phase I) III. To assess the progression-free survival of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) when
      administered in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) compared to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)
      alone in patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To assess the overall response
      rate, complete response rate, partial response rate, duration of response of KW-0761
      (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) compared to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone in
      patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the progression-free survival of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) when administered to patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large
      B-cell lymphomas differs based on the presence or absence of mutations in B2M or CD58 or
      amplifications in PD-L1.

      II. To determine whether the progression-free survival of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) when administered to patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large
      B-cell lymphomas differs based on changes in CD8 T-cell, natural killer (NK) cell, and FoxP3+
      regulatory T cell (Treg) prevalence in response to therapy as measured by
      immunohistochemistry.

      III. To determine whether KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alters the
      prevalence of peripheral blood CCR4+/FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells as well as effector CD4 and
      CD8 T-cells by multi-parametric flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mogamulizumab followed by a phase II
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      mogamulizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of subsequent
      courses. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

             principal investigator (PI)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Subjects with prior history of chemotherapy-induced or radiation-induced pulmonary
             toxicity require confirmation of diffuse capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment;
             exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer

          -  Patients with active cerebral or meningeal involvement by lymphoma should be excluded
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events

             I diabetes mellitus, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or endocrine
             deficiencies (such as hypothyroidism) managed with replacement hormones, including
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy are eligible

          -  Has a history or currently active (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids
             unless prior history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy induced pneumonitis meeting the

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4
             antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)

          -  Patients who are planning to receive allogeneic SCT in the near future as preliminary

             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is an
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab); these potential
             risks may also apply to KW-0761 (mogamulizumab)

             (mogamulizumab) has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm; patients
             are excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or

             detectable viral load, are not on a stable antiretroviral regimen, have a decreased
             CD4+ T-cell count (&lt; 500), or require prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of
             opportunistic infections

          -  Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]
             [qualitative] is detected) infection

               -  Note: No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by
                  local health authority

          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB)

          -  Patients with significant cardiac disease (e.g., New York Heart Association [NYHA]
