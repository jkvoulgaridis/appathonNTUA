    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with and without ipilimumab and radiation
      therapy when given before surgery works in treating patients with undifferentiated
      pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma that can be removed by surgery.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. Giving nivolumab, ipilimumab, and radiation therapy may work better in treating
      patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pathologic response of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab
      combination therapy administered in the neoadjuvant setting with and without radiation in
      patients with treatment-naive primary or locally recurrent resectable undifferentiated
      pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the change in percent viable tumor cells, percent hyalinization and necrosis,
      proliferation by phosphohistone H3 in biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and on treatment
      and surgical specimens.

      II. To assess the change in immune infiltrate in response to neoadjuvant nivolumab
      monotherapy and neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy in patients with
      resectable undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

      III. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and
      ipilimumab combination therapy administered in the neoadjuvant setting as assessed by imaging
      (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 and Immune Related Response
      Criteria [irRC]) in patients with resectable undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and
      dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

      IV. To assess the 12- and 24-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)
      of patients with resectable undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated
      liposarcoma treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab
      combination therapy.

      V. To evaluate the safety of nivolumab monotherapy and combination ipilimumab and nivolumab
      in the neoadjuvant setting and peri-operatively by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 criteria.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify immunologic and genomic markers correlating with clinical response to
      nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab with nivolumab combination therapy.

      II. To assess the quality of life of patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma and
      undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy followed by
      surgical resection.

      III. To analyze the microbiome to determine the role of the microbiome on development and
      response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of
      care surgery within 2 weeks after day 43.

      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A. Patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes on day 1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo standard of care surgery within 2 weeks after day 43.

      ARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, 29, and 43. Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy (RT) once daily (QD) for 5 days during days 15-47 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care surgery
      within 2 weeks after day 71.

      ARM D: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm C, ipilimumab as in Arm B, and RT as in Arm C in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard
      of care surgery within 2 weeks after day 71.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 18 weeks and then
      every 3 months for up to 2 years.

    <description>Pathologic response will be assessed at time of surgical resection by percentage hyalinization. The study will estimate the difference of the pathologic response between the treatment arms (A versus [vs] B, C vs D) along with the estimate of variation of the difference. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, linear mixed effect models for longitudinal measures will be employed to assess the change in the magnitude of the measures over time adjusting for multiple covariates including patient's characteristics, and tumor characteristics. Appropriate transformation of the outcome assessment values will be used to satisfy the normality assumption of linear mixed effect model.</description>

          -  Adult subjects with treatment naive primary or locally recurrent dedifferentiated
             liposarcoma (DDLPS) of the retroperitoneum or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
             (UPS) of the trunk or extremity will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if
             all of the following criteria apply.

             with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Patients must have disease determined to be surgically resectable and candidates for
             upfront surgery as agreed upon by a multidisciplinary consensus (Surgical Oncology,
             Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology) after presentation at sarcoma multidisciplinary
             conference. Resectable tumors are defined as having no significant vascular, neural or

             pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and
             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt; 140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
             Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
             prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type
             and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can
             resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Childbearing potential and agrees to use method(s) of contraception. For a teratogenic
             study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity
             (preclinical studies have not been done), a highly effective method(s) of
             contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required. The individual
             methods of contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the
             investigator. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must follow instructions for
             birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours,
             contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for
             the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. WOCBP should use an adequate
             method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab
             to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to
             the start of investigational product.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review contraception
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men who are sexually
             active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the
             investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a
             period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five
             half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days,
             respectively. Therefore, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue
             contraception for 7 months (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo
             five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.

          -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or
             surgically sterile) and azoospermic men do not require contraception.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.

          -  Other terms for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) may include, but are not
             limited to: pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, unclassified spindle cell sarcoma,
             spindle cell sarcoma not otherwise specified, pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma,
             pleomorphic fibroblastic sarcoma, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma,
             pleomorphic sarcoma with prominent inflammation, pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells,
             malignant fibrous histiocytoma (including storiform-pleomorphic and inflammatory
             subtypes), fibrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma (at least intermediate grade; located
             deep to the fascia in muscle).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease that is considered surgically unresectable, including, but not limited to
             significant vascular, neural, or bone involvement, and in cases where a complete

             therapeutic levels.

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.

          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
