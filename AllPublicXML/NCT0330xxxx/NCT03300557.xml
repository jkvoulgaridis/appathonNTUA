    <textblock>
      This pilot phase IIa trial studies how well exemestane works in treating patients with
      complex atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia or low
      grade endometrial cancer. Exemestane may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if there is a decrease in proliferation index, measured by Ki-67 expression,
      in complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH)/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) or low
      grade (grade 1 and grade 2) endometrial cancer cells from baseline to post-exemestane
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Circulating serum estradiol and progesterone. II. Pathological response (regression of
      CAH/EIN or low grade [grade 1 and grade 2] endometrial carcinoma).

      III. Tissue biomarkers. IV. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutational analysis through next
      generation sequencing and methylation status of endometrial tumor.

      V. Protein markers via tampon recovery before and after treatment. VI. DNA markers via tampon
      recovery. VII. Safety and adverse effects of treatment. VIII. Comparison of Ki-67 expression
      changes between study subjects and a historical cohort.

      IX. Evaluation of the levels of exemestane in the plasma samples pre and post treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) over 21-42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Patients undergo standard of care surgery between
      days 22-43.

      After completion of study treatment, patients with unresolved adverse events on day of
      surgery are followed up periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females with a histologically proven CAH/ EIN or low grade (grade 1 or grade 2)
             endometrial carcinoma (EC) for which surgery is planned; the pathologic report from
             the referring facility will be used to determine pathologic eligibility; this report
             must be within 45 days of their baseline (pre-surgical) clinic visit

          -  No prior treatment for CAH/EIN/EC

          -  Post-menopausal confirmed with one the following criteria:

               -  &gt;= 60 years of age

               -  Age 56 to 59 years of age with &gt;= 2 years of amenorrhea

               -  Age 56 to 59 years of age with &lt; 2 years of amenorrhea and follicle stimulating
                  hormone (FSH) within institutional post-menopausal range.

               -  Age 45 to 55 years of age with FSH within institutional post-menopausal range.
                  The Ki-67 expression changes based on menopausal status and specifically varies
                  based on what phase of the menstrual cycle the sample is collected. Therefore, in
                  order to eliminate this source of variability, only postmenopausal women will be
                  included in this trial. In addition, exemestane is currently approved for use in
                  post-menopausal women only.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 20

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who had curatively treated invasive malignancies for which all treatments
             ended within 1 year prior to the study (with the exception of basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  Not a surgical candidate or surgery is not scheduled within 43 days from starting the
