  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ketamine for Acute Pain in Burns study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group
      trial (RCT) with active control (usual care) contrasting the efficacy and safety of &quot;Ketamine
      Plus Opiate-based usual care&quot; (O+K) with the safety and efficacy of the &quot;Current Standard of
      Care&quot;. THe current standard of care is an opiate medication alone, Fentanyl (Usual
      Care-Opiate (UC-O), dose/timing as per Burn Center protocol).

  <detailed_description>

      Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC)
      are funding this RCT for the following reasons:

      Primary Aims:

        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl +
           ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during twice daily burn wound care
           across a 7-day study period and 30 day outcome period.

        2. To evaluate the opiate sparing effect of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl
           + ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during the 7-day study period and
           30 day outcome period.

      and

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To determine the short and long term effect of the Ketamine Augmentation Condition
           versus the Usual Care Condition on symptoms and syndromes of posttraumatic stress
           disorder and of depression,

        2. To evaluate several established and hypothesized moderators of the relationship between
           the Ketamine Augmentation Condition versus the Usual Care Condition on: 1) pain severity
           reported during wound care, 2) opiate use during wound care, 3) posttraumatic stress and
           4) depression.

          <title>Depression Symptoms as Assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire</title>
          <description>Severity and trajectory of depression symptoms as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9. The questionnaire has 9 items with each rated from 0 to 3. Overall scores ranges from 0 to 27 with 1-4 being minimal depression, 5-9 being mild depression, 10-14 being moderate depression, 15-19 being moderately severe depression and 20-27 being severe depression.</description>
          <population>Data was not collected for the minimum threshold [per the statistical analysis plan] of 6-11 consecutive wound care sessions to assess this outcome measure</population>
