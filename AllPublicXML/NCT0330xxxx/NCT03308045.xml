      Primary objective: safety and tolerability

      Secondary objectives: additional indicators of long term safety and indicators of clinical
      activity

      Exploratory objectives: to characterize EYS606 biodistribution, immunogenicity and biomarkers

      The maximum study duration per patient is 51 Weeks (including an up to 3 week screening
      period + 48 weeks follow-up after treatment).

      The study is conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase which will investigate
      three pEYS606 doses levels (lower, intermediate and higher dose) over 3 cohorts. Part 1 of
      the study has been completed. Part 2, the extension phase, which is now ongoing will confirm
      to safety of the maximum tolerated higher dose from Part 1 and allow a preliminary assessment
      of efficacy.

             chronic liver diseases, malignancy, severe systemic allergy, etc.) that in the opinion
