  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of monthly
      and quarterly subcutaneous (sc) injections of fremanezumab compared with sc injections of
      placebo in participants with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM) who have
      responded inadequately to 2 to 4 classes of prior preventive treatments.

      Approximately equal numbers of participants from each subgroup (CM and EM) are randomized in
      blinded-fashion 1:1:1 into one of 3 treatments for the subgroup - 2 active treatments and 1
      placebo treatment- consisting of monthly injections for 3 months (up to Week 12). Then all
      participants continue into an open-label extension of 3 months (up to Week 24) during which
      everyone is administered sc injections of fremanezumab.

    <description>A migraine day was defined as when at least 1 of the following situations occurred: A calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache meeting criteria for migraine with or without aura; a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of a headache meeting criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1 migraine criterion was missing; a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine-specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds). Monthly averages were derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by formula: (number of days of efficacy variable over relevant period/number of days with assessments recorded in e-diary over relevant period)*28.

    <description>A headache day of at least moderate severity was defined as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of headache of at least moderate severity or; a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine-specific acute medications (triptans and ergot compounds). Monthly averages were derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (number of days of efficacy variable over relevant period/number of days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28.

        <title>DB Period: Change From Baseline in Monthly Average Number of Days of Use of Any Acute Headache Medications During the 12-Week Period After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</title>
        <description>Baseline data and the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of days of use of any acute headache medications during the 12-week period after administration of the first dose of study drug (based on Week 0 to 12 data) is reported. Least Squares (LS) mean calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure (yes/no), migraine classification (EM/CM), and treatment*migraine classification as fixed effects, and baseline number of migraine days and years since onset of migraines as covariates.</description>

        <title>DB Period: Change From Baseline in Monthly Average Number of Headache Days of at Least Moderate Severity During the 4-Week Period After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</title>
        <description>A headache day of at least moderate severity was defined as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 4 consecutive hours of headache of at least moderate severity or; a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine-specific acute medications (triptans and ergot compounds). Monthly averages were derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (number of days of efficacy variable over relevant period/number of days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change was calculated as post-baseline value - baseline value. LS mean calculated using ANCOVA model with treatment, gender, region, special group of treatment failure (yes/no), migraine classification (EM/CM), and treatment*migraine classification as fixed effects, and baseline number of headache days of at least moderate severity and years since onset of migraines as covariates.</description>
