  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study to Study 200622.In this study subjects from Study
      200622 will be continued on 4-weekly dosing with open-label mepolizumab 300 milligram (mg)
      subcutaneously (SC) for an additional 20 Weeks after completing the 32 Week study assessments
      post-randomization, while they continue with their background HES therapy per standard of
      care (SoC). Subjects from study 200622 will participate in this extension study if they had
      completed the 32-Week treatment period in study 200622 or if they were withdrawn from the
      study pre-maturely, but were continued in the study per protocol until 32 Weeks from
      randomization. Data from this study (205203) and 200622 will be combined to provide up to
      52-Week exposure data to further characterize the long-term safety profile of mepolizumab and
      provide additional data on the clinical benefit in HES subjects beyond 32 Weeks. The duration
      of the study participation will be 20 Weeks for subjects who continue with mepolizumab
      treatment via MHE104317/MHE112562 after this open-label extension study; and 28 Weeks for
      subjects who do not continue with MHE104317/MHE112562.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Serious AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment. Non-serious AEs from start of study treatment until 28 days after last dose (up to Week 20) are reported. Number of participants with common (&gt;=3% incidence) non-serious AEs are presented.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Presence of Anti-drug Antibody</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 20 and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were analyzed for the presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies by binding anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. The binding ADA assay results at each visit were summarized as negative or positive. The binding ADA assay was performed in three steps; screening, confirmation and titration. The screening assay produced a result of positive or negative relative to a screening cut point. Positive samples continued with the confirmation assay, which also produced a result of positive or negative relative to a confirmation cut point. For positive confirmation samples, a titre value was obtained to quantify the degree of binding in a titration assay. Participants were considered 'Positive' if they had a positive confirmation ADA assay result.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a multi-center, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety profile of mepolizumab in participants with Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES). In this study, participants received open-label mepolizumab 300 milligram (mg) subcutaneously (SC).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 102 participants who completed the parent study (200622 [NCT02836496]) and met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in this open-label extension study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Blood samples were analyzed for the presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies by binding anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. The binding ADA assay results at each visit were summarized as negative or positive. The binding ADA assay was performed in three steps; screening, confirmation and titration. The screening assay produced a result of positive or negative relative to a screening cut point. Positive samples continued with the confirmation assay, which also produced a result of positive or negative relative to a confirmation cut point. For positive confirmation samples, a titre value was obtained to quantify the degree of binding in a titration assay. Participants were considered 'Positive' if they had a positive confirmation ADA assay result.</description>
