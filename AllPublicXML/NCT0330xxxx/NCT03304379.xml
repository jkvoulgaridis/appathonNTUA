    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared to
      placebo, when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients with pain due to osteoarthritis
      (OA) of the knee or hip.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
           (NSAID)s, when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients with pain due to OA of the
           knee or hip

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of fasinumab compared to placebo and compared to
           NSAIDs, when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients with pain due to OA of the knee
           or hip
