    <measure>Change From Baseline in Spectrophotometer L* Value (a Measurement of Skin Brightness)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate spectrophotometer readings were taken of the participant's face (Normal Skin and Target Lesions) at Baseline and Week 12. L* value scores range from 0=black to 100=white. An increase in the spectrophotometer L* values indicates improvement. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overall Photodamage Score</title>
        <description>The investigator assessed the participant's overall photodamage using a 10-point scale where None (0)= Facial skin is smooth to the touch, without significant fine/coarse line or skin tone unevenness in any areas (periocular, cheeks, forehead and perioral areas) to Severe (7 to 9)= Facial skin shows 3 or more areas (periocular, cheeks, forehead and perioral areas) of significant roughness, skin tone unevenness (red/brown), or fine/coarse lines at Baseline and Week 12. A decrease in score indicates improvement. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
