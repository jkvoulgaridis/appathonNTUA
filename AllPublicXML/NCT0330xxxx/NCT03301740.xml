  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of fluid removal (ultrafiltration, UF) during hemodialysis (HD) may contribute to
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among individuals receiving maintenance HD. More rapid
      UF rates are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Ultrafiltration profiling, the
      practice of varying UF rates to maximize fluid removal during periods of greatest hydration
      and plasma oncotic pressures, is one treatment modification that may reduce UF-related harm
      without necessitating reduction in interdialytic fluid intake or longer HD treatments. To
      date, UF profiling has not been adequately studied independent of sodium profiling.

      This study investigates the comparative effect of UF profiling versus non-profiled
      conventional HD on select cardiovascular and patient-reported outcomes. Participants will
      complete two phases of UF profiling and two phases of conventional HD and will act as their
      own controls.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a 4-phase crossover trial in which participants are successively alternated between conventional HD and conventional HD + linear UF profiling across 4 phases with intervening wash-out periods. The study compares conventional HD (the participant's standard HD prescription with no UF profiling) to conventional HD + linear UF profiling. Participants will be randomly allocated to conventional HD or conventional HD + linear UF profiling for phase 1. Participants will undergo 9 treatments during each phase for a total of 18 conventional HD treatments and 18 UF profiled treatments. Participants will undergo 3 wash-out HD treatments between phases.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Every study hemodialysis treatment, up to 36 treatments per participant over 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intradialytic blood pressure (BP) was measured with an upper extremity cuff in seated position at 15-minute intervals during each hemodialysis treatment per standard dialysis clinic protocols. Intradialytic hypotension was defined as the presence of a nadir systolic BP &lt;90 mmHg. Odds ratios were estimated using a mixed model (repeated measures logistic regression model).</description>

    <measure>Pre- to Post-hemodialysis Treatment Change in Troponin T Level in ng/mL at Weeks 3, 7, 11, and 15, Using Mixed Model Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 3, 7, 11, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Troponin T blood samples were collected at 4 study visits. Specifically, at the 7th hemodialysis treatment in each respective study phase (i.e., at week 3, 7, 11, and 15 study visits). Pre- to post-hemodialysis troponin T change was calculated as: post-dialysis troponin T - pre-dialysis troponin T (ng/mL). A lower change value reflects less cardiac strain. Based on the pre-specified protocol, the reported values represent change in troponin T between pre- and post-hemodialysis using mixed model (repeated measures logistic regression) analysis that considered all specified time-points (i.e., weeks 3, 7, 11, and 15).</description>

    <description>Troponin T blood samples were collected before and after each participant's 7th hemodialysis treatment of each study phase (4 times during the study). Troponin T percentage change was calculated as [(Post-HD troponin T - pre-HD troponin T) / pre-HD troponin T] x100. Troponin T percentage rise was defined as a troponin T percentage change ≥10%. Odds ratios were estimated using a mixed model (repeated measures logistic regression model).</description>

    <description>Left ventricular GLS was measured with transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at 30 minutes before HD treatment end during the 7th treatment in the first phase of each arm. Left ventricular GLS change was calculated as peak intradialytic stress GLS - baseline GLS (%). A lower change value reflects lesser cardiac strain. Median differences were estimated using Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) tests.</description>

        <description>Troponin T blood samples were collected at 4 study visits. Specifically, at the 7th hemodialysis treatment in each respective study phase (i.e., at week 3, 7, 11, and 15 study visits). Pre- to post-hemodialysis troponin T change was calculated as: post-dialysis troponin T - pre-dialysis troponin T (ng/mL). A lower change value reflects less cardiac strain. Based on the pre-specified protocol, the reported values represent change in troponin T between pre- and post-hemodialysis using mixed model (repeated measures logistic regression) analysis that considered all specified time-points (i.e., weeks 3, 7, 11, and 15).</description>
