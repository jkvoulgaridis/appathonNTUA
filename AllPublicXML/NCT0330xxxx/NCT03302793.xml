  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the effect of combined breathing-controlled electrical stimulation
      (BreEStim) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neuropathic pain after
      spinal cord injury, amputation, or brain injury. The hypothesis is that a single session of
      combined BreEStim and tDCS will produce an additive analgesic effect. This record covers the
      study in a population of spinal cord injury patients. Note that this study will also enroll
      healthy volunteers, brain injury patients, and amputation patients and that this study as
      applied to these other populations will be covered in separate ClinicalTrials.gov records.

    <measure>Pain as Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 minutes after tDCS, 10 minutes after BreEstim</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. To allow a continuous assessment of pain, VAS uses a 10 cm line labelled at '0' with 'no pain' and '10' with 'worst pain'. The line is marked at a point corresponding to the assessment of the pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrical Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 minutes after tDCS, 10 minutes after BreEstim</time_frame>
    <description>Trimmed surface electrodes (1 inch by 1 inch) were used to examine electrical pain thresholds upon application of electrical stimulation (electrical stimulator 7SA, Digitimer). To measure electrical pain threshold, a pair of electrodes was placed next to each other centered on the thenar eminence (which is a group of muscles on the palm of the human hand at the base of the thumb); the intensity of electrical stimulation was started from the sensation threshold level (determined in outcome measure 3) and increased in steps of 1 mA; and subjects were instructed to close their eyes and to say ''yes'' when they first felt electrical stimulation painful. The electrical pain threshold is the mA level at which a participant first felt electrical stimulation painful. To improve consistency among subjects, they were advised that the pain threshold level was equivalent to 1 on the 0-10 VAS scale. Three repetitions were made and the average was used as the electrical pain threshold.</description>

    <description>Trimmed surface electrodes (1 inch by 1 inch) were used to examine electrical sensation threshold upon application of electrical stimulation (electrical stimulator 7SA, Digitimer). To measure electrical sensation threshold, a pair of electrodes was placed next to each other centered on the thenar eminence (which is a group of muscles on the palm of the human hand at the base of the thumb); the intensity of electrical stimulation was started from zero and gradually increased in steps of 0.1 mA; and subjects were instructed to close their eyes and to say ''yes'' when they explicitly felt electrical stimulation. The electrical sensation threshold is the mA level at which a participant explicitly felt electrical stimulation. Three repetitions were made and the average was used as the electrical sensation threshold.</description>

          -  have pain, but not neuropathic (e.g., from inflammation at the incision wound of the
             residual limb or neuroma)

          -  have a pacemaker, or other metal and/or implanted devices

          -  have amputation in their arm(s)

          -  have asthma or other pulmonary disease

          -  are not medically stable

          -  alcohol or drug abuse

          <title>Pain as Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. To allow a continuous assessment of pain, VAS uses a 10 cm line labelled at '0' with 'no pain' and '10' with 'worst pain'. The line is marked at a point corresponding to the assessment of the pain.</description>

        <title>Electrical Pain Threshold</title>
        <description>Trimmed surface electrodes (1 inch by 1 inch) were used to examine electrical pain thresholds upon application of electrical stimulation (electrical stimulator 7SA, Digitimer). To measure electrical pain threshold, a pair of electrodes was placed next to each other centered on the thenar eminence (which is a group of muscles on the palm of the human hand at the base of the thumb); the intensity of electrical stimulation was started from the sensation threshold level (determined in outcome measure 3) and increased in steps of 1 mA; and subjects were instructed to close their eyes and to say ''yes'' when they first felt electrical stimulation painful. The electrical pain threshold is the mA level at which a participant first felt electrical stimulation painful. To improve consistency among subjects, they were advised that the pain threshold level was equivalent to 1 on the 0-10 VAS scale. Three repetitions were made and the average was used as the electrical pain threshold.</description>
