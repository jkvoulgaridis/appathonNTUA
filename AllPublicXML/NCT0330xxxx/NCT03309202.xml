      This is a non randomized, open label, single dose, parallel cohort, multisite study to
      investigate the effect of varying degrees of hepatic impairment on the plasma
      pharmacokinetics (total and unbound) of PF-05221304 after a single oral dose administered in
      the fed state.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment.
