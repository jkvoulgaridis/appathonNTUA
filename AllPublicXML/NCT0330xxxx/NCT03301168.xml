  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate pediatric patients with malignant or non-malignant blood cell
      disorders who are having a blood stem cell transplant depleted of T cell receptor (TCR) alfa
      and beta cells that comes from a partially matched family donor. The study will assess
      whether immune cells, called T cells, from the family donor, that are specially grown in the
      laboratory and given back to the patient along with the stem cell transplant can help the
      immune system recover faster after transplant. As a safety measure these T cells have been
      programmed with a self-destruct switch so that they can be destroyed if they start to react
      against tissues (graft versus host disease).

      This is a Phase 2 extension study evaluating the safety and feasibility of BPX-501 T cells
      infused after partially mismatched, related, TCR alpha beta T cell depleted hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) in pediatric patients. The purpose of this clinical trial is to
      determine whether BPX-501 infusion can enhance immune reconstitution in those patients with
      hematologic disorders, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration severe acute
      graft versus host disease (GvHD).

      The trial will also evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the infusion of dimerizer drug
      (AP1903/rimiducid) in those subjects who present with GVHD that does not adequately respond
      to standard of care therapy.
