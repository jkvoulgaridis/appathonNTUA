  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial was to evaluate velocity-associated parameters of pulsed-wave
      Doppler ultrasound at induction, discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit and during
      inspiratory cough in addition to the consumption of phenylephrine during the operation in
      patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery with three types of anaesthesia
      management.

      The objective of the trial was to evaluate velocity-associated parameters of pulsed-wave
      Doppler ultrasound at induction, discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit and during
      inspiratory cough in addition to the consumption of phenylephrine during the operation in
      patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery with three types of anaesthesia
      management. The patients in this trial were visited during the entire operation and just
      before leaving the post-anaesthesia care unit. Velocity-associated data related to
      pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound and the consumption of phenylephrine were collected.
