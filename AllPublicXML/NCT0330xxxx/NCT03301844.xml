      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of, and patient satisfaction with
      Blephapad Combo in the treatment of posterior blepharitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blepharitis is the most common condition in patients seeking an eye examination due to
      discomfort or eye irritation. Treatment of blepharitis is recommended even in mild cases as
      chronic inflammation may cause permanent damage to the Meibomian glands.

      Each eye of each patient represents an experimental unit. Each patient will apply Blephapad
      Combo to one eye and standard treatment to the other eye in accordance with the randomization
      procedure.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled study with a closed sequential design is to evaluate
      versus standard treatment the efficacy of, and patient satisfaction with Blephapad Combo in
      the treatment of posterior blepharitis.

    <measure>Percentage Change of the Total Score of the Grading Scales for Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The total score of the meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading scale was automatically computed by the system as the sum of the six sub-scores (i.e. Lid margin findings of vascularity, Plugging of gland orifices, Lid margin irregularity, Lid margin thickening, Partial glands and Gland dropout), ranging from 0 to 15, where higher values rapresent a worse outcome.
The first four parameters were evaluated using photographic images of anterior segments, while the last two were evaluated using infrared images of the meibomian glands Based on the percentage change from baseline to week 4 of the total score of MGD score, Investigators will choose which of the two eyes had a better change of clinical features.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Total Score of the Grading Scales for Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (Improved vs Not Improved)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 2 (baseline) to Visit 3 (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>For each eye change from baseline to week 4 in the total score of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction was also expressed as one of the following outcomes:
Eye on Blephapad Combo: Improved-Eye on Standard: Improved
Eye on Blephapad Combo: Improved-Eye on Standard: NOT Improved
Eye on Blephapad Combo: NOT Improved-Eye on Standard: Improved
Eye on Blephapad Combo: NOT Improved-Eye on Standard: NOT Improved
The total score was automatically computed by the system as the sum of the six sub-scores (i.e. Lid margin findings of vascularity, Plugging of gland orifices, Lid margin irregularity, Lid margin thickening, Partial glands and Gland dropout), ranging from 0 to 15 (higher values rapresent a worse outcome).If the change of the total score was positive or equal to 0 the specific eye was referred as &quot;NOT improved&quot;,on the contrary if the change of the total score resulted negative the specific eye was referred as &quot;Improved&quot;. For each patient the results on the two eyes were combined.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients Preferring the Standard or the Study Treatment (i.e. Answers to a Specific Question on Patient Preference: Study Drug vs. Standard Treatment)</measure>

    <measure>Incidence of Ocular Adverse Events Reported Throughout the Study</measure>

    <measure>Compliance to Treatment Evaluated by Counting the Applications (Wet Wipes) to Each Eyes</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 2 (baseline) to Visit 3 (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to treatment was evaluated at Visit 3 by counting given wipes/gauze and unused/lost/damaged wipes/gauze.
The compliance to treatment was evaluated by counting given wipes/gauze and unused/lost/damaged wipes/gauze. The following formula was applied:
(Given wipes/gauze − (sum of unused/lost/damaged wipes/gauze)) / Expected number of wipes/gauze used) x 100. Where the &quot;given wipes/gauze&quot; were 60 and the &quot;expected number of wipes/gauze used&quot; were 2 per days per 4 weeks = 56.</description>

          <description>The total score of the meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading scale was automatically computed by the system as the sum of the six sub-scores (Lid margin findings of vascularity, Plugging of gland orifices, Lid margin irregularity, Lid margin thickening, Partial glands and Gland dropout), ranging from 0 to 15. The first four parameters were evaluated using photographic images of anterior segments, while the last two were evaluated using infrared images of the meibomian glands. Higher scores implied a worse meibomian gland condition while lower scores were correlated to a better condition.</description>

        <description>Adherence to treatment was evaluated at Visit 3 by counting given wipes/gauze and unused/lost/damaged wipes/gauze.
The compliance to treatment was evaluated by counting given wipes/gauze and unused/lost/damaged wipes/gauze. The following formula was applied:
(Given wipes/gauze − (sum of unused/lost/damaged wipes/gauze)) / Expected number of wipes/gauze used) x 100. Where the &quot;given wipes/gauze&quot; were 60 and the &quot;expected number of wipes/gauze used&quot; were 2 per days per 4 weeks = 56.</description>

Blephapad Combo: Blephapad Combo is used to cleanse, soften, sooth and decongest inflamed eyelids and cilia.
The combo also presents an applicator with a heatable tablet that is applied to the eyelid in order to clean and open occluded Meibomian glands, thereby allowing the production of lipids necessary for a healthy tear film. The heatable tablet is to be used prior to cleansing with Blephapad wipes.</description>
