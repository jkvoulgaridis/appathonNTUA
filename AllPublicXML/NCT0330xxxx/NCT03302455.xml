  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders. Online cognitive behavioral therapy
      for insomnia (e-aid Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, eCBTI) has received wide
      attention in recent years. Foreign countries already have some eCBTI treatment tool, shown
      similar efficacy as standard CBTI, but how eCBTI can help in acute insomnia disorders require
      further exploration and examination.

      In this study, Investigators will establish eCBTI treatment tool to test whether eCBTI can
      reduce the conversion of acute insomnia disorder to chronic insomnia disorder; and whether
      they can improve sleep-related symptoms, anxious and depressive symptoms, and quality of life

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia patients are collected from: Outpatient from Sleep clinics. Included 200 cases of
      acute insomnia patients, the participants will randomly divided into 100 brief eCBTI Group
      and 100 patients with control group, brief eCBTI Group will receive 1 Week eCBTI intervention
      and control group will not receive any intervention. Both groups will receive 3 months of
      follow-up.

      At week 2, ISI and HADS will be conducted. Brief eCBTI group will also complete Treatment
      Component Adherence Scale (TCAS) in order to assess treatment adherence to and perceived
      helpfulness of each therapeutic element. At 3 months, two groups of subjects will have
      baseline assessment(except socio-demographic information), including chronic insomnia
      disorder diagnosis and self evaluation form (ISI, DBAS, SHPS ,PSAS,FIRST,ESS,HADS,SF-12v2).

      This study provides a Smartphone to complete third-party applications online insomnia
      treatment procedures. Brief eCBTI includes 1-week core curriculum: sleep hygiene education,
      sleep restriction, stimulus control, relaxation audios, cognitive components, information
      about sleeping pills, and a brief overview.

      Previous studies have shown that approximately 40% of acute insomnia disorder will turn into
      Chronic insomnia disorder.While our preliminary work suggests, with the extension of
      follow-up time, high rates of chronic insomnia may be more ( 52.3% ).In order to meet the 95%
      confidence intervals (Confidence Interval, CI )( 35%-49% ) requirement, the project needs 200
      acute insomnia disorder subjects, and random access eCBTI Treatment group and the control
      group (100 Cases) of whom an estimated 70% or more participants can complete 3 months of
      follow-up. This sample size ensures continuous data of small sample (Cohen d = 0.30)
      statistical effect is greater than 0.8, And test the odds ratio of dichotomous variables
      (Odds Ratio, OR) greater than 1.50(p&gt;0.05 ).

      Mean value for continuous variable data ± Standard deviation, Numerical or categorical
      variable data expressed as a percentage. T test for the continuous variables and Chi Square
      test for the categorical variables will be used. Using repeated measures for analysis of
      variance to compare two sets of continuous variables in the treatment and follow-up of
      changes in the process (such as ISI score, etc). Incidence of chronic insomnia is computed
      using Chi Square test. All statistical procedures are used in Windows running 26.0 version of
      the SPSS package (IBM SPSS 26.0).

    <masking_description>Two trained psychiatrists, who conduct telephone interview to confirm the diagnosis of chronic insomnia at 3 months, are blinded to the group assignment of each participant. The independent researcher from the IT department, who carries out the randomization and allocation procedure, is blinded to the study protocol. Participants is not blinded to treatment allocation as participants in the TAU alone group only receive treatment as usual.</masking_description>

    <measure>Changes in Insomnia Severity Index(ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline，week 2, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measure of a patient's sleepiness is measured with Epworth Sleepiness Scale.The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-report 8-item questionnaire producing scores from 0 to 24. Scores greater than 10 suggest significant daytime sleepiness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale has good psychometric properties , correlates with objective measures of sleepiness , and has been shown to differentiate between individuals with and without sleep disorders and those who are and are not sleep deprived.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a self-report questionnaire to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a participant is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. For anxiety (HADS-A) this gave a specificity of 0.78 and a sensitivity of 0.9. For depression (HADS-D) this gave a specificity of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.83.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Component Adherence Scale (TCAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported questionnaire will be administered posttreatment to assess adherence to CBTI guidelines and the perceived helpfulness of treatment guidelines. Adherence to each therapeutic element will be rated on a 0 to 3 scale as follows: (0) Followed rarely or not at all; (1) Followed occasionally; (2) Followed most of the time; (3) Followed consistently. Ratings for all therapeutic elements will be broadly grouped into a Behavioral Component and a Cognitive Component.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DBAS is a 30-item self-report questionnaire designed to evaluates sleep-related beliefs, querying respondents' expectations and attitudes regarding the causes, consequences, and potential treatments of sleep issues. The 30-item version showed adequate psychometric properties as evidenced by good internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha = 0.80), moderate item-total correlations (mean rs = 0.37), and adequate convergent and discriminant validity.Likert-type scale requiring participants to choose from 1 to 5 will be used. Thus, the results are quantified in terms of strength of endorsed beliefs. A higher score indicates more dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep. The total score is based on the average score of all items.</description>
