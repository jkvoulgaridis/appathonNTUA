    <intervention_model_description>This is a long term follow up (LTFU) study designed to evaluate the overall long term safety, durability of transgene expression, and effect on clinical outcomes of SPK 9001 mediated gene transfer. While safety will be monitored in general, new onset of oncologic, hematologic, neurologic, or auto immune events will be of particular interest. This trial will last for 5 years providing a minimum of 6 years of follow up post vector administration.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          2. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,
             and other study procedures.

          3. Subjects who met the C0371005 eligibility criteria, have received a single
             administration of SPK-9001, and completed the required assessments in the C0371005
             clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or
             subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved
             in the conduct of the study.

          2. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within the last 12
             weeks prior to study entry, excluding participation in C0371005, and/or during study
             participation.

          3. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

          4. Fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a condom as outlined in this
             protocol until 3 consecutive semen samples are negative in the vector shedding
             analysis after the last dose of investigational product.

          5. Subjects who will not consent for up to 5 years of safety follow-up.

          6. Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with the study visits and requirements.

          7. Subjects with any clinically significant medical condition that the Investigator
             believes would pose as a safety risk or are not capable of performing the endpoints of
             this study.
