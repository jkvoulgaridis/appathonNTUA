  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the risks and benefits of early screening of Alzheimer's disease.
      Early diagnosis through screening may enhance the family member's transition to a family
      caregiver and reduce caregiver burden by providing an opportunity for the family member to
      learn about the syndrome, receive interventions, and to prepare for their new care giving
      role.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are proposing the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the benefits and
      harms of AD screening on family members of older adults. The proposed trial will randomize
      1,800 dyads (older adult and family member) into three groups. Older adults in the first
      group will be screened for AD at baseline coupled with disclosure of the screening results to
      the dyad and to the patient's primary care provider (Screening Only Group). Older adults in
      the second group will be screened for AD at baseline coupled with disclosure of the screening
      results and, if they screen positive, referred to the Aging Brain Care (ABC) Program for
      diagnostic evaluation and care, if AD is diagnosed (Screening Plus Group). Older adults in
      the third group will not be screened at baseline and will observed through surveillance of
      the patients' EHR for any screening or incident AD diagnoses that occurs as part of routine
      care. At the last follow-up assessment (24 months) we will we will screen the older adults
      and conduct an interview with the family caregiver to detect possible cognitive impairment
      (Control Group).

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of AD screening on family members' quality of life.

      Hypothesis 1: In comparison to the control group, family members randomized to the screening
      only or the screening plus groups will express higher levels of health-related quality of
      life at 24 months as measured by the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of AD screening on family members' mood and anxiety.

      Hypothesis 2: In comparison to the control group, family members randomized to the screening
      only or the screening plus groups will express lower rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms
      at 24 months as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7).

      Specific Aim 3: Assess the impact of AD screening on family members' caregiving preparedness
      and caregiving self-efficacy.

      Hypothesis 3: In comparison to the control group, family members randomized to the screening
      only or the screening plus group, will be more prepared for caregiving and have higher
      self-efficacy at 24 months as measured by the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale and the
      Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy.

      Specific Aim 4: Compare the effectiveness of two strategies for diagnostic evaluation and
      management after AD screening.

      Hypothesis 4: In comparison to the screening only group, family members randomized to the
      screening plus group will express higher levels of health-related quality of life, caregiver
      preparedness and caregiving self-efficacy and lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms
      at 24 months, as measured by the SF-36, Preparedness for Caregiving Scale, the Revised Scale
      for Caregiving Self-Efficacy, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively.

    <description>Multi-level mixed effects models will be used to examine differences in SF-36 scores for both patients and family members using dyadic analytic approaches. For this aim, we will compare family members in the two screening groups (Screening Only and Screening Plus) to those in the no screening (Control) group. Repeated SF-36 scores from both patients and family members will be included as the outcome variables with participant type (patient or family member), group (Screening Only and Screening Plus versus Control), time, and interaction between groups and time as independent variables.</description>

    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale to measure the impact of ADRC screening on family member preparedness. The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale consists of eight items that asks family members how well prepared they believe they are for multiple domains of caregiving. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale with scores ranging from 0 (not at all prepared) to 4 (very well prepared). The scale is scored by calculating the mean of all items answered with a score range of 0 to 4. The higher the score the more prepared the caregiver feels for caregiving; the lower the score, the less prepared the caregiver feels.</description>

If they screen positive (e.g. ≤5 on the MIS-T or ≤2 on the Mini-Cog), the patient and family member will receive an infographic. Also, the family member will receive two follow-up phone calls. One from the COADS Study Coordinator and one from a care coordinator at the Aging Brain Care Program (ABC). This phone call will include an opportunity for the family to ask questions and a conversation about the program and diagnostic evaluation and management. Dyads have the option to refuse the follow-up visit. The patient's PCP is also be notified of the screening results via EHR message,</description>
