  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study to compare
      the clinical outcomes of two trifocal IOLs with different material (hydrophobic and
      hydrophilic) from the same manufacturer. Implantation of the IOLs is bilaterally.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study
      whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of
      trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted with the hydrophobic IOL
      FineVision POD F GF or the hydrophilic IOL FineVision POD F (both lenses: (PhysIOL, Liège,
      Belgium).

      The devices under investigation (FineVision POD F GF and POD F) are trifocal glistening-free
      acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL sa/nv.
      The main difference between the lenses is the material (hydrophobic and hydrophilic). The
      IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients suffering from
      cataract development.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 12 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 9 postoperative) over a period of 36 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the 3 months follow up visit and secondary
      endpoint data will be collected at the 3, 12, 24 and 36 months follow up visits. Data
      analyses will be done after the last patient finished the final examination to support the
      study publication plan.

    <description>The slitlamp examination is one examination to analyse the integrity of eye structures and the implanted IOL. The examination is performed and documented according to the guidelines in ISO 11979-7:2018.
With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined.
