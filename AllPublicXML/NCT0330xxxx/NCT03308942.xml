  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      niraparib alone and in combination with PD-1 inhibitors in participants with locally advanced
      and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will consist of 2 stages. In
      stage 1, participants from Cohort 1 and 2 will receive niraparib plus PD-1 inhibitor;
      pembrolizumab and participants from Cohort 3 will receive niraparib alone. In Stage 2,
      participants from Cohorts 1A and 2A will receive niraparib plus the PD-1 inhibitor;
      Dostarlimab. A total of approximately 53 participants will be enrolled in the study.
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or death or end of study.
