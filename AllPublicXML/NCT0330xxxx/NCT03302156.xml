  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to determine the accuracy of PSMA positron emission tomography
      (PET) and multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to detect the presence of
      gynecological cancer cells in the body.

      The investigators will evaluate a novel second-generation low-molecular-weight prostate
      specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography (PET) agent, 18F-DCFPyL,
      to determine the presence or absence of cancer, the accurate distribution of cancer and the
      normal biodistribution of PSMA in the abdomen and pelvis on PET imaging.

      PSMA, also known as folate hydrolase 1 and glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is an enzyme
      associated with prostate cancer but has been also found to be expressed in the tumor
      neovasculature of many different types of non-prostate cancer tumors. PSMA-based 18F-DCFPyL
      PET demonstrates very high tumor-to-background ratio when studied in other tumors, including
      prostate tumors.

      MR imaging is a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality that can be used for
      gynecologic cancers. MR images can be obtained in conjunction with PSMA PET, adding
      additional anatomic and multi-parametric MRI information without the need for a second
      imaging appointment.
