  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open label, multi-center study including 60 patients
      with symptomatic ischemic heart disease with 70%-100% coronary artery stenoses and occlusions
      enrolled and treated in this investigational device study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who require initial pre-dilatation using the study device, and then undergo
      definitive therapy using additional PTCA catheters and stents, according to standard of care
      will be enrolled in this study.

      A maximum of 60 subjects with native coronary artery lesions or occlusions will be treated
      using the Artimes pro Balloon Dilatation Catheters in a 3:1 ratio using the 1.0mm and 1.25mm
      dilatation catheters for pre-dilatation and will complete the study within the U.S. This
      equals 45 patients treated using the 1.0mm dilatation catheter, and 15 patients treated with
      the 1.25mm dilatation catheter for a total of 60 subjects enrolled and treated.
