  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation is difficult because the ductus arteriosus masks the
      isthmus narrowing. The problem lies in the fact that it is difficult to assert in utero
      diagnosis and to predict severity of neonatal symptomatology. However, it is essential to try
      to establish the diagnosis since it has been shown that the prenatal diagnosis improves
      survival and reduces morbidity.
