  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to look at the potential effects of paricalcitol (a drug
      similar to vitamin D) on pancreatic tumors in patients who are planned for surgical removal
      of their tumor. The study will also look at the safety of paricalcitol prior to surgery.

             registration.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years
