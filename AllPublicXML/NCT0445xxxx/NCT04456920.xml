  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 1500 breast biopsies (1000 microbiopsies and 500 macrobiopsies) are
      performed in the radiologic department of the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM). This exam,
      which is relatively easy for the radiologist, can however lead to major anxiety for patients.
      Indeed, previous studies show that about 50% of women undergoing a breast biopsy have
      significant anxiety affects.

      Anxiety associated with the risks of biopsy, potential breast cancer diagnosis and/or lack of
      routine sedation procedures increase patient concerns. Distress prior to biopsy is associated
      with greater pain and discomfort during the procedure. The psychological distress that
      persists after the biopsy is related to a worse psychological management of side effects of
      the biopsy breast (e.g., sensitivity, skin irritation).

      Limiting apprehension, worry and anxiety induced by the uncertainty linked to the biopsy
      results and the biopsy-related pain should be an integral part of the medical care through
      the patient follow-up during, after and until the diagnosis is announced. In light of these
      challenges, new alternative methods are emerging to enhance patient knowledge, develop
      procedural skills, improve confidence and mitigate procedural anxiety. However, to our
      knowledge, few methods have been developed during this period of 'waiting-time'. Currently,
      only care instructions and a consultation to announce the results (about 10 days after the
      procedure) are proposed to patients at the end of biopsy. Patients are also encouraged to
      call if they suspect complications such as infection or bleeding.

      In this context, the investigators propose to integrate a pain management after biopsy via
      e-health system through the patient's medical care. Radiologist/patient communication could
      have an impact on patients' anxiety and health-related issues, given the challenging nature
      of discussions around need for breast biopsy and potential implications of the results.
      Indeed, paying attention and focusing on symptoms as patients experience them improves their
      empowerment and their adjustment to the disease.

      Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been
      shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control and to
      enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being. In
      addition, it is known that improved communication between patients and medical staff to less
      anxiety after a biopsy and that anxiety is related to pain.

      Taken as a whole, these elements encourage the integration of e-health and e-PRO for the
      management of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a biopsy. The benefits of e-PRO are
      still being discussed in terms of quality of life (Qol) and psychological distress. The
      investigator propose to integrate two types of e-health intervention: 1/e-PRO collected by
      connected objects (smartphone or tablet) as they were used in previous studies, and 2/ e-PRO
      collected by a phone consultation, which values human communication between the medical staff
      and the patient.

      In case of significant pain, the collection of e-PRO by any of these e-health interventions
      will generate an alert and a reactive and responsive care.

      In fine, the purpose of this research is to improve the medical organization and care of
      post-biopsy patients by proposing an innovative connected patient technology, regardless of
      their remoteness from the hospital.

      Social inequalities will be reduced by lending a tablet to patients who do not have such a
      device with a 4G key.

      The primary objective is to compare the benefit of intervention by e-health (phone
      consultation with a professional or connected objects (smartphone or tablet)) with the
      standard follow up of the pain intensity of patients 4 days (D4) after un breast biopsy.

      This study is a Monocentric, prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled trial. A total
      of 192 patients (64 patients in group control vs 64 patients in experimental group 1 (PRO
      gathered via a phone consultation) and 64 patients in experimental group 2 (e-PRO
      self-completed via connected objects (tablet/phone) will be required including 10% of
      lost-to-follow-up patients.

      The inclusion period would be 8 months
