      Open Label, Single-Dose, Crossover Study To Assess The Bioequivalence Under Fed And Fasted
      Conditions Of The Fesoterodine Beads-In-Capsule (BIC) SR4 And SR7 Formulations And To
      Estimate The Bioavailability of SR7 Beads Sprinkled On Apple Sauce Relative To The

    <textblock>
      After oral administration, fesoterodine is not detected in plasma as it is rapidly and
      extensively hydrolyzed by non-specific esterases to its primary active metabolite
      5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT) . Therefore characterization of the rate and extent of
      absorption of the test and reference fesoterodine formulations will be based on
      pharmacokinetic parameters of 5-HMT derived from the 5-HMT concentration-time profiles.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1 randomized, open-label, single-dose crossover study in healthy participants. A two stage approach outlined below will be followed:
Part A (Cohort 1): This part of the study is a 2 sequence, 4 period, crossover design.
Part B (Cohort 2): This part of the study is a 4 sequence, 4 period, crossover design. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 possible treatment sequences. If bioequivalence (BE) criteria for the comparison of the BIC SR7 formulation with the BIC SR4 formulation administered in the fasted state are met in Part A, the formulations will be considered bioequivalent in the fasted state and only the first two periods of Part B will be conducted. Part B (all periods) may not be conducted if the AUCinf or Cmax Percent Geometric Mean Ratio GMR is less than 90% and greater than 111% and/or if variability suggest a highly variable drug (e.g., greater than 30%) because BE demonstration may not be possible with a reasonably sized 4 sequence 4 period study.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male and female participants must be 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent document (ICD).

          2. Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.

          3. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures. Weight:

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

          5. Capable of giving signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy).

          3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;
             positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). A positive serology for hepatitis B
             surface antibody (HBsAb) as a result of Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.

          4. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          5. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate or tolterodine
             tartrate, soya, or any of the excipients in the investigational drug product.

          6. History of uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, gastric retention,
             severe ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon.

          7. Evidence or history of clinically significant urologic disease: urinary retention,
             obstructive disturbance of bladder emptying, micturition disturbance, nocturia or
             pollakiuria (eg, benign prostate hyperplasia, urethral stricture, recurrent urinary
             tract infections).

          8. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of
             investigational product.

          9. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).

         10. A positive urine drug test, as confirmed by a single repeat.

         11. Screening supine blood pressure (BP) greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg (systolic) or
             greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine
             rest. If BP is greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg (systolic) or greater than or equal
             to 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the
             3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.

         12. Screening 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results
             (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block
             [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval
             changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular
             [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline
             uncorrected QT interval is greater than 450 msec, this interval should be
             rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting corrected QT (QTcF)
             should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS
             exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc
             or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.
             Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading
             ECGs before excluding participants.

         13. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             Screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

         14. Screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than or equal to 90 mL
             /min/1.73 m2 for Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] formula).

         15. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).

         16. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

         17. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations
             section of this protocol.

         18. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.
