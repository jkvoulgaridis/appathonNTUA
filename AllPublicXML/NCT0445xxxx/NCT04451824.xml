      The rationale for the selection of Outcome Measures is the compliance with FDA regulations as
      pertain to medical devices with a moderate level of risk of hazard leading to harm of the
      patient; firstly, the safety of the device in achieving the desired effect of its intended
      use when operated in the intended manner; and secondly, the effectiveness of the device in
      achieving its desired effect of its intended use in accordance with its proposed label and
      labeling. The rationale for the selection of the primary outcome measure is to satisfy the
      question of safety and effectiveness of the use of red-light exposure to reduce the
      circumference of overweight patients with a statistically significant Routine Use population
      size. Given that the Routine Use Data Analysis is open label and therefore not blinded, there
      is no need for a control group nor additional cohorts for varying levels of exposure and
      corresponding safety and/or effectiveness.

      In the 1960s, the concept of using light energy for a variety of health maintenance goals and
      overcoming a number of dermatological conditions began in earnest to receive the attention of
      NASA researchers as a means of providing desired clinical outcomes to astronauts while in the
      confines of a space capsule over long periods of time. The research was well funded and
      supported by the U.S. government, and confirmed the value of light emitting diode (LED)
      low-level light therapy (LLLT), in particular red light from the 635nm frequency, for
      producing a variety of healthful effects within the dermis. The ability to achieve a
      reduction in the dimensions of exposed liposomes using red light is intended to be confirmed
      by analyzing the clinical data from a minimum of one hundred patients who were exposed to the
      635 nm frequency for 30 minutes by use of the subject device (Contour Light) during routine
      use to confirm that the device is safe and effective for its intended application. Please see
      the following clinical articles, appended in section 10.
