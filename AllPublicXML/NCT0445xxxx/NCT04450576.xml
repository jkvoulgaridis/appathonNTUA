  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a retrospective community based cohort study from Pueblo County Colorado which has a
      higher population proportion of metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, we hope to clarify
      and quantify an association of the AGE HBa1c elevation with the early subclinical hemodynamic
      changes of diabetic cardiomyopathy as measured by LAV, LVM, E/A ratio, E/e' ratio and BNP in
      patients with stage A heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The classic association of glycemic control, as represented by HBa1c, with progression or
      improvement of microvascular and macrovascular clinical complications has been well
      documented. Additionally, while the association of HBa1c elevation with a syndrome described
      as diabetic cardiomyopathy has also been well documented, the use of the advanced glycation
      end product axis (AGE/sRAGE/esRAGE which includes HBa1c) as markers for the early subclinical
      hemodynamic changes of diabetic cardiomyopathy has been suggested but less well characterized
      or utilized. Stage A heart failure is defined as persons with normal cardiac structure and
      function who have predisposing subclinical risks for cardiovascular disease. Estimates
      suggest that Stage A heart failure may comprise up to 56% of any community's patient
      population and are patients most commonly seen in non-specialty primary care clinics. In
      light of newer cardiometabolic agents which show promise in cardiovascular disease primary
      prevention, these patients may be an important target for preventative cardiometabolic care.
      In a retrospective community based cohort study from Pueblo County Colorado which has a
      higher population proportion of metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, we hope to clarify
      and quantify an association of the AGE HBa1c elevation with the early subclinical hemodynamic
      changes of diabetic cardiomyopathy as measured by LAV, LVM, E/A ratio, E/e' ratio and BNP in
      patients with stage A heart failure.

      Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis by chart review of patients presenting to Parkview
      Medical Center's inpatient service and outpatient clinics who obtained a full resting echo
      characterized by normal cardiac structure and function in conjunction with HBa1c and BNP
      levels within a 3 month time window. Using multiple regression analysis of the dependent
      variables LAV, LVM, E/A ratio, E/e' ratio and BNP, powered to detect a 5% change in LAV in
      conjunction with rising HBa1c levels characterized as normal (&lt;5.7), metabolic syndrome
      (5.7-6.4) or diabetic (&gt;6.4) after controlling for the presence of hypertension and coronary
      artery disease.
