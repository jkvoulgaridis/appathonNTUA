  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to identify factors that may be associated with a better or
      worse response to interventional pain management therapies for the treatment of chronic
      lumbar pain in adult patients. If several predictive factors are to be identified, a
      predictive model will be developed.

    <textblock>
      Chronic lumbar pain is a common affection in the adult population, and an important source of
      chronic incapacity and impaired quality of life. There is a wide range of therapeutic options
      for the treatment of chronic lumbar pain. This study will analyze the response to several
      interventional pain management techniques and will search for factors that may be associated
      to a better or worse response to the techniques.

    <description>While in prone position, lumbar facet joints are identified by fluoroscopy. 18 gauge needles are then advanced aiming to the medial branch of lumbar facet joints. Correct positioning is confirmed by anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopy. Then, the needles are attached to the radiofrequency device. Correct positioning of the needles is confirmed also by sensitive stimulation (paresthesia evocation) with the following settings: 50 Hz (hertz), 1ms, 0,6V (volts). In order to avoid motor lesion, it is confirmed that no motor response is produced with 2Hz, 2ms (millisecond) and twice the voltage that produced sensitive response. After correct positioning and repositioning the needles if needed, conventional radiofrequency ablation of medial branch nerves is performed using the following settings: 90 seconds, 80º Celsius degrees.
The selection of target facet joints is made based on clinical findings. Some patients receive bilateral while other unilateral facet joint denervation.</description>

    <description>With the patient in prone position and guided by fluoroscopy, lumbar facet joints are identified. The 22 french needles are then advanced aiming to the lumbar facet joints. Correct positioning is confirmed with anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopy. A mixture of 3 ml of ropivacaine 0,2% + 1 ml (40 mg) of triamcinolone (trigon depot) is prepared. 1 ml of the mixture is injected in each lumbar facet joint through the needles. Four facet joints are selected for therapy. Some patients receive bilateral and other unilateral but contiguous facet joint infiltration. The selection of target facet joints is made based on clinical and radiological findings.</description>

    <description>With the patient in prone position and guided by fluoroscopy, an epidural needle attached to a syringe filled with saline serum is advanced through the interlaminar approach using a loss of resistance technique for the identification of the lumbar epidural space. When loss of resistance is encountered, 1 ml of iodinated contrast is injected. After fluoroscopical confirmation of epidural spilling, a mixture of 4 ml of ropivacaine 0,1%, 2 ml (12 mg) of betamethasone and 2 ml of saline serum is injected in the epidural space. The lumbar level to which it infiltrates depends on each patient.</description>

    <description>With the patient in prone position and guided by fluoroscopy, an epidural needle attached to a syringe filled with saline serum is advanced through the sacral hiatus using a loss of resistance technique for the identification of the epidural space. When loss of resistance is encountered, 2 ml of iodinated contrast is injected. After fluoroscopical confirmation of epidural spilling, a mixture of 7 ml of ropivacaine 0,2%, 2 ml (12 mg) of betamethasone and 7 ml of saline serum is injected in the epidural space.</description>

    <description>With the patient in prone position and guided by fluoroscopy, a 18 gauge needle is advanced aiming to the intervertebral foramen. Patient is cautioned about the paresthesia which will be felt. A lateral view was taken occasionally to confirm position. 0.5 ml of iodinated contrast is injected to confirm the position of the needle. Then 1 ml of the combination of 12mg of betamethasone and 1ml of ropivacaine 0.2% is injected over the affected root. Then, the needle is attached to the radiofrequency device. Correct positioning of the needles is confirmed also by sensitive stimulation (paresthesia evocation) with the following settings: 50 Hz, 1ms, 0,6V. In order to avoid motor lesion, it is confirmed that no motor response is produced with 2Hz, 2ms and twice the voltage that produced sensitive response. After correct positioning is confirmed, pulsed radiofrequency ablation of lumbar dorsal root ganglion is performed using the following settings: 4 minutes, 42ºC (degrees Celsius).</description>

    <description>With the patient in prone position and guided by fluoroscopy, a 22 french needle is then advanced aiming to the intervertebral foramen. Patient is cautioned about the paresthesia which will be felt along the course of the lumbar root when the needle touches the nerve. A lateral view was taken occasionally to confirm position. 0.5 ml of iodinated contrast is injected to confirm the position of the needle. Then 1 ml of the combination of 12mg of betamethasone and 1ml of ropivacaine 0.2% is injected over the affected root.</description>
