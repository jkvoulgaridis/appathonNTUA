  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of therapy-associated side effects during and after radiotherapy of head and neck
      tumors is essential. The most effective approach to reducing acute toxicity is to cut out
      healthy tissue from the radiation field. The distance between the tumor and normal tissue can
      be individually increased using personalized, 3D printer-based tissue retractors (GWR). Even
      the smallest geometric changes lead to a significant dose reduction in normal tissue and
      significant advantages for the patient.

      The current randomized phase II study evaluates the use of GWR with regard to acute toxicity.
      In addition, quality of life, long-term toxicity as well as local control and overall
      survival 12 months after radiotherapy are evaluated.

      The most effective approach to reducing acute toxicity after radiotherapy is to cut out
      healthy tissue from the radiation field. GWR can increase the distance between the tumor and
      normal tissue. Even the smallest geometric changes lead to a significant dose reduction in
      normal tissue and significant advantages for the patient. Adequate immobilization also
      reduces unwanted movements, especially of the tongue.

      The GWR are manufactured as combinable modules according to the &quot;modular principle&quot;. This
      improves reproducibility and flexibility and reduces development and manufacturing costs. The
      study is being conducted as a monocentric, prospective, randomized phase II study. A total of
      34 patients who meet the inclusion criteria are examined for acute toxicity after
      radiotherapy of a malignant head and neck tumor. The primary goal of the study is to reduce
      acute toxicity through individual immobilization of the jaw and tongue. Secondary study goals
      are the evaluation of quality of life and long-term toxicity as well as local control and
      overall survival twelve months after radiotherapy. In both groups, radiation therapy is
      carried out in accordance with guidelines using image-guided radiotherapy.
