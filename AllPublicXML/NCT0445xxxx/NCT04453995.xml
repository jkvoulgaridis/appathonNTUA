  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson' patients who have not had dyskinesia would be observed for 2 years in a
      multicenter prospective study with the purposes to clarify the predicting factors of
      dyskinesia.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson' patients with daily levodopa dosage above 200mg and no dyskinesia would be
      recruited into the study. They would be observed for two years for analyzed the predicting
      factors of dyskinesia. At the baseline, demographic information, Clinical information, blood
      sample, picture of tongure coating would be collected at the baseline. All participants were
      evaluated every three months for two years. The severity of motor symptoms were evaluated
      every 6 months.
