  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory observational biomarker study in approximately 100 eligible patients
      with resectable adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastro- esophageal junction (GEJ) type
      I-II (GEAC) to investigate the difference deletion frequency of circulating tumor cells
      (CTCs) between peripheral veins and tumor-draining veins (primary endpoint), prognostic
      value, relevance of a set of two additional blood-based biomarkers analyzed from a single
      blood sampling tube (secondary endpoints). The underlying hypothesis is that the biomarker
      alone or in combination improve preoperative staging and help to identify patients at risk
      for metastasis. This should enable a better stratification of GEAC patients to neo-adjuvant
      treatment, (intensified) peri-operative treatment, or even surgery alone, in selected cases.
      The data of the CIRCULATE study shall be used design subsequent studies testing the
      predictive role of these biomarkers for surgical management. Patients will provide blood
      samples and lymphatic fluid during the operation and annual blood samples during clinical
      follow up of 5 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory observational biomarker study. Around 20 mL of blood will be collected
      from a peripheral vein and additional 40 mL from tumor draining veins. In addition, around 5
      mL of lymphatic fluid will be collected from the thoracic duct, when exposed and opened
      during the surgical resection. Annual blood draws (20 mL) will be performed during routine
      clinical follow-up or at the time point when the patients develops a (metastatic) relapse. A
      one tube protocol will be performed from each blood sample to assess CTCs and tumor derived
      extracellular Vesicles (tdEVs) using CELLSEARCH® and ACCEPT
      (https://github.com/LeonieZ/ACCEPT/blob/master/ACCEPT.m). In addition, tumor cells will be
      enumerated by CELLSEARCH® in the lymphatic fluid. ctDNA will be extracted from plasma of each
      blood collection tube and analyzed by mFAST-SeqS. If the mutational status of the primary
      tumor is known, deep sequencing of ctDNA will be applied for mutation tracking at a later
      time point. Tissue resected during the surgical procedure and not required for routine
      pathology will be collected into a biobank (cry-conserved and formalin fixed and paraffin
      embedded (FFPE).

    <description>1. The tumor allele frequency measured by the genome-wide mFAST-SeqS assay (Belic, 2015) and the fraction of patients with high tumor allele frequency will be determined. For this, a threshold of 10% tumour allele frequency will be applied to discriminate high allele frequency (&gt;10%) from low allele frequency (≤10%) cases (Belic, 2015; de Wit, 2019). 2.

        The targeted study population of CIRCULATE1 are 100 patients (see 2.3) with resectable GEAC
        (GEJ type I-II) undergoing surgery with curative intention. The patients will be recruited
        and screened consecutively by trained surgeons involved into the CIRCULATE study. Patients
        are recruited to participate in this study at the outpatient clinic
