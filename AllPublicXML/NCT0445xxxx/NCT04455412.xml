  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      laser-assisted ICSI (LA-ICSI) was described to be a new method combining a less invasive ICSI
      technique with assisted hatching.This procedure is usually used for MII oocytes possessing
      oolemma breakage difficulties, but why not using it for even normal Oocytes?!. Especially
      because data indicated that in addition to an improved oocyte survival, this new approach
      increases the hatching rate in vitro. But since it is still debatable that such a small
      opening might impair the hatching process, so modified zona thinning technique was proposed
      for more embryo safety.

      This study aims to compare the LA- ICSI by drilling a micro hole (LAD-ICSI) and modified
      LA-ICSI by zona pellucida thinning (LAT-ICSI) with conventional ICSI in order to effectively
      assess whether this approach can be applied routinely to improve ICSI outcome.

      One arm study divided into three interventions; Conventional ICSI (control group) was
      compared with LAD-ICSI (Study group 1) and LAT- ICSI (study group 2) in sibling oocytes.

      The rates of maturation, fertilization, Devision, Blastulation and good quality blastulation
      rates were assessed in the three groups

      Cases were randomly selected for embryo transfer from the three groups,Then chemical
      pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates were compared between the three groups.
