  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic dizziness,or persistent positional perceptual dizziness (PPPS) is a common condition
      that results in impaired quality of life and work ability of those affected. Vestibular
      Rehabilitation (VR) is an evidence-based and recommended treatment for chronic dizziness. The
      treatment involves training in specific exercises that challenge the balance system and
      eventually improve dizziness. The main challenge with this treatment is that it is usually
      best provided with individual follow-up of therapists trained in the method. Limited
      resources and the lack of dissemination of this knowledge mean that only a minority of
      patients receive adequate treatment. An internet-based self-help program in vestibular
      rehabilitation has been developed in Norwegian with demonstration and instructions of
      exercises. The program has six lessons, together lasting for six weeks. Patients are given
      the opportunity to exercise at home, without the use of treatment resources and without
      spending time traveling to the treatment site. Patients will have access through their
      general practitioner or health institution at no extra cost. If it turns out that the program
      works according to the intention, the investigators will be able to offer VR to a large
      number of PPPS patients who previously would not receive treatment for their condition.

      The aim of the pilot study is to find out if the internet program for PPPS works as intended
      and evaluate incoming data and make changes to the program. In addition, the investigators
      will gain experience in using the program before designing a randomized clinical trial (RCT).
      The aim of such an RCT would be to compare this internet based treatment to traditional
      treatment.

    <description>semi-structured conversation interview with score tools. The ease of use of the course will be scored in a 7 question questionnaire, rated 1-7 from very good to very bad. The questions are whether the program worked well, was boring, if it was the right dose of exercises, if the text was understandable, instructive, how was the yield and degree of subjective improvement. Participants will also be asked for preparation suggestions.</description>

    <description>The Niigata persistent positional perceptual dizziness (PPPD) Questionnaire (NPQ) contains 12 questions in which patients answer questions about provocation from three aggravating factors of PPPD (upright posture / gait, movement and visual stimulation). Each factor is evaluated using questions that score the severity from 0 (none) to 6 (unbearable) ailments</description>

    <description>VSS - vertigo symptom score form. Consists of 15 questions. Each answer is scored on a 5-point scale (0-4), and a measure of the severity of the symptoms is obtained by summing. The total score ranges from 0-60, higher scores indicate more serious problems. Severe dizziness is defined as ≥ 12 points on the total scale. The scale includes two subscales: 8 selected questions related to vertigo and balance (score ranging from 0-32), and 7 selected questions related to autonomic anxiety symptoms (score ranging from 0-28)</description>
