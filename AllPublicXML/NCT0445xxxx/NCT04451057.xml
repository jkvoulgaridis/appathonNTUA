  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High flow nasal cannula(HFNC) ventilation can provide such effects as wash-out effect of the
      carbon dioxide inside the anatomical dead space,some level of continuous airway pressure and
      humidified oxygen gases.

      Therefore because of its physiological benefits, it has been reported that HFNC can reduce
      &quot;treatment failure&quot; after extubation in pediatric patients like preterm babies,or infants who
      suffer from bronchitis.

      However there is no evidence showing that HFNC can reduce &quot;treatment failure&quot; after
      extubation in pediatric patients after cardiothoracic surgery.

      This multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving pediatric patients after
      cardiothoracic surgery will be conducted to determine whether HFNC,compared with conventional
      oxygen therapy,after extubation can reduce the rate of&quot;escalation of care due to treatment
      failure&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multi-center RCT will enroll 380 pediatric patients after cardiothoracic surgery from the
      Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Japan.Informed consent will be obtained from the their parents
      or legally representatives.They will receive postoperative standard care in ICU and
      spontaneous breathing test(SBT).If SBT will be done successfully,they will be extubated.Just
      before extubation,they will be divided randomly into the intervention group or the control
      group.After randomization,they will be extubated.After extubation,the intervention group will
      receive HFNC therapy,while the control group will receive conventional oxygen therapy.The
      flow in the intervention group will surely be maintained to be high,while the flow in control
      group will surely be less than 2 liter/min.In both groups,outcome measure will be assessed
      within 72 hours after extubation,or during ICU stay.
