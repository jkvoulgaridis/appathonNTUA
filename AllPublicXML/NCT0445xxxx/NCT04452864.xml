  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today the therapy options for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited. One
      recommended intervention is cognitive stimulation. We try to develop serious games as a
      further treatment option, also usable in pre-dementia as well as early stages of dementia and
      for a long period of time.

      The main objective of this study is to test, if the computerized-cognitive training (CCT) is
      able to improve the performance in a score quantifying an &quot;AD-specific&quot; component score.
      Additionally, the neurobiological effects of the training are investigated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study intervention consists of a computer-based cognitive training, targeting the
      cognitive domains mostly affected by AD. This training will be performed for three months
      (each day for 20 minutes). After three months the intervention group will continue the
      training at home for six months and meet monthly for group sessions (i.e. booster sessions)
      on site.

      Primary endpoint will be the change in an &quot;AD-specific&quot; component score, quantified by
      episodic memory, semantic memory and visuospatial abilities. Secondary endpoints are changes
      in task related brain networks and changes in resting state networks.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms and conduct a Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) at home (daily) and on site (weekly) for 10 weeks. Before and after the CCT, neuropsychological assessments will be conducted.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in AD specific component score</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary endpoint will be assessed four times, with breaks of three months in between. Primary outcome will be assessed up to 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is quantified by an AD component score including measures of EM (auditory verbal learning), SM (verbal fluency, naming task) and spatial abilities (Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test). These scores will be assessed four times, before the training as well as after three, six and nine months by tablet-based cognitive tests. A short follow-up assessment will be performed after a total of 12 months which does not include primary outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>MRI functional and structural</measure>
    <time_frame>Secondary endpoints will be assessed two to four times, depending on the study arm, as MRI assessments are not always performed after six and nine months.</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints are changes in task related brain networks (i.e. spatial ability and episodic memory) and changes in resting state networks.</description>
