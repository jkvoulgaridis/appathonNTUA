  <brief_title>Study on the Safety of BAY1817080, How it is Tolerated and the Way the Body Absorbs, Distributes and Gets Rid of the Study Drug in Participants With Impaired Liver Function or Normal Liver Function</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of BAY 1817080 in Participants With Impaired Hepatic Function (Classified as Child-Pugh A, B or C) in Comparison to Matched Controls With Normal Hepatic Function</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY1817080 is currently under clinical development to treat pain related to unexplained
      chronic cough or chronic cough not affected by a treatment (refractory and/or unexplained
      chronic cough, RUCC), or a condition where the bladder is unable to hold urine normally
      (overactive bladder, OAB) or a condition in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally
      lines the inside of the womb grows outside the womb (endometriosis).

      In this study researchers want to learn more about the safety of BAY1817080, how it is
      tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study dug given as
      tablet in participants with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment and participants with
      normal liver function matched for age-, gender-, weight and race.

      The study will enroll 36 male and female participants in the age between 18 and 79 years.
      Participants with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and the matching participants will take
      multiple oral doses of study drug depending on the study plan. Participants with severe
      hepatic impairment and the matching participants will take a single oral dose of study drug
      during the study. Data from this study will provide researcher important information for
      further development of the study drug in particular on dose recommendation for patients with
      hepatic impairment.
