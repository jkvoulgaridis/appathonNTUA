  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of olaparib alone or in combination with bevacizumab
      being compared to bevacizumab with Fluorouracil (5-FU) in participants with unresectable or
      metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have not progressed following first-line induction of
      FOLFOX with bevacizumab. Hypothesis 1 - Olaparib + Bevacizumab is superior to 5-FU +
      Bevacizumab with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation
      Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central
      review (BICR) in the treatment of CRC. Hypothesis 2 - Olaparib is superior to 5-FU +
      Bevacizumab with respect to PFS using RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR) in the treatment of
      CRC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a histologically-confirmed metastatic or unresectable (Stage IV as defined by
             American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC eighth edition) colorectal adenocarcinoma
             (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] 2018).

          2. Has not progressed (ie, achieved a stable disease [SD], partial response [PR], or
             complete response [CR]) after a first-line induction course of at least 6 cycles of
             FOLFOX with bevacizumab as first-line therapy.

               -  Participants must not have received an investigational agent during their FOLFOX
                  + bevacizumab induction course.

               -  Determination of SD/PR/CR will be made by the investigator.

               -  &quot;First-line therapy&quot; is defined as the first systemic chemotherapy regimen given
                  for the diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic CRC. Participants may have
                  received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy for CRC, as long as it was
                  completed at least 6 months prior to initiation of first-line FOLFOX +
                  bevacizumab induction treatment.

          3. Has experienced unacceptable toxicity to oxaliplatin that, in the opinion of the
             treating physician, requires/required the discontinuation of oxaliplatin. Note: As an
             example, unacceptable toxicity may include (but is not limited to) severe or prolonged
             neurotoxicity.

             • Participants must be randomized within a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 6 weeks
             after their last dose of FOLFOX + bevacizumab (last dose is the day of the last
             infusion).

          4. Has provided to the imaging contract research organization (iCRO) at least 1 set of
             radiographic images taken during the FOLFOX + bevacizumab induction period and at
             least 42 days prior to the imaging performed during screening. The iCRO must determine
             the images are of diagnostic quality prior to randomization.

          5. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 within
             10 days prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has known hypersensitivity to the components and/or excipients in bevacizumab, 5-FU or
             olaparib.

          2. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate
             provided they are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of progression for at
             least 28 days by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed
             during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid
             intervention for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.

          3. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          4. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is
             required unless mandated by local health authority.

          5. Has a known history of or is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg reactive)
             or hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA [qualitative]) is detected). Note: No testing
             for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.

          6. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the
             participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.

          7. Has myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) or with features
             suggestive of MDS/AML.

             coagulation).

         10. Has clinically significant bleeding within 28 days prior to randomization.

         11. Is considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder,
             nonmalignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but
             are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months)
             myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord
             compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

         12. Has 1 or more conditions that, in the opinion of the treating physician, make the
             participant ineligible for treatment with bevacizumab. These conditions may include:

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;150 mm Hg or diastolic
                  blood pressure [DBP] &gt;100 mm Hg) or a history of hypertensive crisis or
                  hypertensive encephalopathy

               -  History of nephrotic syndrome or moderate proteinuria

         13. Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy (other than FOLFOX + bevacizumab
             induction) including investigational agents within 28 days prior to randomization.
             Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to
             ≤Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with persistent alopecia or Grade ≤3 neuropathy may
             be eligible.

         14. Has received prior therapy with olaparib or with any other polyadenosine
             5'-diphosphoribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.

             protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir,
             nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate (eg, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,
             diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) that
             cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study. The required washout period
             prior to randomization is 2 weeks.

             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or
             moderate (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) inducers of CYP3A4 that cannot be
             discontinued for the duration of the study. The required washout period prior to
             randomization is 5 weeks for phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents.

         17. Has undergone major surgery within 2 weeks of randomization or has not recovered
             adequately from toxicities and/or complications from any major surgery prior to
