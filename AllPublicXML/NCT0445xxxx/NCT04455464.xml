      -  Primary objective: HVPG response after administration of midodrine as defined by
           decrease in HVPG by &gt; 20 % from baseline or to less than equals to 12 mmHg.

        -  Secondary objectives: Change in HVPG, SVR, heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index,
           Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean).

      Methodology:

      Consecutive patients of chronic liver disease in the Institute (admitted or coming to OPD) as
      per the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be studied.

        -  Study Population: Patients of advanced chronic liver disease admitted or OPD patients in
           ILBS

        -  Study Design: A single arm interventional study

        -  Study Period: 6 months

        -  Inclusion Criteria: i) CLD with grade III ascites with Na &lt; 130 / Systolic BP &lt; 90 /
           type 2 HRS(n=30 ) (ii) ACLF (APASL criteria) with Na &lt; 130 / Systolic BP &lt; 90 / AKI
           (n=30)

        -  Exclusion Criteria: age &lt; 18 and &gt; 75, pregnancy, splanchnic venous thrombosis, HCC, HE,
           significant cardiopulmonary disease, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, intrinsic
           renal disease, peripheral vascular disease.

        -  Sample Size with justification: This is a pilot study where a total of 60 patients will
           be enrolled - 30 each in the two groups.

        -  Intervention: HVPG will be done in these patients at baseline and then after 3 hours of
           10 mg of midodrine tablets.

      Monitoring and assessment: Various parameters will be assessed during the procedure before
      and after 3 hours of midodrine such as HVPG (WHVP - FHVP), SVR, heart rate, cardiac output,
      cardiac index, Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean), SpO2.

      - Statistical Analysis: Continuous data will be represented by mean ± SD or median ± IQR.
      Categorical data will be represented by n = frequency (%). Categorical data will be analyzed
      by Chi square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Continuous data will be compared by
      using student t test or Mann Whitney test (when applicable). The change in HVPG will be
      analyzed by using paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. The % change in the individual
      group will be compared to see the significance between the groups. The significance will be
      seen at 5%.

        -  Adverse Effects: same as for HVPG (mild pain / hematoma at the puncture site, transient
           arrhythmias). Midodrine has got good safety profile and is used in patients of advanced
           chronic liver disease.

        -  Stopping Rule of study: nil

      Expected outcome of the project: If result shows that HVPG is decreased by midodrine, then it
      can be used in place of beta blockers when they are contraindicated or have the potential of
      causing adverse effects.
