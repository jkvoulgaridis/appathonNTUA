  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the change in muscle volume around the hip in
      patients with unilateral femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) after arthroscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed a retrospective review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of FAI patients
      who underwent hip arthroscopy between January 1, 2016, and July 1, 2018. &quot;Image J&quot; with an
      embedded region-of-interest (ROI) tool was used to calculate the cross-sectional area (CSA)
      of muscles on MRI. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine the differences between
      preoperative and postperative hip muscle CSA. The correlations of change in muscle CSA with
      age, gender, BMI, pain level, preoperative symptom duration, and multiple validated
      patient-reported outcomes were also analyzed with a spearman rank correlation test.
