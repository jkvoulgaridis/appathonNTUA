  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) is believed to be one of the risk factors
      contributing to shoulder injuries. In addition, athletes with GIRD of greater than 20° appear
      to be at a greater risk for the shoulder injuries and surgery. Recently, GIRD can be divided
      in anatomical GIRD and pathological GIRD (pGIRD). The dominant arm of the athletes with pGIRD
      have not only humeral retrotorsion (HR) but also stiffer posterior capsule. The soft-tissue
      effect is believed to be the key point in pathological cascade of throwers. Therefore, the
      previous studies use gross GIRD as a risk factor may be modified by ultrasound-guide
      corrected GIRD.

      Objective:

      There are 4 objectives for the present study: (1) to investigate the Receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curves of the gross GIRD; (2) to investigate the ROC curves of the
      ultrasound-guide corrected GIRD; (3) to compare the area under curve (AUC) of the two
      methods; (4) to compare the gross GIRD and the ultrasound-guide corrected GIRD in baseball
      players.

      Design:

      Baseball players who have played baseball for at least 1 year and still active in training or
      competition will be recruited in this study. Participant characteristics will be collected by
      the main assessor, including age, gender, height, weight, dominant arm, practice time, years
      of playing baseball. Performance/function will be assessed via a Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic
      Clinic shoulder and elbow (KJOC) self-report questionnaire. The shoulder rotation ROM,
      ultrasound examination including ultrasound-corrected GIRD and posterior capsular thickness
      and posterior shoulder tightness will also be measured. we will follow subjects for a season.
      Once the injury occurs, deterioration or at the end of the season, we will collect the data
      again.

      Main outcome measures:

      The shoulder rotation ROM, ultrasound examination and posterior shoulder tightness are main
      outcomes of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>alteration of ultrasound-guide corrected GIRD</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be told to supine with 90° of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion. The main assessor places the transducer on the subject's anterior shoulder, perpendicular to the long axis of the humerus in the frontal plane. Then, the humerus will be manually rotated by the assessor for the bicipital groove being centered on the ultrasound image. The ultrasound is then positioned, aided by use of a grid on the ultrasound display. Thus, a line connecting the greater and lesser tubercles can be parallel to the horizontal plane. Last, the second assessor places a digital inclinometer on the ulnar side of the forearm to record the forearm inclination angle, defining the amount of humeral retroversion. This measurement will be repeated 3 times bilaterally and the average will be used for data analysis. The equation of ultrasound-guide corrected GIRD will be gross GIRD minus difference of humeral retroversion between dominant and non-dominant arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>alteration of posterior capsular thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be positioned upright in a chair with the arm at the side and forearm resting on the thigh. The examiner positions a transducer on the posterior shoulder, visualizing the glenoid labrum, humeral head, rotator cuff, and posterior capsule, defined as the tissue immediately lateral to the tip of the labrum between the humeral head and rotator cuff. When the capsule is identified, the image is paused, and the capsule thickness will be measured by built-in caliper. The imaging procedure will be repeated 3 times, and an average thickness will be determined. This measurement will be taken bilaterally for all subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of shoulder rotation ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be placed in supine with the shoulder at 90° of abduction and elbow at 90° of flexion. The main assessor stabilizes the scapula then passively rotating the forearm internally or externally until end feel is reached. Another assessor places a digital inclinometer on the dorsal or the ventral side of the forearm to record the data. Each measurement will be performed 3 times both in the dominant and non-dominant arm, and the average data on the dominant and non-dominant sides will be used for analysis. The total rotation ROM will be the sum of the IR and external rotation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Injury assessment and classification</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The process will be modified according to the previous studies. The players will be prospectively tracked for overuse shoulder injuries throughout the season. For the asymptomatic subjects, any complaint of shoulder problems reported by coach, parents or player will be evaluated by a physical therapist to verify the injury. Moreover, less than 70 KJOC score will be recognized as injury. Injury that does not occur during participation or unrelated to baseball will be excluded. For the symptomatic subject, if he feels exacerbation of the symptom, he will be told to report KJOC score again. Once the decreased score is over 30, the subject will be recognized as injury.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of posterior shoulder tightness</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To begin the test, the tester grasps the subject's extremity distal to the epicondyles of the elbow in supine position. The humerus will be passively moved into the starting position of 90˚ of flexion (if not possible, maximal flexion position) and 0˚ of adduction with neutral rotation for assessment of posterior shoulder tightness. At this point, the scapula will be palpated at the lateral border and stabilized with the hand. While the scapula is stabilized, the humerus is then passively moved into a cross-chest adduction with neutral rotation. The humerus is moved until the movement cease (firm end-feel), indicating the end of shoulder tissue flexibility. The recorder places the digital inclinometer parallel to the humerus next to the medial epicondyle. The measured angle indicates the amount of flexibility of the posterior shoulder tissues. A greater angle indicates more flexibility of the shoulder tissue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic Shoulder and Elbow score (KJOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The KJOC is the most common questionnaire for overhead athletes which has been conducted in several studies. Recently, Major League Baseball (MLB) organization also adopts this evaluation tool as the standard for the recovery of injuries in MLB players. The questionnaire is commonly used to assess shoulder function and performance. It is valid, reliable in its pilot form, and responsive in the tested population of adult overhead athletes. KJOC questionnaire range from 0 to 100 and the lower score represents limited function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>days in the disable list</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days that players cannot participate in the training or game due to injury will be recorded.</description>

        A baseball team usually consists of 30 to 40 players. Therefore, we will recruit 3 or 4
        local baseball teams in Taipei and New Taipei city. Based on the consideration of schedule
        between baseball teams and our research team, We will collect 7 subjects per day and the
        recruitment time will last for about a month.
