  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NACT is a heavy oncologic treatment, which can impair functional capacity, nutritional and
      emotional status. These three impairments are often ignored and not taken into account in the
      pre-therapeutic evaluations but are correlated with postoperative morbidity and mortality
      after major surgery.

      Recently, a prehabilitation before surgery, including physical, nutritional and psycho-social
      support, has been defined. From a literature review, the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max)
      seems to constitute a strong evaluation factor reflecting physical fitness, easily measured
      with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) at maximal effort.

      Several studies have shown beneficial effects of trimodal prehabilitation programs on
      postoperative functional capacity, return to daily activities and pain relief.

      Home-based program and connected devices may improve the feasibility and the compliance to
      this program.

      The hypothesis of this study is that performing a connected supervised home-based and
      patient-tailored multimodal prehabilitation program from diagnosis to surgery (with or
      without ERAS program) during NACRT, for patients managed for ovarian cancer, will limit
      physical fitness alteration and will positively affect postoperative outcomes.

      Our study consists in an early and multidimensional (combining nutritional, physical,
      emotional and medical support) prehabilitation program during NACT for patients with ovarian
      cancer, in order to limit physical alteration before surgical treatment, and therefore
      improve postoperative outcomes. It will include a home-based prehabilitation program, in
      order to allow care access to all eligible patients.

      The main objective will be to determine if a prehabilitation program during NACT, for
      patients treated for an advanced ovarian cancer will limit physical alteration before major
      abdomino-pelvic surgery, compared to a control group without prehabilitation program. The
      primary endpoint will be the comparison of the variation of VO2 max, between baseline and
      surgery, in the prehabilitation group vs control group: VO2 max will be measured with a
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) at maximal effort.

      This prospective, multicentric randomized control trial will be conducted in 7 French
      comprehensive cancer Centers or University Hospital, in compliance with inclusion criteria.
      After an initial evaluation, patients will be randomized in two groups: Prehabilitation group
      (P group) and a Control group (C group).

      For the P group, after baseline evaluation, we will be offering from diagnosis to surgery,
      during the NACT:

        -  A standardized, patient-tailored preoperative physical activity training program will be
           performed at home, from diagnosis to surgery. Supervision will be done with connected
           device (connected watches) and activity will be adapted,

        -  A nutritional care established in respect of the SFNEP-SFNCM guidelines. Nutritional
           support will be adapted by a dietician according to information transmitted daily
           (connected body fat weight scale),

        -  A psychological support with coping strategies.

      For the C group: Patients with ovarian cancer will undergo NACT after baseline evaluation
      without prehabilitation program.

      After NACT, for both groups, major abdomino-pelvic surgery will be done with or without ERAS
      pathway, according to the practice in each center.
