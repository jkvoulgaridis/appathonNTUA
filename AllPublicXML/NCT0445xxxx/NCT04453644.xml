  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscular flexibility is believed to prevent injuries and improve movement therefore most
      coaches include stretching exercises in their pre-competition and pre-exercise warm-up
      routines. One question arises here, should sports persons avoid stretching exercises prior to
      sporting events thereby exposing themselves to musculoskeletal injuries, or should they
      continue stretching exercises prior to sporting events and risk losing the maximal
      performance? The aim of this study is to compare the effects of 2, 4, and 8 min of static
      stretching (SS) on isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVCF) force between proximal
      (Hamstrings) and distal group (Calf) of muscles.

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 2, 4, and 8 min of static stretching (SS) on isometric
      maximum voluntary contraction (MVCF) force between proximal (Hamstrings) and distal group
      (Calf) of muscles.

      DESIGN: Two-group pretest-posttest experimental design. METHODS: Each subject visited the
      Rehabilitation center on three days: On day-I for static stretching for 2 minutes (SS2),
      day-II for 4 minutes (SS4), and day-III for 8 minutes (SS8). Isometric Maximum Voluntary
      Contraction Force (MVCF) measurement was done prior (Pre), 0-min, 10-min, and 20-min
      post-intervention (i.e. stretching). Each visit was separated by a gap of at least 3-4 days.
      On each visit, each subject underwent (a). Pre-intervention evaluation, (b). Intervention,
      (c). Post-intervention evaluation. Subjects performed stretching exercises under the
      supervision of expert Physical Therapist. The outcome assessor who was kept blind to study
      protocol did all measurements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For group A: subjects performed active knee extension test and those lacking at least 20
        degrees of active knee extension range, with hip in 90 degree of flexion were selected. For
        group B (Calf): Subjects performed active foot dorsiflexion in long sitting position with
        back supported against the wall and those having not more than 20-degree range of motion
        were selected.

        Selected subjects used to engage in 1-5 hours of regular physical activity per week
        (recreationally active) that does not involve stretching exercise

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects reporting any current or ongoing neuromuscular disease, injury specific to lower
        limb joints, any apparent limit in knee or ankle ROM and competitive/professional athletes
        were excluded from study.
