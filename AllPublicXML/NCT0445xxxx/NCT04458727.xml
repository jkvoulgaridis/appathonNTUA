  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cariovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death worldwide with high micro- as
      well as macro-economic burden. Several modifiable risk factors increase the probability of
      contracting a CVE. These risk factors can be positively influenced by a cardiac
      rehabilitation measure (CR), which has been shown to reduce mortality in CVD patients and to
      reduce the economic burden. An increase in physical activity and performance are central
      goals in CR, as they have a positive effect on several cardiovascular risk factors and
      correlate strongly with a reduction in mortality in CVD patients. These goals can be achieved
      in most CVD patients but can only be achieved by a modification of lifestyle.

      In order to positively influence this lifestyle modification beyond the duration of the CR
      measure and thus in the long term, CR Phase II should begin as soon as the patient fulfils
      one of the well-defined inclusion criteria. CR Phase II can be carried out as an inpatient or
      outpatient procedure and depends on the patient's state of health, personal preference and
      availability of an outpatient CR facility in the vicinity of the patient. In the Austrian
      healthcare system, inpatient CR and thus differs from other European countries. After
      completion of phase II, the patient is offered an outpatient phase III with weekly visits to
      the outpatient CR facility, so that lifestyle changes achieved at short notice can be
      sustainably maintained.

      For the secondary prevention of the CVD beyond the CR measure recommend international
      guidelines a physical activity of ≥ 150 min with moderate intensity or ≥ 60 to 75 min high
      intensity per week. The current study situation allows the statement that a greater benefit
      can be expected from more physical activity and that the training should be personalized and
      highly titrated. Patients in advanced stages of CVD and very inactive patients, defined as
      &lt;14 mets h/week, achieve the greatest health benefit from increased physical activity.
      Despite the well-studied benefits, even adherence to the above minimum recommendations for
      CVD patients after completion of CR is low. This deficit has been addressed in the latest
      European prevention guideline and recommended that patients i) set clearly defined goals, ii)
      exercise in the iii) Identify obstacles on the way to achieving the goals so that lifestyle
      changes are effective and sustainable and the benefits of physical activity can be achieved
      and maintained.

      The planned study will investigate the effect of multi-modal support measures to help
      patients during the home training phase and their influence on the patients' lifestyle.
