      Susu used to be a clinical experienced Chinese herb formula for treating acute cough caused
      by common cold. The ingredients includes Hua Ju Hong, Qiao Rui Su, Zi Su Ye, Jie Geng, Gan
      Cao,which relieving cold and cough, resolving phlegm in traditional Chinese medicine theory.
      This prescription was used for a long time in clinical for treatingacute cough caused by
      common cold as an herb formula. To standardize the quality and make it easier to take, we
      reproduced it into a patent medicine and design this trial for evaluating it.

    <measure>Time to Resolution of cough/ resolution rate</measure>
    <time_frame>The median time of resolution of cough during Day 2-Day 6 and resolution rate of the last 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical cure is assessed based on visual analogue scale(VAS) score of cough severity, and defined as both VAS scores of day-time and night-time cough reduce to 17mm or less, and last for 24 hours. Day-time refers to 6AM-10PM, night-time refers to 10PM-6AM. The cough VAS is a 100mm line segment, its length represents cough severity (both cough frequent and tense should be considered). 0mm=no cough, 100mm=worst cough, seriously impacting life quality such as playing, going to school, sleeping.18 Day-time and night-time VAS are assessed independently on baseline (Day1) and Day 2-Day 6 to assess the severity of last 24 hours. Children will be trained to use this assessment tool after randomized, and will recorded it by themselves via dairy with the assistance of their parents.</description>

    <measure>Parent-proxy Children's Acute Cough-specific QoL Questionnaire(PAC-QoL) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(Day1),the last 24 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PAC-QoL is a 16-iterm parent-proxy questionnaire to reflect the frequency of particular feelings and concerns or worries of parents, developed by team of Sophie Anderson James in Australia. 7 points Lkiert-type scale (very consistent, consistent, some consistent, general, some non-consistent, non-consistent, and very inconsistent, scoring 1-7, respectively) is used to assess the quality of life of past 24 hours. Lower scores shows greater frequency, concerns, or worries, with higher scores therefore reflecting better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall improvement of cough</measure>
    <time_frame>The last 24 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is assessed by parents, with the question of &quot;How is your child`s cough severity changed after treatment?&quot;(compared with 6 days ago). The response includes much better, better, no difference, worse, much worse. It will be record on Day 6.</description>

    <measure>Disappearance rate of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(Day1),the last 24 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>TCM syndrome includes feverish, cough,intolerance of cold, headache, body ache, nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose, pharyngeal itching.</description>

    <measure>Curative effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(Day1),the last 24 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the cure rate of symptoms respectively and the total efficacy of traditional Chinese syndrome on Day 6 via the TCM syndrome scale. Cure is defined as the score of the independent symptom decreased to 0. Efficacy means the change from baseline of total score＞50%.</description>
