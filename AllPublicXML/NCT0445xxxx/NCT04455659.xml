  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty two male participants, 30-50 years old, suffering from chronic pudendal neuralgia were
      randomly assigned either into experimental group (26 patients) received TENS plus the
      traditional physical therapy program( including range of motion exercise, stretching exercise
      of obturator internus muscle, clam shell exercise, relaxation exercise and underwater
      exercise) 3 sessions per week for 8 successive weeks, or control group (26 patients) received
      only the traditional physical therapy exercise for the same period of time. Intensity of pain
      by Verbal rating scale (VRS) as well as Serum cortisol level (SCL)and Etodolac level intake
      are measured pre and post treatment.

    <description>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain is a one-dimensional measure of pain intensity in adults, including those with chronic pain .It is an instrument tool to measure the intensity of pain, Numerical pain rating scale consists an 11-point numeric scale with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing extreme pain (Worst possible pain)</description>

    <description>TENS that was applied once daily, three times per week for 8 weeks. Each treatment session was conducted for 20 minutes, two electrodes were positioned over the perineal area between anus and scrotum on the Centrum tendineum, while the other two electrodes were applied under the buttocks medially at the level of the ischial spines (medial to the ischial spines bilaterally) with the patient in comfortable supine hook-lying position with abducted hips. to prevent burn beneath the electrodes, the surface area of the electrode should be equal to or greater than 4 cm2 to minimize the heat production. In addition, to decrease the current density between electrodes, the inter-electrode distance was less than the cross sectional area of the electrode</description>
