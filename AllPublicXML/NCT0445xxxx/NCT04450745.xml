  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity, along with proper nutrition, is the basis for the behavioral treatment of
      diabetes. In recent years exercise training in normobaric hypoxia is used in training
      programs for athletes and in rehabilitation. The aim of this study is the assessment of
      physical exercise in normobaric hypoxia condition on metabolic control of diabetes: blood
      glucose profile, its stability, HbA1c value, hypoglycemia: frequency, level, severity and
      time of occurrence, insulin demand, maximal muscle strength level, VO2max and anthropometric
      parameters.

      Hypoxia leads to HIF-1 production (hypoxia inducible factor 1) which regulates expression of
      many genes (eg. gene responsible for erythropoetin production). It also stimulates
      angiogenesis, muscle hypertrophy and glycolytic energy production by transactivating genes
      involved in extracellular glucose import.

      Before starting the training program all participants will be assessed by cardiologist. Then
      the incremental exercise test will be performed to determine aerobic capacity (VO2max).

      Recruited patients ( type 1 male diabetic patients) will be divided into 2 arms: exercise in
      normoxia or in normobaric hypoxia. Hypoxic chamber is set to contain equivalent to an
      altitude of 2500 meters above see level (indoor air composition: 15,4% of O2 and 84,7% of N).

      Training program will be the same for all participants: 60 minutes sessions twice a week for
      6 weeks of mixed exercise: aerobic and anaerobic.

      Glycemia will be monitored by Flash Glucose Monitoring (Free Style Libre) and the same
      glucometer model by all patients.

      At baseline and after 6 weeks: echocardiography, ECG and incremental exercise test, ECG and
      blood pressure monitoring, lipid profile and diabetes control parameters will be performed in
      all patients.
