  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation aims to generate clinical data to support the use of Multispectral
      Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) in clinical practice, its inclusion in diagnostic guidelines
      and to support its reimbursement, specifically to

        -  Further validate the application with respect to including ulcerative colitis patients

        -  Prepare a study protocol for large-scale clinical validation study in inflammatory bowel
           disease (IBD)

        -  Successfully execute the clinical validation study

      The clinical investigation, EUPHORIA, will pave the way to establish Multispectral
      Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) technology for the non-invasive assessment of intestinal
      inflammation in patients. EUPHORIA will enable commercialization of the technology by
      finalizing technical improvements that will increase diagnostic outcome beyond what has been
      shown in a first feasibility study, will improve usability, prepare CE marking for the new
      device and validate clinical results in a large clinical investigation.

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition, posing significant burden to
      patients and health care systems. Patients suffer from a relapsing course of intestinal
      inflammation, and to date, there is no satisfying noninvasive diagnostic modality for
      monitoring disease activity. In a recent clinical study conducted by University Hospital
      Erlangen, MSOT, a technology developed by iThera Medical (ITM), has proven to be superior in
      diagnostic performance to other procedures.

    <description>Assess performance of other non-invasive diagnostic modalities in order to allow for comparison to MSOT performance. Diagnostic accuracy of each of the various non-invasive tests (CRP, fCal, US, MRI) with respect to the endoscopy (reference test) and histology will be calculated using standard techniques for diagnostic studies. This includes cross tabulation of the index test results by the results of the reference standard, as well as plots of their distribution and ROC curves. Area under the Curve (AUC) estimates and conﬁdence intervals (DeLong) will be calculated. Score conﬁdence intervals (Wilson) will be calculated for proportions such as sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and predictive values at the predeﬁned thresholds.</description>

    <description>Explore performance of MSOT in combination with other modalities, e.g. in combination with ultrasound (US) or laboratory. AUC will be estimated for all non-invasive tests with a 95% conﬁdence interval (DeLong) both from the derivation cohort and from the pooled cohorts (derivation + validation) for increased precision. Cohen's κ will be used as a measure of overall agreement. Results will be presented in three-way tables, comparing the new test (MSOT), the non-reference standard (non-invasive modalities), and the reference standard (endoscopy).</description>
