      The aim of this study compares mirror therapy and visual feedback treatment with the control
      group in frozen shoulder patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-six individuals divided three groups as mirror therapy, visual feedback, and control
      groups were included in the study for 15 sessions of treatment. All individuals received
      basic treatment as ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, cold pack,
      stretching exercises, glenohumeral range of motion exercises, scapulothoracic exercises. The
      mirror group bilateral exercised with an affected arm behind the mirror; visual feedback
      group bilateral exercised by seeing both arms in the mirror; control group bilateral
      exercised without a mirror for 10 minutes after every session. Pain severity was evaluated
      with the &quot;Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&quot;, ROM and proprioception were measured with a universal
      goniometer, and functional status was evaluated with &quot;shoulder pain and disability index
      (SPADI)&quot; and &quot;Modified Constant Score&quot;. Evaluations were made before, day after the treatment
      and 4 weeks after the treatment by the same researcher. Data analysis was performed with
      SPSS.23.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 5 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was obtained using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS is usually a horizontal line, 10 cm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end with &quot;No Pain&quot; (score of zero) on the left side up to &quot;severe pain&quot; on the right side. The patient was asked to mark the line point that represented his or her worst pain in the past week during daily rutine.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 5 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion is the measurement of the amount of movement around a joint as a flexion, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation (degree). Measurement performed with universal goniometer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 5 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proprioception is the sense of self-movement and body position. A joint position error test (JPET) was used for proprioception measurement. JPET is a deviation of the ability to reposition the joint to the target position which fifty percent of active flexion ROM.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 5 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The shoulder pain and disability index is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other one for functional activities on the shoulder. The total score is defining as a percent. 0 for best score 100 for worst score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Constant-Murley Score (CMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 5 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Constant-Murley score is a questionnaire for shoulder injuries that consists of four dimensions, pain, activities of daily living, range of movement, and power. Pain and activities of daily living are considered subjective scores therefore the range of movement and power considered objective score. 100 for best score 0 for worst score.</description>
