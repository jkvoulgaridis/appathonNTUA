  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to develop and test a new supportive care program to help
      individuals with lung cancer improve their quality of life after cancer treatment is over.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this pilot study are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a brief
      psychoeducational intervention for participants with cancer who are transitioning from active
      treatment to surveillance.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility.

      This study consists of 2 parts. It is expected that about 45 people will take part in this
      research study.

        -  In the first part of this study, about 5 participants will complete survey questions and
           receive a 5-session program.

        -  In the second part of this study, about 40 participants will complete survey questions
           and the first session, and then will be randomly assigned to receive the rest of the
           sessions or to not receive the rest of the sessions.

        -  These sessions will focus on providing targeted support related to life after cancer
           treatment. The sessions will focus on skills for coping with uncertainty, managing
           symptoms, improving social support, and other topics important to the individual.

    <description>This measure assesses multidimensional quality of life including physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and lung cancer-specific concerns. Each item is answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Total scores will be used, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>This measure assesses worry about the return of disease with 6 items measured on a 5-point scale and 1 item measured on a 10-point scale. Total scores will be used, with higher scores indicating greater fear of recurrence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses depression and anxiety symptoms (7 items each), and mixed affect (all 14 items). Total scores will be used, with higher scores indicating greater distress.</description>

    <description>Recruit up to 5 patients who meet eligibility criteria to participate in the run-in period of the study.
Participants will receive Sessions 1-5 of the psychoeducational intervention condition and will complete both assessments and a semistructured interview about the intervention.
Session 1 with a study interventionist, focused on identifying participant's goals, expectations and wishes for post-treatment quality of life, as well as a handout listing local and national support resources.
Session 2-5 is focused on teaching skills to enhance post-treatment quality of life, with attention to (a) managing expectations about life after cancer treatment, (b) managing uncertainty (e.g., fears of cancer recurrence), (c) enhancing self-management of residual symptoms and (d) strengthening social support</description>
