    <description>Changes in the total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (II +III) score relative to baseline from baseline to the end of the double-blind dose maintenance period, The UPDRS scale refers to Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and it is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's disease in patients. Some sections of the UPDRS scale require multiple grades assigned to each extremity with a possible maximum of 199 points. A score of 199 on the UPDRS scale represents the worst (total disability) with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>

    <measure>changes in the severity (SI) score;</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>From baseline to the end of the double-blind dose maintenance period, changes in the severity (SI) score of Item 1 ;The Severity Score (ISS) scores ranges from 0 to 75 (i.e. Abbreviated Scale (AIS) scores of 6 for each injury in every body region according to its relative severity). If an injury is assigned an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) of 6 (identified currently as untreatable injury or unsurvivable injury), the ISS score is automatically assigned 75. Since a score of 6 (&quot;unsurvivable&quot;) indicates the futility of further medical care in preserving life, this may mean a cessation of further care in triage for a patient with a score of 6 in any category.</description>

    <description>Changes in pd sleep Disorders Scale (PDSS) score from baseline to the end of the double-blind dose maintenance period. The overall PDSS is the summary score of the single PDSS items. If the single items have values between 0 (= worst case) to 10 (= best case) the total score can range between 0 and 150. Score 150 means the best case.</description>

Each item of the BDI-II is rated along a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3； Items are summed to produce a total score（0-63） with higher scores representing more depressive symptoms.</description>
