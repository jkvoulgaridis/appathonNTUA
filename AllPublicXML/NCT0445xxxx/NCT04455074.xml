  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropsychiatric fluctuations (NF) are among the most disabling non motor fluctuations in
      Parkinson disease (PD). The investigators developed the NF-scale for acute assessment of
      non-motor neuropsychiatric fluctuations between the off- and on-medication conditions in PD.
      The main goal of this project is to validate the NF-scale in french language in a multicenter
      approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety, sadness, lack of energy and motivation, fatigue and pain are common during the
      off-medication condition, whereas euphoria, well-being, impulse control disorders, behavioral
      addictions, mania, and psychosis might occur during the on-medication condition. Early
      diagnosis of NpsyF is crucial for their holistic management. Unfortunately, NpsyF are often
      under-recognized by patients or misdiagnosed by physicians due to the lack of specific
      assessment tools. The NFS is composed of 20 items among which ten measure the &quot;ON
      neuropsychological state&quot; and ten, the &quot;OFF neuropsychological state&quot;. It provides two
      sub-scores (one ON and one OFF) with a maximal total score of 30.
