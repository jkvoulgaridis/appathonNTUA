    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol
      treatment on intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis. In this test, a method
      adapted from the Fleming one-step scheme will be used. The success rate is measured by the
      proportion of patients with fecal calprotectin levels &lt; 250 µg/g at 3 months after treatment
      initiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is one of the most frequent serious genetic diseases in France (7000
      patients). It is the consequence of mutations in the CFTR gene, encoding a protein involved
      in the hydro-electrolytic balance of secretions. Beyond the well-known lung damage in these
      patients, intestinal inflammation is present in the majority of patients.

      While advances in the management of cystic fibrosis are increasing patient life expectancy,
      other issues are emerging, including the impact of this chronic intestinal inflammation on
      the nutritional status and high risk of digestive cancers (Maisonneuve, 2013; Garg and Ooi,
      2017; Yamada, 2018).

      Currently, no management is proposed to treat this intestinal inflammation. The use of
      laxatives to fluidize digestive secretions and restore a digestive ecosystem close to the
      healthy subject could constitute a new therapeutic approach to this intestinal inflammation,
      as previously shown in the mouse model of cystic fibrosis (De Lisle, 2007). However, to date,
      to the investigator's knowledge, no studies have evaluated the effect of laxative treatment
      on intestinal inflammation of cystic fibrosis in humans.

      This study is a bi-centric, non-comparative, prospective study for a phase II trial according
      to a Fleming scheme.

      Study participants will take a 3-month laxative treatment with polyethylene glycol for 3
      months. In addition to the inclusion visit, a follow-up visit will take place at 3 months and
      3 intermediate telephone calls will be made to ensure efficacy, tolerance and compliance.

The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measure for children, adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is a profile measure of HRQOL with several different domains. It has undergone extensive reliability and validity testing.
The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) application calculates the score derived from the CFQ-R, on a 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating better HRQoL.</description>
