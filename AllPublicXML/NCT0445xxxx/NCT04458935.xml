      Background:

      Retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) is a tumor. It grows from the retina in the eye. It can
      threaten a person s vision. Trans-scleral cryotherapy is used to destroy the tumors and
      minimize the long-term risks of vision loss. RH is a rare condition, often occurring in
      people with von Hippel-Lindau disease. There are no clinical trials to study how well the
      treatment works. Researchers want to study the medical records of people with RH who were
      treated at the NIH eye clinic to learn more.

      Objective:

      To analyze clinical data collected over a 20-year span to study consecutive cases of RH
      managed with trans-scleral cryotherapy at the NIH.

      Eligibility:

      People who took part in NIH natural history protocols for which cryotherapy of RH was
      performed as a standard care measure.

      Design:

      Researchers will collect and study data from participants medical charts. Participants will
      not be contacted because no new data is needed. Researchers were granted a waiver of informed
      consent for use of these medical records. To protect patient privacy, participants will be
      assigned an ID number. Their data will be entered into a spreadsheet in a coded fashion. The
      key to this code will be kept in a secure file. No patient identifying information will be
      used in the analysis or the publication.

      Study Description: This study is a retrospective review of medical records in the NIH eye
      clinic. To our knowledge, there has been no report in the current era dedicated to a
      description of trans-scleral cryotherapy for retinal hemangioblastomas despite its routine
      use in this setting. This study aims to explore features and outcomes of these cases to
      better inform best practices.

      Objectives: The objective of this study is to perform a retrospective analysis of consecutive
      cases of retinal hemangioblastoma managed with trans-scleral cryotherapy at the NIH (single
      center retrospective case series).

      Study Population: Consecutive cases involving participants in NIH natural history protocols
      for which cryotherapy of retinal hemangioblastoma was performed as a standard care measure.

      Description of Sites/Facilities conducting research: Analysis includes only NIH data and will
      occur at the NEI.

      Study Duration: Six months.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Participants were enrolled in NEI and non-NEI natural history protocols, but in
                  all cases, cryotherapy was administered as a standard care measure (not as an
                  investigative treatment).

               2. Patients were identified by searching the NIH eye clinic EMR for all of those
                  manifesting one or more retinal hemangioblastomas (with or without associated von
                  Hippel-Lindau disease) treated with cryotherapy.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        None
