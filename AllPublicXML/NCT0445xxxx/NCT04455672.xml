      • to compare the relief of pain for patients with anterior disc displacement with reduction
      between two groups; in the first group a digitally formed stabilizing splint followed by an
      anterior repositioning splint (ARS) and the second group a digitally fabricated (ARS) splints
      followed by a stabilizing splints

    <description>Scaning of the maxillary and mandibular cast in the centric relation.
The CAD/ CAM splints will be designed using Exocad s.
The design will include all maxillary teeth and the occlusal surfaces will be flat and smooth.
The difference in design between the ARS and the stabilization splint, is that the ARS will have an anterior ramp to allow for posterior disocclusion of posterior teeth, while the stabilization splint will not have such a pronounced anterior ramp.
Both splints will be printed using Dent2 3D printer and then cured using Dentcure.
All patient will be asked to wear their spints during sleeping only.
In each group, patient will be recalled after 1week,2 weeks 1,2and 3monthes then change for the other splint for another 3 months .</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • TMDs according to the research diagnostic criteria (RDC)8 which include: i. Painful
             TMJ audible and palpable click unilateral or bilateral ii. Presence of clicking during
             opening. iii. TMJ tenderness.

               -  Fully dentate patients without any malocclusion (natural or restored by fixed
                  prothesis) and good oral hygiene.

               -  Co-operative patient that should show motivation to follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Patients with systemic diseases which could affect TMJ, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis,
             osteoarthrosis, Myasthenia Gravis and fibromyalgia.

               -  Patients taking analgesic, muscle relaxant, or anti-inflammatory drugs were
                  excluded because such drugs could influence the results.

               -  Patients with removable dental prosthesis
