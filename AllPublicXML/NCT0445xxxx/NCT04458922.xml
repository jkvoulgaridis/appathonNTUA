  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well atezolizumab works in treating patients with
      chondrosarcoma or clear cell sarcoma that is newly diagnosed, cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable), or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the objective response rates (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 of atezolizumab in adult (&gt;= 18 years) and
      pediatric/adolescent (&gt;= 2 years) patients with clear cell sarcoma (CCS) and chondrosarcoma
      (CS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine duration of response (DOR) using RECIST v 1.1 and/or change in clinical symptoms
      (time frame: baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of
      another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination).

      II. Measure progression-free survival (PFS) time (time frame: baseline until disease
      progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment,
      withdrawal of consent, or study termination).

      III. Assess the number of activated CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor before and after
      atezolizumab treatment, and correlate treatment-induced changes with clinical response.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare RECIST v 1.1 versus (vs) immune RECIST (iRECIST) in patients with CCS and CS on
      atezolizumab.

      II. Examine changes in PD-1/PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment before and after
      atezolizumab treatment, and correlate treatment-induced changes with clinical response.

      III. Evaluate potential associations between atezolizumab activity and tumor genomic
      alterations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 30 days.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atezolizumab is an investigational
             agent with the unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary

               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately
