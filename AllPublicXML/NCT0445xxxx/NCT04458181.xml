    <description>PPJ is a journaling practice to support addiction recovery. PPJ encourages past 24 hour review and upcoming 24 hour planning to improve subjective wellbeing in recovery and reduce relapse. PPJ uses journals with column headings under which individuals make bullet-pointed lists. On the left hand page, past 24 hours is recalled, itemizing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; things that happened and things for which one is grateful. Good wishes for others are also expressed on this page. On the right hand page, values-based activities for the upcoming 24 hours are planned via headings representing valued life domains such as &quot;recovery,&quot; &quot;work/school,&quot; &quot;spirituality,&quot; &quot;home and household,&quot; and &quot;health.&quot;</description>
