  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial on 40 bariatric surgery candidates who will be randomized into
      two arms (app vs. control). All the participants will receive the standard care of 3-6
      preparation to bariatric surgery meetings with a dietitian, and only those participants who
      will assigned to the experimental group will get access to our study's smartphone app site
      during this period.

      Evaluations will be performed at baseline, at the end of the intervention phase (after 3-6
      meetings as needed) and at 1 and 2 years post-surgery (data will be collected at 1 and 2
      years post-surgery by phone calls).

      Data which will be collected for this study include:demographics and medical data,
      anthropometrics including body composition analysis, handgrip Strength, physical activity,
      hydration state, bariatric surgery knowledge questionnaire, quality of life by visual
      analogue scale, compliance to dietary and lifestyle BS recommendations, readiness for
      surgery, the subject's experience regarding the smartphone app, surgical data and adherence
      to post-surgical follow-up by the bariatric team.

      A randomized controlled trial on 40 bariatric surgery candidates who will be recruited while
      attending to the bariatric clinics and by advertisement about the study. Patients will be
      randomized into two arms (app vs. control) using an online software. All the participants
      will receive the standard care of 3-6 preparation to bariatric surgery meetings with a
      dietitian, and only those participants who will be assigned to the experimental group will
      get access to our study's smartphone app site during this period. The study specific
      smartphone app site will be based on current literature plus investigators experience and
      will include a wide knowledge on types of surgeries, dietary guidelines pre- and
      post-surgery, fluids type and amount, knowledge on supplementation use pre and post-surgery,
      general dietary knowledge, psychological information, physical activity, recommendation and
      tips for long-term surgery success, emphasis will be made on long-term follow-up meetings
      with the bariatric team and practical information on the preparation to the hospitalization
      process. The smartphone app site will contain video-based modules and encouraging messages.
      In addition, patients will be encouraged to use the platform to ask questions and receive
      answers regarding any aspect of the surgery.

      Evaluations will be performed at baseline, at the end of the intervention phase (after 3-6
      meetings as needed) and at 1 and 2 years post-surgery (data will be collected at 1 and 2
      years post-surgery by phone calls).

      Data which will be collected for this study include:demographics and medical data,
      anthropometrics including body composition analysis, handgrip Strength, physical activity,

      analogue scale, compliance to dietary and lifestyle BS recommendations, readiness for
      surgery, the subject's experience regarding the smartphone app, surgical data and adherence
