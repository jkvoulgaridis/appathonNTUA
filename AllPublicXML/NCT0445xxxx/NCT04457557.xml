  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rebound pain after nerve block could interfere with patient's recovery and
      rehabilitation. It is not known how local anesthetic concentrations affect rebound pain. The
      aim of this study is evaluation of the effect of local anesthetic concentration on rebound
      pain after interscalene block for shoulder surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder surgery is related to more than moderate pain after surgery. Interscalene nerve
      block could reduce the postoperative pain effectively. When the effect of nerve block ends,
      however, rebound pain could appear. The rebound pain could interfere with patient's recovery
      and rehabilitation.

      The mechanism of rebound pain is not well known. One of possible mechanism is that the pain
      stimulus that was blocked suddenly comes out, and it is perceived as more severe pain. The
      strength of the block may vary depending on the concentration of the local anesthetic.
      Therefore, the concentration of local anesthetics could affect rebound pain. The aim of this
      study is evaluation of the effect of local anesthetic concentration on rebound pain after
      interscalene block for shoulder surgery.
