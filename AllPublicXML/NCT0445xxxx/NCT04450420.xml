  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCC-PASTE is a randomised controlled trial comparing a simulation based training curriculum
      with standard training for ophthalmology residents learning to perform tunnel construction in
      manual small incision cataract surgery. After obtaining informed consent, participating
      trainees will be randomly assigned to learn to perform tunnel construction either through the
      simulation based curriculum or through the standard curriculum at their institute. Trainees
      assigned to simulation will learn through studying an eBook, participating in training
      sessions supported by repeated practice on a virtual reality simulator, and supervised
      training in live surgery to facilitate transfer of skill acquired in simulation to the
      operating room. To determine the effect of simulation based training, we will assess the
      number of errors trainees perform in the initial part of their intraoperative learning curve.
