  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether acupuncture treatments can reduce the need
      for opioid medication when managing pain caused by chemotherapy. The study will compare the
      effects of adding acupuncture to usual pain management with those of usual pain management
      alone, in reducing opioid use by relieving pain. Researchers also want to find out more about
      the effects of acupuncture treatments on other symptoms caused by cancer treatments and
      quality of life.
