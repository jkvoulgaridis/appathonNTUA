  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether there is a difference in the rate of tendon tear after hyperlipemia in
      tennis elbow patients and those with normal blood lipids after closed treatment, which
      provides clues for further exploration of its mechanism. 1. Collect data from 108 cases of
      tennis elbow patients treated at the Institute of Sports Medicine, Peking University Third
      Hospital from January 2010 to December 2018 at the Institute of Sports Medicine, Peking
      University Third Hospital. Statistics included the sex, age, BMI, number of closures, total
      cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein. 2. Retrieve
      the MRI imaging data of the above-mentioned patients, and use the extensor tendon at the
      humerus to see if there is a tear as an observation indicator. Analyze the difference of
      tendon tear after closed treatment in patients with high blood fat and normal blood fat.

    <description>One sports medicine surgeon and one musculoskeletal radiologists, being blinded to the patients' information, reviewed the elbow MRI independently. The common extensor tendon (CET) abnormalities were evaluated on axial and coronal fat-suppressed T2-weighted FSE image. Tendinosis group was defined as an increased signal intensity, but lower than the fluid signal on T2-weighted images and/ or an increased tendon thickness. Tendon tear group contain a partial thickness tear defined as a region with fluid-signal-intensity that extended partway across the tendon and a full thickness tear appeared as a gap of fluid-signal-intensity across the entire tendon substance.</description>

        In order to rule out the influence of the imbalance between height and weight on blood
        lipids, the difference between the case group and the control group was analyzed after
        adjusting the height and weight covariates using the Generalized Linear Model.
