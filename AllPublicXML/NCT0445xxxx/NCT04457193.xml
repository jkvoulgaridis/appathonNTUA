  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precancerous lesion characterized by the replacement of the
      normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus by intestinal metaplasia (IM).
      Non-dysplastic BE may progress to low-grade dysplasia (LGD), to high-grade dysplasia (HGD)
      and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Endoscopic ablation is safe and effective for complete
      eradication of BE. However, recurrence is common. Cumulative incidence rate of BE recurrence
      is up to 30% in the third year. Thus, achieving complete eradication of IM, patients should
      undergo surveillance indefinitely with serial endoscopy to assess for recurrence of BE. In
      addition, BE patients have been committed to life-long proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy,
      but increasing concerns about adverse effects has led to alternative therapies. Studies have
      showed that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication may decrease recurrence of BE after endoscopic
      ablation. Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) is an endoscopic procedure that
      mechanically creates fundoplication similar to traditional operative Nissen fundoplication.
      The role of TIF in patients with BE whom underwent successful endoscopic ablation has not
      been fully investigated.
