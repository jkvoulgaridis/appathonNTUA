    <textblock>
      Today in elderly tooth loss and loss of oral function is widespread, but it is an
      underexplored modifiable risk factor potentially contributing to the development of dementia.
      In this interventional study we want to investigate a &quot;cause-effect&quot; relationship between
      mastication and cognition in humans.

      A total of eighty (80) participants, 65-80 years of age, indicated for prosthodontic
      rehabilitation will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group.
      Participants will be randomized into two different groups, measurements are going to be
      conducted before and after prosthetic rehabilitation. The difference between the two groups
      is that the control group are going to do two measurements before undergoing the
      rehabilitation, this to control for the test-re-test effect.

      The aim with this study is to determine if the rehabilitation of chewing function will cause
      changes in the neurocognitive assessments of episodic memory and learning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Dementia is a general term of several neurodegenerative diseases that jointly affects
           approximately 7% of the general population older than 65 years, and 30% older than 80
           years (O'Brien, 2003). Importantly, these statistics are expected to almost double every
           20 years (Prince, 2013), making disorders of cognition a priority for healthcare
           (O'Brien, 2014).

        -  Animal and human studies have shown associations with mastication and cognitive function
           through the medial temporal lobe (i.e., hippocampus) and its role in learning and
           memory. (Ono, 2010. Weijenberg, 2011. Ohkubo, 2012. Teixeira, 2014. Klineberg, 2014)

        -  Although tooth loss and loss of oral function is widespread in older people, it is still
           an underexplored modifiable risk factor contributing to the development of dementia.

        -  We aim to conduct an intervention study on elderly people where rehabilitation of
           masticatory functions is performed and evaluated, with cognitive measures and brain
           imaging, to investigate a &quot;cause-effect&quot; relationship between mastication and cognition
           in humans.

        -  Our hypothesis is that rehabilitation of masticatory function will improve cognition
           primarily in the performance of episodic memory and executive function tests along with
           the corresponding neural changes mainly in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

        -  A total of eighty (80) participants, 65-80 years of age, indicated for prosthodontic
           rehabilitation at Eastmaninstitutet (Stockholm, Sweden) will be randomly assigned to
           either the experimental or the control group. The difference between the groups is that
           the participants in the experimental group will begin with the rehabilitation
           immediately after the first measurement while the control group will do one more
           measurement before the onset of the rehabilitation procedure. The two measurements
           conducted before treatment in the control group are to rule out for test-retest effects.
           Three months and one year after completed prosthodontic treatment participants will
           conduct the last measurements, as a post-test to evaluate potential treatment effect.

        -  The neuropsychological assessments will be conducted together with MRI assessments, oral
           health-related quality of life instrument, chewing function test (two coloured chewing
           gum) and saliva samples recorded at different time points (i.e., pre-test, post-test 1,
           post-test 2, post-test 3) in both the groups.

        -  The data from the study will be entered in a Microsoft Excel sheet and exported to
           Statistics is a software package SPSS Inc, Statistica, StatSoft Inc (or similar advanced
           analytics software package for analysis). The result from the cognitive testing will be
           analysed as repeated measure Analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) with groups (experimental
           and control) and time (pre- and post-rehabilitation) as factors. Group-by-time
           interaction, main effect of group, and main effect of time will be evaluated. To compare
           the magnitude of gains, the effect size (partial eta-square) will also be calculated. We
           will use time-length between pre- and post-tests as a covariate of interest with aiming
           to better control group differences. To predict the intervention outcomes, we will
           develop models that mainly predicts cognitive test measures (neuropsychological
           assessments). Predictive ability is defined as the amount of variance in the outcome
           that can be explained by pre-test cognitive status (slope method). Explained variance in
           outcome will be obtained by analysing linear regressions.

        -  Preprocessing and statistical analyses of MRI data will be performed with Statistical
           Parametric Mapping (SPM) run in Matlab (MathWorks). Movement correction will be
           performed by realign and unwarp to the first image in the series. To consider
           group-specific anatomical brain differences, all patients will be normalized to Monteral
           Neurological Institute (MNI) echoplanar-imaging template. Cortical thickness measures
           will not be normalized but rather used in their raw form. For cortical segmentation, a
           Freesurfer pipeline will be applied to the MRI images to produce regional cortical
           thickness and volumetric measures. To investigate rehabilitating-related changes
           repeated measures ANCOVAs will be performed with the groups (experimental and control)
           and time (pre- and post-rehabilitation) as factors. We will control for multiple
           comparisons with the Bonferroni-Holm method.

    <description>Individual treatment options will be discussed with the participants individually and rehabilitation will be provided as agreed by the dentist and the participant depending on the clinical situation and the participants financial status. The rehabilitation will include fixed prosthodontics and will be achieved by providing the latest and most effective measures in modern day prosthodontics. The procedures will involve a control phase involving scaling, root planing oral hygiene instructions etc., extractions and bone augmentation when needed and temporary removable dentures will be made if required. Restoration of the lost vertical dimension (if needed) with occlusal splints, tooth preparations, placement of dental implants (if needed) and finally cementation of dental crowns. The entire rehabilitation phase is estimated to take approximately 3-18 months, where implant treatment is the main factor for the longer time frames.</description>
