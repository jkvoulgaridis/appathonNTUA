  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) treatment in patients with incurable cancer is understudied and the
      level of evidence for clinical meaningful effects is weak. The ESPEN guidelines give few
      specific recommendations regarding which patients with incurable cancer that should be
      offered PN treatment. According to the Norwegian prescription database, the use of parenteral
      nutrition has more than doubled in the period 2004-2015. These numbers do not separate
      between diagnoses and medical conditions, so the current use of medical nutrition in cancer
      patients in Norway is not known. The decision to initiate parenteral nutrition is taken at
      hospitals, whereupon the patient returns home to their respective municipalities and receives
      follow-up by the home care service. There are often uncertainties about the duration of
      treatment, as patients' clinical condition can change rapidly. One major challenge health
      care professionals face is to decide when to end medical nutrition therapy. Patients and
      relatives may experience fear that discontinuation of medical nutrition accelerates death,
      while health care professionals often experience that nutrition in many cases does not help
      and inflicts negatively on patients' condition. This makes communication concerning end of
      nutritional treatment between health care professionals at several health care levels,
      patients and their relatives challenging.

      There is a need for a stronger evidence base considering the effect of medical nutrition in
      patients with incurable cancer. To be able to study the effect of PN treatment, more studies
      on clinical practice of PN treatment to patients with incurable cancer is needed. Aspects
      like indication for use, dosage and duration of PN treatment is poorly described in the
      available literature. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe indications for use of PN,
      duration of treatment, reasons for discontinuation, method of administration, possible
      benefits and complications as well as survival.

        This retrospective medical record review includes adult patients with incurable cancer who
        received parenteral nutrition treatment in palliative care in the time period, January 2011
        to December 2017. Only patients who were deceased at point of data abstraction are
        included.
