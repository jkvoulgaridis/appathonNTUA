    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of intravenous infusion of plasma from healthy young people for the treatment of amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis. The main outcome indicators are the record of adverse reactions and the
      rate of change of amyotrophic lateral sclerosisFunctional Rating Scale score. The secondary
      outcome indicators include survival time-time to the end event (death, tracheotomy,
      continuous ventilator dependence), forced vital capacity (FVC), recognition Knowledge
      function evaluation (ECAS score).
