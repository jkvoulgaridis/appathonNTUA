    <measure>Part B- Annualized Bleeding Rates(ABR).</measure>
    <time_frame>For the duration of study participation, 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Annualized bleeding rate = (number of bleeding episodes during the efficacy, period/total number of days during the efficacy period)*365.25. The efficacy period begins with the first prophylactic dose of FRSW107 and ends with the last dose (for prophylaxis or a bleed). Surgery/rehabilitation periods and PK evaluation periods are not included in the efficacy period. A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed and ended no more than 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleed, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart were considered the same bleeding episode. Any injection to treat the bleeding episode taken more than 72 hours after the preceding one was considered the first injection to treat a new bleeding episode at the same location. Any bleeding at a different location was considered a separate bleeding episode, regardless of time from last injection.</description>
