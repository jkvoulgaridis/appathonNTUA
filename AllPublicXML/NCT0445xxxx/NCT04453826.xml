  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through multicenter, open-label, randomised clinical trials, we intend to demonstrate that
      concurrent and adjuvant PD-1 treatment added to chemo-radiotherapy could further decrease the
      rate of disease progression and improve the survival outcome of high risk patients with
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with those treated with chemo-radiotherapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through multicenter, open-label, randomised clinical trials, high risk patients with
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (staged as II-III with SD/PD according to RECIST criteria or EBV DNA
      of &gt;0 copies/mL after 3 cycles of GP induction chemotherapy and staged as IVa) are randomized
      into camrelizumab plus chemo-radiotherapy arm and chemo-radiotherapy arm. The efficacy and
      safety of patients between these two arms are compared.
