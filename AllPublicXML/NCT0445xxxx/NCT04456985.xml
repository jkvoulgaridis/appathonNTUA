      Comparison of preoperative folic acid and VitB12 intervention on postoperative delirium and
      long-term neurobehavioral changes in children under general anesthesia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Folic acid, as a one-carbon unit transferase coenzyme, participates in the synthesis of
      purine and thymine, and is an important element of the nervous system. Vitamin B12
      participates in methyl conversion and folate metabolism in the body, promoting the conversion
      of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. It has been reported that the lack of serum
      folic acid and B12 is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. The
      explanation mechanism of the relationship between folic acid deficiency and cognitive
      dysfunction may be that folic acid deficiency leads to impaired central nervous system
      methylation, resulting in insufficient methyl synthesis of myelin sheaths, neurotransmitters,
      membrane phospholipids and deoxyribonucleic acid. Our previous studies showed that
      preoperative folic acid supplementation can alleviate myelin damage and cognitive impairment
      in young rats caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. Therefore, this study further explored the
      preoperative folic acid and coenzyme B12 supplementation for children's delirium and
      long-term neurobehavioral changes after general anesthesia.

    <measure>PAED scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Observe whether the index will cause delirium during the recovery period.The evaluation range of the PAED scale is 0-20 points, If the score exceeds 10 points, Then it is considered delirium.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gesell scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 day after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Through the gesell scale, 5 tests are carried out on children: gross motor ability, fine movement, physical ability, verbal ability, and human ability.The evaluation range of the Gesell scale is 0-100 points. If the score is higher, it means good. If the score is low, it means that the result is not good. If the result is not good, it may be caused by anesthesia, so we conducted this evaluation.</description>

    <description>Ramsay sedation score after recovery, extubation and every 10min within 30min after extubation，Ramsay sedation score is 1-6 points. If the score is 2-4 points，That result is satisfactory, 5-6 points are excessive sedation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain CHEOPs scores</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after extubation</time_frame>
    <description>The postoperative pain CHEOPs scores were taken at the time of extubation and every 10 minutes within 30 minutes after extubation (the total score was less than 6 points, there was no pain, and ≥10 points for corresponding analgesia treatment).
The total score is 46 points, if the total score is less than 6 points, it is judged as no pain</description>

    <description>Before the operation, the patient took 20ml of brown sugar aqueous solution containing folic acid and VitB12 for 3 days (folic acid concentration is 0.4mg / d for 2 year old children + 1.2μg / d of VitB12, dissolved in 20ml brown sugar water once a day). Postoperatively, PAED scores were performed at the time of awakening, extubation and every 10min within 30min after extubation. 10 points is defined as delirium during the recovery period). Long-term neurobehavioral changes were evaluated using the Gesell scale, followed up every six months until the age of three</description>

    <description>The patients in the placebo group took 20 ml of brown sugar aqueous solution with the same concentration as the intervention group 3 days before the operation. Postoperatively, PAED scores were performed at the time of recovery, extubation, and every 10 minutes within 30 minutes after extubation. The PAED scores of all children were measured by the same person. (The total score is 0-20, and the score ≥10 is defined as delirium during the recovery period). Long-term neurobehavioral changes were evaluated using the Gesell scale, followed up every six months until the age of three</description>
