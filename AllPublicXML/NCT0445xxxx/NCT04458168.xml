  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, ovarian cancer survivors will be enrolled and followed for six months to
      evaluate usage of an eHealth app called &quot;Purposeful&quot;.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility and acceptability of Purposeful, the eHealth app.
      First, feasibility of enrolling ovarian cancer survivors to use Purposeful will be assessed.
      Secondly, the acceptability of the app among ovarian cancer survivors will be assessed, based
      on frequency of use and validated acceptability measures. Participants will be asked to
      complete other validated questionnaires so investigators may explore whether further research
      on the Purposeful app among ovarian cancer survivors is warranted. This will include
      correlations between use of the Purposeful app and the life purpose questionnaire score.
      Lastly, correlation between life purpose and quality of life in ovarian cancer survivors will
      be explored.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of days during a 6-month period on which each participant used the Purposeful app. Using the app during the day is defined as doing at least one of the following: setting an intention; completing a reflection; completing an action. Usage data will be provided by the Purposeful app.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility assessed by trajectory of usage on a percent of days used on both a weekly and monthly time scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The average percentage of days of app use per week and per month during a 6-month period. Using the app during the day is defined as doing at least one of the following: setting an intention; completing a reflection; completing an action. Usage data will be provided by the Purposeful app.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability assessed by percentage of patients who find the Purposeful app to be acceptable</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A score of 3 or more on the acceptability summary score (assessed using a protocol-specific questionnaire) will indicate that the patient finds the Purposeful app to be acceptable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in life purpose from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months using the Modified Ryff and Keyes Scales of Psychological Well-being evaluation, a 7-item questionnaire that uses a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater purpose in life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) (FACT-O TOI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. FACT-O TOI is a 26-item questionnaire that sums the physical well-being, functional well-being, and additional health concerns with a 7-day recall period. All items will be rated on a 5 items (point) Likert Scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much so). To score the FACT-O TOI, all 26 items will be summed to create a single score with a range from 0 to 104. Items will be reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which a higher score represent a higher quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life assessed using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. The FACIT-fatigue scale is a 13-item patient-reported measure of fatigue with a 7-day recall period. All items will be rated on a 5 items (point) Likert Scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much so). To score the FACIT-fatigue, all 13 items will be summed to create a single fatigue score with a range from 0 to 52. Items will be reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which a higher score represent less fatigue.</description>

    <intervention_name>Use of Purposeful app</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be asked to use the Purposeful app every day, which should take no longer than 5 minutes. The app includes three key components: Explore, Act and Reflect. The Explore section provides thematically organized resources that suggest discrete actions users can try out and potentially incorporate into their lives. The app uses machine learning to customize resources presented to the user. The Act section is where users place actions they'd like to keep track of or build into a habit. Finally, the Reflect section includes daily &quot;reflections&quot; where the patient answers open ended questions regarding their alignment with their best self qualities, their sense of purpose, and more. Depending on whether users choose to allow push notifications, they will be notified daily to complete morning, afternoon, and/or evening reflections.
Participants will complete questionnaires at enrollment and at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment.</description>
