  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of blood and
      platelet transfusions in improving symptoms and quality of life of patients enrolled in
      hospice.

      This is a non-randomized pilot study to investigate the feasibility of symptom-based blood
      transfusion in patients with hematologic malignancies enrolling in hospice care.

      The study will be a case series involving OU Medical Center (OUMC). Patients will be
      identified at the University of Oklahoma/Stephenson Cancer Center (OU-SCC) where
      investigators performing the study will consent and monitor patients. Integris Home Hospice
      agency will provide hospice patients with blood transfusions in those willing to participate,
      and the Oklahoma Blood Institute (OBI) will provide the hospice patients with palliative
      transfusions at home at no cost to the patient, including blood products, transfusion
      testing, infusions and the nursing staff.

      This will be a pilot project including 20 consented patients with hematologic malignancies
      enrolling in hospice through Integris Home Hospice. The transfusions received will be
      determined by the hospice team, and will not be based on objective symptom based guidelines.
      Patients will have the option to either be enrolled on this clinical trial, where they may
      receive home based blood or platelet transfusions, or be enrolled in any other hospice of
      their choosing, including the other hospice that will provide home based transfusions.
      Information will be collected regarding symptoms, Hospice QOL scores and transfusion use,
      reactions, and time in hospice. Data will be collected until death.
