  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare viral infection of the central
      nervous system (CNS) occurring in immunocompromised patients. Recovery of JC virus (JCV)
      specific T cell immune responses is the only available therapeutic option. JCV may use immune
      checkpoint inhibitory pathways to evade immune responses. The aim of this project is to
      determine whether T cell expression of immune checkpoint molecules is correlated to antiviral
      T cell responses, control of JCV replication and PML outcome. Immune checkpoint blockade by
      reversing T cell exhaustion may represent a therapeutic perspective for PML.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PML is a devastating orphan disease of the CNS due to the reactivation of JCV in
      immunocompromised patients. Given the lack of drugs controlling JCV replication, initiation
      of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients or cessation of immunosuppressive
      therapies in others, and subsequent recovery of JCV-specific T cell immune responses remains
      to date the only available therapeutic option. Promoting antiviral immune responses may
      improve the control of viral replication and the outcome of this severe disease. Immune
      checkpoint molecules such as PD-1 are inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells that trigger
      inhibitory signaling pathways, limiting effector immune responses in cancer and chronic
      infections. Immune checkpoint inhibitory pathways implicated in evading immune responses may
      be at play in PML. Immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1, by
      reversing T cell exhaustion, has been suggested as a therapeutic perspective for PML. More
      insights in the dynamics of immune checkpoint molecules expressed by T cells in PML patients
      are needed to pave the way for a therapeutic study.

      The aim here is to determine whether T cell expression of a broad range of immune checkpoint
      molecules, and its dynamics, correlates with the generation of antiviral of immune responses,
      the control of JCV replication and PML outcome.

      To this end the investigators will recruit 15 PML patients from 4 teaching hospitals in the
      South West of France and assess at PML diagnosis and 1, 3 and 6 months after, the expression
      of immune checkpoint molecules on circulating T cells, ex vivo specific immune responses
      against a JCV peptide library, JC viral load in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine, and
      clinical and neuroradiological outcomes.
