  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate endoplasmic reticulum stress in women with recurrent pregnancy loss and those who
      had healthy births in the same age group. The level of the unfolded protein X box binding
      protein 1 (XBP-1) is measured. It is aimed to show the effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress
      on recurrent pregnancy loss.
