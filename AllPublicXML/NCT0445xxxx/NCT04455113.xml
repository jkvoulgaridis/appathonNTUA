  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe sepsis/septic shock complicated by hypophosphatemia are at high risk of
      developing morbidities other than that underlying sepsis and more vulnerable to higher
      mortality rate. Thus, the current study hypothesized that diagnosis and management of
      hypophosphatemia may be advantageous for reduction of morbidity and mortality rates of septic
      patients admitted to ICU

      The current study was started since June 2018 till Jan 2020 after approval of the study
      protocol by the Local Ethical Committee. The study intended to include all patients admitted
      to ICU with or developed severe sepsis or septic shock within 24-hr after admission to ICU.

      All patients admitted to ICU were eligible to evaluation for demographic and clinical data
      including hemodynamic data. Disease severity and its impact on body organs were evaluated
      using acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (APACHE II) (20) and SOFA (18)
      scores. Exclusion criteria included maintenance on immunodepressent therapy for any
      indication, severe hemorrhagic shock, pregnancy and refusal of nearest relative to sign the
      written concept for study participation. Children and adulthoods younger than 18 years and
      patients who were expected to die were also excluded from the study.
