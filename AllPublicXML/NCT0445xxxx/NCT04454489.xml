      combination quad-shot palliative radiotherapy with immunotherapy for
      advanced/recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer.

      Primary Objective: Measure the overall response rate for immunotherapy given with quad-shot
      radiotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  Measure the response rate at the target lesion.

        -  Measure the response rate at non-target sites in patients with non-target sites.

        -  Evaluate the durability of response at the target lesion.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate overall survival.

        -  Assess the tolerability of the combination of quad-shot radiotherapy with immunotherapy
           in order to assess the feasibility of this treatment regimen.

      Exploratory Objective: Evaluate the effect of quad- shot administration on increasing the
      immune activation by treatment with pembrolizumab and investigate possible mechanisms.

    <measure>Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 weeks at cycle 10 (each cycle is 3 weeks) weeks after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response will be measured according to RECIST 1.1 criteria to determine the percentage of participants with either a partial or complete response and the corresponding 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment across all time points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate in the Target Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 weeks at cycle 10 (each cycle is 3 weeks) weeks after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be measured as the following:
Complete: Disappearance (or decrease to the point at which measurement is not possible) of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Progressive Disease: Greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir. When sum becomes very small, increases within measurement error (2-3 mm) can lead to 20% increase.
Stable Disease: Greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir. When sum becomes very small, increases within measurement error (2-3 mm) can lead to 20% increase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate in the Non-Target Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 weeks at cycle 10 (each cycle is 3 weeks) weeks after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be measured using RECIST 1.1:
Complete: Disappearance (or decrease to the point at which measurement is not possible) of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt; 10 mm short axis).
Partial: Non-complete response/Non-progressive disease: Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s).
Progressive Disease: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.
Stable Disease: Greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir. When sum becomes very small, increases within measurement error (2-3 mm) can lead to 20% increase.</description>

    <description>Each cycle of quad-shot radiotherapy will be comprised of 14.8 Gy in 4 fractions (3.7 Gy per fraction) delivered twice daily (at least 6 hours apart) over two consecutive days.
All patients will receive 1 cycle of quad-shot radiotherapy between ICI cycles 2-3.
Subsequent cycles may occur between immunotherapy cycles 6-7 and 11-12, if more than 1 cycle can be safely delivered and the patient has experienced less than a partial response at protocol-specified tumor assessments (after C5 and C10). The eligibility for subsequent cycles will be at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.
Therefore, the total prescription dose will be:
14.8 Gy in 4 fractions for those that complete 1 cycle (all patients will receive 1 cycle)
19.6 Gy in 8 fractions for those that complete 2 cycles
44.4 Gy in 12 fractions for those that complete 3 cycles</description>
