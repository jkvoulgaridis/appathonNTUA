  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the side effects and safety of a combination of the
      anti-IL23 targeting monoclonal antibody tildrakizumab in combination with abiraterone acetate
      in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and to determine the most
      appropriate dose of this combination. In the Phase I part of this study small groups of
      patients will be treated with increasing doses of tildrakizumab in combination with a fixed
      dose of abiraterone acetate(1000mg once daily). Once Phase I has been completed the
      combination with the optimum safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile will be taken
      forward to the Phase II part of the study. The Phase II part of the study will evaluate the
      optimized dose/schedule identified in Phase I of the study in patients with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be divided into 2 parts: Phase I and Phase II. The Phase I study will adopt a
      Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method. Patients will receive single-agent abiraterone 1000
      mg orally, once daily (continuous dosing) along with prednisolone at 5 mg BD for up to 4
      weeks. Upon confirmation of PSA progression, tildrakizumab IV will be started and given once
      every 4-weeks in combination with the fixed dose abiraterone (and prednisolone). The starting
      dose of tildrakizumab will be 100mg with single dose escalations to 300mg and 600mg to
      determine the RP2D to take forward to the Phase II study. Depending on the number of
      responses observed, dose levels that are deemed tolerable may be expanded to up to a total of
      10 patients who are evaluable for response

      The Phase II study will employ a two-stage Minimax design, recruiting up to 25 patients.
      During the first stage 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2
      cycles each. If there are one or more responses confirmed at least 4-weeks later an
      additional 10 evaluable patients will be recruited. If 4 or more responses are seen in the 25
      patients evaluable for response, the combination will be deemed successful, warranting
      further evaluation in subsequent phases of testing. In the phase II study patients will start
      taking 1000mg abiraterone as an oral tablet once daily along with 5mg of prednisolone twice
      daily on Day -28 for the first 4 weeks. Upon confirmation of PSA progression, the
      tildrakizumab will be given as an intravenous infusion at the dose established in the Phase I
      safety run in part of the study in combination with the abiraterone (and prednisolone)from
      Cycle 1 Day 1 onwards.

             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence effective from the first administration of
             any of the study drugs throughout the trial and for six months afterwards. Men with
             partners of child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner
             uses an effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual
             abstinence). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier
             method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of
             the foetus or neonate.

             NB. Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participants. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympathothermal, post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

         25. Prior bone marrow transplant.

         26. Extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone marrow within 8 weeks.

         27. Any other condition, which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.

         28. Symptoms of COVID-19 and/or documented COVID-19 infection
