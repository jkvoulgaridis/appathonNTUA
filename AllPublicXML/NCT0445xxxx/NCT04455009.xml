  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation was to examine the acute effects of consuming two different
      fitness drink formulas on the physiological response at rest and to exercise in healthy men
      and women.

    <textblock>
      Thermogenic fitness drinks containing ~200mg of caffeine have been reported to accelerate the
      metabolism, increase energy, and consequently promote increased fat oxidation. However,
      determination of the efficacy of lower caffeine concentrations may provide additional options
      for individuals with preferences for reduced caffeine intake. Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to evaluate different fitness drink formulas containing a total of 100mg and 140mg
      of caffeine on the physiological response at rest and to exercise.

      This study utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. All participants
      completed three testing visits during which they consumed the placebo, the 100mg caffeine
      formula, and the 140mg caffeine formula. Blood samples, blood pressure, heart rate, resting
      energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, and neurocognitive assessments were collected at
      baseline and repeated 30, 60, and 90 minutes post-ingestion. Immediately following the last
      cognitive assessment, a maximal graded exercise test with gas analysis was conducted on a
      cycle ergometer to evaluate physical performance and maximal fat oxidation during exercise as
      well as the physiological response prior to and following exercise.
