  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase I/IIa dose escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK)
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) trial of BNT151 with expansion cohorts in various solid tumor
      indications. The trial consists of Part 1, Part 2A and Part 2B with adaptive design elements:

      The monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1) of this clinical trial will enroll patients with
      various solid tumors that are metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable for whom there is no
      available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, or patients who are not
      candidates for such available therapy. During combination dose escalation (Part 2A), patients
      of different specific solid tumors (one cohort per indication) will be enrolled and treated
      with a combination of BNT151 and the respective standard of care (SoC) treatment.

      Part 2B is the expansion phase where a predefined number of patients in each indication
      cohort will be treated with the confirmed recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BNT151 in
      combination with respective SoC.
