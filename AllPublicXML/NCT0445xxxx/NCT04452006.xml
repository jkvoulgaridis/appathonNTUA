                  administration. Moreover, it is recommended that women of child-bearing potential
                  partners of male subjects consistently and correctly use for the same period a
                  highly effective method of contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year.

               2. to not donate sperm from (first) study treatment administration up to at least 90
                  days after (last) study treatment administration.

          -  Body temperature in the range of 35.5° to 37.5 °C at Screening and on Day -1 in the
             first period, if applicable.

             (inclusive) with no clinically relevant abnormalities on 12-lead safety ECG after at
             least 5 min in the supine position at Screening and on Day -1 in the first period, if
             applicable.

          -  Normal renal function as confirmed by an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 80
             mL/min/1.73 m2 determined at Screening using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
             Collaboration formula.

        Part A/B:

        - Healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 55 years (inclusive) at Screening.

        Parts C1 to C3 (Adult subjects):

        - Healthy male and female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years (inclusive) at Screening.

        Parts E1 and E2 (Elderly subjects):

        - Healthy male and female subjects aged between 65 and 80 years (inclusive) at Screening.

        Parts C1 to C3, E1 and E2 (Female subjects):

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at

             and for at least 30 days after last study treatment administration) a highly effective
             method of contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, or be sexually inactive,
             or have a vasectomized partner. If a hormonal contraceptive is used, it must have been
             initiated at least 1 month before first study treatment administration.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., postmenopausal [defined as 12 consecutive
             months with no menses without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by an FSH test &gt;
             40 mIU/mL], or with documented previous bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral salpingo
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy, or with premature ovarian failure [confirmed by a
