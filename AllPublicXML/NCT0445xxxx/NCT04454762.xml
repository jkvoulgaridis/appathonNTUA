  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an prospective, interventional, non-randomized multicenter phase II study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Cabozantinib as a second-line therapy (after one
      prior systemic therapy) in patients with intermediate to advanced HCC (BCLC B/C) and
      concomitant impaired liver function CP score B7-8. Subjects who meet all study eligibility
      criteria will receive Cabozantinib 40 mg daily orally. Subjects will receive Cabozantinib as
      long as they continue to experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator or
      until there is unacceptable toxicity or the need for subsequent systemic anti-cancer
      treatment or liver directed local anti-cancer therapy. Treatment may continue in this fashion
      after radiographic progression as long as the Investigator believes that the subject is still
      receiving clinical benefit from Cabozantinib and that the potential benefit of continuing
      Cabozantinib outweighs potential risk. In addition, all subjects will be treated with best
      supportive care. This excludes systemic anti-cancer therapy and liver-directed local
      anti-cancer therapy.

               -  Other clinically significant disorders such as: Active infection requiring
                  systemic treatment, known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or

          9. Subjects with untreated or incompletely treated varices with bleeding or high risk for
             bleeding are excluded with the following clarification: subjects with history of prior
             variceal bleeding must have been treated with adequate endoscopic therapy without any
             evidence of recurrent bleeding for at least 6 months prior to study entry and must be

             beginning at informed consent, for the duration of study participation and for at
             least 4 months after last dose of the study drug. Because oral contraceptives might
             possibly not be considered as &quot;effective methods of contraception&quot; during the
             treatment with Cabozantinib, they should be used together with another method, such as
             a barrier method.

         12. Currently receiving any other investigational agent or received an investigational
             agent within 30 days (or within 5 times the half-life of this agent or its relevant
             metabolites, the longer period will apply) before the first dose of Cabozantinib.

         13. Hepatic encephalopathy Grad I-IV according to CP classification (≥ 2 points) and West
             Haven Criteria

         14. Moderate or severe ascites according to CP classification (≥ 3 points)

         15. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms within 7
