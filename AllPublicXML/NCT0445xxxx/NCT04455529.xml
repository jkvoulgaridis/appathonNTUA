      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics, risk factors
      (such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, history of previous
      stroke, smoking, and alcohol consumption), clinical characteristics in patients with ESUS and
      their medication compliance and relapse within 1 year.

    <description>Medication adherence usually refers to whether patients take their medications as prescribed (eg, twice daily), as well as whether they continue to take a prescribed medication. The Morisky scale, a validated, 4-item self-reported adherence measure that has been shown to be predictive of adherence to cardiovascular medications and blood pressure control. If a patient scores higher on the scale, they are evaluated as more adherent. If they score lower on the scale, they are presumed to be struggling with nonadherence.</description>
