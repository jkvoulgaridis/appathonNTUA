  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) ïs the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide among young people.
      Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients do not influence
      educational achievement and receipt of disability pension, indicating that there are other
      factors such as neurocognitive function that are of importance for maintaining occupational
      and social function. Research has shown that at the group level, cognitive deficits are
      present in euthymic BD patients, while approximately 30%-50% of BD patients is not different
      from healthy controls when it comes to cognitive function. There is however little knowledge
      of risk and resilience factors for cognitive impairment in BD. Factors likely to contribute
      to cognitive and functional outcomes in BD, such as sleep, obesity, biological rhythms,
      comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are also understudied. While it has been
      customary to focus research on factors related to the negative illness trajectories, the
      overarching aim of the current project is to explore factors associated with favourable
      outcomes. This shift in research focus is essential to elucidate factors related to more
      preserved function since this represents a clear gap in knowledge today.

      This is an observational and prospective study aimed at identifying risk and resilience
      factors for cognitive impairment in BD. The investigators will enrol 85 participants with
      bipolar disorder. The assessment period is from one up to two weeks. At inclusion, the
      investigators will examine other psychiatric conditions, known somatic diseases and symptom
      levels of depression and hypo-/mania. Insomnia severity and risk factors for metabolic
      syndrome will also be assessed. Secondly, the investigators will examine sleep and Activity
      extensively with both subjective and objective measures for one to two weeks. Third, a newly
      developed web-based neuropsychological test protocol will be used shortly after assessment of
      sleep and activity to test cognitive function. Fourth, alcohol use, substance use and
      biological rhythms will be assessed. Lastly, the investigators will retest cognitive function
      and symptom levels up to five years after enrolment.
