  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway injury in patients is a high risk and complex medical crisis. Unfortunately, training
      for airway management in injured patients is challenging. The most effective way of
      practicing airway management is using mannequins. However, mannequin training is expensive
      and only occasionally available to medical trainees.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if Virtual Reality (VR) can be used to educate
      medical students on airway injury management. VR training will involve managing the care of a
      patient with an airway injury in an immersive, interactive VR hospital trauma bay. The
      investigators will compare the knowledge gained from VR training vs. mannequin training. The
      investigators will also investigate whether VR training teaches students faster than
      mannequin training. In addition, the investigators will identify factors which might affect
      learning from VR.

      Medical students who choose to participate will be randomized (i.e. participant will have a
      50% chance to be placed in either group) to be trained with VR or a mannequin. Participants
      then will be trained on airway injury management using their assigned training approach. One
      week later, all participants will be assessed on their airway injury management skills using
      a mannequin. Before and after their sessions, participants will also be asked to complete a
      questionnaire on their clinical decision-making. Participants who received VR training will
      also complete a questionnaire about their experience with the VR training.

      This study will help develop a new approach to airway management training which is cheaper
      and more easily available to medical trainees than mannequin training. This educational tool
      could lead to better treatment of airway trauma in future patients.

    <description>Participants will experience a novel interactive and immersive VR full size trauma bay with an adult patient and healthcare professionals. Immersed in the environment, learners undertake the decision-making steps in managing the medical care for a patient with an airway injury. Learners are first given the case scenario from which they form their own learning goals/plans. They then navigate through the scenario that will provide feedback depending on their actions in the form of either the patient's hemodynamic changes or prompts from healthcare avatars in the scenario. These feedback processes are built-in and designed to promote reflection and reorganization of the learner's decision-making strategies. As learning progresses, fewer prompts will be given. At the end of the scenario, evaluation algorithms pre-programmed into the VR-based simulation will be displayed.</description>
