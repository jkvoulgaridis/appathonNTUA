    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics,
      treatment pathway, and effectiveness and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with
      relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin
      in the real-world.
