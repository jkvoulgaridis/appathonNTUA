      The study is performed in Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong
      University School of Medicine . According to inclusion and exclusion criteria ,the
      investigators are expected to enroll 4000 participants who performed endotracheal intubation
      under general anesthesia. All enrolled participants must sign a written informed consent.In
      the preset studio,The 3D face scanner is used to obtain three-dimensional portrait images of
      patients in different positions and from different angles.Then,Statistical experts use
      quantitative software to quantify the data.The investigators will put all the data and images
      into a confidential database in order to build a large database of difficult airways.

      Anesthesiologist will give every patient an endotracheal intubation as planned. After that
      the anesthesiologist will be asked to fill out the questionnaire immediately.This
      questionnaire allows obtaining a ground truth for the intubation difficulty.All data will be
      used for AI deep learning and intelligent analysis,Several of the most relevant landmarks
      will be selected to build an early warning model.The overall study did not involve any
      intervention in the process of anaesthesia and operation of the patients, only the
      three-dimensional facial images of the patients were obtained, without any trauma or injury.
