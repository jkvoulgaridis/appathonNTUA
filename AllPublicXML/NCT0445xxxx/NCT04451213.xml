  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CF is a complex, inherited illness that can affect many organs of the body. The investigators
      have found that some patients with CF have reported more problems with memory than would be
      expected at their age and that patients appear to be using memory strategies to overcome
      memory loss. The investigators intend to objectively test memory and examine MRI images of
      the brain of patients with CF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CF have several potential risk factors which may predispose them to memory
      problems. Because the CF population has historically only been young, this is not something
      that has been focused on. No research has currently identified whether patients with CF have
      a much earlier risk of developing cognitive impairment or how CF impacts on the brain.

      There has not previously been work in this area of CF and the investigators are in a unique
      position with the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) and its expertise
      to be able to perform Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) scans and neurocognitive testing on
      patients with CF for the first time.

    <description>the investigators will acquire structural and functional MRI data at 3T to explore brain health of CF patients compared to control data. Structural MRI will include T1 and T2 weighted anatomical images for group comparisons of brain morphology (volume, cortical thickness). T1 weighted images will also be used as reference images for all other MRI parameters.</description>
