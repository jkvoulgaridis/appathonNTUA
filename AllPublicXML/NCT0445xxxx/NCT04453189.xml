  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple-dose administration
      of lansoprazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-64417184 in healthy adult
      participants; and to evaluate the effect of time-separated, multiple-dose administration of
      famotidine on the single-dose PK of JNJ-64417184 in healthy adult participants (optional).

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>

             screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical and surgical history, and vital
             signs performed at screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening

          -  Must have a normal 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) (triplicate) at screening,
             including: normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute [bpm],

             cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric

             psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Past history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (for example, extrasystoli,
             tachycardia at rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (for
             example, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Any evidence of clinically significant heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection (confirmed by
