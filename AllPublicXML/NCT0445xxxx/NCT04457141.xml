      JUSTIFICATION:

      Urinary incontinence is highly prevalent among women who play high impact sports such as
      running. that observed one of the possible reasons for this high prevalence is delayed
      activation of the pelvic floor in relation to the abdominal muscles.

      The use of minimalist shoes during the race produces changes in muscle and joint biomechanics
      and efficiency in the race. However, to date no studies evaluating the influence of footwear
      in the musculature of the pelvic floor during the race.

      OBJECTIVE: Describe and compare the electromyographic activity of the muscles of the pelvic
      floor and abdominal during the race with conventional shoes and minimalist.

      DESIGN: cross-over study experimental, analytical and prospective. METHODOLOGY: conventional
      and minimalist: 10 healthy young women, randomized into two groups to characterize the
      electromyographic activity of the muscles of the pelvic floor prior and during the race at 9
      km / h with the two types of slippers are included.

      an initial assessment in which it is confirmed that women meet the criteria for inclusion and
      exclusion will be made. the ability to run will be assessed a 10-minute treadmill at a speed
      of 9-13 km / h as well as the ability to properly contract the muscles of the pelvic floor.

      The first group will race with conventional shoes and then minimal, while the second group
      will make the race with minimalist and after conventional shoes. Both groups have a washout
      period of 10 minutes between both interventions.

      EMG recording are collect with electromyographic sensors musculature of the pelvic floor (by
      intravaginal probe germproof brand), abdominal (intern and oblique external oblique), erector
      spinae and gluteal (by surface sensor) in relation to the cycle gear, barographic recorded
      with sensors. The variables to be included in the electromyography for each muscle regarding
      the gait cycle will be, activation start, duration, intensity and synergy with its
      corresponding standard deviation.
