    <textblock>
      This study aims in investigating the effects of a core muscles' strengthening program on core
      muscles' atrophy and contraction ability. Twenty healthy adults recruited and randomly
      assigned to either a 5-week training group developed to activate and strengthen local trunk
      muscles or a control group. The training program includes isometric bridging exercises from
      various positions and dynamic exercises for lumbopelvic stability. Core muscles' thickness
      will be assessed at rest and contracting conditions, prior and after the intervention, using
      ultrasonography.

      A total of 136 male and female adults, members of local gyms, were initially invited for
      participation in the study after giving their written consent. After a second contact with
      the participants, forms regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria were sent for
      completion.

      Of the 136 that initially answered positively for participation, 62 did not meet the
      inclusion criteria, based on their reports and the clinical examination by a health
      professional. Of the remaining 74 participants, 32 were excluded because of previous low back
      pain incidents and other recent musculoskeletal injuries that led to rehabilitation, while 22
      decided to not participate for personal reasons.

      The remaining 20 participants were randomly allocated to either training group or
      intervention group, by a neutral, blinded investigator who had no involvement and was unaware
      of the study purposes. The intervention group will be trained and supervised by a certified
      fitness instructor in a gym class, who will be responsible for the correct execution of the
      exercises. The duration of the intervention will be 5 weeks, 3 times a week.

    <description>The first part of the program aims in pelvic and hip mobility and includes the following exercises, glute bridge, single-leg glute bridge, side-lying clam, side plank and side plank with hip abduction, on stable surface.
The second part consists of exercises for deep and superficial trunk muscles. In the first exercise the participants learn to activate the transversus abdominis muscle from the crook-lying position, by performing abdominal hollow. Other exercises include the front plank, trunk curl-up, trunk curl-up on stable surface and curl-up on unstable surface (Swiss ball).
The third part of the program consists of exercises for strengthening the lumbar multifidus muscle. The participants will perform prone trunk extension, superman exercise, quadruped diagonal arm and leg lift, single leg supine bridge and supine bridge on unstable surface (Swiss ball).</description>
