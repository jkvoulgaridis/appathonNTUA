  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the mechanisms of cognitive-behavioral response to medications
      used for relapse prevention in opioid use disorder (opioid addiction, OUD), through
      investigation of the neural circuits underlying key cognition functions. The study will use
      previously validated cognitive probes, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and
      novel extended-release injectable preparations of opioid partial agonist buprenorphine and
      antagonist naltrexone, in OUD patients to explain the individual heterogeneity of OUD
      treatment response.

      This proposal seeks to identify the neural circuits underlying the cognitive effects of
      medication assisted therapy (MAT) for OUD. The study will examine the neurocognitive effects
      of MAT by comparing two preparations with different pharmacodynamic properties (extended
      release buprenorphine and naltrexone, XRBUP, XRNTX) in three key domains (incentive salience,
      executive functioning, and emotion processing) using task functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI). In the 1st phase of the study, forty treatment-seeking OUD patients will be
      randomized to XRNTX or XRBUP groups after detoxification. Participants will undergo
      medication induction followed by monthly injections and urine toxicology monitoring for 120
      days. Neuroimaging will follow completion of detoxification (pre-treatment) and 15 days after
      the second injection (on-treatment). The second study phase will extend the paradigm to an
      independent sample of 160 additional participants and test the explanatory value of
      MAT-induced changes in the neuroimaging signal in the classification of OUD treatment
      outcomes.

The HAM-A is a 15-minute, 14-item, clinician-administered instrument that measures current anxiety and changes in anxiety symptoms. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <description>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (Hamilton, 1959 #2497). The HAM-D is a 20-minute, 24-item interview that measures the severity of depression and changes in depressive symptoms. HAM-D form includes 21 items, however the scoring is based on the first 17. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2. The HAM-D score level corresponds to the clinical severity of depression as follows: 10 - 13 mild; 14-17 mild to moderate; &gt;17 moderate to severe.</description>
