  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current anti-diabetic treatment fails to stop the progressive course of the disease. Recent
      studies have revealed a surprisingly high variability in the diabetic phenotype. The
      investigators propose that anti-diabetic treatment should ideally target the underlying
      pathophysiology of each individual patient. The investigators will therefore test whether the
      effect of two approved anti-diabetic drugs differs between individuals at different ends of
      the pathophysiological spectrum: 1) patients with poor insulin secretion, here termed SIDD
      and 2) patients with high insulin resistance, here termed SIRD. The study may open up a new
      avenue for more precise treatment of diabetic patients that would be of immediate clinical
      relevance.

      The trial is a clinical phase II study that will be randomized and open-label with fixed
      stratification variables (SIDD and SIRD) to analyze if the response to anti-diabetic drugs
      differs between patients with distinct pathophysiology, as captured by SIDD and SIRD. The
      compounds used are semaglutide and dapagliflozin, which will be randomized to patients of
      each subgroup using a parallel group design.

      The clusters (SIDD and SIRD) will be used as a practical tool to distinguish individuals who
      are at different ends of the pathophysiological spectrum.

      The investigators will recruit 200 patients from the ANDIS registry with HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol
      on metformin monotherapy. Half of them will have SIDD and half will have SIRD
      characteristics. The patients will be randomized (open-label) to receive semaglutide or
      dapagliflozin for six months in addition to metformin.

      The investigators will recruit participants on metformin monotherapy with stable dose for the
      last three months. Metformin dose at inclusion (as prescribed by their regular physician) is
      maintained throughout the study; the investigatorswill correct for metformin dose in the
      analyses. Patients randomized to add semaglutide will receive injection training at the study
      site and inject 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly during the first four weeks, followed by
      0.5 mg weekly for the subsequent four weeks and finally 1.0 mg weekly throughout the study.
      Those randomized to dapagliflozin will receive 10 mg orally once daily in addition to
      metformin. The participants will attend a screening visit followed by three study visits at
      0, 3, 6 months. At the first and last study visit they will undergo an OGTT. HbA1c will be
      measured at all study visits.
