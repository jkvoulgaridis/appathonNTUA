  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, Bladder Traininhg (BT) and Magnetic stimulation (MS) are frequently
      used together in the treatment of women with idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB). Up to our
      knowledge, there is no study evaluating the combined effect of magnetic stimulation and
      bladder training in women with idiopathic OAB in the literature. Moreover, there is no
      recommendation on conservative treament combinations in the guidelines due to insufficient
      data. At this stage, studies are needed to determine whether it will be effective to use MS
      in combination with other conservative treatment options. In addition, in the light of our
      clinical experience, we think that this issue is still open for research. In our study,
      adding MS to BT in women with idiopathic AAM is thought to contribute additionally to the
      efficacy of treatment with BT.

      Our study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial that compares the efficacy of
      BT and BT plus MS in women with idiopathic OAB. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
      efficacy of MS added to BT on incontinence-related QoL and clinical parameters in women with
      idiopathic OAB.

      This study is a prospectively randomized, controlled trial. The trial is held at
      Urogynecological Rehabilitation Unit of XXXX, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department
      between September 2020 and November 2021. The local ethics committee approve the study
      (approvel no: 60116787-020/37878). Patients are informed about the purpose and contents of
      the study and all women give written consent to participate.

      By using a random number generator, all patients which included the study were randomized
      into two groups as follows: The Group 1 received BT program alone, the Group 2 received BT
      plus MS.

      Group 1: Bladder Training (BT) - Control group All women were informed about BT for 30
      minutes. Then it was given as a written brochure to be implemented as a home program.

      BT, consisting of four stages, did not contain any PFMT programs in two groups.

      Group 2: BT plus MS Patients are told to sit on the chair with a magnetic coil below the
      chair. When a volume conductor is in serted by this magnetic ﬁeld, an eddy current ﬂow is
      generated. This eddy current stimulates nerve or muscle of the pelvic ﬂoor. To apply MS, the
      device was set to generate its maximum stimuli, with a stimulation pulse width of 200 μs and
      a stimulation repetition cycle of 10 Hz in accordance with the literature (10,13-15). When
      setting the device at each treatment session, patients were interviewed so that they received
      stimuli at the maximum stimulation intensity (maximum tolerable stimulation intensity) (10).
      MS was applied two days a week, 20 minutes a day, a total of 12 sessions for 6 weeks. MS
      sessions were performed by other physician.

    <description>BT, consisting of four stages, did not contain any PFMT programs in all groups. In these stages, including urgency supression strategies, it was aimed to delay urination, to inhibit detrusor contraction and to prevent urgency; by squeezing the PFM several times in a row (women were encouraged to pause/stop their work, sit down if possible, relax the entire body and squeeze PFM repeatedly), breathing deeply, giving their attention to another job for a while and self-motivating (I can do it, I can check the urination, etc.).</description>
