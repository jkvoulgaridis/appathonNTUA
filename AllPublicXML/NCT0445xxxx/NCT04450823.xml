      Introduction: Recently, the devastating consequences of neglected surgical care in global
      health became apparent with an estimated five billion people lacking access to safe surgical
      and anesthesia care. Traditionally, short-term surgical missions were the predominant
      strategy how surgical care was supported in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Although
      surgical missions have been criticized in recent literature they are still being performed on
      a large scale. The aim of this study is to provide recommendations for persons and
      organizations involved in surgical mission on how to strengthen surgical care in LMICs in the
      future.

      Method: An online survey was developed for members of foreign teams and local team members
      from LMICs. Data was collected on 5 topics, consisting of: 1) basic characteristics of the
      missions, 2) main activities, 2) follow-up and reporting, 3) the local registration process
      for foreign teams and 4) collaboration with local stakeholders.
