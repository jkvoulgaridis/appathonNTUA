  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged daily sedentary time is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases,
      impaired physical function, and mortality. Older adults are more sedentary than any other age
      group and those in assisted living residences accumulate even more sedentary time as they
      often have little need to engage in light-intensity or standing activities such as cleaning
      or meal preparation. This &quot;low movement&quot; environment can hasten functional decline. Thus, the
      purpose of this study was to develop a multi-level intervention to reduce and interrupt
      sedentary time within assisted living residences and conduct a pilot study to determine if
      the intervention is feasible and if further testing is warranted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a voluntary single-arm uncontrolled trial in assisted living residences. Pre- and
      post- intervention assessments will be conducted over two sessions; the intervention period
      is 6 weeks.

      First session:

      In the first session participants will complete informed consent, compete all questionnaires,
      and be fitted with the active PALs for measuring sedentary time. This should take
      approximately 30-60 minutes. The second session will be 7 days later, and the investigators
      will retrieve the ActivPAL inclinometer and then complete the Short Performance Physical
      Battery. This should take 20-30 minutes. Health-related quality of Life will be assessed
      using the Euro Quality of Life 5 dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D). This is a generic health
      status questionnaire (i.e. it is not disease specific) and consists of a descriptive system
      and a visual analogue scale (VAS). Five dimensions are included: mobility, self-care, usual
      activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. It is widely used and has good
      reliability. General Quality of Life will be assessed using the ICEpop CAPability measure for
      Older people (ICECAP-O). The ICECAP-O has a broad view of quality of life and covers the
      domains of attachment (love and friendship), security (thinking about the future without
      concern), role (doing things that make participants feel valued), enjoyment (enjoyment and
      pleasure), and control (independence). Both questionnaires are attached and the estimated
      time for completion is about 10 minutes.Sedentary time will be with an activPAL4™
      inclinometer and the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) self-report sedentary
      behaviour questionnaire. The activPAL4™ device is enclosed in a nitrile sleeve and secured to
      the thigh using medical tape. Skin will be monitored for irritation. Both the finger cots and
      the nitrile sleeves are single use. The activPAL4™ inclinometers are only 9 grams and 5mm
      thick, making them comfortable for 7-day wear on the thigh. Using proprietary algorithms and
      software, it classifies an individual's free-living activity into periods spent sleeping,
      sitting, standing and ambulating as well as step counts, activity start time and activity
      duration. This allows for quantification of these movement behaviours over 24 hours. The unit
      will be worn for 7 days to determine the pre-intervention movement profile. Mid-way through
      the 7 day period researchers will check in with participants to ensure there are no problems.
      These devices have been used extensively with older adults in previous research.

      The LASA sedentary behavior questionnaire is moderately associated with
      accelerometer-measured sedentary time (r=.46) and reliably ranks sedentary time in older
      adults. While self-report tools underestimate total sedentary time, they provide valuable
      information about the context (eg. where or with whom) and type (eg. reading or watching TV)
      of sedentary behaviours, which will be valuable for evaluating the intervention. (See
      attachments for a copy of the questionnaire).

      Second Session:

      Blood pressure in mmHg and heart rate in beats per minute will be measured at rest in a
      seated position. If Blood Pressure exceeds 160/90 mmHg or heart rate exceeds 99 beats per
      minute, the participants will not complete the SPPB described below. These will be measured
      using an automated sphygmomanometer. Height in centimetres and weight in kilograms will be
      measured using an electronic scale and stadiometer.Participants will be asked to refrain from
      smoking or consuming caffeine for 2 hours before the appointment and avoid exercise or
      strenuous physical activity the day of the assessment. The Short Performance Physical Battery
      (SPPB) will be used to assess physical function. The SPPB is an objective assessment tool for
      evaluating lower extremity functioning in older persons and it includes assessments of gait
      speed, standing balance, and timed chair rises (see attachment for details). It was developed
      by the National Institute on Aging and has been shown to have high validity and reliability
      in measuring physical function in older adults. The participants will also measure grip
      strength by having participants grasp a hand grip dynamometer and squeezing as hard as
      possible, with each hand. The entire battery of tests will be conducted in a circuit format
      and will take ≤20 minutes to complete.

    <description>Sedentary time in minutes per day will be assessed with the activPAL4™ inclinometer which measures movement patterns and body posture 24 hours/day and can monitor body positions, making them useful for measuring sedentary time. activPALs have been found to be valid and reliable in comparison to direct observation (R2 = 0.94). The activPAL4s were waterproofed using a nitrile sleeve and affixed to the thigh using Tegaderm (3M Medical, USA).</description>

    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an objective assessment tool for evaluating lower extremity functioning in older adults and it includes assessments of gait speed (4 m walk), standing balance (side by side, semi-tandem, and tandem), and 5 timed chair rises. The SPPB has been shown to have good predictive and concurrent validity and reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient &gt; 0.70) in measuring physical function in older adults and is also predictive of mobility impairment. A maximum score of 12 represents good physical function.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life measured by the EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, along a five-point scale (no problems, slight problems, moderate, severe, and unable to do the action/extreme). These questions create a health state which will be translated to a summary index value using the Crosswalk Index Value Calculator (US values, euroqol.org). A value of 1 represents the best possible health state, with health states diminishing as they approach zero. It also includes a visual analogue scale for overall health anchored between 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable). The EQ-5D-5L has a discriminatory power of 0.68 and a test-retest reliability of 0.69.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported time spent in sedentary behaviour measured by the LASA Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire estimates self-reported sedentary time by asking participants about time (hours:minutes) spent in 10 sitting behaviours on an average weekday or weekend day. The questionnaire has a test-retest reliability of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57-0.81) but may underestimate total sedentary time by as much as 2.1 hours. The six domains of napping, reading, listening to music, watching TV, engaging in seated hobbies, and talking to friends had the highest correlation with device-measured sedentary time. Thus, the investigators will only include these six domains when calculating self-reported sedentary time.</description>

    <description>Intervention strategies can be customized to different environments based on consultation with management. Some strategies will be mandatory:
Education session: group information session during the first week of the intervention (30min) to discuss sedentary time (ST), health risks, strategies to reduce ST, goal setting, &amp; the identification of barriers and motivators to reducing ST. Group discussion will be encouraged to increase self-motivation and self-efficacy. An information &quot;workbook&quot; will be given to each attendee for their personal use and goal setting.
Point of decision prompts (ie: signs that encourage standing; see attachments) will be placed in common areas of the facility, and/or given as pamphlets to residents.
An intervention package will be provided to the Activity Coordinator and Manager of the facility. This package will provide an introductory letter along with materials to promote reduced sedentary time in the facility</description>
