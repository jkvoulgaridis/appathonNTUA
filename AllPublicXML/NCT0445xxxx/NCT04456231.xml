  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting for colonoscopy at one of the participating centers will be asked to
      participate in the present study after careful evaluation of inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Before inclusion, all patients have to sign the written informed consent. All
      participating patients will receive PLENVU, a well-known and approved bowel preparation
      agent. Patients are randomly assigned in two groups. Patients in group 1 are informed in
      traditional way on how to use the bowel preparation agent. This way includes discussion with
      the physician and nurse on how to use the bowel preparation agent and a written
      documentation, highlighting the individual steps again. Patients in group 2 will receive in
      addition a QR-code referring to an App, available for free in all App stores, explaining to
      the patient in detail when and how to use the bowel preparation agent. The patient is
      receiving the same questionnaire (please see attached) in both groups and asked to bring the
      filled form on the day of the examination. Endoscopy is performed in standard way and
      effectiveness of the bowel preparation is specifically highlighted by the physician on the
      documentation report. Finally, data is analyzed regarding effectiveness of the QR code
      regarding patient satisfaction, acceptability and quality of the bowel preparation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient education is of paramount importance for high acceptance and an adequate bowel
      preparation. Using the QR code directly referring to the App for bowel preparation with
      PLENVU might accelerate the discussion between the medical doctor and the patient and might
      also improve the acceptance rate of the patients for the bowel preparation finally leading to
      a more enhanced and effective bowel-preparation.

      Patients undergoing screening or surveillance endoscopy will be prospectively included and
      randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Group 1: App; Group 2: no-App Study end
      points addressed below are prospectively assessed and evaluated for any significant changes.
