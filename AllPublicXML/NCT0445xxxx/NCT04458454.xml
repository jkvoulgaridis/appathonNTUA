  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluated the effect of serum relaxin and follicular fluid levels on the number and
      quality of oocytes, fertilization, the number and quality of the embryos in IVF protocols.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relaxin is one of the promising indicators of oocyte quality and prognosis of the
      effectiveness of invitro fertilization protocols. The hormone plays an important role in the
      processes of folliculogenesis, growth and maturation of oocytes, development of embryos,
      implantation processes, pregnancy and childbirth. A pilot study was conducted on a group of
      patients undergoing infertility treatment using assisted reproductive technologies in the
      superovulation stimulation protocol using gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonists. Blood
      and follicular fluid samples were obtained on the day of transvaginal follicular puncture.
      The results allow us to consider the hormone relaxin as a promising predictor of the result
      of ovarian stimulation, the effectiveness of fertilization in IVF cycles.

    <description>The level of relaxin in follicular fluid was estimated using an ELISA Kit for Relaxin 2. The range of detectable concentrations was 3.1-500 pg / ml. Higher relaxin concentrations in follicular fluid are associated with a higher number of oocytes obtained.</description>

    <time_frame>10-14 days from the start of stimulation in the IVF protocol for relaxin. The first day after transvaginal follicular puncture for evaluation oocyte fertilization efficiency.</time_frame>
    <description>The level of relaxin in follicular fluid was estimated using an ELISA Kit for Relaxin 2. The range of detected concentrations was 3.1-500 pg / ml. In course of standard IVF technique the fertilization efficacy was evaluated as a ratio of double pro-nucleus zygote on the 1st day of development to obtained oocyte-cumulus complexes number. In course of ICSI the efficacy was estimated as ratio of double pro-nucleus zygote on the 1st day of development to oocyte number on MII stage on puncture day. Higher concentrations of follicular fluid relaxin are associated with a decrease efficacy of oocyte fertilization</description>

    <description>Ovarian stimulation was carried out from day 3 of the menstrual cycle using a fixed protocol, with recombinant (Gonal-F, Pergoveris) or human menopausal gonadotropins (Meriofert), GnRH antagonist (ganirelix 0.25 mg). A recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin Ovitrel 250 Î¼g or a GnRH agonist, Diferelin 0.2 mg, was used as an ovulation trigger.</description>
