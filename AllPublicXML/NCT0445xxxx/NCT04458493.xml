  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized into two groups, one group will be the control (no
      intervention at all) and the other will be CHO-PRO (meal replacement, Generation UCAN
      supplement, 400ml, 20% solution). Prior to the start of the experiment, all participants will
      be asked to record their satiety ratings, appetite and desire to eat (10-point visual
      analogue scale) 30, 60 and 120 minutes after their regular dinner for 3 days. On the first
      day of the experiment, all participants will be asked to measure their waist and hip
      circumferences, fasting blood glucose level, maximal number of pushups and body weight using
      a scale at home prior to breakfast. Instructions on how to do the measurements properly will
      be recorded in a video and distributed to the participants. Participants in the control group
      will not receive any intervention. Participants in the CHO-PRO group will be provided with
      the supplement and they will be asked to consume the CHO - protein supplement (Generation
      UCAN supplement, 250ml, 10% solution) 6 to 7 hours after lunch, in place of their dinner for
      6 weeks. They will also be asked to record their satiety ratings, appetite and desire to eat
      (10-point visual analogue scale) 30, 60 and 120 minutes after each meal replacement drink.
      All participants will be required to complete a dietary record, prior to, and during (at
      weeks 2 and 4) intervention. To track adherence of the CHO-PRO group, participants will be
      asked to check off the calendar that they did not consume the meal replacement due to various
      reasons. On day 43, all participants will be asked measure again waist and hip
      circumferences, fasting blood glucose level, maximal number of pushups and body weight using
      a scale at home prior to breakfast again.
