      The purpose of this study is to evaluate methods to modify blood pressure in humans and
      measure the effectiveness of such methods. A secondary outcome is to evaluate the performance
      of an investigational continuous non-invasive blood pressure (cNIBP) device created by
      Sensifree. The tests will per performed in non-hospitalized subjects under varied controlled
      conditions that include resting blood pressure and non-pharmacologically induced blood
      pressure changes.

      On a first visit a screening procedure to verify inclusion / exclusion criteria are met will
      be conducted. On the primary procedure visit, data collection will begin with the subjects
      having the investigational device, ECG sensors, and 1 or more pulse oximetry sensors placed
      on them for data collection and to monitor their safety for the duration of the study. A
      physician will place an arterial line in the radial artery. The Sensifree cNIBP system will
      be calibrated with an oscillometric and/or auscultatory blood pressure cuff measurement taken
      on the arm opposite the arterial line.

      A series of blood pressure changes will be induced, including various combinations of
      methods.
