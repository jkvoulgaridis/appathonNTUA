  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited research on the amount of calories burned and metabolic differences of a
      complete supplemental meal in comparison to a whole food meal. The purpose of this study is
      to analyze the differences in calories burned and metabolic response post-consumption of a
      meal consisting of whole foods compared to its nutritionally engineered equivalent. We
      hypothesize that energy expenditure and satiety will be greater in the whole food meal
      compared to the supplement meal, whereas, there will be no difference in levels of glucose
      between the two conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 50% of U.S. adults today use some form of dietary supplementation to obtain their
      nutrient intake (Bailey et al., 2011). Previous research has shown that certain nutritional
      supplements may produce varying metabolic and thermogenic (calories burned) responses, when
      compared to other food sources (Acheson et al., 2011). The difference in thermogenic response
      may also suggest that there is a difference between a whole food meal and its supplemental
      equivalent. If there is a difference in thermogenic response, this may indicate that a
      meal-replacing supplement, such as a ready-to-drink-shake and/or food bar may not induce the
      same health benefits as a whole food meal in terms of nutrient digestion, absorption,
      metabolism and storage. There has not been extensive research on the thermic effect and
      metabolic differences of a complete supplemental meal in comparison to a whole food meal. The
      purpose of our study is to analyze the differences in thermogenic and metabolic response
      post-consumption of a meal consisting of whole foods compared to its supplemental, engineered
      equivalent. We hypothesize that energy expenditure and satiety will be greater in the whole
      food meal compared to the supplement meal, whereas, there will be no difference in levels of
      glucose between the two conditions.

    <description>The total amount of calories burned after each meal will be measured using indirect calorimetry with the ventilated hood technique. Following meal ingestion, participants will rest quietly for 2 hours during which time their resting energy expenditure will be measured every other 15 minutes for 15 minutes. For example, they will have their resting energy expenditure measured during minutes 15-30, 45-60, 75-90 105-120 following meal ingestion.</description>
