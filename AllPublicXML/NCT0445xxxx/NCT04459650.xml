      Participants who enroll in this study will undergo the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) study
      treatment. Participants will have a sample of blood collected and the platelets will be
      separated and then injected into half of the participants' scalp every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the is the relative density in scalp hair at week 12compared to baseline (week 0) between treatment and observation sides of the scalp. The study investigator will use the 7-point GAS (−3 = greatly decreased, −2 = moderately decreased, −1 = slightly decreased, 0 = no change, +1 = slightly increased, +2 = moderately increased, and +3 = greatly increased) to evaluate relative differences in hair density.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive PRP obtained with PRP harvesting kits on one side of the scalp and no injections on the other side of the scalp (split-scalp technique). The entire half of the intended scalp will receive inter-follicular injections of PRP under aseptic conditions at the amount of 0.05-0.1 ml/cm2 in a retrograde fashion from deep to superficial, at every centimeter throughout the treated site. For study purposes, Study Day 0 is defined as the first day of injection. Subsequently the patient will continue therapy every 4 weeks for a total of 3 injections (12 weeks).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women between the ages of 18 and 60 years old.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of endocrine therapy induced alopecia (EIA) for breast
             cancer:

               -  Selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen, toremifene)

               -  Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane)

               -  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide)

        OR

          -  Must have a clinical diagnosis of chemotherapy induced (pCIA) alopecia with incomplete
             or absent regrowth of hair &gt; 3 months after completion of chemotherapy without use of
             endocrine cancer-related therapy (ET) within the last 6 months

          -  Ludwig stage 1-3 for women

          -  History of use of topical minoxidil and/or systemic spironolactone for alopecia for at
             least three consecutive months

          -  Completed informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  History of hair transplantation

          -  Use of any cosmetic product aimed at improving or correcting the signs of hair loss
             within 2weeks prior to screening. Note: patients are not permitted to use any hair
             loss products during the study.

          -  An active scalp dermatologic condition (e.g. alopecia areata, scalp psoriasis), scalp
             skin cancer (e.g. BCC, SCC), a pre-existing condition with sequelae on the scalp (e.g.
             scarring alopecia) or acute infection.

          -  Hereditary or acquired hematologic/coagulation disorders such as: platelet dysfunction
             syndrome, critical thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;150,000
             platelets/ul),hypofibrinogenemia, impaired coagulation, drepanocytosis (sickle cell
             anemia).

          -  Actively receiving anticoagulant medication

          -  Patients taking Aspirin or other NSAIDs such as Nurofen, Voltaren, Diclofenac or
             Naproxen, or fish-oil supplements because of its anti-platelet activity, can
             participate, provided medication is interrupted 7 days before beginning of the
             treatment.

          -  Planned or previous radiation therapy to the brain

          -  Vulnerable populations e.g. decisionally impaired (cognitive, psychiatric) or patients
             who, in the opinion of the investigator have a condition that precludes their ability
             to provide an informed consent
