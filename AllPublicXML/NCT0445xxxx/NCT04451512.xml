  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who met the criteria for removal of 10-19mm colorectal polyps using cold snare or
      hot snare were included in the study, signed by endoscopic treatment written informed consent
      for surgery, patients with detailed tracking and record the basic information and information
      related to the operation, postoperative lack of region and edge endoscopic observation
      carefully no residue, additional excision may be took if necessary，after resection specimen
      inspection, and in 6 months review colonoscopy, assess whether there is residual or
      recurrence of polyps.Main outcome: technical success rate (no other auxiliary resection),
      complete resection rate, secondary outcome: intraoperative and postoperative complications,
      polypectomy time and related costs, influential factors of incomplete resection.Research
      significance: The effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of cold and hot snare
      resection of 10-19mm colorectal polyps were compared, and the influencing factors of
      incomplete polyps resection were analyzed, so as to provide evidence for the decision on the
      best method of medium-size polyps resection.
