    <textblock>
      Patients who have completed the Part2 of JR-171-101 study and fulfill all eligibility
      criteria can be enrolled in this JR-171-102 study. Until the dose determination in the
      JR-171-102 study, subjects will intravenously receive either low dose or high dose of JR-171
      at the same doses received at Week 12 of the JR-171-101 study. Thereafter, all subjects will
      be transitioned to the optimal dose determined based on the results of JR-171-101 study. This
      JR-171-102 study will be continued until the product launch.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have completed the Part 2 of JR-171-101 study

          -  A patient from whom written informed consent can be obtained. If the patient is aged
             under 18 years (20 years in case of Japan) at the time of assent or willingness to
             participate in the study cannot be confirmed due to MPS I-related intellectual
             disability, informed permission from the patient's legally acceptable representative
             (e.g., his/her parents or guardians) need to be obtained instead of his/her consent.
             Even in this case, written informed consent should be obtained from the patient,
             wherever possible

          -  Female patient or male patient whose co-partners are of child-bearing potential agree
             to use a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient who is unable to perform the study procedures, except for 6-minute walk
             test, neurocognitive testing, BVMT-R, HVLT-R, and T.O.V.A.

          -  Judged by the principal investigator or subinvestigator as being unable to undergo
             lumbar puncture, including those who have difficulties in taking a position for lumbar
             puncture due to joint contracture or those who are likely to experience difficulty
             breathing during the lumbar puncture process

          -  Judged by the principal investigator or subinvestigator to be ineligible to
             participate in the study due to a history of a serious drug allergy or sensitivity

          -  Otherwise judged by the principal investigator or subinvestigator to be ineligible to
             participate in the study in consideration of patient's safety
