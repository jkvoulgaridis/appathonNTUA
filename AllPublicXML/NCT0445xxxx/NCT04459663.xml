  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open, single-center clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      JS001 combined with Axitinib in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer without
      activated EGFR mutation, ALK fusion and ROS fusion after or during first-line chemotherapy.
      About 50 subjects will be included in this study and will be treated with JS001 combined with
      acitinib. Each cycle is 21 days.
