      The purpose of this study is to assess functional, imaging, and safety outcomes of the SOFIA®
      Flow Plus 6F Aspiration Catheter when used with the direct aspiration as first line treatment
      technique for the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior
      circulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, observational study. The primary objective
      is to determine proportion of subjects achieving successful revascularization with the SOFIA®
      Flow Plus 6F Aspiration Catheter when used in conjunction with the direct aspiration as first
      line treatment technique for patients with AIS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 21 and &lt; 80 years of age.

          -  Patient has a pre-morbid mRS ≤ 1.

          -  Neuroimaging (CT/CTA and/or MR/MRA collected at no more than 60 minutes pre-treatment)
             demonstrates large vessel proximal occlusion (distal ICA through MCA bifurcation).

          -  Patient has an NIHSS score ≥ 5 at time of intervention.

          -  Symptom onset is within 6 hours of when groin puncture can be achieved.

          -  Patient is appropriate for treatment via femoral access.

          -  Patient is considered by the treating physician to be treatable using the direct
             aspiration as first line treatment technique.

          -  Patient or patient's legally authorized representative (LAR) has provided written
             informed consent.

          -  Patient is considered by the treating physician to be available for and able to
             complete all follow-up visits with a trained site investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to obtain written informed consent.

          -  Patient is &lt; 21 or ≥ 80 years of age.

          -  Patient has a pre-morbid mRS ≥ 2.

          -  More than 6 hours have passed since symptom onset.

          -  Severe unilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenosis or dissection requiring stent
             treatment.

          -  Presence of a pre-existing large territory infarction.

          -  Absent femoral pulses or other condition preventing femoral access.

          -  Patient has vascular anatomy/tortuosity or other vascular disease preventing access to
             the target occlusion or that will likely result in unstable access.

          -  Patient is pregnant.

          -  Known or suspected pre-existing/chronic large vessel occlusion in the symptomatic
             territory.

          -  Patient has known, untreatable hypersensitivity to contrast dye, iodine or any
             component of the treatment device that cannot be medically controlled.

          -  The intracranial occlusion is suspected to be chronic based past imaging, clinical
             history, or clinical judgment.

          -  Patient has a severe or life-threatening comorbidity that could confound study
             results, or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.

          -  Patient is unable to complete scheduled follow-up assessments due to comorbidities,
             geographical limitations, or a life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Patient is enrolled in another device or drug study in which participation could
             confound study results.

          -  Imaging (CT or MR) exclusion criteria:

               1. Presence of intracerebral hemorrhage as evidenced on initial imaging

               2. Ischemic changes in the posterior circulation territories (including the
                  vertebra-basilar and posterior cerebral arteries)

               3. Significant mass effect with midline shift

               4. Evidence of intracranial tumor

               5. Baseline ischemic core lesion &gt;50 cc

               6. Involvement of &gt; 1/3 of the middle cerebral artery territory

               7. ASPECTS &lt;6 (hemispheric sulcal effacement and/or loss of grey-white
                  differentiation alone are not contraindications for treatment)
