  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Asthma, the levels of exhaled FeNO is correlated to sputum eosinophils particularly in the
      patient with poor controlled asthma or severe asthma. Moreover, the blood eosinophils had
      been studied that are also correlated to sputum eosinophils in similar patients group.
      According to well controlled asthma, althoug hin clinical practice guidelines recommend that
      the stepping down therapy should be considered to those patients due to the risks or costs of
      daily treatment, there is previous study has been shown that the airway hyperresponsiveness
      and sputum eosinophilia are predictors of loss of control during dose reduction. And, these
      tests are not readily available in primary care. However, there is limit number of clinical
      study to study the correlation of biologic markers among the patients with well controlled
      level before the stepping down management.

      This is a single prospective trial. Enrollment will continue until 50 patients with well
      controlled asthma have been entered into this trial and have completed blood tests and
      spirometry. In this trial, the following parameters are to be evaluated:

      Blood eosinophils (absolute and relative) FeNO Pulmonary lung function test: FEV1, FVC, PF,
      MMEF 25-75%, % reversibility
