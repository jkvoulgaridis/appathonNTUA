  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal: The long-term goal of the proposed research program is to test the effectiveness of a
      preventative behavioral intervention and to scale it up for use with broader immigrant
      populations to reduce stress and mental health disorders.

      Intervention: This study plan to adapt the World Health Organization developed Problem
      Management Plus (PMP), an evidence based, multi-component, behavioral intervention including
      breathing, problem solving, behavioral activation, and social support for immigrants.

      Hypothesis: Immigrants in the Problem Management Plus for Immigrants (PMP-I) will have
      significantly lower levels of stress and anxious/depressive symptoms as compared to
      immigrants in the talk program with Community Support Service pamphlets (CSS).

      Objective: The current study aims to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of PMP-I
      among Bhutanese immigrants 18 years and older living in the Massachusetts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problem Management Plus (PMP) is a low-intensity evidence-based psychological intervention
      developed by World Health Organization that can be delivered by trained lay people. PMP
      systematically teaches four strategies: stress management through breathing exercises,
      problem solving, behavioral activation, and skills to strengthen social support at individual
      level. The current study plans to adapt PMP to develop the PMP for Immigrants (PMP-I) for a
      family setting to address immigrant's multiple social and emotional stressors while adjusting
      into the new multi-cultural environment of the United States. The rationale to adapt PMP is
      based on our intervention model that demands integration of social and emotional stressors;
      promising results of PMP; strong evidence of family and community ties in health care
      process; and growing consensus among community, scientists, and policymakers on the need for
      family-based care models that are sustainable. PMP-I is a 5-week, peer-led, culturally
      tailored mental health promotion program that includes psychoeducation, behavioral
      activation, and problem solving (90 minutes/session/weekly), and breathing exercises and yoga
      (90 minutes/session/weekly) in a family setting. Participating families will be randomly
      allocated into two groups (N=116 families; 58 families per intervention (PMP-I) and control
      (CSS)) with assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention with
      trained community facilitators in collaboration with church leaders.

    <description>The 10-item Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) will be used to assess perceived stress at baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week post-intervention. The PSS uses a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 0, &quot;never&quot; to 4, &quot;very often&quot;) to assess psychological stress experienced during the past four weeks, including the extent to which situations felt unpredictable, uncomfortable, and overwhelming.</description>
