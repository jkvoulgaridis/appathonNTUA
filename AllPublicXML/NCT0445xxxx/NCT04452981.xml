  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is known to be one of the most common health concerns in in the general population
      and has been associated with several health consequences. Medications are known to be
      effective, and currently serve as the primary treatment for insomnia but their use is limited
      due to the risk of adverse events. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-1) has also been shown
      to be effective and safer in the treatment of insomnia but presents its own limitations such
      as the time, cost, and training required. The relationship between vestibular stimulation and
      sleep continues to be explored, however its usefulness in the treatment of insomnia is still
      unknown. Vestibular stimulation itself has been shown to be safe across multiple populations.
      If vestibular stimulation is shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia, it could
      serve as a safer alternative to medications. It could also require less cost, time, and
      training than CBT-1, providing a treatment option that is not only safe and effective, but
      broadly available to the general population. Consequently this trial seeks to evaluate the
      efficacy of non-invasive electrical vestibular nerve stimulation as a method of improving
      sleep quality and quantity, as compared to a sham control, in patients newly diagnosed with
      insomnia.

    <description>The active device utilizes a technology called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) (sometimes termed vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS)). The device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones and will deliver a small electrical current to the skin behind the ears, over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The sham device looks identical to the active device and interacts with the app in a similar manner to the active device. However, it does not deliver vestibular stimulation to users. The device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones with hydrogel electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. Males or females.

          3. 22-80 years of age inclusive on starting the study. (In order to comply with FDA
             guidance:
             https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm08
             9740.htm#s6)

          4. Ability and willingness to complete all study visits and procedures; in particular an
             agreement to engage with: trying to use the device on a daily basis

          5. Agreement not to use prescription, or over the counter, sleep medications for the
             duration of the trial.

          6. Access to Wi-Fi (to connect iPod to internet)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently being treated for diagnosed insomnia (new cases only).

          2. History of vestibular dysfunction or other inner ear disease as indicated by the
             screening questions.

             affecting the skin behind the ears.

          4. Previous diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS (HIV is known to cause a vestibular
             neuropathy which would prevent VeNS from working).

          5. Use of beta-blockers within 1 month of starting the study.

    <ipd_description>Data will be transferred in an encrypted PDF format. Trial staff will be given direction on how to share the trial data and given access to one specific section of a controlled cloud service which is controlled via role based access. Once they have authenticated with the service and the service verifies that they have the correct role to access the system they will be directed to a single webpage within the application where they will be able to upload the encrypted PDF. This PDF is generated on the fly and is therefore not stored in another location that could become compromised. Generating the PDF on the fly means that the source data is extracted from the database, processed and delivered in the context of a single request. These data will be transferred for each subject when they complete participation in the study.</ipd_description>
