  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Everyday practice in dentistry is based on giving the painless injection and achieving
      adequate local anesthesia. Various techniques of reducing injection pain in children can be
      broadly categorized as psychological and physical. The psychological approach includes
      behavior management techniques, physical means and other recent techniques such as computer
      controlled anesthesia, electronic dental anesthesia, and so forth. However, none of these
      techniques have been successful in eliminating pain, fear and anxiety in children.

      Direct palatal injection technique is difficult to administer without significant pain or
      discomfort since there is little tissue space at these sites between the mucosa and the
      underlying periosteum. Studies conducted on indirect palatal injection technique
      (intrapapillary) revealed that it reduces the pain of palatal injection with the same
      efficacy of anesthesia during extraction.

      The desirable method to evade pain during palatal injection is just not to have one.

      Maxillary molars removal without palatal or multiple injections is possible due to relatively
      thin porous bone of posterior buccal maxilla that facilitates the diffusion of local
      anesthetic.

  <detailed_description>

      The provision of intraoral palatal anesthesia can be potentially more painful for the patient
      when compared to other sites of the oral cavity, as palatal tissues are tightly bound to the
      hard palate with limited tissue space between it and the periosteum . As the injection is
      given, pressure builds up within the palatal tissues causing pain.

      Studies conducted on indirect palatal injection technique (intrapapillary) revealed that it
      reduces the pain of palatal injection with the same efficacy of anesthesia during extraction.

      The desirable method to evade pain during palatal injection is just not to have one. So
      studies was made to evaluate the single buccal injection and its efficiency during extraction
      of maxillary teeth. The relatively thin porous bone of posterior buccal maxilla facilitates
      the diffusion of local anesthetic,as well as articaine can diffuse through soft and hard
      tissues more reliably than other LA so that maxillary buccal infiltration of articaine
      provides palatal soft tissue anesthesia.Therefore single injection eliminates the need for
      multiple painful injections.

Injecting by a small amount of solution in the superficial mucosa. After a few seconds, the needle was slowly advanced in the mucobuccal fold toward the apex of the molar and 1.8 ml of 4% articaine using short 30-gauge needle was slowly given.
Subjective assessment of buccal and palatal soft tissue anesthesia will be assessed by inquiring about the area of numbness from the participant, no pain during pricking the palatal mucosa. The cases in which palatal anesthesia will not be reported by the patient will be given supplemental palatal infiltration with 0.2 to 0.3 mL articaine.
After achieving adequate buccal and palatal tissue anesthesia, the tooth will be extracted under aspetic technique.</description>
