  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of aerobic exercise in
      different amounts (number of minutes/session) over different periods of time (number of
      weeks). Aerobic exercise is physical activity of light-to-moderate intensity that uses the
      large muscle groups (muscles in your legs, buttocks, back, and chest) and can be performed
      for at least 10 minutes.

      The researchers will study the effects of different exercise programs on how well the study
      participants' bodies use oxygen, how well their heart pumps blood, how well their lungs
      function, and how healthy their blood vessels are.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the initiation of every supervised aerobic training session, patient resting vital
      signs will be assessed to ensure the patient can safely proceed with the session. Vital
      signs, including resting heart rate and blood pressure, will be collected and monitored per
      ExOnc program guidelines. In addition, the planned session will not be initiated if the ExOnc
      staff member observes any concerns that may compromise participant safety and/or the
      integrity of the planned session. Vital sign monitoring guidelines for unsupervised sessions,
      prescribed at lower intensities, will be advised by the exercise physiologist at the time the
      session plan is provided to the patient. Patients will be instructed to not begin an
      unsupervised session if their resting heart rate or blood pressure is outside the recommended
      guidelines.
