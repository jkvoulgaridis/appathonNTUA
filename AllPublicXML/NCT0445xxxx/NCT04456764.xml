  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workers report work-related mental and
      physical fatigue. Odds of injury among fatigued EMS workers are nearly double that of
      non-fatigued workers. There is a compelling need to reduce fatigue among EMS workers, yet few
      EMS organizations have a formal fatigue management program and many may not be cost-effective
      or evidence-based. This trial addresses national goals of the National Occupational Research
      Agenda (NORA) and tests a novel approach to fatigue risk management that is easily scalable
      to large workforces and low-cost for employers of shift workers.

      The investigators will test an enhanced version of our SleepTrackTXT pilot intervention -
      Sleep and Fatigue Treatment in EMS (SaFTiE) - in a two-arm parallel cluster-randomized design
      of 36 EMS agencies. Our unit of randomization will be the EMS agency, with the intervention
      deployed as a Fatigue Risk Management Program that can be integrated into an agency's
      existing program. Prior to randomization the investigators will use a run-in period of 60
      days with all 36 agencies to capture the natural history of the target population whereby
      they are naive to the study intervention. During the active intervention phase, the
      investigators will use SaFTiE and an attention placebo control (APC) group to test the
      specific effect of our multi-component intervention on EMS worker fatigue and sleep health.

    <description>[Used with permission from the developer], the Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion Recovery (OFER) questionnaire with 3 sub-scales [Acute Fatigue (AF), Chronic Fatigue (CF), and Inter-Shift Recovery (IR)]. Individual item responses are coded 0 to 6 and summed, divided by 30, then multiplied by 100 to produce a composite sub-scale score ranging from 0 to 100. The developer suggests stratifying the continuous measure into quartiles (Low, Low/Moderate, Moderate/High, and High) for comparative purposes. Higher scores on the AF and CF sub-scales (e.g., 50-100) signify moderate to high fatigue. Higher scores on the IR sub-scale signify greater/improved ability to recover between shifts. The OFER has no minimum thresholds to define clinically meaningful change in fatigue or recovery.</description>
