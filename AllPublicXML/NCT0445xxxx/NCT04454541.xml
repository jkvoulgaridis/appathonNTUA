    <textblock>
      Background: Cervicogenic headache (CH) described as a chronic hemi-cranial pain resulted from
      a disorder of the cervical spine and its anatomic structures innervated by the C1, C2, and C3
      cervical spinal nerves. Traditionally noninvasive and invasive techniques were used for
      treatment. Greater occipital nerve block is the most frequent peripheral nerve block invasive
      technique used for the management of cervicogenic headache Objectives: The study was done to
      compare the efficacy of two different techniques: multifidus cervicus plan block and greater
      occipital nerve block in treatment of refractory cervicogenic headache using ultrasound
      guided.

      Patients and Methods: sixty patients with cervicogenic headache were recruited and diagnosed
      according to ICHD-ш Beta version. Divided into two group, one for greater occipital nerve
      block and the other for multifidus cervicis plane block with ultrasound guided.

      This study was done to compare the efficacy of two different techniques: multifidus cervicus
      plane block and greater occipital nerve block in treatment of cervicogenic headache using
      ultrasound guided.

      This prospective study that was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB), Mansoura
      Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Cairo Egypt (Code Number: R/19.04.483) and all
      participants gave written informed consent. The procedures followed were in accordance with
      our protocol.

      This study included patients with cervicogenic headache disorders that diagnosed according to
      International Classification of Headache Disorder version III (ICHD-III beta version)
      criteria (18)

      Full clinical neurological examination was done for all patients. Blood samples for routine
      laboratory investigations (Complete blood count, creatinine, liver function tests, PT, APTT)
      were taken from all patients, electrocardiography (ECG) were done for all patients. Pain
      intensity was evaluated via visual analog scale (VAS) scores (0 -10). Pain intensity
      evaluation will be done at initial presentation then after 2 and 4 weeks, using the VAS scale
      for affected side of cervicogenic headache. Saturation of pulse oxygen (SpO2), all Procedures
      performed using ultrasound system with a 7 - 13 MHz multi-frequency transducer (LOGIQ P5; GE
      Healthcare).

    <intervention_model_description>Arm A-Greater occipital nerve block The ultrasound-guided GONB was performed to more accurately locate the nerve. The patient was asked to lie prone on the table. To locate the nerve, we searched for the occipital artery in the medial one-third of the superior nuchal line between the occipital tubercle and mastoid process.
Arm B- Multifidus cervicus plan block group (MCPB) Patients will receive continuing low-flow non humidified nasal cannula oxygen (2 L/min) and continued intravenous infusion of Ringer's solution while respiratory signs were closely monitored during the procedure.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A-Greater occipital nerve block The ultrasound-guided GONB was performed to more accurately locate the nerve. The patient was asked to lie prone on the table. To locate the nerve, we searched for the occipital artery in the medial one-third of the superior nuchal line between the occipital tubercle and mastoid process. The scalp was cleaned with iodine. After that, the skin was sterilized, and the probe was sheathed in a sterile plastic package GONB was performed by applying the injection to the medial of the artery. A 22-gauge needle was advanced beneath the lateral border of the probe using real-time ultrasound guidance and an in-plane technique. In all patients the occipital nerve was seen medial to the artery. The injected side was determined by the patients' clinical symptoms and according to the painful side reported in their headache diaries. The patients were required to lie down for 30 minutes after the injection to avoid dizziness.</description>

    <description>Patients placed in a lateral position with their affected side upwards. Several gel cushions were placed under their head, neck, and arm to put the neck in a stable and slightly anterior flexion position spinal level was determined by identifying the transverse process of the seventh and sixth cervical vertebrae (C7 and C6). The seventh cervical transverse process (C7) differs from the levels above by having a rudimentary anterior tubercle and a prominent posterior tubercle. After aseptic preparation of the injection area, lidocaine 1% was used to anesthetize the skin. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the needle (22-G, 0.7 mm × 60 mm, Plexufx, B-BRAUN, Tokyo, Japan) was introduced in-plane through the skin and advanced into the fascial plane between the multifidus cervicis and semispinalis cervicis muscles for the MCP block.</description>
