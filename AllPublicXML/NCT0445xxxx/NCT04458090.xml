  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the documented benefits of hospice, less than 2 million people utilize hospice
      services annually. Underuse disparities are extreme across race and ethnicity as White
      Americans comprise 85% of all hospice enrollees. AAs account for only 8% of hospice enrollees
      but are more likely to die from the top three hospice diagnoses (i.e. cancer, heart disease
      and dementia) than White Americans. Even when AAs enroll in hospice, they spend less time in
      hospice than White patients, averaging fewer than seven days in hospice care. Notably, AA
      hospice enrollees report a higher degree of satisfaction with end of life care when hospice
      is involved, as compared to AAs who are not enrolled in hospice care. There are several
      potential barriers that may prevent AAs from enrolling in hospice care including lack of
      knowledge of hospice care, mistrust in healthcare, perceived discrimination, health literacy.
      AAs routinely report less knowledge of hospice than White Americans, and the information that
      AA know about hospice often comes from non-medical professionals and is inaccurate. Some AA
      have persistent mistrust in healthcare due to events such as the Tuskegee Syphilis
      Experiments and many AA perceive discrimination when accessing healthcare. Data shows that
      health literacy is a stronger predictor of hospice use than race and older AAs are more
      likely to possess low health literacy. The driving hypothesis of this research is that by
      providing clear and accurate information to older AAs will help address the underutilization
      of hospice by clarifying misperceptions, building trust, and overcoming literacy barriers.
      Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are an evidence-based approach to improve patient agency in
      medical decision making. Research shows that AA report a desire for more agency and autonomy
      in decision-making yet the use of PtDAs is understudied in AA communities. This proposal
      offers a unique opportunity to address many of the potential barriers that may prevent older
      AAs from enrolling in hospice, while simultaneously expanding the literature of SDM specific
      to older AAs. The goals of this proposal are to evaluate if the relationships between health
      literacy and hospice knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs is mediated by mistrust in healthcare
      and perceived discrimination among AAs aged 65 or older (Aim1) and to evaluate the effect of
      the hospice PtDA on changing hospice knowledge and attitudes and beliefs about hospice in AA
      aged 65 and older (Aim 2).
