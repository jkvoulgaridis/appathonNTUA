  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respectively for patients with repeated transplant failure and routine patients, Thawing
      frozen embryos in advance (18h) to extend the duration of embryonic development or thawing
      embryos on the day of transfer in the frozen embryo transfer cycle, to analyze which way can
      improve clinical pregnancy outcomes, is there a significant difference between the two ways
      or two types of patients?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although in clinical practice, thawed embryos with appropriate development time will be
      selected strictly according to the number of days after ovulation, there are still two
      problems in actual clinical treatment: one is the embryonic factor, although the rate of
      embryonic development is generally the same, However, the phenomenon of delayed embryo
      division and development often occurs. The second is the endometrial factor. There are
      reports that a small number of people will move the transplant window forward, or the
      transplant window is narrow. This potentially creates the risk of embryo-endometrial
      mismatch. Based on this, the research team focused on patients with frozen embryo transfer
      cycles and put forward the strategy of &quot;thawing embryos in advance and prolonging the
      development period of embryos properly&quot; in an effort to achieve better repair of damage
      caused by embryo freezing and fine-tuning of embryo-endometrial interaction time. Therefore,
      it is necessary to compare thawing embryos in advance and thawing on the day of transfer on
      pregnancy outcomes in patients with repeated transplant failure and routine patients
      respectively.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze which way can improve clinical pregnancy and birth
      outcomes, is there a significant difference between the two ways or two types of patients?
