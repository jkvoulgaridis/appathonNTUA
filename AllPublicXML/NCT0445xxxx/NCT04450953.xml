  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) pathologies are the leading cause of death in kidney transplant
      patients.Arterial stiffness is a prognostic factor for CV mortality in kidney
      transplantation. Despite a reduced CV risk in transplant kidney patients in comparison to
      patients in dialysis, CV mortality among kidney transplant patients is much higher than the
      general population.

      After renal transplantation, the cardiac and vascular anomalies observed in chronic end-stage
      renal disease are partially improved because of restored normal kidney function and
      withdrawal from dialysis.

      However, patients are exposed to immunosuppressive drugs, in particular calcineurin
      inhibitors, which can be associated with vascular toxicity, either directly or by promoting
      the appearance of hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia.The pathophysiology of arterial
      stiffness in kidney transplantation is complex and multifactorial.

      Calcineurin inhibitors are likely to play an important role in the persistence of increased
      arterial stiffness in transplant patients in whom renal function has been restored. Indeed,
      the discontinuation of anti-calcineurins in favour of other molecules .is associated with a
      decrease of arterial stiffness.

      Preclinical work has shown that the vascular toxicity of cyclosporine is mediated by
      activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor in smooth muscle cells. The involvement of the
      mineralocorticoid receptor in the onset of arterial stiffness is also well demonstrated in
      non-transplanted subjects.

      Blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor in patients under cyclosporine may reduce their
      arterial stiffness and in and consequently improve their CV prognosis.

      Studies have show a good safety in kidney transplant patients. This pilot study proposes to
      examine, for the first time, the impact of treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor
      antagonist on the evolution of arterial stiffness in renal transplant patients on calcineurin
      inhibitors.
