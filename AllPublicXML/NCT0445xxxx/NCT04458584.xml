  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for three widely held fundamental tenets
      about surgical intervention for thumb basal joint arthritis;

        1. Trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and metacarpal stabilization is associated
           with superior functional outcomes and strength,

        2. Preservation of the arthroplasty space correlates with functional outcomes, pain relief,
           and restoration of strength after basal joint arthroplasty, and

        3. Mitigation of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) hyperextension optimizes postoperative
           strength after basal joint arthroplasty, regardless of surgical technique.

      It is hypothesized that thumb basal joint arthroplasty with metacarpal stabilization, by
      either ligament reconstruction (I) or suture suspension (II), provides greater improvement in
      grip and pinch strength, and better hand function, than might be achieved following provision
      of pain relief alone by simple trapeziectomy (III). Preservation of the arthroplasty space
      will correlate positively, and MCPJ hyperextension will correlate negatively, with improved
      thumb function and lateral pinch strength.

      Primary Aims (within 3 procedure cohorts):

        1. Compare pre-operative pinch and grip strength as well as patient-reported outcomes
           (PROs) for pain in patients before and after lidocaine injection of the
           trapeziometacarpal joint, prior to thumb basal joint arthroplasty;

        2. Compare post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function at 3 and 6
           months after thumb basal joint arthroplasty with pre-operative values before and after
           lidocaine injection;

        3. Correlate preservation of dynamic arthroplasty space as measured on a stress radiograph
           with postoperative improvement in pinch and grip strength, and PROs for pain and
           function;

        4. Correlate dynamic MCP joint position and laxity with change in strength and
           patient-reported pain and function to define optimal MCPJ position.

      Secondary Aims (between 3 procedure cohorts):

        1. Compare change in pre- and post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and
           function between patients having basal joint arthroplasty with and without specific
           metacarpal stabilization;

        2. Compare preservation of the dynamic arthroplasty space and improvement in strength and
           patient-reported pain and function between arthroplasty groups; and

        3. Compare changes in pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function with dynamic
           MCPJ position between arthroplasty groups.

        4. Compare postoperative neuritis and complications between surgical groups.

      Study Procedures: Upon obtaining informed consent and within 4 weeks of the planned date of
      surgery, each site coordinator will collect baseline clinical and demographic information, a
      visual analogue score (VAS), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
      (PROMIS-10) Global Health Survey, the short form Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand
      (QuickDASH) questionnaire and grip and then pinch measurements from the participant. On the
      same day, and immediately following collection of baseline clinical data in the clinic, the
      surgeon will anesthetize the trapeziometacarpal joint. Adequacy of the injection and
      resulting anesthesia of the joint will be assessed by repeat of the VAS score. Following 15
      minutes set time for the local anesthetic, the VAS diagram will again be completed by the
      patient followed by recording of repeat grip and then pinch measurements. Each patient will
      then undergo one of three pre-specified procedures; trapeziectomy with ligament
      reconstruction-tendon interposition (LRTI) arthroplasty with flexor carpi radialis tendon;
      trapeziectomy with suture suspensionplasty; or arthroscopic or open trapeziectomy with
      temporary K-wire fixation. Patient follow-up visits are otherwise scheduled according to the
      surgeon's routine and by clinical indication only. The patient will follow the routine
      postoperative rehabilitation protocol and hand therapy program of the operating surgeon.
      Protective splinting and exercise programs are to be utilized per surgeon protocol and
      preference.Postoperative study assessment will occur at three and six months after operation,
      The 3 and 6 month evaluation will include PROMIS-10 and QuickDASH surveys, completion of the
      VAS pain diagram, and recording of grip, key, and pulp to pulp pinch strengths. Additionally,
      specific notation of paresthesias, dysaesthesias, or sensitivity of the incision will be made
      by the surgeon or hand therapist at the 3 and 6 month assessments.

    <description>Power grip using a Jamar (Jackson, MO) dynamometer, followed by lateral (key) and pulp-to-pulp pinch, will be recorded (in kilograms) with a pinch meter, taking the greater strength of three successive attempts at each position with a 15 second rest between each attempt. The dynamic position of the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint will be recorded with a small goniometer during lateral pinch testing.</description>
