      To assess if vitamin D status in the elective foot and ankle fusion population affects fusion
      healing categorically (fused vs. un-fused).

      This study will be a randomized, 1:1 placebo controlled, blinded, prospective study of level
      I evidence. The investigators will recruit patients undergoing a major ankle, hindfoot, or
      midfoot arthrodesis and obtain serum vitamin D levels. Patients that are vitamin D deficient
      (&lt;30 ng/mL) will then be randomized into two treatment groups: vitamin D supplementation
      (50,000 IU D2) and no vitamin D supplementation, receiving placebo. Vitamin D levels will be
      drawn on the day of surgery and 6-8 weeks post-operatively. Outcome variables tested in this
      study are as follows: bone fusion as an event, time to bone fusion, VAS, and SF-36.

      The study will be conducted at 4 investigative sites within the Allegheny Health Network;
      West Penn Hospital, Forbes Regional Hospital, Twin Towers and Steel Valley Orthopedics &amp;
      Sports Medicine, Jefferson Hills, PA. Recruitment will stop when approximately 150 subjects
      are entering the follow-up phase of the study.

    <intervention_model_description>The specific aim of this study is to assess if vitamin D status in the elective foot and ankle fusion population affects fusion healing rates. With this information the investigators hope to ascertain if vitamin D supplementation in the perioperative period leads to superior fusion rates than does no supplementation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>The patients will be blinded for the duration of the study. This will be accomplished by providing the patients with over encapsulated vitamin D and placebo in pill bottles. Twelve (12) over encapsulated 50,000 IU vitamin D2 or placebo tablets will be packaged in pill bottles for patient use. The Foot &amp; Ankle Institute CRC will document which drug the patients received.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in patient reported SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>

    <description>Change in patient reported VAS survey scores. The scale shows a series of faces ranging from a happy face at 0, or &quot;no hurt&quot;, to a crying face at 10, which represents &quot;hurts like the worst pain imaginable&quot;. ... The fifth face represents a pain score of 8, and indicates &quot;hurts a whole lot&quot;; the sixth face represents a pain score of 10, and indicates &quot;hurts worst.&quot;</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females age 18 to 89 years undergoing ankle, hindfoot, or midfoot arthrodesis
             surgery

          2. Vitamin D serum level &lt;30 ng/mL including those concurrently taking vitamin D

          3. Ambulatory
