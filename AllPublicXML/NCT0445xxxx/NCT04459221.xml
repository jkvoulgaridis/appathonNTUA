  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer (CCU) is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. In Reunion island,
      CCU is the third leading cause of cancer in women (standardized incidence rate on the world
      population (TIS) in 2013 of 10.3 / 100,000) and is the eighth deadliest cancer with a rate
      standardized mortality of 4.8 / 100,000, almost three times higher than in mainland France
      where it was 1.7 / 100,000 in 2018.

      CCU results from infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common
      sexually transmitted viral infection.

      CCU prevention is mainly based on cervical smear screening and anti HPV vaccination (VHPV)
      which has demonstrated its effectiveness on the prevalence of HPV carriage, but also on
      incidence of condyloma or intermediate grade dysplasia. Since HPV is mainly transmitted
      sexually, it is important to vaccinate before the start of sex.

      In Reunion island, the HPV vaccination coverage rate is the lowest in France, estimated by
      Public Health France at 8.1% among girls aged 16 years in 2018, while the already low
      national average was established 23.7%.

      Thus, in view of the epidemiological situation in Reunion island (high incidence and
      mortality for the CCU, very low VHPV coverage rate), we thought it would be interesting to
      study the impact of a health promotion program sex and prevention of sexually transmitted
      infections (STIs) including papillomavirus-related pathologies, with a program to promote HPV
      vaccination among young students in middle school.
