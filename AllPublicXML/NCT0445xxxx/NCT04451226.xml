  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause with hot flashes. Menopause, a normal part of aging, is
      the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's daily life. The
      purpose of this study is to find out how safe it is for these women to take fezolinetant long
      term (up to 52 weeks). To do that, the study will look at the number and severity of the
      &quot;adverse events.&quot; Those are the side effects that study participants have while they are in
      the study. The study treatment is fezolinetant (1 tablet of fezolinetant) once a day. The
      study participants will take study treatment for 52 weeks. At weeks 2 and 4 and then once a
      month, the study participants will go the hospital or clinic for a check-up. They will be
      asked about medications, side effects and how they feel. Other checks will include physical
      exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature and blood pressure). Blood and urine will be
      collected for laboratory tests. At some study visits, study participants will complete
      questionnaires that are about their quality of life. Study participants who still have their
      uterus will have 2 more tests done at the first and last study visits. One of the 2 tests is
      endometrial biopsy. This test involves removing a small amount of tissue from the inside
      lining of the uterus. The tissue is then checked under a microscope. The other test is
      transvaginal ultrasound. It uses sound waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis.
      The sound waves are transmitted by a probe (transducer), which is placed inside the vagina.
      Study participants may have a screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit.
      A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study
      participants who did not have this test done in the last 12 months will have it done at the
      first study visit. They will have it done at the last study visit if they are due for their
      screening mammogram and their own doctor agrees. The last check-up at the hospital or clinic
      will be 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.

             are normal. Subject with mildly elevated ALP (up to 1.5 × ULN) can be enrolled if
             cholestatic liver disease is excluded and no cause other than fatty liver is

             portion of the C-SSRS), or who is at significant risk to commit suicide at screening
