  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the Adoption study is to determine how best to encourage people to adopt clean
      cookstoves in order to diminish the global health risk of household air pollution. The study
      harnesses an existing cohort in Ghana to study factors that increase the adoption of clean
      cookstoves, and to test strategies to promote adoption and continued use. Limited past
      research has shown that the demand for clean cookstoves is low, and that households continue
      to use traditional hearths even when they have clean cookstoves. This behavior threatens to
      undermine clean cookstove intervention programs, such as those promoted by the Global
      Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. The proposed study aims to ascertain the demand curve for
      liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in the Kintampo North Municipality and South district.

      The study will assess if demand for LPG in rural settings in Ghana is price elastic - and by
      how much - by providing different levels of LPG price subsidies. It will also ascertain if
      demand is influenced by distance by allocating participants to varying distances to points of
      LPG supply. Finally, it will assess factors that could affect the demand for LPG such as
      availability and price of other fuels for cooking, and income levels.

      In particular the objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine if demand for LPG is price elastic

        2. To determine if demand for LPG is influenced by distance

        3. To ascertain what other factors aside the price of LPG, and distance to point of LPG
           supply, determine the demand for LPG

        4. To document the successes and challenges of introducing a subsidy for LPG in rural
           settings

    <description>Different subsidy rates, ranging between 0% and 100% (listed below) will be written on cards. Individuals will randomly select a card to display the subsidy rate for each household. The card will be concealed with a scratch-off sticker, with a higher likelihood of drawing a high price (low subsidy) than a low price (high subsidy) given that take up will be higher in the latter group.</description>

    <description>We will set up fuel supply depots to increase the convenience and lower costs and hassle associated with traveling to an established filling station. The supply depots will mirror a recirculation model of LPG distribution currently being piloted by the National Petroleum Authority of Ghana. Households will be randomly assigned to one of the supply depots in advance or to continue refilling their cylinder at the filling station.</description>
