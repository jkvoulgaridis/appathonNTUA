               -  PCNSL patients: relapse is defined as the appearance of new lesions at the

                  large B-cell lymphoma who must include central nervous system invasion. Relapse
                  was defined as the patients who had been prevented or treated with MTX;

                  regimen for 2 cycles without PR or 4 cycles without CR. if the best effect or end
                  cause was PD, the number of courses was not required;
