      Objective: To make a retrospective analysis of the injuries of skiing population in a large
      ski resort in Chongli, China and provide a basis for predicting the rapidly increasing
      medical needs for ski injuries in the context of the 2022 winter Olympic Games.

      Methods: The basic data of all injured skiers who were treated in a medical station of a
      large ski resort in Chongli during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 snow seasons were collected.
      The number of skiers, the number of injuries, the causes of injuries, the types of injuries
      and the locations of injuries were compared.
