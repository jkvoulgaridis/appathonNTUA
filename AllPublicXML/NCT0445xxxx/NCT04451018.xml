    <textblock>
      Evaluation of macro and microcirculatory arterial condition of the upper limb in
      insufficiently renal patients

      Hand ischemia affects 1.6 to 8% of patients with arteriovenous fistula (FAV) of hemodialysis
      in the upper limb. The diagnostic and therapeutic stakes are major as it concerns the
      functional prognosis of the hand and, to a lesser extent, vascular access for hemodialysis.

      In some cases, the diagnosis of ischemic hemo-hijacking is evident, in other cases, the
      ischemic condition appears to be rather the result of uncompensated arteriatory of the upper
      limb or limbs. Echo-doppler exploration is usual for assessing vascular access but without
      validated formal criteria for arterial disease in the upper limbs, with fistula flow
      calculation and analysis of FAV hemodynamics. Compression manoeuvres on or under the FAV can
      also be performed. The pressures of the digital arteries are also indicated with
      non-consensual values found in the literature for the diagnosis of digital ischemia but with
      varying tools in terms of collection of measurements.

      The main objective of this study is to collate the characteristics of arterial condition of
      the upper limbs of medium or severe renal patients, medium- or short-term candidates for
      kidney dialysis. The data collected will match the data of the arterial echodoppler as well
      as measures of pressures doppler laser and plethysmography. Candidates for dialysis tend to
      be older and polyvascular. A better assessment of the vascular condition of their upper
      limbs, including the diagnosis of advanced arterial disease, could eventually guide the
      choice of type of dialysis (compared to an indication of FAV).
