      Study Design This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized clinical study in patients
      presenting thoracic aortic pathologies.

      Following a baseline assessment, the implantation procedure will be performed according to
      the Instructions for Use and local routine practice. A follow-up visit will be performed 30
      days, 6, 12,24 and 36 months after the implantation procedure.

      The investigator will perform assessments of the implantation procedure and device system and
      document adverse events (AE) and device deficiencies. Resources utilization and unit costs
      will be collected at index procedure and during follow-up. HRQoL is going to be investigated
      in this prospective study using the generic questionnaire EQ5D 5 levels, comparing pre- and
      postoperative scores.

      Study Objective The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, performance and
      resource utilization associated with the use of GORE® TAG® Conformable Thoracic Stent Graft
      with ACTIVE CONTROL systems in humans having thoracic aortic pathologies. Safety will be
      evaluated considering mortality and morbidity variables (mainly focused on device related
      complications). Efficacy will be evaluated according to the variables related to the
      technical and clinical successes. In addition, resource utilization and associated costs will
      be collected prospectively with the objective to analyze differences in resource utilization
      between outcome groups, landing zone groups, disease severity groups, adverse event groups
      and case-mix groups. We will calculate the average marginal costs increase for complications
      when they occurred during TEVAR or surgical revascularization (e.g., paralysis, stroke, nerve
      injury, lymph damages, myocardial infarction, major bleeding event, respiratory
      complication). Resource utilization analysis is not going to be limited to the index
      procedure but will continue during follow-up.

      Subject Population: Elective and Urgent Thoracic aorta pathologies such as aneurysms,
      pseudoaneurysms, dissections, blunt thoracic aorta injury, penetrating ulcers and intramural
      hematoma.

      Planned number of patients: A total of 200 patients. Approx. 20 study centers in 2 European
      countries (15 in Italy and 5 in Spain) . A subgroup of 8centers will be selected for the
      micro-costing analysis (7 in Italy and one in Barcelona) Expected Time to Complete
      Enrollment: end of 2021 (18 months).

      identify and address waste in healthcare and reduce the total cost of care. The secondary
      objective of this trial is focusing on patient-based costing (PBC).

      To provide patient care cost a micro-costing analysis (a cost estimation method that involves
      the direct enumeration and costing out of every input consumed in the treatment of a
      particular patient) will be conducted together with an assessment of patient QoL alongside
      the study data collection.

      2.2.2. Quality of Life data This health status information is collected before and after a
      procedure and provides an indication of the outcomes or quality of care delivered to the
      patient. Among different PROMs, the preference-based measure, such as the EQ-5D and Health
      Utilities Index, describes patients' responses to questions not to provide a score 3. Study
      Design 3.1. Description of Study Design This study is a prospective, multicenter,
      non-randomized single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the GORE TAG

      investigational device are described in detail in the Instructions for Use.

      8.1. Risk-to-Benefit Rationale Risks are inherent to the endovascular repair of the thoracic
      aorta. Benefits are related to the repair of the pathological entity. Risk / benefit should
      be assessed by the physician in charge, explained to the patient and accepted, by signed
      informed consent, by the patient or other legal representative.

      9. Adverse Events (AE) and Safety Monitoring 9.1. Anticipated AE Anticipated AE are
      complications that are known to be associated with thoracic aortic pathologies which are
      planned to undergo TEVAR with a stent-graft. See Section 8, Risk Assessment.

      9.2. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (USADE) Serious adverse device effect which
      by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version
      of the risk analysis report. NOTE: Anticipated: an effect which by its nature, incidence,
      severity or outcome has been previously identified in the risk analysis report.

      10. Statistical Analysis 10.1. Study Hypotheses The used thoracic endograft device, C-TAG
      active control, has high safety and effectiveness, in terms of very low rates of
      device-related complications, high accuracy on deployment and solution of the underlying
      pathology.

      10.2. Sample Size Assumptions A cohort of a minimum of 200 cases is enough to prove our
      hypothesis according to previous clinical reports with similar devices. Technical
      improvements will be easily assessed by experienced operators with large expertise with
      similar devices.

      10.3. Sample Size Determination That is a case series study. 200 cases are comparable with
      similar series already published in the literature with other similar devices for similar
      indications.

      10.4. Data Analysis 10.4.1. Timing of Analyses An interim clinical analysis can be considered
      when the sample will reach 50% of the final goal.

      10.4.2. Analysis Populations Consecutive patients with thoracic aorta pathology according to
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously described. The investigators will replace
      missing or removed cases in order to have the goal population included.

      10.4.3. Statistical Analysis of Primary Endpoint(s) Quantitative parameters will be described
      using the following summary descriptive statistics: number of non-missing values, mean,
      standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, and minimum and maximum values.

      10.4.4. Statistical Analysis of Secondary Endpoint(s) The rate of MAEs will be assessed at 1
      year and following time points and will be derived as: all-cause death, bowel ischemia,
      myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, and secondary
      endovascular procedure as defined in section 9, stroke, and procedural blood loss ≥1,000mL.

      11. Cost and QoL analysis 11.1. Micro-costing analysis Micro-costing analysis will be
      conducted to assess cost associated to each patient enrolled in the trial from the beginning
      of the hospitalization to the study follow-up in the perspective of the provider that need to
      consider budget constraints.
