    <textblock>
      Off-label drug use, where a marketed drug is used outside its approved indication, may allow
      early access to new and promising treatments. However, its use can be a source of
      controversy, due to limited evidence for clinical benefit and lack of cost/QALY-estimates,
      leading to challenging prioritization issues. The number of drugs suitable for off-label use
      is expected to further increase in the coming years, owing to the rapid progress in the field
      of oncology, in particular with the current era of precision medicine and targeted therapies.
      This also challenges the traditional method of running clinical trials, with eligible patient
      populations commonly being small, underpinning the importance of gaining supplementary
      real-world evidence from well performed observational studies.

      This prospective observational study will therefore assess real-world outcomes of patients
      treated with off-label anti-cancer drugs, including efficacy in terms of response rates, time
      to progression/relapse measures and survival; patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and
      self-reported side-effects/toxicity; as well as collecting blood samples for a biobank for
      further translational research. Further, the study will give a descriptive analysis of the
      current practice of off-label use of anti-cancer drugs in Norway, including prevalence
      estimation and health care related cost analyses.
