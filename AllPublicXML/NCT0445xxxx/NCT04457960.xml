    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of JNJ 66525433 compared
      with placebo after administration of: 1) single ascending oral doses of JNJ 66525433
      administered to healthy participants (Part 1), 2) multiple, ascending oral doses of JNJ
      66525433, administered to healthy participants once daily over 14 consecutive days (Part 2),
      and 3) multiple oral doses of JNJ 66525433, administered once daily over 14 consecutive and
      once daily over 42 consecutive days in participants with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Part 3).

    <measure>Part 3: Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo scoring system is used for assessment of ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment, and endoscopy findings) each ranges from 0 to 3. The Mayo score is calculated as the sum of these 4 subscores and can range between 0 and 12, where higher score indicates severe disease.</description>

    <description>Partial Mayo score is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment) and ranges from 0 to 9 points. Higher score indicates severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 3: Endoscopic Subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopy sub-score ranges from 0 to 3 where; 0 = normal or inactive disease; 1 = mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability); 2 = moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions); 3 = severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration).</description>

    <time_frame>Days 1, 7, 14, 28, 43, 70 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>IBDQ18 is a validated, 32-item, self-reported questionnaire for participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that will be used to evaluate the disease-specific health-related quality of life across 4 dimensional scores: bowel symptoms (loose stools, abdominal pain), systemic functions (fatigue, altered sleep pattern), social function (work attendance, need to cancel social events), and emotional function (anger, depression, irritability). Scores range from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to antisense oligonucleotides,

             be in the participant's interest or could confound study assessments

          -  The field of COVID-related testing (for presence of, and immunity to, the severe acute
             respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] virus) is rapidly evolving. Additional
             testing may be performed as part of screening and/or during the study if deemed
