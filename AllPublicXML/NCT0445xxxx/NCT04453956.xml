  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An artificial intelligence-based system, named EndoAngel,has been constructed
      previously,which has polyp detection and quality monitoring functions. This study aims to
      evaluate the two different functions of EndoAngle in improving adenoma detection rate.

    <textblock>
      The detection and removal of precancerous polyps via colonoscopy can reduce the the risk of
      colon cancer. However, the detection rate of adenomatous polyps can vary significantly among
      endoscopists. EndoAngel is an artificial intelligence-based system,consisting of polyp
      detection and quality monitoring functions. The polyp detection function can remind
      endoscopists of the location of the polyp. The quality monitoring function can monitor the
      velocity of insertion of the endoscope, record the time of insertion and withdrawal of the
      endoscope, and remind endoscopists of the blind areas caused by intestinal segment
      slipping.This study aims to evaluate the two different functions of EndoAngle by 2 × 2
      factorial design in improving adenoma detection rate and the quality of colonscopy .
