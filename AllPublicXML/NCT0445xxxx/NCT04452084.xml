  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the evidence supports hippocampal avoidance with whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT)
      as the recommended treatment option in patients with good prognosis and multiple brain
      metastases as it gives better neurocognitive preservation compared to historical whole brain
      radiotherapy controls. There is however often poor tumour control with this technique due to
      the low doses given. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), a form of focused radiotherapy which is
      given to patients who have a limited number of brain metastases, gives a higher radiation
      dose to the metastases resulting in better target lesion control. With improvements in
      radiation technology, advanced dose-painting techniques now allow a simultaneous integrate
      boost (SIB) dose to lesions whilst minimising doses to the hippocampus to potentially improve
      brain tumour control and preserve cognitive outcomes (HA-SIB-WBRT).

      The Investigators believe that the SIB in HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental) will result in better
      functional and survival outcomes compared to HA-WBRT (control). Patients who are fit, have
      multiple brain metastases (5-25 lesions) and reasonable life expectancy (&gt;6 months) will be
      recruited from NCCS over 2 years. Patients will be followed up the over the following year
      with imaging, toxicity data, quality of life, activities of daily living and cognitive
      measurements at set time points. The results will be compared across the 2 arms.

      Patients with brain metastases are living longer. Maintaining functional independence and
      brain metastases control is thus increasingly important. Improved radiotherapy treatment
      techniques could provide better control and survival outcomes whilst maintain QoL and
      functional capacity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21-80 years old patients with radiological confirmed brain metastases (5-25 lesions)

          -  Histologically proven malignancy of primary cancer

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Maximum lesion or cavity size ≤ 5cm

               -  For patients with large (≥ 3cm) lesions, a neurosurgical consult is recommended
                  as the risk of cerebral oedema and hydrocephalus is higher with RT. A
                  Ventricular-peritoneal shunt/ surgical excision may be required prior to planning
                  of RT

               -  If brain surgery or other invasive procedures are performed, the treatment can
                  only begin at least 2-weeks post-procedure

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration for women of
             childbearing potential

          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must
             agree to use a medically effective means of birth control throughout protocol
             treatment

          -  Not recommended or does not want Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior whole brain radiotherapy

             o Prior SRS is not an exclusion. Details of treatment must be recorded.

          -  Concurrent systemic cytotoxic treatment.

             o If patient is on systemic treatment a treatment break of at least 7 days for
             immunotherapy or chemotherapy and 3 days for targeted therapy is required before and
             after radiotherapy.

          -  Leptomeningeal disease

          -  Extensive extracranial disease, not controlled by systemic treatment

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  Major medical or psychiatric illness, which in the investigator's opinion would
                  interfere with the completion of therapy and follow up or with full understanding
                  of the risks and potential complications of the therapy;

               -  Unstable angina and/or uncontrolled congestive heart failure;

               -  Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months;

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration; note that patients switched from IV antibiotics and currently on
                  oral antibiotics whose infection is assessed to be adequately treated or
                  controlled are eligible.

               -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days prior to
                  registration;

               -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition;
                  note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The
                  need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the
