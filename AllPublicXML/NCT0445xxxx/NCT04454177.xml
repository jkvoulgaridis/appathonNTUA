  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe conduction disturbance, daily activity level, heart
      rates, oxygen saturation in patients who underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
      (TAVR) and to evaluate the utility of the HUAWEI Watch (HUAWEI Technologies Co., Ltd.,
      Shenzhen, China) for the potential early warning sign of changes in multiple biometric
      parameters including heart rate, rhythm, oxygen saturation, activity, and sleep in patients
      following TAVR. This will be evaluated in the context of a recently implemented early
      discharge protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study including patients undergoing TAVR procedure
      in Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine. HUAWEI Watch will
      be assigned to patients within 24 hours before TAVR. HUAWEI Watch GT series can continuously
      monitor and record multiple biometric parameters heart rate, step counts, sleep cycles and
      can detect and record the pulse oxygen saturation, as well as analyze QRS complexes and P
      waves after triggering. The patients will be followed in outpatient clinic visits at 1, 6,
      12, 24, and 36 months after TAVR and will commence monitoring with the HUAWEI Watch protocol
      at least 1 day before the scheduled TAVR procedure to allow familiarity with the device.
      Patients will be required to activate SMART watch readings (including pulse oxygen saturation
      and ECG) at least once prior to TAVR and twice per day in the week following TAVR discharge
      (morning and late afternoon/early evening), at least two days a week for the subsequent month
      after TAVR discharge and at least once weekly for the remainder of the study. Patients will
      also be required to activate SMART watch readings at times of any cardiovascular symptoms
      including dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness or presyncope. The health data
      recorded by HUAWEI Watch will be transmitted to HUAWEI phone application. The Heart Health
      App (developed by Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University) will
      receive, process and store the data, and transfer it to remote database after approval by
      patients. A designated heart team member would access the data via a cloud database, contact
      the patient further investigation or management was deemed necessary.
