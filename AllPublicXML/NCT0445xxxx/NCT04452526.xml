      This trial studies how well a multi-level health system-based intervention works in improving
      human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation and completion among children in health systems
      in four Appalachian states. Utilizing educational and promotional materials and electronic
      health record reminders, may improve the uptake of the HPV vaccine in children and young
      adults, ultimately preventing the development of cervical cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Test the effectiveness of a multi-level intervention (MLI) directed at clinics, providers,
      and patients (parents of children aged 11-12) to improve HPV vaccine initiation and
      completion in health systems in four Appalachian states (Kentucky [KY], Ohio [OH], West
      Virginia [WV,] and Virginia [VA]) among children aged 11-12 and assess the effectiveness of
      the intervention program among subgroups, e.g., females versus (vs) males.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess sustainability of the intervention. II. Assess cost impacts of the intervention
      III. Assess changes in clinic practices that occur as a result of the intervention in terms
      of staff responsibilities for the vaccination process and reducing missed opportunities for
      vaccination.

      IV. Assess whether interventions focused on 13-26 year olds increases catch-up vaccination.

      V. Examine changes in knowledge and attitudes of providers via educational session pre-post
      surveys.

      VI. Satisfaction with the intervention at the multiple levels.

      OUTLINE: Health systems are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EARLY INTERVENTION): Health systems receive educational materials consisting of
      posters, brochures and table tents. Providers complete survey about HPV knowledge,
      participate in educational session over 1 hour and receive educational handouts on the HPV
      vaccine. Patients receive educational materials about HPV vaccine and reminder letters for
      HPV vaccination.

      ARM II (DELAYED INTERVENTION): Health systems, providers, and patients receive usual care for
      12 months, then receive multi-level intervention as in Arm I.
