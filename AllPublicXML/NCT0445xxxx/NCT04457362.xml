  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of Arthrex NanoScope
      compared to conventional arthroscopic instruments. Patients with wrist pathology who are
      indicated for an arthroscopic procedure will be enrolled pre-operatively after a thorough
      discussion of the study aims, risks, and benefits. At the time of surgery, under standard
      conditions, using standard wrist arthroscopy portals, a diagnostic arthroscopy will be
      performed with the Arthrex Nanoscope. The diagnostic arthroscopy will be performed in a
      stepwise manner for consistency with notation of pathology and intended intervention. The
      diagnostic arthroscopy will then be performed with the standard arthroscopic equipment, again
      noting pathology and final intervention. Post-operatively, diagnostic accuracy, incidence of
      change in intervention, and surgeon rated ease of use and confidence will be determined.
