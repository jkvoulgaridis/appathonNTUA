      The aim of this study was to investigate the exploration history, key theories, methods, and
      techniques involved in the evolution from the intracapsular method to the extracapsular
      method for arthroscopic treatment of tennis elbow, and explore the effectiveness and safety
      of extracapsular method on the basis of retrospective analysis of 43 cases.

      Background: Arthroscopic surgery is widely used in the treatment of refractory tennis elbow
      due to its advantages of minimally invasive, safe and direct vision. Intra-capsular
      arthroscopy(intracapsular method), which is performed via natural cavity, is the mainstream
      arthroscopic procedure. However, intracapsular method requires the damage of joint capsule
      and may cause intraoperative neurovascular injury and other complications. In view of the
      defects of intracapsular method, the surgical scheme of the extracapsular arthroscopy
      (referred to as &quot;extracapsular method&quot;) has emerged. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the exploration history, key theories, methods, and techniques involved in the evolution from
      the intracapsular method to the extracapsular method for arthroscopic treatment of tennis
      elbow, and explore the effectiveness and safety of extracapsular method.

      Methods: Qualitative data were collected via focus group interview. 7 surgeons who were
      selected through purposive sampling discussed on the theories, methods, and technical
      specifications of the transition from intracapsular method to extracapsular method.
      Qualitative data were analysed using NVivo11. Quantitative data of consecutive 43 patients
      were analysed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the extracapsular method.
      Descriptive analysis was conducted to analyse the demographic characteristics and clinical
      outcomes after surgery.
