  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of women with overactive bladder OAB (dry or wet) who have
      failed 2 prior treatments, including behavioral modification, pelvic floor physical therapy,
      and/or OAB medication (anticholinergics or mirabegron), and have chosen either
      OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) injection or percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) as their
      next treatment. OAB-dry refers to patients with OAB who do not have urge urinary
      incontinence; OAB-wet refers to patients with OAB and urge urinary incontinence. Eligible
      patients will be approached for study participation after they have decided to proceed with
      BTX or PTNS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to initiation of BTX or PTNS, patients will undergo a standardized evaluation including
      urodynamics study (UDS) if not previously done in the past year and pelvic organ prolapse
      quantification (POPq) exam if not previously done in past 6 months. Subjects will also
      complete quality of life questionnaires and 3-day voiding diary prior to initial treatment.
      Follow up questionnaires will be completed at 3 months either in office, if patient has a
      routine visit scheduled with provider and questionnaires can be completed at that visit or
      questionnaires will be mailed with return postage for participant to mail completed
      questionnaires back.

    <measure>Difference in patient global impression of improvement score between PTNS and BTX groups</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) is a single question that asks a patient to rate her urinary symptom response to treatment on a 7-point Likert scaleis a validated questionnaire for assessment of the impact of OAB on patient's lives.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life between PTNS and BTX groups</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The minimally important difference (MID) for change in SSS is 10 points. We compare the change in SS score between the PTNS and Botox groups at 3 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in individual question scores on OAB-q questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q consists of 33 items: an 8-item symptom bother scale (SS) and a 25-item health-related quality of life (HRQL) scale. Higher scores on HRQL scale represent better quality of life and lower scores on SSS is indicative of less bother.</description>

    <description>Tools used: Urogenital Distress Inventory short form (UDI-6) is a validated questionnaires used to assess urinary symptoms. We will compare change in scores between the 2 groups</description>

        Women with refractory OAB (dry or wet) who have failed 2 prior treatments, including
        behavioral modification, pelvic floor physical therapy, and/or OAB medication
        (antimuscarinics or mirabegron), and have chosen either BTX or PTNS as their next

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women with refractory OAB (dry or wet)

          2. OAB will be defined by a positive response and bother of &quot;somewhat, quite a bit, a
             great deal, or a very great deal&quot; to question #3 or #8 on the OAB-q (see appendix B)
             regarding urinary urgency and urgency incontinence.

          3. Refractory will be defined as failure of 2 prior treatments, including behavioral
             modification, pelvic floor physical therapy, and OAB medication (anticholinergics or
             mirabegron). Trial of 2 medications that did not improve symptoms after 2 weeks or
             could not be tolerated due to side effects will constitute 2 treatment failures.

          3. Contraindication to PTNS and/or BTX

               -  PTNS: Pacemaker
