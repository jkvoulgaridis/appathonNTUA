  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional eating is a behaviour that has been linked to weight concerns, mental health
      concerns, and disordered eating. Effective interventions have been developed to treat
      emotional eating, however these exist solely in the context of promoting weight loss.
      Emotional eating is not exclusive to those who struggle with weight and thus interventions
      are needed that target those who engage in emotional eating regardless of their weight
      status. The present study aims to do so through the implementation of a brief online
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) workshop for emotional eaters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional eating is defined as increased food consumption in response to negative emotions,
      and has been linked to weight concerns, mental health concerns, and disordered eating
      behaviours. Effective interventions have been developed that address emotional eating, namely
      to improve weight loss. Such interventions are based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), which encourages tolerance of internal cues, such as emotions, and external cues, such
      as food.

      Previous studies have found that brief ACT interventions are effective for the reduction of
      emotional eating. Our laboratory has recently developed and pilot-tested a one-day ACT
      workshop intervention for emotional eating, which was found to be effective for reducing
      emotional eating and deemed feasible and acceptable by participants.

      The present study was developed with the aim to adapt the above mentioned workshop
      intervention to an online format in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The study aims to
      test the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a brief, online version of the above
      mentioned one-day ACT workshop for emotional eating. The workshops will be delivered through
      the Zoom online platform.

    <measure>Emotional Eating - Post-Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at post-intervention (1 week following the first session)</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional eating, as assessed by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire Emotional Eating Subscale (DEBQ-EE). Participants are asked to rate the frequency with which they engage in particular eating behaviours, on a 5-point Likert-type rating scale from never (1) to very often (5), with higher scores reflecting higher emotional eating. Only the emotional eating subscale of the DEBQ will be assessed and is calculated by averaging the 13 items that assess emotional eating.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at post-intervention (1 week following the first session)</time_frame>
    <description>Distress tolerance, as assessed by the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS). Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements aimed at assessing distress tolerance, absorption, appraisal, and regulation from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with lower scores reflecting lower distress tolerance. Subscale scores are derived by calculating the means of the items that make up each subscale. Total score is calculating by averaging the four subscales.</description>

    <description>This is a brief online intervention using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) technique to target and reduce emotional eating. The intervention will be modeled after Frayn and Knäuper's 1-day ACT workshop for emotional eating intervention, which was derived from Forman and colleagues' &quot;Mind Your Health Program&quot;. During the workshop, the following topics will be discussed, based on the three processes of ACT: (1) values clarification/commitment, (2) acceptance/distress tolerance, and (3) mindfulness/awareness.</description>
