  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic ocular neuropathic pain may be misdiagnosed as dry eye disease. Our study aims to
      identify a population with previous monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms and differentiate
      neuropathic from dry eye pain using topical corneal naloxone hydrochloride.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Response to Hypertonic Saline (Muro 128) drop</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after hypertonic drop administered. Measured during both study visits, thus through study completion, an expected average of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The pain response is graded using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) survey. It is graded 1-10; 10 indicates the most severe pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At any point during study visit. Measured during both study visits, thus through study completion, an expected average of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This 12 question survey measures your recent dry eye symptoms using the ocular surface index scale. The scale has a low score of 10 and high score of 100. A higher score means you have worse dry eye symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after hypertonic saline drop. Measured during both study visits, thus through study completion, an expected average of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This test examines many areas of your eye (cornea, lids, inner eye) using a microscope.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flourescein corneal examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after hypertonic saline drop. Measured during both study visits, thus through study completion, an expected average of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A yellow staining dye will be applied to your cornea that will allow us to examine the structural integrity of your cornea.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>intraocular pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after hypertonic saline drop. Measured during both study visits, thus through study completion, an expected average of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure will be measured via Tono-Pen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after hypertonic saline drop. Measured during both study visits, thus through study completion, an expected average of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured using ETDRS letter grading system. Your grade will depend on your ability to read small print.</description>
