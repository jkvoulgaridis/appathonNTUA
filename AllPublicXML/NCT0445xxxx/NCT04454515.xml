  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is an α2 receptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties. In previous
      reports, dexmedetomidine improves smoothness of postoperative recovery and reduces
      intraoperatory imflammatory responses. As patients receiving breast surgeries are especially
      vulnerable to postoperative nausea/ vomiting, the dosage of narcotics and associated
      complications were concerned for not only comfortness but also postoperative oral intake and
      discharge. We aimed to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine infusion versus placebo on
      postoperative narcotics requirement, complications, and oral intake.

      Dexmedetomidine is an α2 receptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties. In previous
      reports, dexmedetomidine improves smoothness of postoperative recovery and reduces
      intraoperatory imflammatory responses. As patients receiving breast surgeries are especially
      vulnerable to postoperative nausea/ vomiting, the dosage of narcotics and associated
      complications were concerned for not only comfortness but also postoperative oral intake and
      discharge.

      We aimed to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine infusion versus placebo on postoperative
      narcotics requirement, complications, and oral intake.

      Our patients under general anesthesia and aged from 30 to 65 years old will be enrolled. All
      subjects were randomized into the dexmedetomidine or placebo group. They received placebo
      (group P, n = 30) or dexmedetomidine (loading dose of 1 μg kg−1 followed by 0.5 μg kg−1 h−1)
      (group D, n = 30) to the end of surgery.

      Data collected included intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption. Postoperative
      questionare including PONV, Pain intensity, I-FEED questionnaire. Prospective analysis will
      be performed on the prospectively collected data.

      We expected to examine if intraoperative dexmedetomidine decreases the postoperative opioid
      consumption and associated complications, and enhances the gastrointestinal recovery and oral
      intake with narcotic-sparing effect.
