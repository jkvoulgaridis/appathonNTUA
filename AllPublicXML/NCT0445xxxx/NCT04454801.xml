  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Expert-performance begins by focusing specifically on the end-product of training and
      experience in the hands of the expert. By defining expert behaviors and techniques,
      investigators can guide learners and non-expert practitioners by offering them models to
      emulate. At Toronto Western Hospital (TWH), there are more than ten expert attending regional
      anesthesiologists who routinely provide clinical patient care in the block room. The primary
      objective of this study is to qualitatively and quantitatively examine behavior of experts
      performing ultrasound guided regional anesthesia techniques to identify those which are
      consistent and unique, and which may underpin expert performance.

        This is a mixed methods assessment study to be completed at TWH. We will recruit 10
        fellowship-trained regional anesthesiology and pain medicine staff anesthesiologists to
        perform USGRA blocks while being video-recorded. Here, we specifically define expert as a
        staff anesthesiologist who has completed a fellowship in regional anesthesia and/or chronic
        pain and has at least 6-years of post-fellowship clinical experience with USGRA.

        Consent will also be sought from 180 patients undergoing USGRA for surgical procedures at
        TWH to have the block completed by an expert, as previously defined, and to have the
        procedure recorded.
