  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1/2 study, to evaluate
      TY101 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, effectiveness and immunogenicity
      in patients with Locally Advanced /Metastatic Solid Tumors and Relapsed or Refractory
      Lymphomas. The study includes two parts: dose escalation and expansion cohort to evaluate the
