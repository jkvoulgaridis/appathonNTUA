  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are major contributors for immobility and independency. Most falls in older adults
      occur during walking after a sudden unexpected loss of balance. It was well-established that
      balance can be improved by performance of a training program that provides perturbation
      (unexpected perturbations of balance). The main aim of the current study is to investigate
      the effects of two perturbation-training methods: 1) random perturbation training; vs. 2)
      block (non-random) perturbation training. We also aim to explore brain area's (as measured by
      MRI) that are related to balance function in older adults.

      We hypothesize that response to an unexpected loss of balance is the balance responses will
      be improved in both training methods, but more in the random training method. We also
      hypothesize that brain function as seen in MRI will be improved in both training methods,
      more in the random training method.

      As far as we know, there is a lack of studies investigating the learning effect of random vs.
      block non-random training on balance recovery responses while walking and exposure to
      unexpected loss of balance and on brain function.

      Goals:

        1. Determine the relationship between gait stability (as measured in the Lab) and brain
           function (MRI) in 50 old (70 years old and over) and 10 young adults (20-40 years old)
           that represent heathy brain.

        2. To determine which of the training intervention methods (25 older adults that
           participate in random training vs. 25 older adults that participate in block non-random
           training) are more beneficial for balance recovery responses and for improved brain
           function.

      Methods: This study is a clinical investigation study. First stage - Individuals that show an
      interest in participating in the study will be exposed to a brief interview before further
      testing is performed to see if they fit the inclusion-exclusion criteria. Individuals who
      pass the interview a screening, and physical examination and the additional questionnaires
      and functional tests described below.

      Second stage - Testing different motor learning paradigms for improving balance recovery
      ability: A convenience sample of 60 healthy subjects (10 young's, 50 older adults) will be
      recruited. After testing their clinical balance performance (Berg balance test, 6-minutes'
      walk and get up and go) and cognitive function (MOCA), All testing will occur on a specific
      motor-driven surface perturbation treadmill (BaMPer). The Gait protocol will include about
      10-20 minutes of comfortable pace walking, than progressive unexpected surface perturbations
      will be added. The same protocol will be performed with during standing condition. Subjects
      will also walk on the treadmill without perturbations. The order of the different test
      conditions will be randomized.

      Outcome measures: The stepping threshold as measured by the distance of the platform
      movements in centimeters will be measured. Quantitative parameters of the compensatory
      stepping/ and motor ability (i.e., step reaction time, step time, step length), descriptive
      parameters of the stepping strategy after perturbation

      (i.e., arm responses, upper body responses, leg step threshold and fall threshold). In
      addition, we will be testing the correlation between brain activity and anatomy using brain
      imaging in 10 young and 50 older adults and correlate with balance/motor function.

      The aims of this study are to determine the relationship between the different requirements
      for gait stability (walking without perturbations, ability to overcome small perturbations,
      ability to overcome larger perturbations and, largest recoverable perturbation during
      walking) and brain function and anatomy. The research hypothesis: there is a correlation
      between the age related atrophies in areas of the brain and functional capacity

      Third stage - A Randomized control trial we will compare two perturbation motor learning
      paradigms with different challenge level of the practice condition (i.e. blocked practice vs
      random practice). According to motor learning theory we hypothesize that a) healthy older
      adults will benefit more from random practice. The purpose of this stage is to investigate
      the effects of task practice order (random vs blocked) on motor learning (i.e. responding to
      perturbations during walking) in older adults. According to motor learning theory we
      hypothesize that a) healthy older adults will benefit more from the random motor learning
      approach as compared to using blocked practice.

    <description>participants will be instructed to stand upright on the force platform with the feet positioned as close as possible (heels and toes touching). A total of six 30-second trials will conduct for two visual conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. Balance measurements will be collected with a Kistler 9287 single force platform (Kistler Instrument Corp, Winterthur, Switzerland), which measures the time-varying displacement of the center of pressure (CoP) under the participant's feet. The force platform data will be sampled at a frequency of 100 Hz and stored on a hard disk for later processing.</description>
