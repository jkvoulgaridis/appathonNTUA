      identification of optimal duration for hamstring muscle stretch by using 3 different time of
      stretch 15,30,60 seconds .100 subjects will be participated in this study divided into 4

      Abstract:

      OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of variable stretching intervals on neural function and ROM.

      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial Participants: In this trial, 100 participants will
      participate in the study diagnosed with tight hamstring muscles (defined as the inability to
      extend the knee to less than 20Â° of knee flexion) were randomly assigned to the control group
      or one of the 3 intervention groups Interventions: The three experimental groups will
      stretched 5 times per week for 4 weeks for 15, 30, and 60 seconds, respectively the control
      group did not stretch Main Outcome Measures: The neurophysiological outcome measures included
      peak to peak somatosensory evoked potential for dermatomes L3,L4,L5, and S1. Secondary
      outcome measures included knee ROM. All outcome measures will be assessed immediately after
      the treatment session and 24 hours after the treatment session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects had to demonstrate &quot;tight&quot; hamstring muscles, defined as inability to extend
             the knee to less than 20 degrees of knee flexion with the femur held at 90 degrees of
             hip flexion while the person was positioned supine. Subjects were also screened to
             rule out knee joint flexion contractures by checking knee extension ROM, while they
             were lying in a prone position

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Using of medical aids, and suffering from any neurological or cognitive impairment,
             limiting cardio-respiratory conditions, or had undergone recent surgery (within the
             past 12 months). Having any hip or knee replacements or any history of pathology in
             the low back, hips, or knees for the 3 months prior to the study
