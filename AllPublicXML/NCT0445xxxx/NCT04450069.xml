  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLBR001 + SWI019 is an combination investigational immunotherapy being evaluated as a
      potential treatment for patients diagnosed with B cell malignancies who are refractory or
      unresponsive to salvage therapy or who cannot be considered for or have progressed after
      autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. This first-in-human study will assess the
      safety and tolerability of CLBR001 + SWI019 and is designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal SWI019 dose (OSD). Patients will be administered a single
      infusion of CLBR001 cells followed by cycles of SWI019. The study will also assess the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CLBR001 + SWI019.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLBR001 + SWI019 is a two-component therapy comprising an autologous chimeric antigen
      receptor T (CAR-T) cell product (CLBR001, the switchable CAR-T cell (sCAR-T)) and an
      anti-CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19) antibody (SWI019, the switch, a biologic).
      In combination, SWI019 acts as an adapter molecule that controls the activity of the CLBR001
      CAR-T cell product.
