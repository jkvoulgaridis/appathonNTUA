  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain may lead to several alterations in the brain activity and sensory perception
      (i.e. pain). Around 80% of professional musicians experience prolonged episodes of
      musculoskeletal pain throughout their careers, a percentage that is four times higher than in
      the general population. With this background, the intended experiment aims at understanding
      the role of several biological factors associated to sensorimotor training that can lead to
      alteration of the brain activity and, consequently, pain processing.
