  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labour induction is an obstetrical procedure, which artificially starts the process of cervix
      dilation, in order to induce labour. Several methods of labour induction exist : mechanical
      ones (using dilatation balloons) or pharmacological ones (using prostaglandins or oxytocin).
      This trial aims to compare, in case of non-favourable cervix, the strategy of labour
      induction using the Propess® method first (Dino-first) versus the strategy beginning with the
      use of a dilatation balloon (Ballon-first), with respect of the usual practice and the
      current guidelines.
