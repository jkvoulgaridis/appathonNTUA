      This trial studies the benefits of an exercise and diet counseling program in improving
      quality of life in stage I-III breast cancer survivors. Exercise and diet counseling may help
      improve weight loss and relevant clinical and patient-reported outcomes in overweight or
      obese breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering a community-based, comprehensive lifestyle
      weight management (LWM) intervention to 20 overweight or obese breast cancer (BC) survivors.

      II. Explore preliminary efficacy of the community-based, comprehensive LWM intervention for
      producing meaningful improvements in select clinically-relevant anthropometric, fitness,
      functional, and patient-reported outcomes in BC survivors.

      III. Provide the effect size estimates necessary to inform the design of a subsequent R01
      application addressing a large scale, optimally powered, randomized controlled,
      community-based LWM comparative efficacy intervention trial targeting weight loss in BC
      survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo aerobic exercise over 10-30 minutes and resistance exercise comprising 1-3
      sets of 8-12 repetitions of 10 different exercises over 1 hour for 24 weeks. Patients also
      receive behavioral activity counseling once a week and nutritional counseling over 30 minutes
      for 10 sessions after center-based exercise sessions during months 1-2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <measure>Mobility disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the 400-meter walk test. Will be analyzed using paired samples t-tests. Statistical significance will be assumed at p =&lt; 0.05, and results will be based on two-tailed statistical tests. Mean change from baseline, paired sample t-test, and effect size estimates will be calculated for each outcome measure. Analyses will be conducted using the intent-to-treat principle to account for missing data with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach, used to impute change across time to be zero. Additionally, effect sizes (Cohen?s d) will be calculated by taking the mean difference and dividing by the pooled standard deviation to determine the magnitude of differences observed for each outcome.</description>

    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory is a 9-item scale scored on an 11-point rating scale ranging from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). Higher scores represent greater levels of fatigue. In this form, there are 5 overarching questions. The first one asks, &quot;Have you felt unusually tired or fatigued in the last week?&quot; which is simply a Yes or No response. The next 4 questions then have answers in terms of a scale. The next 3 have the following sliding scale: 0= No Fatigue, 10= As bad as you can imagine, with 1-9 each representing intermediate responses. For the last question, the scale is: 0= Does not interfere, 10= Completely interferes, with 1-9 representing individual intermediate responses.</description>
