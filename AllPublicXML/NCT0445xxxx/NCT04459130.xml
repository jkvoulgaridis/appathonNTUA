    <textblock>
      Obesity, which is an important public health problem of the last century globally, affects
      not only adults but also children and young people. Reducing childhood obesity requires
      effective lifestyle changes and behavioral interventions aimed at healthy nutrition, physical
      activity and stress management.

      to reduce childhood obesity, including school-based multi-component behavioral research in
      Turkey it has not been demonstrated to parents.

      The program, which is planned to be carried out and aims to reduce overweight and obesity in
      children, is a school-based parenting lifestyle intervention involving multiple behaviors.
      The program includes family visits, game-based physical activity activities with children,
      healthy eating recommendations and healthy eating activities with parent participation. The
      program planned to be implemented was developed to evaluate whether healthy preferences and
      lifestyle intervention reduce obesity. The aim of this study is to make the positive health
      behaviors permanent in children, to be a guide for combating childhood obesity and to be
      useful for future research. to be applied to the research, nutrition consists of 10 sessions,
      physical activity, including issues such as coping with healthy ways with stress Child
      Obesity Program (COP), it is thought to overcome this deficiency was needed in Turkey.

    <description>Firstly, overweight and obese students will be determined by measuring their height and weight. While selecting children for the experimental group, random numbers table will be used. As a result of statistical analysis, 33 students will be selected to the Experiment group. Child Obesity Program (COP) will be applied to students in the experimental group for 10 weeks. Before the program is implemented, children's height, weight, subcutaneous adipose tissue measurements will be made. The pedometer wristband will be distributed.
Pretest: BMI, weight average, subcutaneous adipose tissue measurement and application of scales
- Children's Dietary Self- Efficacy Scale-CDSS
- Food Behavior Scale
- Child Heart Health Development Attitude Scale (exercise, stress, nutrition subscales)

    <description>Firstly, overweight and obese students will be determined by measuring their height and weight. When selecting children for the control group, random numbers table will be used. As a result of statistical analysis, 33 students will be selected to the Control group. First, children's height, weight, subcutaneous adipose tissue measurements will be made. The pedometer wristband will be distributed. The control group will be trained for a daily healthy diet and physical activity.
