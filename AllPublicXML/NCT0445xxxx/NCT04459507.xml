    <description>Mean and distribution of DLQI scores at baseline will be reported. DLQI instrument consists of 10 questions covering six domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and bother with psoriasis treatment).

It measures absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the impairments in unpaid activity because of health problem during the past seven days. It consists of 6-item questionnaire looks at the effect of health problems on ability to work and perform regular activities. The WPAI yields 4 types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Every 6 Months Up to 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with a PGA score of 1 or less (0 or 1) will be reported.

DLQI instrument consists of 10 questions covering six domains (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and bother with psoriasis treatment). The response options range from 0, not affected at all, to 3, very much affected. This gives an overall range of 0 to 30 where lower scores mean better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EQ5D-5L Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Every 6 Months Up to 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in EQ5D-5L index score will be reported. The EQ-5D-5L is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Every 6 Months Up to 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in WPAI will be reported. WPAI questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in both paid work and unpaid work. It measures absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the impairments in unpaid activity because of health problem during the past seven days. The higher the score the greater impact on productivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with adverse events and serious Adverse Events will be reported. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding or lack of expected pharmacological action), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product.</description>
