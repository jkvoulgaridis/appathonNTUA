    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the preliminary effects of home-based M1-SO
      applied tDCS on clinical pain in persons with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD),to
      evaluate the preliminary effects of home-based M1-SO applied tDCS on pain-related cortical
      response in persons with early-stage AD and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      home-based M1-SO applied tDCS for pain management in persons with early-stage AD.
