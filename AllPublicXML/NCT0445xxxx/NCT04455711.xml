  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough suppression during emergence and tracheal extubation from general anaesthesia has
      become an important issue as part of patient safety. Cough arised from the mechanical
      irritation of endotracheal tube and cuff could be accompanied by various adverse effects such
      as laryngospasm, hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia and increase of intracranial,
      intraocular, or intra-abdominal pressure.

      Several cough-preventing strategies have been proposed for smooth emergence, such as opioids,
      dexmedetomidine or lidocaine. Maintenance of remifentanil infusion during emergence has been
      reported to be an effective method in reducing cough and cardiovascular change without delay
      of recovery. In previous studies, the effetive effect-site concentraions for 95% of adults
      (EC95) for preventing cough are a little different depending on anaestheic agent, type of
      surgery and sex, ranged from 2.14 to 2.94 ng/ml. However, since most of these studies are for
      sing lumen endotracheal tube, similar preventing effect would not be expected for double
      lumen tube (DLT) because of its large diameter and long length. Another problem is higher
      concentration of remifentanil more than 2.5 ng/ml could not guarantee the safety after
      extubation. The efficacy of a single IV bolus of lidocaine for the prevention of cough has
      been the subject of numerous trials.

      Therefore, combined use of lidocaine and remifentanil could effectively prevent emergence
      cough for DLT without the risk of high concentration of remifentanil.
