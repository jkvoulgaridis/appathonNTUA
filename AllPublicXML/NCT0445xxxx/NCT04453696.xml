      The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of dentist-patient communication
      via social media on dental anxiety, and second, to evaluate the appropriate timing of such
      communications.

      Instagram's quick replies system was used to answer patients' questions to alleviate dental
      anxiety for patients undergoing impacted mandibular third-molar extraction under local
      anesthesia. Patients were assigned randomly into four groups according to timing of such
      communications: Communication before operation (n=36), Communication after operation (n=35),
      Communication before and after operation (n=36), and a control group who received no
      communication on social media (n=36). Dental anxiety was evaluated one week before and after
      the surgical operation using recognized assessment scales—the Spielberger's State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory, Modified Dental Anxiety Scale and a visual analog scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS scale was included in the present study to determine how anxious the patients felt according to their own thoughts. Scores range from 0 (no anxiety) to 10 (extreme anxiety).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T and STAI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>STAI-S, like kinetic energy, refers to a palpable reaction or process taking place at a given time and level of intensity. STAI-T, like potential energy, refers to individual differences in reactions. Both of STAI-S and STAI-T scales includes 20 questions. For each question, the scores range from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) points. For both scales, the sum of the scores ranges from 20 to 80. A score between 36 and 41 refers to a mean anxiety level, with values greater than 41 classified as a high level of anxiety.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MDAS consists of 5 questions that measure anxiety at different stages of dental treatment. The options range from 1 (not anxious) to 5 (very anxious) for each question. The sum of the scores varies from 5 to 25; values between 19 and 25 indicate a high level of dental anxiety.</description>
