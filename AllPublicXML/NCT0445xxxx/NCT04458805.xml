      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study.
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a single ascending dose (SAD) part (Part A) followed
      by a multiple ascending dose (MAD) part (Part B).

      The decision to escalate between dose levels and proceed to Part B will be based upon review
      of blinded available safety data by a Safety Review Committee.

    <description>Dose escalation in Part A will be conducted in 5 cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 5). Seven participants will be enrolled in each cohort and randomized to receive either NX-13 or placebo (ratio 5:2). NX-13 will be administered to Cohort 1 participants at the starting dose of 250 mg and increased in each new cohort. Five nominal dose levels in the range of 250 to 4000 mg have been selected for evaluation in Part A. The starting dose level in Part B will be determined by the SRC based on safety and tolerability data obtained in Part A. A dose level will only be evaluated in Part B if determined to be safe and tolerable in Part A. It is anticipated that 3 dose levels will be evaluated in Part B in a total of 3 cohorts (Cohorts 6 to 8). Seven participants will be enrolled in each cohort and will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of either NX-13 or placebo (ratio 5:2), once daily for seven days. NX-13 dose levels to be evaluated in Part B will be in the range of 500 to 4000 mg.</description>
