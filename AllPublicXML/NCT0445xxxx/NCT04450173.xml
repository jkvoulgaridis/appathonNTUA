      This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab, ibrutinib, and venetoclax work in treating
      patients with previously untreated stage II-IV follicular lymphoma. Immunotherapy with
      obinutuzumab may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib and venetoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving obinutuzumab, ibrutinib, and
      venetoclax together may work better in treating follicular lymphoma compared to each drug
      alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab combined with venetoclax and ibrutinib in
      patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) (determined by a positron
      emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT] complete response [CR] rate at 12 months
      as per International Workshop Lymphoma Response Criteria, Cheson 2014).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of obinutuzumab in combination with venetoclax and
      ibrutinib in patients with untreated FL as assessed by frequency, severity, and relatedness
      of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) as well as frequency of treatment-emergent AEs
      requiring discontinuation or dose reduction of study drug.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with venetoclax and ibrutinib in
      subjects with untreated FL as assessed by CR at 30 months, overall response rate (ORR) (CR +
      partial response [PR]), duration of response (DOR), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment
      (TTNT), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of
      cycle 1, day 1 of cycles 2-6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24. Patients also receive
      venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 (days 4-28 of cycle 1) and ibrutinib PO
      QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
