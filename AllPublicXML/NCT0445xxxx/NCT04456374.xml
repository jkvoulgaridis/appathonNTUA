  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate physiological characteristics, body composition and
      performance indicators among youth soccer players of four age categories (U-12, U-14, U-16,
      and U-18). Participants will undergo assessment of their body weight, body height and percent
      of body fat as well as performance testing including flexibility, strength, vertical jump,
      speed, repeated sprint ability, agility, dribbling and endurance.

      This study aims at investigating anthropometric, body composition and performance indicators
      among male youth soccer players. The study will be conducted prior to the preparation period.
      Initially, participants and their parents (for those under 18 years) will be informed about
      the benefits, risks and discomforts associated with the study and will provide a written
      consent. Participants will be instructed to refrain from strenuous exercise for at least 48
      hours prior to testing and they will be also asked to consume their normal diet. Prior to
      testing all participants will be familiarized with testing procedures and specific test. Body
      weight will be measured on a seca beam balance. Participants' height will be measured by
      using a fixed stadiometer and the percent body fat will be calculated with bioelectrical
      impedance analysis. Flexibility will be assessed by using the sit and reach test and the
      lower body explosive strength will be determined through vertical jump testing (squat jump
      and counter movement jump without arm swing). Knee flexor and extensor strength will be
      assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Sprint performance will be assessed from a standing
      start over by infrared photocells with participants running 10m and 30m as fast as they can.
      The repeated sprint ability will be tested by using linear sprint test including 5 maximum
      sprints of 30 meters with a 25-second recovery period in-between. Maximal oxygen consumption
      (VO2max) will be determined by open-circuit spirometry via breath-by-breath analysis during a
      graded exercise test to exhaustion on a treadmill. Furthermore, participants will be
      evaluated in agility by using the short dribbling test and the ability to recover after
      repeated intense exercise through the YO-YO Intermittent Recovery test 1 (only for u-16 and
      U-18 groups).
