    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal study to determine whether light therapy can improve non-motor and motor
      function in Parkinson's disease, on top of current best medical treatment.

      Six month double blind, randomized controlled study with virtual clinic visits at baseline,
      week 13 and week 26. The Celeste specialized phototherapy device is similar to a tablet with
      a stand that allows the device to be angled towards the participant's face. The light is to
      be used each evening in the home for 1 hour, while the participant watches TV, eats dinner,
      reads, etc. The primary outcome measure is Parts 1 and 2 of the Movement Disorders
      Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 and 2
      measure non-motor and motor function in Parkinson's. Participants will be assessed via online
      videoconferences.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a six-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study with visits at screening, baseline, weeks 13 and 26, and blinded coordinator calls throughout the study for safety and efficacy assessments. This study will use a remote trial design, which will allow participants to be recruited nationally and evaluated centrally using video conferencing. All study participants will have their eligibility assessed and confirmed by a study coordinator and a PD specialist (primary investigator). Participants will complete the secondary outcome measures, which are Patient Response Outcomes (PRO's), and will be assisted by a blinded coordinator to ensure completeness of answers. A blinded investigator will conduct the Primary Outcome Measure as well as the Clinician's Global Impression assessments. All assessments will be conducted by video at Baseline, Week 13, and Week 26 visits.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Subjects will receive either the investigational device, or an identical device which produces the same bandwidths (color) of light, but at different intensities. A Device Technician, separate from the trial, will assist the participants in the device setup. Participants will be instructed not to disclose any aspects of their device. All study staff will be masked. A separate Medical Monitor may become unmasked if the participants experience a serious adverse event that may be related to the therapy.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Parts 1+2</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the sum of the MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 and 2. These subscales are described in more detail below:
MDS-UPDRS Part 1: Non-motor impact of experiences of daily living. Part I has 13 questions, the first 6 are assessed by the examiner, and the remaining 7 are usually self assessed, but may include the patient's caregiver. Each question = 0-4, range= 0 - 65, with higher scores representing worse severity.
MDS-UPDRS Part II: Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living: This portion of the scale assesses the motor impact of PD on patients' experiences of daily living. There are 13 questions which are a component of the self-administered Patient Questionnaire. Each question = 0-4, range = 0-65. with higher scores representing worse severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 39 question Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a patient-reported rating scale for quality of life in Parkinson's disease. Respondents affirm if they have experienced problems due to their disease using a five point scale from never (0 points) to always (4 points, or worse) in doing common activities. The PDQ-39 is comprised of 8 domains: mobility, emotion, activities of daily living, cognition, stigma, social support, communication, bodily discomfort. Total possible range of scores = 0 - 156, with higher scores representing worse severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness to help in diagnosing sleep disorders. The ESS questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 (none) to 3 (worse) for eight different everyday situations. The total range is 0 - 24, with higher scores representing worse severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement is an assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's global functioning. Participants are ranked &quot;O&quot; at baseline. The CGI-I ranks 0 - 7, with &quot;0&quot; being much improved, &quot;4&quot; being neutral, and &quot;7&quot; being much worse.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory -II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question multiple choice inventory to measure the severity of depression. Each question is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. The cutoffs used are: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; and 29-63: severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2) is designed to assess nocturnal disability in Parkinson's disease. The PDSS-2 is a 15 question analog scale that ranks answers from 0 - 4, with 4 being worse. (Question 1 is an exception, where 4 is better and 0 is worse). In addition to an overall assessment of sleep disability three aspects of sleep problems can be obtained; disturbed sleep (total of questions 1-3, 8 and 14), PD-specific nocturnal motor symptoms (total of questions 4-6, 12 and 13), and PD-specific nocturnal symptoms (Total of questions 7, 9-11 and 15).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The MoCA will be used at screening and again at Week 26, mainly for characterization purposes and to assist the site investigators in their decisions to include participants in the trial. An efficacy analysis may be conducted at the end of the study. Higher scores indicate better cognitive function, while a score below 26 may indicate mild cognitive impairment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-assessed, health related, quality of life questionnaire. The scale measures quality of life on a 5-component scale including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The instrument comprises a short descriptive system questionnaire covering five areas which assess quality of life issues, and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) that provides a simple descriptive profile of a respondent's health state. The 5L refers to five levels (0-4) of increasing severity for each question.</description>

    <description>The Celeste device resembles a large tablet. It has a protective cover that folds into a stand and is magnetically attached to the back of the device. It produces a low intensity of specific bandwidths of light believed to be responsible for circadian and alerting responses in humans. The overall emission produces a pleasing soft glow of light.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Control device is identical in appearance to Celeste. When turned on, the device emits a soft diffused light that is indistinguishable in color from the Active Device. However, this device produces a minimal amount of the specific wavelengths thought to be effective in the Active Device.</description>
