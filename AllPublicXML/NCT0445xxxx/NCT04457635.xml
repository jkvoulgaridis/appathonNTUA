  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of brief
      versus short psychotherapy in subjects with substantial mental complaints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Running evaluations of the brief intervention (BI) at our outpatient clinic preceding to this
      study had given us the impression that the patients obtained a more active coping style
      towards their health problems with consequential enhanced work participation (WP). These
      evaluations, in addition to our experiences in BI for low back pain (LBP) has generated the
      current hypothesis of this study towards WP. Yet, the sustainability of WP and long-term
      effects on mental health remained questionable. In this pragmatic RCT the objective was to
      compare brief psychotherapy with focus on normalization and coping (Brief-PsT) with
      short-term psychotherapy of standard duration with more extended focus (Short-PsT), as
      otherwise used at the Mental Health services. The primary aim of this study was to assess
      differences in effect on WP and the secondary aim was to assess differences in clinical
      response. The investigators hypothesized that in the short term, Brief-PsT could facilitate
      or sustain WP in a superior fashion to Short-PsT in persons who are on, or at risk of sick
      leave due to mental health problems. Although the investigators expected a substantial
      long-term rate of clinical recovery and reduction in mental health-related symptoms in both
      groups, the investigators had no specific hypothesis regarding the extent and direction of
      possible group differences in these clinical measurements.

    <description>The focus was on normalizing, accepting and coping with their present mental health complaints and their hindrance for work participation. Primarily, there was no intention to process previous pathogenic experiences. The standard duration was set on six sessions.</description>

    <description>With more extended focus, there was besides coping of mental health and challenges concerning WP, an emphasis on both an extensive anamnesis and possibility to establish a so-called central theme based on previous or current challenging issues such as trauma, difficult childhood conditions, and personality-related issues. Additional aims of the intervention could include reducing symptoms and problematic behaviour and an improvement of home situation, with deeper focus on cognitive maladaptive coping strategies or dynamic repetitions. The number of sessions was aimed to be 20 on average</description>
