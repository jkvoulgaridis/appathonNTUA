  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if intensive management of at-risk participants,
      utilizing longitudinal patient tracking, proactive outreach, multidisciplinary action
      planning and careful outcomes monitoring, will lead to better patient outcomes than usual
      care.

      At-risk participants will be randomized 1:1 to either usual care or intensive management
      utilizing longitudinal patient tracking, proactive outreach, multidisciplinary action
      planning and careful outcomes monitoring for 6 months. Participants in the intervention group
      will be assigned to a partnership of one nurse practitioner and one medical assistant who
      will manage them with the support of the study team. Staff will focus on contacting all
      patients within one week of any emergency department visit or hospital discharge, contacting
      all highest-risk participants weekly and all participants monthly, and completing
      high-priority tasks for participant care within one week. The primary outcomes of this
      quality improvement study are inpatient bed days and number of inpatient admissions.
