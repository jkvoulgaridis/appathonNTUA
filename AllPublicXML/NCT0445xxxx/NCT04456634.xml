      Phase 1, single -center study in 2 parts. The study designs for each part are well
      established for first-in-human studies and are appropriate to assess safety, tolerability and
      preliminary pharmacokinetics&amp; pharmacodynamics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, single centre, phase 1 trial.

      Eight healthy males or females, aged between 18-55 years old, who meet all of the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be enrolled.

      The study will be composed of 2 groups to be enrolled sequentially.

      • Group 1a (sentinel group): two participants will be randomised single-blinded such that one
      participant will receive AL+Rux and the other participant will receive AL+placebo.

      After review of the safety and tolerability data up to and including Day 8 from Group 1a by
      the Safety Review Committee (SRC), a decision to proceed with Group 1b will be made.

      • Group 1b will be composed of 6 participants, to be randomised single-blinded such that five
      participants will receive AL+Rux, and one participant will receive AL+placebo.

          2. Contactable and available for the duration of the trial and for up to two weeks
             following the EOS visit.

          3. Total body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg, and a body mass index (BMI) within
             the range of 18 to 32 kg/m2 (inclusive) at Screening and Day -1. BMI is an estimate of
             body weight adjusted for height. It is calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms
             by the square of the height in metres.

             Health status

          4. Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history,
             full physical examination and special investigations).

          5. Vital signs measured after 5 min in the supine position:

               -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) - 90-140 mmHg,

               -  Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) - 40-90 mmHg,

               -  Heart rate (HR) 40-100 bpm.

          6. ECG parameters for both males and females: QT ≤ 500 msec, QTcF ≤450 msec, QTcB ≤450
             msec; PR interval ≤210 msec.

          7. Heterosexual female participants of childbearing potential who have, or may have, male
             sexual partners during the course of the study should be using an insertable (implant
             or IUD), injectable, transdermal or combination oral contraceptive approved by the TGA
             combined with a barrier contraceptive from the time of informed consent until EOS.
             Abstinent female participants must agree to start a double method if they start a
             sexual relationship with a male during the trial. Female participants must not be
             planning in vitro fertilisation within the required contraception period.

             Women of non-childbearing potential who will not require contraception during the
             trial are defined as: surgically sterile (tubal ligation is not considered surgically
             sterile), post-menopausal (spontaneous amenorrhoea for ≥12 months, or spontaneous
             amenorrhoea for 6-12 months and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥40 IU/mL; either
             should be together with the absence of oral contraceptive use for &gt;12 months).

             Male participants who have, or may have female sexual partners during the course of
             the study must agree to use a double method of contraception including condom plus
             diaphragm, or condom plus stable insertable (implant or IUD), injectable, transdermal
             or combination oral contraceptive by the female partner, from the time of informed
             consent through to EOS. Abstinent male participants must agree to start a double
             method if they begin a sexual relationship with a female during the trial, and through
             to EOS. Male participants with female partners that are surgically sterile or
             post-menopausal, or male participants who have undergone sterilisation and have had
             testing to confirm the success of the sterilisation, may also be included and will not
             be required to use above described methods of contraception.
