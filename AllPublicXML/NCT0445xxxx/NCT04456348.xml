  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center prospective cohort study. We will continuously recruit subjects
      with silent cerebrovascular disease aged 60 to 85 years from Shanghai and Guizhou. Data
      including demographic characteristics, medical history, other concomitant diseases,
      neurological function assessments, laboratory examinations, imaging examinations, and other
      clinical data and health economics survey responses will be collected from all subjects.

      At baseline, all subjects will undergo gait assessment using the intelligent system and
      cognitive function scale assessment by clinicians. According to the intelligent gait results,
      the subjects will be divided into normal and abnormal gait groups. All subjects will be
      observed naturally for 1 year, and all medical behaviors will be recorded. All subjects will
      be interviewed by telephone for the occurrence of vascular events and changes in medical
      behaviors at half a year after enrollment and followed up at 1 year after enrollment,
      including gait evaluation using the intelligent system and cognitive function scale
      evaluation by clinicians. During the follow-up period, patients can visit the hospital for
      follow-up at any time when their condition changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The neurological function of all subjects was assessed based on the following tests under the
      guidance of a physician. The timed up-and-go test was used to evaluate the subjects' gait
      function, requiring them to stand up from their seat and walk straight forward for 3 meters,
      turn around, walk straight back to the chair, and then sit down again. Using simple cognitive
      evaluation (Mini-Cognitive Assessment) screening of the subjects' memory and executive
      function, the participants will first be asked to remember three unrelated words and
      immediately repeat the three words; they will then be asked to draw a clock marked with the
      numbers and pointers, and eventually recall the three words. The verbal function of the
      subjects will be assessed using the verbal retelling items in the MMSE and Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment, asking the subjects to clearly repeat &quot;44 stone lions,&quot; &quot;I only know Zhang Liang
      came to help today,&quot; and &quot;the cat always hid under the sofa when the dog was in the room.&quot;
      Through the camera image data record, the intelligent system uses the built-in intelligent
      algorithm for intelligent video gait recognition and neural networks based on depth
      interpretation automation and automatic access to the subjects' gait characteristics
      (stand-up time, turnaround time, stride length, step velocity, stride length, step width,
      etc.), language features (pronunciation, intonation, word order, language accuracy, language
      fluency, etc.), and clock features.
