  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is excessive fat build-up in the liver with insulin
      resistance due to causes other than alcohol use.The obesity epidemic is closely associated
      with the rising prevalence and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Currently, the
      only treatment modality for patients with fatty liver disease is weight loss and exercise
      which is challenging for most patients. Therefore, a huge need exists for an alternative
      approach to reducing alanine transaminase (ALT) &amp; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels for
      these patients. Low level laser light therapy (LLLT) offers a simple, non-invasive, safe,
      effective and side-effect free alternative to achieving this goal, through LLLT's proven
      ability to effect weight loss, body circumference reduction and lipid profile modification

    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common disorder and refers to a group of
      conditions where there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver of people who drink little
      or no alcohol. The most common form of NAFLD is a non serious condition called fatty liver.

      NAFLD is part of the metabolic syndrome characterized by diabetes, or pre-diabetes (insulin
      resistance), being overweight or obese, elevated blood lipids such as cholesterol and
      triglycerides, as well as high blood pressure. A few studies have suggested that weight loss
      may be associated with regression of fat within the liver. Therefore, the most important
      recommendations for people with fatty liver are to lose weight if they are overweight or
      obese, increase their physical activity, follow a balanced diet and unnecessary medications.

      Several studies have investigated low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or light-emitting diode
      (LED) therapy and have made advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms LLLT
      in biological systems. Few studies explain the effect of low level laser therapy on liver
      enzymes and non alcoholic fatty liver risk factors (as obesity).So, our goal was to perform a
      randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of the LLLT on lipid profile, body
      weight and liver enzymes
