         11. Patients with a history or current evidence of any concomitant condition, therapy, or
             laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the
             results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation and compliance;

         12. Women who are lactating or pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test within 7 days
             before first treatment;

         13. Male and female subjects who are unwilling to use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g.
             concomitant use of a spermicidal agent, barrier contraceptive, or/and intrauterine
             contraceptive) during the study and for at least 7 months after the last dose of
             GQ1001;
