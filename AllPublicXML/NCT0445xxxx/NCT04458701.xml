  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to assess the impact of implementing a hemodynamic optimization
      protocol, utilizing flow guided parameters that is provided by technology from Edwards
      Lifesciences, for patients undergoing high risk cardiac surgery. Importantly, this project is
      being targeted as a QI initiative because there is no evaluation of new technology or
      procedures. All technologies and procedures are currently being used for patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery. Rather this project is evaluating the implementation of a multi-dispclinary
      developed protocol that seeks to remove variability in which providers are currently treating
      patients hemodynamics during and acutely after cardiac surgery. Previous research has
      demonstrated that implementation of hemodynamic management protocols improves perioperative
      outcome in surgical patients. This project seeks to evaluate the impact of implementing this
      protocol as the new clinical standard for high-risk cardiac surgery patients. Specifically,
      this protocol would be a comprehensive hemodynamic management strategy that would-be
      initiated in the operating room post-bypass and then continued for the first 12 hours in the
      intensive care unit (see figure below). To restate, all technologies and procedures are
      currently being performed for these patients, however, there has not been a protocol guiding
      how practionioners use this technology. The project is evaluating the impact of protocolized
      treatment strategies. Importantly this protocol has been designed, reviewed and agreed by the
      motivation of the physicians who are currently responsible for managing these patients
      hemodynamics. Since this project does involve alterations in procedures or technologies we
      are seeking to proceed as a quality improvement project. Additionally the protocol is one
      that has been reviewed and agreed to provide the optimal management strategy for these
      patients. This again is the overall focus of this project, to implement a hemodynamic
      management protocol to improve outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
