  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: nonspecific shoulder pain is very common and the symptoms can persist for 6 to 12
      months in half of patients. Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (US-guided PNM) is
      an intervention based in an electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve through a needle
      located close to the target nerve by the use of an ultrasound guidance.

      Objectives: the primary aim is to determine changes in strength after US-guided PNM or
      Ultrasound-guided Dry Needling (US-guided DN) intervention in the Suprascapular Nerve (SN) as
      well as its effectiveness in changes of muscle function, pain and disability.

      Methods: randomised clinical trial (ratio 1:1), single-blind (examiners), parallel, with
      assessment of third parties. 62 adult participants with unilateral mechanical chronic
      nonspecific shoulder pain with at least 3-month evolution and shoulder muscle weakness will
      randomised to one of two procedures: US-guided PNM or US-guided DN. It will be assessed
      muscle strength, muscle function, pain and disability before, just after, a week and a month
      after the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is the third reason for medical consultation in the world. Many treatment
      techniques have been proposed. Neuromodulation techniques through the application of an
      analgesic electric current using a needle as an electrode, are increasingly used in the
      treatment of pain.

      In this study, the investigators will compare whether the application of a neuromodulation
      technique is more effective than applying the dry needling technique in isolation.

    <measure>Muscle Force</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline force at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Force will be measured by a manual dynamometer (microFET®2, Hoggan Scientific LLC). Measurements will be taken in Newtons (N). It will be evaluated in the movements of external rotation and abduction of both shoulders.
Manual dynamometry has proven to be a tool with excellent intra-examiner reliability to assess isometric force in external rotation of the shoulder, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.96 (0.93-0.98). The minimum value is 0 and de Maximum values is 55</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline pain at 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. The VAS is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and ten the other end representing &quot;worst pain.&quot; Subjects will be asked to rate their current pain with a mark on the scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be measured by Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI).The Spanish version of SPADI has high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.89-0.93).The clinically important minimum difference varies between 8 and 13.2. The minimum value is 0 and de maximum value is 100</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline muscle function at 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle function will be measured by an ultrasound scanner (VINNO® E35; VINNO ULTRASOUND S.L.U. ©, Barcelona, Spain) with a linear transducer with a frequency range of 6-16MHz (X6-16L, 5cm footprint) will be used. The unit of measurement used will be millimeters. Muscle thickness at rest and contraction will be measured. On the other hand, the percentage of change in thickness will be measured using the equation (Shrinkage thickness - Rest thickness) * 100 / Rest thickness.</description>
