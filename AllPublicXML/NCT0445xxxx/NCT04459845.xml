  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy in delivering two evidence-based parenting programs
      to families and young children experiencing homelessness. Outcomes evaluated include
      feasibility, treatment completion, treatment satisfaction of delivery of interventions as
      well as child outcomes (e.g., behavior problems, trauma symptoms) and parenting outcomes
      (parenting stress and parenting skills).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of homeless families in the U.S. has increased since the 1980s to over half a
      million as of 2018. Most troubling, in 2013 (the most recent year for which census data is
      available) one in every 30 children in the U.S., or 2.5 million, experienced homelessness. In
      addition to having disproportionally higher rates of unmet health needs (e.g., acute health
      problems, trauma-related injuries), children experiencing homelessness have staggering mental
      health needs such that 78% suffer from at least one mental health issue (e.g., depression,
      behavior problems) along with academic/developmental delays. Given that over half of all
      homeless children in the US are under the age of 6, it is particularly important to
      investigate the effectiveness of evidence-based parenting programs within a homeless
      population. This study aims to compare the efficacy in delivering two evidence-based
      parenting programs to families and young children experiencing homelessness.

    <description>Parent-child Interaction therapy (PCIT; Eyberg and Robinson, 1982) s a manualized evidence-based behavioral parent training program that integrates social learning and attachment theories. Parents proceed through two distinct phases: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) resembles traditional play therapy, and Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI) resembles clinical behavior therapy. During all sessions, the therapist coaches each parent in vivo in their use of the CDI and PDI skills with their child.</description>

    <description>Child-parent psychotherapy (CPP; Lieberman et al., 2005) is a relationship-based treatment that integrates attachment, cognitive-behavioral, social-learning, and psychodynamic theories. CPP focuses on the child-parent relationship as a way to improve the child's adaptive functioning. Various treatment strategies are employed including a focus on safety, affect regulation, the joint construction of a trauma narrative, and engagement in developmentally appropriate activities.</description>
