  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is classically described as a sexually transmitted disease. As this source of
      contagious has been described long ago -mainly though by observation- when children presents
      with acquired syphilis, child abuse is always considered and must be ruled out by specialists
      in a careful evaluation.

      However, muco-cutaneous lesions can be a contagious source for congenital syphilis; therefore
      the possibility of non-sexual transmission through intimate contact with infected people
      through humid lesions (such as in kisses, breastfeeding, food-handling) or contaminated
      fomites (towels, bed sheets, underwear, cups, pacifiers, cutlery) could be considered.
      Experts worldwide have observed this non-sexual transmission, as described in many reports in
      literature.

      The investigators will study retrospectively patients from a cohort with non-sexual
      transmission. The diagnosis criteria used for acquired syphilis were as follows: age under 18
      years with treponemic and nontreponemic positive tests, secondary-syphilis suspicious lesions
      and negative maternal syphilis serology. Nonsexual contagious was defined as contacts without
      physical and psychosocial indicators of sexual abuse according to current guides. In this
      cohort, in every case a psychosocial evaluation was completed with a written report in order
      to evaluate sexual contact probability.

      The teamo will describe these patients clinical and laboratory findings, family and close
      acquaintances serologies and probable source of contagious.
