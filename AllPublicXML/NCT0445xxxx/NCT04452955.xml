  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 2, open-label, single dose level study of PRL3-zumab
      monotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Screening Period (Day - 21 to Day -1), a Treatment Period during
      which visits will occur every 2 weeks, an End of Treatment visit within 14 days of the
      decision to discontinue treatment for any reason, and a Safety Follow-up visit at 30 days
      after the last dose of study treatment. PRL3-zumab will be administered by intravenous (IV)
      infusion till patient meets any of the discontinuation criteria (progressive disease,
      clinically or per RECIST v1.1, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent). One cycle of
      treatment will be 4 weeks (2 infusions, 2-weeks ±2 days apart).
