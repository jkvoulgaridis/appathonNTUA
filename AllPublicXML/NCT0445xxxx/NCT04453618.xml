      This study consists of two parts: The objective of the food effect study (Part 1) is to
      investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profiles of SYHA1402 tablets under fed
      and fasted conditions following the oral administration of SYHA1402.

      The primary objective of the multiple doses study (Part 2) is to investigate safety,
      tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of SYHA1402 in healthy subjects following oral
      administration of Multiple rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of pharmacokinetics (PK) following multiple oral
      doses.

         13. Loss of blood or blood donation more than 200 mL within 8 weeks before signing
             informed consent, or plan on blood donation during the study period and 1 months after
             the last dose of drug.

         14. Have a surgical schedule or a plan on excessive physical activity during the study
             period.

         15. Subjects participating in other clinical trials, or who have participated in any other
             clinical trials of drugs within three months before signing informed consent;
