  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of a manualized treatment (Goal Management Training, or
      GMT) on the cognitive impairments associated with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in
      certain populations. Participants will be randomized to either GMT group treatment (with or
      without use of a mindfulness meditation aid), or a wait-list condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD has an emotional impact on individuals, but it is also associated with impaired
      cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, executive functioning). This study is a
      randomized control trial for a cognitive remediation intervention (Goal Management Training,
      or GMT) that has been shown to improve cognitive impairment observed in other populations
      (e.g., older adults). The present study will evaluate GMT's effects in the adult PTSD
      population. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions - GMT
      group treatment + Muse meditation device, GMT group treatment w/o Muse device, or a wait-list
      (in which GMT will be postponed for approximately 21 weeks). The Muse device is a mindfulness
      meditation aid, anticipated to further enhance the effects of GMT. Knowing other research has
      focused on the use of GMT within the PSP population (Public Safety Personnel; e.g., police,
      firefighters, military, paramedics, etc.), this study will focus on two other groups of
      participants: non-PSP &quot;civilians&quot; with PTSD (stemming from any type of traumatic event), and
      frontline healthcare workers with PTSD related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
      (e.g., physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, personal support workers, cleaners, etc.).
      Due to the pandemic, this study will have two streams: one online stream (i.e., all
      activities completed virtually or digitally, n=75), and then, once in-person research
      restrictions have lifted, a second stream that will involve in-person assessments, treatment,
      and pre/post fMRI scans (functional magnetic resonance imaging; n=75). Content of assessment
      and treatment materials will be the same for both streams, with the exception of the fMRI
      scans.

    <intervention_name>Goal Management Training (GMT)</intervention_name>
    <description>GMT is a structured, short-term cognitive remediation program with an emphasis on mindfulness and practice in planning and completion of goal-oriented behaviours. The main objective of GMT is to help participants regain executive control in order to better define goals and monitor performance in achieving them. Sessions include instructional material, interactive tasks, discussion of patients' real-life deficits, and homework assignments. Mindfulness meditation is also incorporated for the purpose of developing the skill of bringing one's mind to the present to monitor ongoing behaviour, goal states, and the relationship between them, and for the development of attentional control. The program further incorporates real-life examples to illustrate goal attainment failures and successes, as well as in-session practice of complex tasks that mimic real-life tasks - an issue for individuals with executive function deficits (e.g., planning and set-shifting tasks).</description>

    <description>The Muse headband is a research-grade EEG device that passively senses brain activity and translates it into auditory &amp; visual feedback, guiding the user to a state of greater calm &amp; focus. Using this in combination with the Myndlift app will allow study researchers to conduct at-home neurofeedback with participants in an effort to enhance the benefit of GMT.</description>
