  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients arrive in the waiting room of the MRI department, patients and holders of
      parental authority will be given the information note explaining the objective of the study
      and its unfolding. During the consultation, the radiologist will check the inclusion and
      non-inclusion criteria, and will take the time to answer all of their questions about the
      study. If the patient and the holders of parental authority agree to participate in the
      research, the investigative doctor will obtain his consent.

      The MRI examination will be performed on a 3T multi-parametric MRI. Compared to the standard
      protocol, patients will benefit from an additional sequence of f-mRI, called resting state,
      and performed before injection of gadolinium contrast agent.
