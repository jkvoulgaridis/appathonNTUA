  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity is prevalent among women of reproductive age (25-34 years) with 42%
      having a BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2. Weight gain increases the risk of developing diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease. The amount of weight regain postpartum can shift women from the
      healthy weight category into the overweight or obese BMI categories. Purpose: This study was
      conducted to compare the effectiveness of ultra-sound Cavitation versus radiofrequency on
      abdominal fat thickness on postnatal women

      Fifty overweight primipara women at 6 months postnatally aged from 20-35 years, BMI (25-29.9)
      kg/m2 and have waist hip ratio (WHR) &gt; 0.8. They were assigned randomly into 2 equal groups:
      Group (A) received ultra-sound cavitation40 KHz applied for 30 min, once time weekly for 8
      weeks. Group (B) received radiofrequency multi-polar 5MHZ applied for 30 min, once time
      weekly for 8 weeks. Both groups received the same diet program throughout the treatment
      period. All females in both groups were assessed through weight scale for body weight, tape
      measurement for waist/hip ratio and ultra-sonography for fat thickness of abdominal region
      before and after treatment

    <description>The woman's BMI had calculated from measured weight &amp; height for each woman in both groups (A&amp;B) before beginning of the study and weight only had measured after 8 weeks of treatment sessions to according to the following equation: BMI=weight (Kg) /height (m2)</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WHR was calculated by dividing WC on HC. Both measurements were taken for all women in all groups (A &amp; B) before starting the study and after 8 weeks of treatment sessions (end of study). All measurements were with the women in standing position. Skin of the anterior abdominal wall was cleaned while the woman in hip circumference worn light clothes and sometimes measurements repeated twice for more accurate. That measured WC, HC to measure (WHR) calculated by dividing the measurement of the waist by the measurement of the hips.
WHR= (waist circumference / hip circumference)</description>
