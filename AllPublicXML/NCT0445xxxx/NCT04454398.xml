      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of a single dose of STI-1499 (COVI-GUARD™), a
      COVID-19 targeting monoclonal antibody, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Four dose
      levels will be tested: 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg. Each dose cohort consists of 8
      subjects randomized 3:1 drug to placebo.
