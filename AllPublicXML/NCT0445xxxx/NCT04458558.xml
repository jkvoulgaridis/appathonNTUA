  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Republic of Georgia, the medical abortion regimen involves three in-person visits.
      This study aims to pilot and evaluate a simplified medical abortion service delivery model
      that will reduce the number of in-person visits to only one visit for diagnosis and
      counseling. Medication will be mailed along with two multi-level pregnancy tests to study
      participants, who will assess their abortion outcome at home.

      This prospective cohort study of patients obtaining medical abortion medications by mail. The
      study investigators aim to recruit approximately 120 patients for this study across three
      study sites that have extensive experience providing early medical abortion. Five days after
      undergoing in-person consultation and necessary exams to assess eligibility for medical
      abortion, study team will mail study participants medical abortion pills and two multi-level
      urine pregnancy tests. Medical abortion follow-up will occur at the participant's home
      approximately two weeks after the initial visit, and the multi-level pregnancy test will be
      used to assess abortion outcome. At follow-up, study participants will be asked questions
      about the results of the multi-level pregnancy test, and their experience and feedback about
      the acceptability of the process. At the conclusion of the study, investigators will
      interview providers to better undertand their experience with the simplified medical abortion
      service delivery model.
