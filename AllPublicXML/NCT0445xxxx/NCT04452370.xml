      The hypothesis of this study is to discover if the oral Etoposide plus Anlotinib can shrink
      or slow the growth of pretreated advanced TNBC.

      It is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study of oral etoposide combined with
      antinib in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
