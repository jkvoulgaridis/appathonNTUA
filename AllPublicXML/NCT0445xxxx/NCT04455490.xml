      This study proposes endoscopic surgery for delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture
      which is a brand new treatment，and retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 4 cases
      treated with this treatment. The analysis results of the clinical efficacy of the method can
      serve as a reference for clinical and surgical decision-making and prognosis assessment.

      Background: Delayed wound healing is a kind of postoperative complication of Achilles tendon
      suture. Conventional surgical approach is open surgery in order to clean the wound, which
      requires multiple dressing changes and involves a longer recovery period. We recently
      developed arthroscopic surgery for delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture. This
      therapy may be an alternative approach to open surgery.

      Purposes: In this paper we evaluate the long-term efficacy of endoscopic surgery for delayed
      wound healing after Achilles tendon suture.

      Patients and Methods: Clinical data of 4 patients with delayed wound healing after Achilles
      tendon suture who underwent endoscopic surgery from April 2008 to October 2017 at our
      institute were retrospectively analyzed. There were 3 males and 1 females with age of 39-60
      years, the follow‐up period was 8-43 months). All the patients had unilateral tendon rupture
      with 3 cases on the left and 1 cases on the right. Scores on Visual analogue scale(VAS) and
      the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale were used. The
      postoperative outcome was evaluated on the basis of Victorian Institute of Sport
      Assessment—Achilles score and Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS).

        4 patients with delayed healing after Achilles tendon suture surgery who were treated at
        our institution, in the period from April 2008 to July 2019. The patients were 3 men and 1
        woman, aged 39 to 60 years. Among them, 3 had surgery on the left Achilles tendon and 1 had
        surgery on the right Achilles tendon. The time from the first operation (Achilles tendon
        suture) to foreign body reaction ranged from 1 month to 5 months.
