    <textblock>
      This study will test whether the combination of cisplatin, nivolumab, and temozolomide is an
      effective treatment for in people with advanced and/or metastatic colorectal cancer that is
      mismatch repair-proficient (MMR-proficient). The researchers will also look at how safe the
      study drug combination is in participants.
