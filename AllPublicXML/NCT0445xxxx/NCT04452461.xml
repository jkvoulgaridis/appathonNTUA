  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center feasibility trial of patients with borderline resectable
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma receiving radiation therapy with Stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) and chemotherapy with mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel followed by
      pancreatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma infiltrates into adjacent vascular structures
      to an extent such that complete macroscopic resection is technically feasible, but an R0
      resection poses a challenge when surgery is the primary therapy. Therefore, a different
      management strategy may be beneficial.

      The primary outcome of the PANCREAS trial is defined as the proportion of eligible patients
      enrolled in the study over an 18-month period and the proportion of patients who complete the
      protocol (neoadjuvant therapy and pancreatectomy). Certain modifications of the neoadjuvant
      therapy protocol are expected and allowed, and the primary feasibility outcome will be one of
      the following: stop, main study non-feasible; continue with protocol modifications; or
      continue without modification. A safety analysis will be performed after first 15 patients
      are enrolled and complete neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. Patients enrolled in this trial
      will undergo interventions in the following order: neoadjuvant chemotherapy, re-staging CT
      scan, SBRT, re-staging CT scan, pancreatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Postoperative
      mortality will be recorded up to 90 days after surgery. Patients will be followed every four
      months with a CT scan of the chest/abdomen for two years after resection or until evidence of
      disease recurrence. Patients who do not undergo surgical resection will be followed for two
      years after accrual (duration of study period) or until evidence of disease progression or
      death.

As described, there are certain modifications of the neoadjuvant therapy protocol that are expected and allowed. The primary feasibility outcome will be one of the following:

Continue with protocol modifications: 1) estimated proportion of eligible patients enrolled between 40-59% or 2) estimated proportion of enrolled patients who complete the protocol (neoadjuvant therapy and pancreatectomy) 40-59%.
Continue without modification: 1) estimated proportion of eligible patients enrolled equal to or greater than 60% or estimated proportion of enrolled patients who complete the protocol (neoadjuv</description>

    <description>Chemotherapy: 6 cycles (three months) of IV combination chemotherapy with mFOLFIRINOX on day 1 followed by one week of rest (14-day cycle). Alternatively, patients will receive three months of gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel.
Re-staging CT scan with Carbohydrate Antigen (CA) 19-9 serum test.
Radiation therapy with SBRT for 5 days.
Re-staging CT scan with CA 19-9 serum test one week following the last day of SBRT . Staging laparoscopy to rule out occult metastatic disease is optional based on surgeon's preference.
Pancreatectomy 4 weeks following the last day of SBRT as per standard of care.
Adjuvant chemotherapy: as per standard of care.
Clinical assessment and CT scan with CA 19-9 serum test at 4-month intervals until identification of cancer recurrence.
Follow up of patients after 2 years every six months for up to 5 years following the initiation of treatment will be performed off-protocol as per standard of care.</description>

    <description>The radiation dose will be limited to 30 Gy maximum for the small bowel. For other organs, we will follow the &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; principle. Radiation quality assurance will be performed for all treatment plans. Volumes of tumour obtained on CT images at 1.25 mm slice thickness will be reconstructed into a three-dimensional image set for SBRT planning. The SBRT will deliver a radiation dose of 36 Gy in three fractions with 12 Gy per fraction to the isodose line best encompassing the planning target volume, including a 2 mm expansion around the gross tumour.</description>
