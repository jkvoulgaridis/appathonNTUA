  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyloidosis by mutation of the transthyretin gene (ATTRh) is part of a group of diseases in
      which the deposit of structurally abnormal proteins (amyloid fibrils) affects multiple organs
      such as: liver, kidney, eyes, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and heart, and, finally,
      it increases the morbidity and mortality of affected patients. This deposit in the myocardium
      is manifested syndromically as heart failure with preserved or slightly reduced systolic
      function, and important diastolic dysfunction. The analysis of diastolic function comprises
      two components: the assessment of active relaxation, dependent on preload and afterload, and
      the assessment of the passive properties of the tissue - its hardness or rigidity. Myocardial
      stiffness represents an important parameter for diagnosis and prognosis, but its evaluation
      is not included in conventional echocardiography. Cardiac elastography has recently been
      proposed as a non-invasive diagnostic modality to assess myocardial stiffness.

    <description>The elastographic technique by ultrasound (USE), shear waves or shear wave elastography (SWE), quantitatively evaluates tissue stiffness by mapping the propagation of acoustic waves (shear waves), in a non-invasive manner and without emission of ionizing radiation. Their speeds are tracked by the ultrasound equipment after tissue deformation occurs, generated by pulses of acoustic radiation (ARFI) of the transducer itself. Assuming the correlation between tissue stiffness and increased acoustic propagation speeds, it is possible to describe mathematically the elasticity of tissues by measuring specific acoustic waves.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of HRTR with and without cardiac involvement.

          -  For the definition of cardiac involvement by ATTRh, all the criteria below must be
             presented:

               -  Pathogenic mutation of TTR consistent with ATTRh.

               -  Evidence of cardiac commitment by echocardiography or nuclear magnetic resonance
                  with measurement of the interventricular septum at the end of diastole (SIVd)&gt;
                  12mm or / and medical history of heart failure, and / or levels of troponin and /
                  or BNP above the reference value without another more likely cause.

               -  Amyloid deposit in cardiac or extra-cardiac tissue (eg, abdominal fat aspirate,
                  salivary gland, connective sheath of the median nerve) confirmed by congo red
                  staining or presence of grade 2 or 3 myocardial scintigraphy (DPD-CT) of cardiac
                  uptake, in cases where the presence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
                  significance (MGUS) was ruled out.

               -  In the presence of MGUS, confirmation of the TTR protein in the tissue is
                  necessary through immunohistochemistry (IHC) or mass spectrometry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of another type of cardiomyopathy such as hypertension, valve or ischemic
             heart disease (eg, previous myocardial infarction documented with myocardial necrosis
             markers and electrocardiographic changes).

          -  Presence of diseases other than cardiac amyloidosis, impairing the assessment of
             functional capacity, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe arthritis
             or peripheral arterial disease, recent or planned orthopedic procedure during the
             course of the study (eg, spine surgery or under lower limbs) that impairs walking in
             the 6-minute test evaluation.

          -  Acute coronary heart disease or unstable angina in the past 3 months

          -  Previous heart, liver or other organ transplant.

          -  Presence of neoplasia in the last 3 years, except for basal and squamous cell
             carcinomas of skin or cervical cancer in situ previously treated.

          -  Presence of other medical conditions or comorbidities that, in the investigator's
             opinion, could interfere with the course of the study or the interpretation of the
             data.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  History of alcohol abuse in the last 2 years or excessive daily alcohol intake (for
