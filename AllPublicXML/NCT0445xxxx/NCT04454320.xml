    <textblock>
      Intussusception remains a common cause of bowel obstruction in children and results in
      significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly treated. There is a paucity of
      prospective studies regarding childhood intussusception. This study describes the seasonal
      variation and management outcomes of childhood intussusception

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intussusception is the invagination of a segment of bowel into an adjacent segment resulting
      into an intestinal obstruction. It is the most common acquired cause of intestinal
      obstruction in children aged four months to two years with a peak of incidence between four
      and nine months of age. Etiology of intussusception is reported to be idiopathic in about 90%
      of cases and rarely is it associated with pathological lead points such as Meckel's
      diverticulum, appendix, solid bowel lesions, intestinal polyp, and intestinal lymphoma. It is
      an occlusive-strangulation type of intestinal obstruction, and all necessary measures should
      be taken early to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid ischaemia and necrosis of
      bowel. The term comes from two Latin words, intus, which means &quot;inside&quot; and suscipere, which
      means &quot;to receive&quot;. It has been reported in neonates and adults . The ancient Greeks, treated
      intestinal obstruction with enema or insufflations of air into the anus. Abdominal pain,
      vomiting and blood in stools are the classic triad and are uncommon and seen in less than
      one-third of the children affected. Cases often present with non-specific symptoms, including
      vomiting, pain, irritability, decreased appetite and lethargy, and this may render diagnosis
      of intussusception difficult. Abdominal ultrasound is considered the standard choice for its
      diagnosis. Non-surgical management with Pneumatic reduction (PR) by air, hydrostatic
      reduction by saline or contrast enema is the best procedure.Surgical management by
      exploratory laparotomy with simple reduction while some cases may require a bowel resection
      and reanastomosis for gangrenous bowel.
