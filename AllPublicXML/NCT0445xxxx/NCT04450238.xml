  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dual Factor Model of mental health (DFM; Greensporn &amp; Saklofske, 2001) postulates that
      mental health consists of two at least partially unrelated factors, the experience or absence
      of psycho-pathological symptoms (i.e. depressive symptoms) and the experience or absence of
      positive mental health (i.e. life satisfaction, meaningfulness). Both factors contribute to
      an individual's well-being and mental health.The DFM has been used as a framework to describe
      and evaluate participants' mental health in different settings in cross-sectional and
      longitudinal designs mostly outside of clinical settings. Psychological Interventions, such
      as cognitive-behavioral therapy are widely studied concerning their reduction of
      psycho-pathological symptoms. However, little is known about the effect of psychological
      interventions on the second factor (positive mental health) of the DFM. This is especially
      important, because the latter has been shown to contribute significantly to subjective
      well-being and to reduce the risk of suicidal intentions and behavior.

      Primary, the authors aim to investigate the DFM in an inpatient sample over the course of
      time (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6 and 12 months after discharge). Secondly, they aim to
      investigate the relationship between positive mental health and suicidal ideation over the
      course of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be divided into four groups according to the DFM over the course of time:

        1. unhappy: high psychopathology and low positive mental health; depression and/or anxiety
           scores above published cut -offs and positive mental health scores under published cut
           offs.

        2. symptomatic but content: high psychopathology and high positive mental health;
           depression and/or anxiety scores above published cut -offs and normal to high positive
           mental health scores

        3. vulnerable: low psychopathology and low positive mental health; depression and/or
           anxiety scores under published cut -offs and positive mental health scores under
           published cut offs

        4. Complete mental health: low psychopathology and high positive mental health; depression
           and/or anxiety scores under published cut -offs normal to high positive mental health
           scores.

      The authors will then depict the movements of patients through these groups graphically and
      use regression analyses to check for differences according to age, diagnosis and gender.

      Towards the second aim they will use regression analyses to investigate the protective effect
      of positive mental health on suicidal ideation or behavior.

        treatment as part of their routine assessment. They are invited to fill out the same
        measures 6 and 12 months after discharge voluntarily to support the long-term evaluation of
        their treatment. They have all given written informed consent to use their data for
