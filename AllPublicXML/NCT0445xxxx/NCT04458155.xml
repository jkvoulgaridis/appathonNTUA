  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, diagnostic, cohort study within the standard care of ACS
      patients. It compares the analytical performance of Siemens® point-of-care high sensitive
      troponin I testing in venous, plasma and capillary sample types. We hypothesize that there is
      a good correlation between the Siemens® POC HS cTnI assay results for the three sample types
      and that the bias between different POC sample types reduces from ~10% to ≤ 5% when using
      heparinized transfer device for the capillary sample.

    <textblock>
      In September 2019, the validation study 1.0 started, in which the cTnI result of the Siemens
      POC device on three sample types are compared. Interim analysis of the sample comparison was
      performed by regression analysis using Passing and Bablock, and calculating the Pearson
      correlation coefficient.

      The Li-hep Plasma vs Li-hep venous blood show a very good correlation of 1.00-1.03 with an R
      of &gt;0.99, so the results between these sample types can be used interchangeably. For the
      capillary sample vs the Li-hep sample (both blood and plasma) the slope is 8-12% higher. With
      a 8-12% higher response, the capillary test results may not be interchangeably used with the
      other 2 sample types.

      It is remarkable that capillary samples give a higher response, since it was anticipated that
      the result may be slightly lower due to the possible dilution by interstitial fluid. We
      hypothesize that the presence of the Li-heparin anti-coagulant in the venous draw lead to a
      slight reduction of the apparent cTnI concentration. By using a heparin coated transfer
      device for the capillary samples instead of an uncoated transfer device, this hypothesis will
      be tested.

    <description>The primary objective is to compare the analytical performance of Siemens® point-of-care high sensitive troponin I testing in different sample types by using the coefficient of variation.
This comparison will comprise Siemens® POC capillary vs. Siemens® POC venipuncture and vs. Siemens® POC plasma (Sample comparison).
The primary objective will be achieved by taking:
Two capillary samples &gt; one sample with a heparin coated transfer device (drawn from a finger of the right hand) and the other one with a non-heparin coated transfer device. (drawn from a finger of the left hand)
One extra venous blood sample &gt; for POC venous and POC plasma analysis.
Trained clinical staff will collect the different samples. All samples will be collected once, at one time point with a maximum of 10 minutes in between.</description>
