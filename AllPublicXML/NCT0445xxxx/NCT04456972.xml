  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent histo-prognostic molecular discoveries of the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) have
      shed new light on the classification of endometrial carcinomas.

      After carrying out different types of high-throughput molecular analyzes on 373 endometrial
      carcinomas of different histological types, 4 major tumor subtypes could be identified, each
      with a different survival profile (the &quot;ultra-mutated&quot; group with POLE mutations, the
      &quot;hypermuted&quot; group with microsatellite instability (MSI), the &quot;low number of copies&quot; group,
      and the &quot;high number of copies&quot; group).

      This histomolecular classification is not yet directly transposable to clinical practice and
      tumor genetic characteristics have not had any direct therapeutic impact to date.

      The main objective of the study is to determine the concordance rate between molecular
      analysis of tumor tissue and that of cDNA in patients with endometrial cancer during
      treatment.
