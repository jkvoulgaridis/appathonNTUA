  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to evaluate if improving sleep could enhance the intensive lifestyle
      intervention for improving weight loss and glycemic control in prediabetic individuals who
      have insomnia with short sleep duration. A cognitive behavioral intervention for insomnia
      with adjustments aimed at increasing sleep duration (CBT-Sleep) will be used for this study.
