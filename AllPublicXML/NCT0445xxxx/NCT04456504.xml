      This study is being done to determine if healthcare workers who have previously failed to
      respond to hepatitis B vaccine series will respond to a hepatitis B with CpG adjuvant
      (hepB-CpG) (Heplisav-B)

      Study Intervention Each individual who has completed at least 5 doses hepB vaccine with
      aluminum adjuvant series but is anti-HBs negative will be contacted by EHS staff and invited
      to receive the hepB-CpG two dose series on a 0 and 1 month schedule. Antibody to the surface
      antigen will be measured after the first dose during the visit for the administration of the
      second dose. One month after completion of the series, each immunized individual will have
      another anti-HBs measured.

      Total Number of Subjects Up to 130 individuals will be recruited and enrolled. Study
      Population Healthcare workers who have received at least 5 doses of hepatitis B vaccine with
      aluminum adjuvant and have antiHBs &lt; 10mIU/ml.

             study

          -  Healthcare workers who have received at least 5 doses of hepatitis B vaccine with
             aluminum adjuvant and have antiHBs &lt; 10mIU/ml

          -  Females of childbearing potential will be asked about the possibility of pregnancy as
             is the standard of care for immunization services. If a female indicates that she may
             be pregnant, study participation will be postponed until pregnancy is completed or the
             female reports that she is not pregnant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant during the study

          -  Allergy to the vaccine or a component of the vaccine

          -  Not suitable for study participation due to other reasons, such as inability or
             unwillingness to comply with the study procedures, at the discretion of the
             investigators
