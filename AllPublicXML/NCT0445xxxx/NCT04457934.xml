  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting for endoscopic surveillance of IBD or colorectal screening colonoscopy at
      one of the participating centers will be asked to participate in the present study after
      careful evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The aim is that the final study
      population will comprise of 50% IBD patients and 50% colorectal cancer screening patients.
      Before inclusion, all patients have to sign the written informed consent. All participating
      patients will receive PLENVU, a well-known and approved bowel preparation agent. Bowel
      preparation is performed following the general recommendations of use. Following the bowel
      preparation, patients are asked if they have well tolerated the preparation, if they already
      had a colonoscopy in the past with another bowel preparation agent and if they would prefer
      PLENVU or another bowel preparation for their next endoscopy examination. Endoscopy is
      performed in standard way and effectiveness of the bowel preparation is specifically
      highlighted by the physician on the documentation report. Finally, data is analyzed regarding
      effectiveness of PLENVU for bowel preparation and patient satisfaction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PLENVU is effective for bowel preparation and the efficacy and safety of PLENVU has been
      investigated in randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing gut cleansing prior to
      colonoscopy. Data on the specific screening population and for patients suffering from IBD
      however is limited to date. The aim of the current study is to fill this gap and to provide
      data of the effectiveness of PLENVU for the specific patients groups in order to provide
      specific recommendations for an adequate bowel preparation in those groups.

      In general, bowel-preparation in IBD patients is often more challenging. This might be due to
      the chronic disease burden but also according to compliance factors of individual patients.
      Of note, an adequate bowel-preparation is of paramount importance in IBD in order to detect
      subtle neoplasia and to perform chromoendoscopy, which is still recommended by the updated
      ESGE guideline.

      It is anticipated, that PLENVU will help IBD patients to achieve a better bowel preparation,
      thereby yielding in more effective screening colonoscopies and higher acceptance rates of
      patients for surveillance colonoscopies. In order to show that no significant differences are
      seen in the included IBD cohort compared to the general screening population (bias risk), we
      aim to also include patients from the normal screening population.

    <description>Patients with IBD will undergo preparation for Standard endoscopy with PLENVU, since it is considered to be less affecting for patients. IBD patients have to undergo endoscopy often and mostly suffer from non-efficient preparation.
Patients will drink 1 Liter of Plenvu and 1 Liter of water or tea in preparation for endoscopy and will follow the Guidelines for preparation of endoscopy.
The only Change from Standard care is that patients will receive Plenvu instead of Movicol.</description>
