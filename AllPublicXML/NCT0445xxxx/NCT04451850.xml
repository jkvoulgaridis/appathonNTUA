        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult patients (ages 18-70) of any functional class with a new diagnosis of PAH
             (World health Organization Group 1) placed on targeted therapy

          -  Eligible PAH etiologies include idiopathic PAH, associated with connective tissue
             disease, human immunodeficiency virus, hereditary, or portopulmonary hypertension

          -  Right heart catheterization (RHC) hemodynamics with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure
             &gt;=20 millimetres of mercury at rest, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &lt;= 15
             millimetres of mercury, and a pulmonary vascular resistance &gt;= 3 woods units

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to undergo (non-contrast) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) testing

          -  On chronotropic agents (Beta-Blockers, anti-arrhythmic medications, etc.) that could
             affect the calculation and interpretation of HRV measures

          -  Conditions that could affect the accuracy of MRI imaging, including a history
             previously repaired or unrepaired congenital heart defects, ventricular or atrial
             septal defects, or other anatomic cardiac abnormalities)

          -  Inability to complete a six-minute walk test

          -  Currently being on targeted PAH therapy at the time of consent and enrollment

          -  Thyroid disease, known arrhythmias in the past six months, uncontrolled anemia with a
             hemoglobin less than 7 grams per deciliter, untreated coronary artery disease or a
             diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, the presence of a cardiac
             pacemaker

          -  Clinically significant lung disease (including pulmonary function testing forced vital
             capacity &lt; 60%), a positive ventilation/perfusion scan, uncontrolled sleep apnea not
             adherent with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation

          -  Unable to consent, pregnant women, and prisoners.
