  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEDIS Study is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter Italian study conducted in a
      consecutive series of patients who refer to the Emergency Departments (either spontaneously
      or sent by their attending physicians) for the recent (less than one months) development of
      exertional dyspnea.

      The general aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of PE in the overall population
      referring to the Emergency Departments without potential explanations for dyspnea

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PEDIS Study is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter and no Profit Study.

      600 consecutive patients referring to the Emergency Departments of the participating centers
      because they have developed one or more episodes of exertional dyspnea since less than one
      month will be enrolled. All eligible patients will be interviewed and examined by trained
      study physicians. The presence of already known potential explanations for the dyspnea will
      be assessed. In addition, symptoms of the lower extremities will be elicited, as well as the
      presence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).

      The presence or absence of pulmonary embolism will be assessed with the use of a validated
      algorithm based on pre-test clinical probability and D-dimer result. In patients in whom the
      pre-test clinical probability is low and the D-dimer result is negative, no further testing
      will be done, and PE will be considered excluded. In patients with high clinical probability,
      positive D-dimer result, or both, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography will be
      performed

      The primary study objective is to evaluate Prevalence of PE in the overall population
