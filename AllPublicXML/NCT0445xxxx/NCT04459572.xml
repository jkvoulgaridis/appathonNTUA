  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sepsis and septic shock remain major causes of child morbidity and mortality, despite the
      use of modern antibiotics and resuscitation therapies. Recent interest has focused on
      biomarkers for early diagnosis, and evaluation the outcomes of sepsis; but there is a still
      lack of early diagnosis and timely intervention for sepsis in the emergency department (ED).
      The primary aim was to investigate the role of C-Reactive Protein(CRP), Procalcitonin(PCT),
      soluble-urokinase plasminogen activator receptor(suPAR) and Presepsin in the early
      stratification of patients with sepsis. The usefulness of pediatric Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment (pSOFA) for predicting of the mortality and the rate of PICU admission in children
      with septik shock were also investigated. This prospective pilot study was conducted at
      academic pediatric ED between September 2017-June 2018. All children who met sepsis criteria
      admitted to ED were involved to study. They kept following up after ED management and their
      blood samples were taken upon admission on day 0, 1, 2, 4 and 7. The definition made as
      sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. At the same period, 100 healthy children chosen as
      the control group. The patient characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, co-morbidities,
      source of infection, laboratory results (CRP, PCT, lactate, suPAR and Presepsin) and
      treatments were recorded. The pSOFA score was calculated during first hour of admission.
      Length of stay in ED and hospital was noted. The main outcome measure was in 7 and 30-day
      mortality.
