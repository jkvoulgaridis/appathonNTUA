  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial of limited-duration therapy with zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) in
      combination with rituximab for patients with treatment-naive CLL.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the proportion of patients who have treatment-free
      remission 6 months after discontinuation of zanubrutinib. Treatment-free remission will be
      defined as the time from discontinuation of zanubrutinib to the date of CLL relapse with
      active disease, as defined by the CLL criteria 1. The outcome of this trial will be
      considered positive if more than 70% of patients remain in treatment-free remission 6 months
      after zanubrutinib discontinuation. This estimation is based on a prior analysis of the
      outcome of CLL patients who discontinued BTK inhibitor (BTKi) therapy with ibrutinib because
      of drug intolerance, and were in complete or partial remission2. In these analyses,
      approximately 75% of patients remained in remission after ibrutinib discontinuation for
      ibrutinib intolerance.

      Secondary objectives are

        -  to determine clinical factors associated with a treatment-free remission of more than 6
           months after discontinuation of zanubrutinib;

        -  to determine the treatment-free remission length;

        -  to evaluate the efficacy of re-treatment with zanubrutinib plus rituximab in patients
           who relapse.

               5. Patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice highly effective
                  birth control (e.g., condoms, implants, injectables, combined oral
                  contraceptives, intrauterine devices [IUDs], sexual abstinence, or sterilized
                  partner) during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
                  Women of childbearing potential include any female who has experienced menarche
                  and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,
                  bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal.

               6. Adequate renal and hepatic function as indicated by all of the following: Total
                  bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 x institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) except for patients
                  with bilirubin elevation due to Gilbert's disease who will be allowed to
                  participate; an ALT &lt;/=2.5 x ULN; and an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of
                  &gt; 30 mL/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft- Gault equation unless disease
                  related.

                  cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the cervix
                  or breast. If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last 3
                  years, such patients can be enrolled, after consultation with the Principal
                  Investigator, if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy for this other
                  malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert in that
                  particular malignancy.

               8. A Urine Pregnancy Test (within 7 days of Day 1) is required for women with

             antibody therapy, radiotherapy, high-dose corticosteroid therapy (more than 60 mg
             Prednisone daily or equivalent), or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to enrollment
             or concurrent with this trial. Patients that receive zanubrutinib salvage therapy
             cannot have received any other CLL-directed therapy besides frontline zanubrutinib
             plus rituximab.

          4. Investigational agent received within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             If received any investigational agent prior to this time point, drug-related
             toxicities must have recovered to Grade 1 or less prior to first dose of study drug.

          5. Systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled by antimicrobial

             count of less than 500/μL, unless disease-related, and/or a platelet count of less
             than 30,000/μL at time of screening for this protocol.

          8. Any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ dysfunction or
             disease involving the heart, kidney, liver or other organ system that may place the
             patient at undue risk to undergo therapy with zanubrutinib and rituximab.

          9. Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or

             had no signs of PAF or DVT/PE in the last 6 months before enrolment. Patients with
             ongoing atrial fibrillation (AFib) or ongoing PAF or DVT/PE should be excluded.

         15. Treatment with warfarin (Coumadin®) or any other vitamin K antagonist. Patients who
             recently received warfarin must be off warfarin for at least 7 days prior to start of
             the study. Patients receiving novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC), also termed direct oral
             anticoagulant (DOAC) are permitted to enroll. Patients who are currently on a vitamin
             K antagonist must be switched to a non-vitamin K antagonist, such as a NOAC/DOAC.
