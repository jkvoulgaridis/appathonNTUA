  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a new psychotherapy intervention called Cancer and Aging:
      Reflections for Elders (CARE) can effectively treat depression and distress in older cancer
      patients. CARE is a 5-session intervention that takes place over the phone. This study will
      compare CARE with the Social Work and Supportive Counseling (SWSC) intervention, which also
      takes place over the phone. SWSC is a standard psychotherapeutic intervention that has been
      shown to be a supportive and effective form of treatment for distress for patients with
      cancer. The researchers will look at which intervention is more effective in treating
      depression and distress in participants.

    <measure>Depression and Anxiety: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 14-item scale, which has been well tested in cancer populations including elderly patients with cancer, has depression and anxiety subscales of seven items each. It is considered particularly useful for patients with chronic disease because of the absence of somatic items that often confound the determination of psychiatric problems among the medically ill.</description>

    <description>Session content and timing was developed and confirmed in our qualitative work (Expert Panel) and the CARE pilot study. Five sessions (45-60 minutes each) will be delivered over an 8-week period (+4 weeks). Following these sessions, four brief booster sessions (20-30 minutes each) will be delivered at a rate of approximately one per month to extend the interventions to 6 months (+3 months).</description>

Following these sessions, four brief booster sessions (20-30 minutes each) will be delivered at a rate of approximately one per month to extend the interventions to 6 months (+3 months).</description>

        Potential MSK participants will be identified by the MSK study investigators, the patient's
        treating physician, or review of the clinic lists. Since we plan to recruit all patients 70
        years of age or older, regardless of type of cancer, we will also identify potential
        patients by query of MSK institutional databases (e.g., DaVinci, Dataline). Once the list
        is created, members of the protocol research team will verify the medical eligibility
        against the patient's medical record prior to contacting the patient regarding
        participation. Once identified as eligible, the patient will be approached at their next
        clinic visit by an CRC who will provide detailed information about the study.
