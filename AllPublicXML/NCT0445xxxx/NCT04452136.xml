      This study provides expanded access to radiotracer Gallium 68 (68Ga)-prostate-specific
      membrane antigen (PSMA)-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA-11) with Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
      imaging for participants with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer before prostatectomy
      or for suspected biochemical recurrence of their prostate cancer. Compared to conventional
      imaging, 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC might improve the ability to localize the sites of recurrent or
      metastatic disease, which helps with surgical and other treatment planning.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Provide participants with prostate cancer access to 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC to localize the site of
      potential metastatic or recurrent disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Eligible participants will be intravenously administered 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC at a dose of 3-7
      mCi (111 - 259 MBq), target 5 mCi. The estimated uptake time of the study agent is 75 minutes
      ± 25 minutes. The targeted uptake time is 60 minutes, with an acceptable range of 50-100
      minutes. Following the PET scan with the study agent, participants will undergo either
      surgical management or treatment for metastatic disease in accordance with institutional
      standards.

      Patients will be observed for 2 hours after injection of the radiotracer, and will be
      followed-up 1-3 days post injection with a phone call.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PLANNED PROSTATECTOMY

          -  Biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  Intermediate to high-risk disease, defined as one of the following factors: PSA &gt; 10,
             T2b or greater, or a Gleason score of 7 or greater.

          -  Planned prostatectomy with lymph node dissection

          -  Must be treatment naïve (not have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation
             therapy, hormonal therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, or focal ablation techniques
             (e.g., HiFu)

        BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE

          -  Pathologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma. Rising PSA after definitive therapy
             with prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy).

          -  If post-radical prostatectomy, PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/mL measured &gt; 6 weeks post-operatively and
             confirmatory persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL (AUA recommendation for biochemical
             recurrence).

          -  If post-radiation therapy, PSA that is equal to or greater than a 2 mg/mL rise above
             PSA nadir (ASTRO recommendation for biochemical recurrence).

          -  No other malignancy within the past 2 years (skin basal cell or cutaneous superficial
             squamous cell carcinoma or superficial bladder cancer are exempt from this criterion).

        ALL

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 50 (ECOG/WHO 0, 1, or 2)

          -  Not receiving any other investigational agents (i.e., unlabeled drugs or drugs under
             an IND for initial efficacy investigations

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of Stevens-Johnson syndrome

          -  Known Paget's disease

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
