  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that by 2030, the percentage of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) in Canada
      over 60 years of age will exceed 50%. In this population, poor cognition and persistent
      sub-threshold depressive symptoms are particularly common, difficult to treat, associated
      with increased mood episodes, and poor daily functioning. Mind-body interventions have
      increasingly been found to be effective in treating several psychiatric condition including
      BD. A few pilot studies examining mindfulness-based intervention in younger adult BD have
      been promising for depressive symptoms, but some pilot research suggest that patients with
      older age bipolar disorder (OABD) may benefit more from moving mindfulness. The investigators
      will conduct a 12-week randomized controlled trial to assess whether tai-chi/qigong will be
      associated with 1) greater reduction in depressive symptoms, and 2) greater improved
      cognition, in comparison to a walking/stretching active control condition, 12- and 24-weeks
      from baseline, in BD patients aged 40+.

    <ipd_description>Data from the study will be sent to the Global Aging &amp; Geriatric Experiments in Bipolar Disorder Database (GAGE-BD). The objective of GAGE-BD is to gather data from research studies about older adults (age 50+) with bipolar disorder to allow researchers from the Douglas Institute, or other researchers, in Canada, the United States and around the world, to use the database for future research projects exploring possible relationships between age, medical conditions and bipolar symptoms. Following completion of data collection, the data including all outcomes and demographic and health information, anonymized and free of any identifying or personal information, will be sent to Dr. Betsy Wilson (more info on Dr. Wilson further below) via Box (https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/box/box-information), a secure cloud storage service managed by Case Western University.</ipd_description>
