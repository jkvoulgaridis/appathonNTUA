  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wisdom tooth extraction is the most common surgical procedure being carried out in oral
      surgical departments. The complications carried by post operative period include pain and
      trismus and may affect patient's quality of life.

      PRP is an autologous concentrate of platelet in plasma and accelerate healing by production
      of growth factors. PRP is prepared from patient's own blood and later packed with gel sponge
      (Spongistone) in the experimental group immediately after surgical extraction of mandibular
      third molar teeth, followed by suture placement to close the surgical site.

      Wisdom tooth extraction is the most common surgical procedure being carried out in oral
      surgical departments. The complications carried by post operative period includes pain,
      swelling, trismus , along with disturbance in post extraction wound healing which may
      significantly affect patient's quality of life.

      PRP is an autologous concentrate of platelet suspended in plasma and accelerate healing by
      production of various growth factors. PRP is prepared from patient's own blood and later
      packed with gel sponge (Spongistone) in the experimental group immediately after surgical
      extraction of mandibular third molar teeth, followed by suture placement to close the
      surgical site. PRP speeds up healing by concentration of growth factors which can lessen the
      inflammation and decreases trismus and pain.

    <description>PRP was prepared by withdrawing 8-10 ml of patients own blood (IV from antecubiodal area and collected in a vacuum tube coated with anticoagulant (Na citrate). For activation 1 ml of calcium chloride was added to Platelet Rich Plasma. This layer of approximately 2 ml of PRP was then taken into the residual bone cavity along with gel sponge to stimulate regeneration in wound healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molar tooth followed by sutures</description>
