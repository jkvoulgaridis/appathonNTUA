  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, open label, national multicenter study, to explore the efficacy
      and safety of the combination of Camrelizumab, apatinib and albumin paclitaxel in advanced
      untreated EGFR Wild Type and ALK-negative Lung Adenocarcinoma. The study does not consider
      PD-L1 expression, but tumor samples need to be explored by PD-L1 detection and other
      exploratory analysis.

             potential risk of severe bleeding associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis after
             apatinib treatment, the degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels
             should be considered.

             8. Having active autoimmune diseases, which require systemic treatment in the past 2
             years (ie using disease-modifying drugs, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).
             Replacement therapy (for example, thyroxine, insulin, or physiological corticosteroid
             replacement therapy due to adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered
             as systemic therapy and is allowed.

             9. History of other malignant tumors in the past 5 years. 10. Has received previous
             systemic chemotherapy or other targeted or biological anti-tumor treatment for its

             of metastatic NSCLC, prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is allowed as part of
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy for non-metastatic NSCLC).

             11. Previously received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 and other drugs or drugs
             acting on another stimulatory or co-suppressive T cell receptor (eg CTLA-4, OX 40,
             CD137 ) therapy, or cell biological therapy, etc.

             interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung disease, radiation
             pneumonitis requiring hormone therapy, or any active interstitial lung disease with
             clinical evidence.

             17. Known liver diseases of clinical significance, including active viral hepatitis,
             alcoholic hepatitis or other hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hereditary liver disease.(
             patients who have been cured of previous HBV infection (defined as hepatitis B core
             antibody [HBcAb] positive and HBsAg negative) can participate in this study. Before
             entering the group, HBV DNA testing must be performed on this class of patients and
             well-controlled hepatitis B (peripheral HBV DNA testing is less than 103/ml) can be
             considered for this experiment, and antiviral treatment should be given. Previous
             patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) had positive HCV antibody test results,
             They were eligible for this study only if the HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test
             result was negative (below the detection limit).) 18. Patients who are suspected or

               -  Evidence that active or latent tuberculosis (TB) is determined by locally
                  approved screening methods. If the screening results require treatment in
                  accordance with local treatment guidelines or clinical practice, the patient is
                  disqualified.

               -  Chronic or active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

               -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. During the
                  screening period, the local test result was positive.

               -  There are any other medical conditions (such as active infections that have been
                  treated or not treated) that the investigator believes that the patient has an
                  unacceptable risk if receiving immunomodulatory therapy(Patients with local
                  diseases that are unlikely to cause systemic infections (such as chronic nail
                  fungal infections) are allowed to be enrolled).

                  systemic effects. 21. Known mental illness or substance abuse disorders that
                  interfere with a subject's ability to comply with research requirements.
