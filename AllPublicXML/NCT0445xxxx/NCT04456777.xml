      Research goals:

        1. Examination of the relationship between the use of vortioxetine and cognitive efficacy
           in patients with schizophrenia.

        2. Examination of the association between the use of vortioxetine and the presence
           depressive symptoms, physical and social anhedonia in patients with the disease from
           schizophrenia.

        3. Examining the association between vortioxetine use and quality of life

      (functional recovery) in patients with schizophrenia

      Expected results (hypotheses)

        1. Patients with schizophrenia treated with additional therapy vortioxetine will show
           better cognitive achievement in memory (short-term and long-term), attention, logical
           reasoning and reasoning, speed of information processing, processing of visual and sound
           information, language and speech in relation to patients without additional
           intervention.

        2. Patients with schizophrenia treated with additional therapy vortioxetine will have a
           less pronounced presence of depressive symptoms, physical and social anhedonia in
           relation to untreated patients with additional vortioxetine therapy.

        3. Patients with schizophrenia who were treated with additional therapy vortioxetine will
           have a better quality of life, ie. better functional recovery

      In the first phase of the research, the development of the research protocol and obtaining it
      will be done of his approval.

      The second phase of the research will include patients with schizophrenia disorders based on
      inclusive and exclusive criteria and a study will be conducted procedure. In the third phase
      of the research, the obtained results are processed and analyzed.

      The content of the dissertation will include an introduction, a goal with hypotheses,
      methods, results, discussion, conclusions and literature. In the introduction, in addition to
      current knowledge about schizophrenia and vortioxetine, it will be pointed out cognition
      problem in patients with schizophrenia.

      It will be defined and explained hypotheses and research objectives. In the chapter dedicated
      to methodology, the number of respondents and a description will be presented study concepts,
      presentation of statistical methods used for data processing The presentation of the results
      obtained by this study will be presented textually, tabularly and using charts. The obtained
      results will be commented and evaluated in the Discussion. Recent literature will be used

      Randomization 1:1 will divide 120 patients with schizophrenia into two groups, each group
      into 3 subgroups. One group of 60 patients (who are on monotherapy antipsychotics: new
      generations: 20 patients will be on olanzapine, 20 patients on risperidone and 20 patients on
      aripiprazole) will receive vortioxetine and the other control group of 60 patients (who is
      also on monotherapy with new antipsychotics generations: 20 patients will be on olanzapine,
      20 patients on risperidone and 20 patients on aripiprazole) will not receive vortioxetine.
      Vortioxetine will be given in 10 mg dose (which can be reduced by 5 mg if needed in case of
      poor tolerability)
