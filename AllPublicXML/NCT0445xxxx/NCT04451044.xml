        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Adult men and women (local age of consent) who present with stable or unstable
             angina, NSTEMI, or STEMI ≥ 24 hours after symptom onset

          -  2. Undergoing cardiac catheterization with planned PCI or possible ad hoc PCI

          -  3. Following angiography, PCI is indicated in at least one coronary artery* on the
             basis of one or more of the following:

               1. Presenting with ACS (unstable angina with ECG changes or cardiac enzyme-positive
                  NSTEMI) with an identified culprit lesion

               2. One or more angiographic stenoses are present with 90% stenosis severity by
                  visual estimation;

               3. One or more angiographic stenoses are present with ≥40% to &lt;90% stenosis severity
                  by visual estimation and an abnormal non-invasive stress test in the distribution
                  of the lesion(s)

               4. One or more angiographic stenoses are present with ≥40% to &lt;90% stenosis severity
                  by visual estimation and a spot iFR measure ≤0.89

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. STEMI within 24 hours

          -  2. PCI within the prior 12 months, or any PCI planned after the study procedure (other
             than planned staged procedures, which are allowed). Exception: Patients with STEMI
             within 30 days undergoing primary PCI of the index artery only in whom multivessel
             disease was present may be enrolled and the non-infarct vessels randomized.

          -  3. Silent ischemia

          -  4. Documented prior iFR pullback performed in any coronary artery including during the
             qualifying diagnostic angiogram

          -  5. Target lesion is in-stent restenosis (ISR)

          -  6. Prior CABG anytime

          -  7. Cardiogenic shock (sustained &gt;20 min) defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg
             not responding to fluid resuscitation, or need for inotropic, pressor, or device-based
             hemodynamic support)

          -  8. Presence of unstable ventricular arrhythmias

          -  9. Decompensated congestive heart failure

          -  10. Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of a target vessel (a CTO may be present in a
             non-target vessel if there is no intent to open the CTO during the index or later
             procedure)

          -  11. Known severe aortic or mitral valve stenosis/insufficiency

          -  12. Any known non-cardiovascular comorbidity resulting in lifespan &lt;24 months

          -  13. Known left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%

          -  14. Estimated creatinine clearance (MDRD formula) &lt;30 mL/min or on dialysis

          -  15. Any cardiac or non-cardiac surgical procedure planned within 12 months after
             enrollment, or any procedure necessitating discontinuation of dual antiplatelet
             therapy planned within 6 months after enrollment

          -  16. Known pregnancy or planning to become pregnant (women of child-bearing potential
             must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of enrollment)

          -  17. Participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached
             its primary endpoint

          -  18.Any condition such as dementia or substance abuse that may impair the patient's
             ability to comply with all study procedures, including medication compliance and
             follow-up visits

          -  19. Patient is a member of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the
             investigator, is unable to give Informed Consent for reasons of incapacity,
             immaturity, adverse personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include
             individuals with mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished
             persons, persons in emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and
             those permanently incapable of giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also
             include university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees
             of the Sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.
