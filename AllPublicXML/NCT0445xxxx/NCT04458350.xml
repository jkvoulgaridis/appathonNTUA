  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of digital promotions of a Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) fruit and vegetable incentive program on SNAP participant
      patronage and sales at farmers' markets. The study will analyze SNAP transactions from zip
      codes that receive digital promotions compared to zip codes that receive no additional
      promotions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) financial incentives for fruits and
      vegetables (FV) increase FV purchases and consumption with long-term implications for
      nutrition-related chronic disease. However, many SNAP participants are not aware of these
      programs, leaving them underutilized. The investigators aim to assess if digital promotions
      of SNAP incentive programs increase SNAP patronage and sales at farmers' markets. Eligible
      farmers' markets in the New England Nutrition Incentives Collaborative (NENIC) will receive
      digital promotions for their SNAP fruit and vegetable incentive programs on the Fresh EBT app
      and Facebook, randomly assigned to nearby eligible zip codes. Eligible zip codes will be
      randomized to receive the intervention (digital promotion) or serve as a comparison (no
      additional promotion) with ads running for 13 weeks (Summer 2020 market season).
