      10-year effect of a lifestyle intervention program (exercise, sedentary lifestyle and dietary
      diet) on abdominal visceral adipose tissue (primary endpoint of the RESOLVE study 10 years
      ago): influence of kinetics abdominal visceral adipose tissue loss in the first year of
      follow-up on abdominal visceral adipose tissue at 10 years
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RESOLVE + 10 protocol was design to provide a 10-year effect of a lifestyle intervention
      program (exercise, sedentary lifestyle and dietary diet) on abdominal visceral adipose
      tissue.

      In the present protocol, parameters are measured just once, during 3 hours, to compared the
      results with those of the protocol RESOLVE (5 measurement times over a year 10 years ago:
      before the thermal modification program of the lifestyle ( exercise, sedentary lifestyle and
      diet) of 3 weeks (D0), after the thermal program (D21), at the 3rd month (M3), 6th month (M6)
      and 12th month of follow-up (M12), to which was matched a healthy control group).

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (version 13; Stata-Corp, College
      Station, Tex., USA). All statistical tests will be two-sided and p inferior to 0.05 will be
      considered significant. Qualitative variables will be described in terms of numbers and
      proportions. Quantitative variables will be described in terms of numbers, mean standard
      deviation or median according to statistical distribution (normality studied using
      Shapiro-Wilk test). Graphic representations will be complete presentations of results.
      Comparisons between patients and controls, concerning loss of abdominal visceral adipose
      tissue at 10 years, will be performed using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test if the
      assumptions of anova are not met (normality and homoscedasticity analyzed using
      Fisher-Snedecor test). The results will be expressed as effect-size and 95 percent confidence
      intervals. The primary analysis should be completed by multivariable analysis (linear
      regression with logarithmic transformation of dependent outcome if necessary) considering an
      adjustment on covariates fixed according to univariate results and clinical relevance. The
      results will be expressed as regression coefficients and 95percent confidence intervals.
      Furthermore, the abdominal visceral adipose tissue loss kinetics in the first year of
      follow-up will be considered an independent variable and treated as a functional variable.
      The intra-group comparisons (for patients and for controls) will be performed using paired
      statistical tests: paired t-test or Wilcoxon test. The results will be expressed as
      effect-size and 95 percent confidence intervals. Comparisons between independent groups will
      be done similarly as presented previously for other quantitative outcomes (body composition,
      quality of life, skin conductance, etc.). Multivariable analyses will be applied similarly as
      described previously. The comparisons concerning categorical variables will be realized using
      Chi-squared or when appropriate Fischer-exact test. The relations between quantitative
      outcomes will be analyzed using correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman according to
      statistical distribution). Considering the several multiple comparisons, a correction of the
      type I error will be applied (Sidak's correction).

    <measure>Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing mindfulness using Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory a consistent and reliable scale evaluating several important aspects of mindfulness. Mindfulness has been described as a non-elaborative, non-judgmental present-centred awareness in which each thought, feeling or sensation that arises in the attention field is acknowledged and accepted as it is. Mindfulness appears as an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. Each self-descriptive statement of the FMI is evaluated using a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree)</description>

The 28 items of the BCQ explore the 14 different theoretically identified coping responses (with two items for each of the measured coping strategies): self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, use of emotional support, use of instrumental support, Behavioral disengagement, venting, positive reframing, planning, humor, acceptance, religion, and self-blame. Items of BCQ are scored on a four-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree.</description>

    <measure>Perception of work</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing perception of work using Job Content Questionnaire of Karasek which assessed job demands, job control and social support through 26 items. The questionnaire measures 9 items of job demands, 9 items of job control and 8 items of social support. Items are scored on a four-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Among the 26 items, 5 negative statements require reverse scoring. From French data, the job strain threshold is set for a demands score higher than 20 and a control score lower than 71; the isostrain threshold is determined from a combining score of job strain and social support lower than 24. We would ask the participants to fulfil the questionnaire from memories that they keep of their work.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing self-efficacy using Perceived self-efficacy scale created to assess a general sense of perceived self-efficacy with the aim in mind to predict coping with daily hassles as well as adaptation after experiencing all kinds of stressful life events. Responses are made on a 4-point scale for the 10 items (from &quot;false&quot; to &quot;true&quot;). The final composite score (ranged from 10 to 40) is obtained by summing up the responses to all 10 items. An example of item is &quot;I am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Addiction</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing addiction to work using Work Addiction Risk test (WART). The WART is a self-administered test with 25 statements for which the answers are scored 1-never true to 4-always true [20,26]. Respondents read the statements and mark their answers to describe their work habits [19,27]. The total score is the sum of the responses to the items‚Äî25 to 100‚Äîand the higher the score, the more one is considered addicted to work [18,21]. Scores from 25 to 56 were defined as &quot;at low-risk of work addiction&quot;; 57 to 66 as &quot;at medium-risk of work addiction&quot;, and from 67 to 100 as &quot;at high-risk of work addiction&quot;.</description>

It's a self-questionnaire comprising an 11-point scale, including 8 items measuring cognitive and emotional illness perceptions (consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, symptoms, coherence, illness concern and negative emotions). The total score is calculated by averaging all items (after reversed some items). A high score meant that diabetes was perceived as a threat.</description>
