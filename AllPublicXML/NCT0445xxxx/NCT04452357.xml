  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard chemoradiation, followed by surgery are standard treatment plan for patients
      suffering from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Due to damage to the surrounding healthy tissue
      caused by standard radiation, this study uses a new type of radiation plan- pulsed low-dose
      rate (PLDR) radiation , in combination with chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, given weekly
      along with the radiation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation, combined with radiosensitizing chemotherapies, is often used preoperatively for
      borderline resectable cases with the intent of facilitating a curative surgical intervention.
      This includes providing margin adjacent to un-resectable vessels and sterilizing regional
      lymph nodes. Unfortunately, due to the radiosensitivity of adjacent small bowel and stomach,
      the total dose of radiation used is modest due to the risk of toxicities associated with
      higher doses. Pulsed low-dose-rate (PLDR) radiation improves the safety of radiation through
      breaking it up into small pulses. This increases the repair of DNA damage in normal tissues
      while remaining effective in cancer cells. Multiple prior studies have shown PLDR to be safe
      in the setting of re-irradiation, where additional radiation with conventional techniques is
      associated with severe toxicity.

      PLDR radiation will be given in 2 doses to 6 patients at each dose level:

      Dose level 1: 56 Gy- given over 6 weeks Dose level 2: 66 Gy- given over 7 weeks Standard
      chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, will be administered once a week for the duration of
      radiation.

      This treatment will be followed by standard surgery to remove the cancer after consultation
      with a surgeon.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically-confirmed pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patients must have non-metastatic pancreatic cancer not appropriate for immediate
             surgical resection. This includes the following:

               -  Any involvement (defined as loss of fat plane on contrast CT) of any of the
                  following vessels*:

                    -  Common hepatic artery

                    -  Superior mesenteric artery

                    -  Celiac axis

                    -  Superior mesenteric vein

                    -  Portal vein

                    -  Aorta

                         -  These criteria will be judged by the operating surgeon in conjunction
                            with a radiologist prior to enrollment.
