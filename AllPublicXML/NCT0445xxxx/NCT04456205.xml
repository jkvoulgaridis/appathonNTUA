  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the WISDOM study, withdraw of inhaled steroids has no effect on the acute
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the lung function of
      patients with COPD is significantly reclined. In the subgroup analysis of this study,
      patients with COPD were found to have continued to use inhaled steroids in patients with
      eosinophilic leukocytes greater than 400 cells/ul or whom has more than two episodes of
      exacerbation per year. However, in SUNSET study, it was pointed out that withdraw of inhaled
      steroids had no effect on lung function in patients with COPD, but it was also found that in
      patients with COPD, eosinophilic leukocytes in the blood were greater than 300 cells/ul, have
      a better therapeutic response in steroid inhalation. In addition, some studies have shown
      that in patients with COPD, a decline in lung function after discontinuation of inhaled
      steroids can make the patient's clinical symptoms worse and increase the risk of acute
      exacerbations. However, in other comprehensive analytical studies, there are different
      outcomes. There is no statistically significant difference in the risk of acute exacerbation
      in patients with COPD after discontinuation of inhaled steroids.

      In past studies, it was noted that inhaled steroids cause an increased risk of pneumonia in
      patients with COPD. However, in these studies, the diagnosis of pneumonia was only from the
      clinician's suspicion without clear symptom assessment, laboratory examination,
      microbiological evidence or imaging assessment. Therefore, further research is needed to
      assess whether patients are suitable for the reduction of inhaled steroids and the impact of
      COPD in clinical treatment.

Walks slower than most people on the level, stops after a mile or so, or stops after 15 min walking at own pace; 4. Stops for breath after walking 100 yards, or after a few minutes on level ground; 5. Too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing/undressing).</description>
