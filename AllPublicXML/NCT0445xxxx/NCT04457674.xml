  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is common in people who are in treatment for alcohol use disorder. It can impact
      both sleep quality and daytime functioning, as well as make it harder to treat the underlying
      alcohol use disorder. This study is looking at two types of therapy to help manage insomnia
      specifically for people also in treatment for alcohol use disorder.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score from the insomnia severity index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report assessment of the nature, severity and impact of insomnia. Scores range from 0-28 with higher scores suggesting more clinically significant insomnia.</description>

    <measure>Percent days abstinent from alcohol as documented in the timeline follow-back (TLFB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol TLFB is an interviewer-based drinking assessment method to estimate drinking behaviors, including both frequency and quantity of consumption.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score from Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), General Fatigue sub-scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The MFI is a 20-item assessment that provides an overall fatigue score (20-100) in addition to 5 separate dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation, reduced activity, and mental fatigue. Sub-scale scores range from 4-20 with higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.</description>
