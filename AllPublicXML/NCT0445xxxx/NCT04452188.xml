  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying the use of different levels of oxygen exposure during and
      after cardiopulmonary bypass in eligible infants to learn about its safety during heart
      surgery.

      In addition to having the various doses of oxygen, patients that participate will also have
      blood samples, ultrasounds of the head, and brain wave patterns monitored.

      The hypotheses of this trial are:

        -  that there will be no difference with regards to adverse events between the infants in
           the normoxia group compared to the infants in the standard of care group

        -  there will be a significant difference in the measured partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)
           values between the two treatment groups.

        -  the use of normoxia during cardiopulmonary bypass and in the immediate post-operative
           period will result in clinically significant decrease in oxidative stress as measured by
           thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) after cardiac surgery

    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed at three separate time points in the first 24 hours after surgery (2, 6, and 24 hours). An analysis of co-variance will be used incorporating all available data to model the outcome with an adjustment for pre-operative baseline. The model will compare the mean values (and 95% confidence intervals) between the two groups at each time-point.</description>

    <description>Scores will be calculated based on a pre-specified ranking of outcomes: mortality, cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), seizures, and dialysis. This study will also explore the inclusion of other clinical endpoints in both the global rank score and composite outcome, as well as different ranking strategies.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive lower levels of oxygen during surgery and after surgery on the ventilator.
As cardiopulmonary bypass is being weaned, anesthesia will initiate mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% or less (unless clinically necessary) to achieve oxygen saturation and PaO2 goals that fit within the expected range for the patient's physiology:
Single ventricle patients (PaO2:35-45 and oxygen saturation 75%-85%)
Two ventricle patients (PaO2: 60-100 and oxygen saturation &gt;92%)</description>
