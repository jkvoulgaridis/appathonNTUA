    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that affects upper
      and lower motor neurons. In animal model studies have shown that peripheral nerve
      degeneration in ALS motor function decline, tip peripheral nerve degeneration is of great
      significance for early progress of ALS may be, at the same time analysis showed that the
      motor neuron involvement severity and the prognosis of patients with ALS show obvious
      negative correlation, so finding biomarkers can reflect the motor neuron axonal degeneration
      is of great significance. Neurofilaments is an intermediate fiber specifically expressed in
      central and peripheral neurons and can serve as a biomarker for axonal injury, but there is
      no evidence now that peripheral neurofilament levels have been associated with severity of
      motor axonal involvement in ALS.
