    <measure>Migraine-like attack</measure>
    <time_frame>Before (-5 min) and after administration of (+12 hours) of experimental trigger</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of migraine-like attack after administration of calcitonin-gene related peptide or cilostazol in patients with migraine pretreated with erenumab compared to patients with migraine pretreated with placebo.
A migraine-like attack is defined attack fulfilling either (i) or (ii):
(i) Headache fulfilling criteria C and D for migraine without aura according to the International Headache Society criteria: C. Headache has at least two of the following characteristics: unilateral location; pulsating quality; moderate or severe pain intensity (moderate to severe pain intensity is considered ≥4 on verbal rating scale); aggravation by cough (in-hospital phase) or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (out-hospital phase); D. During headache at least one of the following: nausea and/or vomiting; photophobia and phonophobia; and (ii) Headache described as mimicking the patient's usual migraine attack and treated with acute migraine medication (rescue medication).</description>

    <description>Change in headache intensity after administration of calcitonin-gene related peptide or cilostazol in patients with migraine pretreated with erenumab compared to patients with migraine pretreated with placebo.
Headache intensity scores are measured by a numerical rating scale (NRS). It is a verbally declared scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain; 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</description>
