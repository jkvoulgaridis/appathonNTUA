      A multicenter, stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical
      trial.

    <textblock>
      After establishing eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive
      rhThrombin (1000 U/mL) or placebo. During a surgical procedure, study participants will be
      treated with blinded study drug (rhThrombin or placebo) in combination with an absorbable
      gelatin sponge at appropriate bleeding evaluation site(s). 510 patients will participate in
      the study.

      In this study, stratified random enrollment was conducted according to the
      condition(experimental group or control group) of the subjects.Stratification factors were
      centered, gender (male/female) and age (18 ≤ age &lt;60/60 ≤ age ≤70).
