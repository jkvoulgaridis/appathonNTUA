  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to demonstrate the benefits of the RAAC program for patients undergoing
      cementoplasty, in particular on their level of anxiety and pain control throughout the
      perioperative phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the preoperative anxiety of patients hospitalized for a
      percutaneous vertebroplasty, depending on whether or not they are managed in an RAAC program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Superiority of RAAC versus standard management over preoperative anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The main analysis consists of testing the superiority of RAAC versus standard management over preoperative anxiety, evaluated on a numerical scale of 0 to 10</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the pain on a numerical scale of 0 - no pain to 10 - maximum pain imaginable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the patient satisfaction with care, assessed on a 5-level scale (not at all satisfied / somewhat dissatisfied / moderately satisfied / somewhat satisfied / very satisfied)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional impotence</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the functional impotence of low back pain by the Quebec score, which includes 20 questions on the ability to undertake daily activities, rated from 0 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable). The score therefore varies from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>If the patient is under the &quot;RAAC&quot; group, he/she will then be received in consultation by a RAAC specialist nurse, between the anesthesia / radiology consultation and the intervention. This RAAC nurse will explain the procedure and show him/her an information video on vertebroplasty. Information about managing anxiety and pain will also be provided. In addition, the day after the patient leaves the clinic, the RAAC nurse will call him/her to inquire.</description>
