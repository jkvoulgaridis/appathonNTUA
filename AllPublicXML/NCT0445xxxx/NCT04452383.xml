    <measure>time until suﬃcient sedation to start endoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>It is about 5-10 minutes from start of studied drug till patient is ready to start endoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>time to start endoscopy is deﬁned as the duration between start of the studied drugs until MOAA/S Modified observer assessment scale of alertness sedaion score 1 was obtained.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>any airway intervention and occurrence of laryngospasm after start of the DISE procedure until its completion with diagnosis of site and degree of obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Once the DISE began, the airway interventions were important as outcomes, because these interrupted the clinical study of the DISE. Furthermore, laryngospasm was deﬁned by the requirement for positive pressure ventilation of &gt;20 cmH2O or administration of succinylcholine or propofol or any .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, laryngospasm, cough, gag reﬂex, apnea or aspiration) were recorded during the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Bradycardia was diagnosed if heart rate dropped below 60beats/min and atropine 0.01mg/kg was given if HR decreased below 50beats/min. Hypotension was diagnosed if mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased by more than 30% from baseline or below 60mmHg</description>

    <measure>Time till Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 5 minutes between stop of drugs until Modified observer's assessment of alertness sedation MOAA/S became 4</time_frame>
    <description>Time between stop of the study drugs until Modified observer's assessment of alertness sedation MOAA/S score of 4 was calculated and patient is shifted to recovery room( MOAA/S score btween 0-6 where 1 patient is ready for endoscopic airway evaluation and 1 patient is ready for discharge to recovery room ) Time till (MOAA/S) score 4 was calculated .</description>

    <measure>patients and surgeon satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>about 30 minutes after complete recovery both patients' and surgeon satisfaction were recorded using a 7-point Likert-like verbal rating scales for patients and surgeon satisfaction where 7 is extremely satisfied and 1 is extremely dissatisfied</time_frame>
