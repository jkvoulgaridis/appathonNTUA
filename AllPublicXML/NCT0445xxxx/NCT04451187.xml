  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of seltorexant, compared to placebo, as an
      add-on medication to an antidepressant, on next-day driving performance as assessed by the
      mean difference of standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) from an on-road driving
      test.

    <measure>Participant Driving Performance as Assessed by Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 and Day 9</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after each driving test, participants will indicate the perceived quality of their driving performance on a visual analog scale from 0 ('I drove exceptionally poorly') to 20 ('I drove exceptionally well') around a midpoint of 'I drove normally'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>

             mental health practitioner

          -  Participants with mild or better depressive symptoms indicated by a Montgomery-Asberg
             Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 18 at
             screening

          -  Participants with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or
             panic disorder for whom major depressive disorder (MDD) is considered the primary
             diagnosis are not excluded

          -  Participants receiving and tolerating well any one of the following selective
             serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
             (SNRIs) for depressive symptoms in any formulation and available in the participating
             country: citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, milnacipran,
             levomilnacipran, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, vilazodone, or
             vortioxetine at a stable dose (at therapeutic dose level) for at least 4 weeks prior
             to screening, and expected to continue to take the same drug and dose for the duration
             of the study

          -  Participant should be medically stable on the basis of medical history, neurological
             examination and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening, and physical
             examination, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening
             and predose on Day 1 of Period 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants has a recent (last 3 months) history of, or current signs and symptoms of

             thyroxine (FT4) test will be conducted. If the FT4 value is abnormal and considered to
             be clinically significant (after discussion with the medical monitor) the participant
             is not eligible. Participants with a pre-existing history of thyroid disease/disorder
             who are treated with thyroid hormones need to be on a stable dosage for 3 months prior
             to the start of the screening phase. Participants taking thyroid supplementation for
             antidepressant purposes are not allowed in the study

          -  Participants has Cushing's Disease, Addison's Disease, primary amenorrhea, or other
