  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scarring from burn wounds remains a chronic and often severe sequela of burn injury. Burn
      wounds may be left to heal by secondary intention or treated with surgical skin grafting; in
      both circumstances, significant scars likely result. When surgical skin grafting is employed,
      skin graft harvest sites (&quot;donor sites&quot;) likewise result in clinically significant scars.

      This study will have interventional and observational components. Patients will receive the
      standard fractional ablative CO2 treatments to their scars resulting from burn wounds allowed
      to heal by secondary intention and/or those treated with skin grafts. These will be
      prospectively observed for the duration of the study as well as adjacent normal skin. In
      addition, a donor site that meets inclusion criteria that would not have otherwise received
      LSR will be identified as a treatment site. Patients with have one half of their donor sites
      randomized to standard of care (SOC) treatment, which consists of wound dressings,
      compression therapy, physical and occupational therapies and the other half randomized to SOC
      + ablative fractional CO2 laser therapy (LSR).

    <description>The primary endpoint will be assessment of control and treatment halves at follow-up evaluation completed 2 months ± 2 weeks after the final laser treatment.
The change in scale measure from baseline to date of assessment will be used to compare treatment vs control scar halves. This will be calculated and compared using paired t-test with a p-value of 0.05 as the cutoff for significance.</description>
