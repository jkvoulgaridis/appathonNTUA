  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/PBS) is a constellation of symptoms of pelvic
      discomfort that includes both bladder-related pain as well as urinary frequency, urgency, and
      nocturia in the absence of an identifiable etiology that affects likely more than 5.4 million
      patients in the United States. There is a significant overlap in patients with IC/PBS and
      those with fibromyalgia and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been
      shown to be effective for the treatment of chronic pain conditions.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if LDN improves pain scores and lower urinary
      tract symptoms in patients with IC/PBS. A secondary aim is to show that it has a low adverse
      event profile.
