  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SHR-1209 in
      subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia. 8 eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) with
      familial hypercholesterolemia, on stable maximum tolerable dose lipid-regulating therapy for
      at least 28 days, to receive subcutaneous SHR-1209, follow up 8 weeks. The primary endpoint
      was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline at week 12 .
