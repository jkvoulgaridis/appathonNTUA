  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance, particularly insomnia, is a common problem for cancer survivors and their
      caregivers. Insomnia can be described as excessive daytime napping, difficulty falling
      asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you would like. Insomnia can
      increase fatigue, impair physical function, impair immune function, cause circadian rhythms
      (known as your biological clock) to be disrupted and decrease quality of life. Because there
      is no ideal standard of care for effectively treating sleep problems in cancer survivors or
      their caregivers, the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Partnered
      YOCAS©® yoga to Nonpartnered YOCAS©® yoga and standard care are for improving sleep problems.
      The three treatments are Partnered YOCAS©® yoga (cancer survivors and their caregivers
      receive YOCAS©® yoga together), Non-partnered YOCAS©® yoga (cancer survivors receive YOCAS©®
      yoga alone), and standard care. The study team will also examine the effectiveness of
      Partnered YOCAS©® yoga to Non-partnered YOCAS©® yoga and standard care on fatigue, cognitive
      function, psychological conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, mood), pain, relationship
      quality, quality of life, and physiological synchrony.

    <description>This is the Partnered YOCAS©® yoga intervention which is a low to moderate intensity mode of exercise that draws from two basic types of yoga; gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga. The program includes specific physical postures and mindfulness exercises focused on breathing and meditation. Instructors will be allowed to modify the yoga postures to meet the specific needs of participants and participants will be allowed to use yoga props. (See the YOCAS©® manual, &quot;Yoga for Cancer Survivors&quot;.) The program is delivered by certified yoga instructors in community settings, 2 times a week for 75-minute sessions over a 4 week period. Both cancer survivor and their caregiver will participate together in these classes as partners.</description>
