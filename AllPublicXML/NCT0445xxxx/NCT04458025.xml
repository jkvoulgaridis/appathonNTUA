  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic suture for complete and partial &gt;50% thickness Rotator Cuff Tears (RCT) is the
      gold standard. However, there is no evidence of superiority of delayed postoperative
      mobilization protocols versus early ones, in terms of ROM, pain, quality of life and
      complications in last review published in 2019 by AAOS. Although, excessive immobilization
      can lead into stiffness, neuropathic pain or adhesive capsulitis. All of these are
      complications which can diminish patient quality of life or prolong their return to work or
      sports activities.

      This is an experimental, prospective, non-blind, comparative, randomized clinical trial,
      between two options of treatment. On one treatment branch, we will continue applying our
      standard postoperative 4 weeks immobilization rehabilitation program with a sling in
      adduction and internal rotation. On the other treatment branch, we will start passive
      mobilization during second week after surgery, including controlled external rotation
      movements. All recruited patients will be followed-up during 12 months.

      Our main objective is to compare differences in terms of functionality (using ASES scale).
      Secondary objectives are to compare differences in terms of ROM, functionality (using CMS and
      UCLA scales), pain (using VAS score), need of analgesic drugs, quality of life (using EQ-5D
      scale), return to previous work and sports activities, patient adhesion to protocol,
      complications and MRI rotator cuff retear ratio at 12 months follow-up.

      After this study, we hope to develop a new postoperative mobilization protocol for patients.
      This protocol will be focused on timing, and self-administrated exercises in order to involve
      patients in their recovery, in the fastest and safest way for them.
