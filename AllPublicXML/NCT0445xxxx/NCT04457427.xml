  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective, single-center feasibility study of the use and
      benefits of NeuRx DPS in patients undergoing tracheostomy for failure to wean.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 patients undergoing tracheostomy for failure to wean will be randomized into one of 3
      cohorts (5 in each cohort): Cohort A: tracheostomy with no intervention; Cohort B:
      tracheostomy with DPS implantation and immediate stimulation and monitoring and Cohort C:
      tracheostomy with DPS implantation with monitoring followed with stimulation on day 5.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is intubated, on mechanical ventilation, undergoing tracheostomy, and expected
             to undergo mechanical ventilation for at least 5 days

          -  Signed written informed consent has been obtained prior to performing any study
             related procedure(s)
