  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Pakistan, breastfeeding is widely practiced. National data suggests that 94% of infants &lt;2
      years of age receive breastmilk at some point. However, the introduction of complementary
      foods often occurs early. At 3 months of age, it is suggested that only 54% of Pakistani
      infants are exclusively breastfed. This declines with each month of age. Because the
      production and release of breastmilk is influenced by the frequency and intensity of
      suckling, early initiation of complementary feeding can reduce breastmilk output. Given that
      complementary foods are introduced early within Pakistan, we hypothesize that breastmilk
      composition will change between 1 and 3 months postpartum among those mother-infant pairs if
      nutritive complementary foods are introduced early (i.e., before 6 months). In this study, we
      aim to better understand how breastmilk composition changes over time among infants recruited
      at 1 month of age who are exclusively breastfed or receive only non-nutritive feeds. This is
      a substudy to the Matiari emPowerment and Preconception Supplementation (MaPPS) Trial
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03287882).
