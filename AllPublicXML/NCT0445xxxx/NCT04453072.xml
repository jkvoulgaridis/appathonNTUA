    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well a behavioral weight loss intervention consisting of
      a smartphone application and coaching works for the promotion of weight loss in adolescents
      and young adults after a stem cell transplant. This study may help researchers learn more
      about how adolescents and young adults can lose weight and develop healthy eating habits.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied as
      a smartphone application (app) with telephone coaching, on weight outcomes of overweight and
      obese post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) adolescents and young adults.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the changes in metabolic parameters and physical activity levels, in addition
      to modifications in addictive eating behaviors, motivation, and self-regulatory behaviors.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction of this intervention.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive an iPhone with W8Loss2Go app, a body scale and a digital food scale to weigh
      themselves and food daily. Patients interact with coaches via text messages for 4 days weekly
      and receive weekly 15 minute phone calls for appointment reminders, emotional support,
      progress discussion, and follow up on items discussed in a prior visit or phone call.
      Patients also have telemedicine interviews with the coach lasting 60 minutes at 2 and 4
      months to elicit both positive and negative impacts on weight management and to identify
      barriers such as emotional eating, displacement behaviors, poor coping skills to life
      stressors, and social challenges. Patients who opt to extend the intervention until month 12
      attend an additional telemedicine meeting with the coach. Patients also complete
      questionnaires over approximately 1.5 hours.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body mass index (BMI) status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcomes measures will be height (meters), weight (kg), and BMI (kg/m^2). Height will be measured to assess consistency in height measurements. Weight will be measured to assess trends in weight over the time span of the intervention. BMI will be measured as a product of weight and height to obtain an appropriate metric that accounts for these measures, and is the standard measure to assess weight progression in weight intervention studies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance with app intervention will be measured by daily interaction with the application and the coach. A point system has been designed in the application to measure compliance with the app intervention, measured by +/- weight measured daily, logging of problem foods, logging of snacking panel, and logging of meals. The coach interacts with the participants through text daily, and through phone calls weekly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:
