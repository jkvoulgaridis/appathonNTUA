  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time restricted feeding (TRF) has been emerging as a potential weight loss strategy that
      avoids major dietary changes but achieves strong effects. It also improves insulin
      sensitivity through increased human growth hormone. This effect helps to improve the root
      cause of weight gain and has additional benefits for women with PCOS.

    <description>Daily caloric requirement was calculated using basal metabolic rate (BMR) calculator. All women were directed to decrease calorie intake by 500 calories.
Women were told about timed restricted feeding. They were required to fast for 16 hours and consume their allotted calories during the remaining 8 hours.</description>
