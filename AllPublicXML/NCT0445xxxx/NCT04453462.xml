  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy. Carpal tunnel release is
      indicated when failed conservative treatment. Although it can be done either with local
      anesthesia or brachial plexus block, there is no gold standard of anesthetic choice. The
      study is conducted to compare the efficacy of two methods and we hypothesized that the local
      direct median nerve block has effectiveness in intraoperative pain control not inferior to
      brachial plexus block in endoscopic carpal tunnel release.

      The study is randomized-control trial conducted in single center (Orthopaedic department,
      Faculty of medicine, Thammasat university) The patients with failed conservative treatment of
      carpal tunnel syndrome confirmed by EMG are enrolled and ramdomized with computerized
      block-of-4 method.The local direct median nerve block is done by the surgeon and brachial
      plexus block in done by single anesthesiologist after that the patient will be operated with
      1-portal endoscopic carpal tunnel release (Agee technque) by single surgeon. Immediate
      postoperative the blinded observer will ask the patient about interaoperative pain in visual
      analog scale then the pateint is asked to record the 2-hr, 4-hr ,6-hr and 12-hr postoperative
      pain in case record form.The patient will return the case record form at 1-week and also
      stitched off the wound then next follow up will be 4, 12, 24 weeks to assess functional
      outcome (Thai version Bonton questionaire)
