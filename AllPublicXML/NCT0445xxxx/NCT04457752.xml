      Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) challenge the most experienced wound care specialist. The US
      Wound Registry reports that only 40% of DFUs heal in 12 weeks1. Woundologists have adopted
      the phrase, &quot;time is tissue.&quot; This adage reminds clinicians that the longer a DFU remains
      open, the greater the risk of infection, major amputation and death. The diabetic with a foot
      ulcer has a mortality rate of 47% which exceeds the mortality2 from most common cancers3.
      Beyond patient suffering, the treatment of DFUs cost the US health care system more than 15
      billion dollars annually4.

      In recent years, several clinical trials have demonstrated that products derived from human
      placental membranes promote the healing of DFUs5. Research has confirmed that growth factors
      present in amniotic membrane induce angiogenesis, stimulate human dermal fibroblast
      proliferation, and recruit stem cells important to wound repair and regeneration to the DFU6.
      All these factors are highly desirable properties in the healing of chronic DFUs.

      A novel dual layer amniotic membrane (DLAM, Artacent™, Tides Medical. Lafayette, LA)
      potentially can increase the delivery of growth factors due to its double layer of amniotic
      membrane. A prospective case series demonstrated good healing rates in DFUs: 65% healing at
      12 weeks7. The current study is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy
      of DLAM in DFUs.

    <intervention_model_description>Dual Layer Amniotic Membrane (DLAM). Artacent® Artacent® is a double layer of dehydrated amniotic membrane. The amnion is harvested from human placenta obtained during planned Caesarean sections. Tides Medical uses a proprietary process to clean and decellularize the amniotic membrane. The amnion is then folded into a bi-layer with the stromal sides facing outward. The dual layer is dried and cut into various sizes. In the final step the DLAM is terminally sterilized.
Atracent®, like all other placental-derived products, is FDA cleared for homologous use through the 361 pathway. It is indicated for non-healing ulcers applied to a debrided, clean and uninfected ulcers.</intervention_model_description>

          3. At randomization subjects must have a target ulcer with a minimum surface area of 0.7
             cm2 and a maximum surface area of 20.0 cm2 measured post debridement with the Tissue
             Analytics photographic planimetry App.

          4. The target ulcer must have been present for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 52
             weeks of standard of care prior to the initial screening visit.

          5. The target ulcer must be located on the foot with at least 50% of the ulcer below the
             malleolus.

          6. The target ulcer must be full thickness without exposed bone.

          7. The affected limb must have adequate perfusion confirmed by vascular assessment. Any
             of the following methods performed within 3 months of the first screening visit are
             acceptable:

               1. ABI between 0.7 and ≤ 1.3;

               2. TBI ≥ 0.6;

               3. TCOM ≥ 40 mmHg;

               4. PVR: biphasic.

          8. If the subject has two or more ulcers, they must be separated by at least 2 cm. The
             largest ulcer satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be designated as
             the target ulcer.

          9. Target ulcers located on the plantar aspect of the foot must be offloaded for at least
             14 days prior to randomization.

         10. The subject must consent to using the prescribed off-loading method for the duration
             of the study.

         11. The subject must agree to attend the weekly study visits required by the protocol.

         12. The subject must be willing and able to participate in the informed consent process.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A subject known to have a life expectancy of &lt; 6 months is excluded.

          2. The subject is excluded if the target ulcer is not secondary to diabetes.

          3. If the target ulcer is infected or if there is cellulitis in the surrounding skin, the
             subject is excluded.

          4. If there is evidence of osteomyelitis complicating the target ulcer, the subject is
             excluded.

          5. A potential subject cannot have an infection in the target ulcer or in a remote
             location that requires systemic antibiotic therapy.

          6. A subject receiving immunosuppressants (including systemic corticosteroids at doses
             greater than 10 mg of Prednisone per day or equivalent) or cytotoxic chemotherapy is
             excluded.

          7. The topical application of steroids to the ulcer surface within one month of initial
             screening is not permitted.

          8. A subject with a previous partial amputation on the affected foot is excluded if the
             resulting deformity impedes proper offloading of the target ulcer.

          9. If a subject has glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than or equal to 12% within 3
             months of the initial screening visit he/she is excluded.

         10. The subject is excluded if the surface area of the target ulcer has reduced in size by
             more than 20% in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screening visit (&quot;historical&quot; run-in
             period). Photographic planimetry is not required for measurements taken during the
             historical run-in period (e.g. calculating surface area using length x width is
             acceptable).

         11. The subject is excluded if the surface area measurement of the Target ulcer decreases
             by 20% or more during the 2-week screening phase: the 2 weeks from the initial
             screening visit (S1) to the TV-1/randomization visit during which time the subject
             received SOC.

         12. A Subject with an acute Charcot foot, or an inactive Charcot foot, that impedes proper
             offloading of the target ulcer is excluded.

             investigational product within the previous 30 days is excluded.

         16. A subject who in the opinion of the investigator, has a medical or psychological
             condition that may interfere with study assessments is excluded.

         17. A Subject treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a Cellular and/or Tissue Product
             (CTP) in the 30 days prior to the initial screening visit is excluded.
