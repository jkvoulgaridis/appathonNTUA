  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a rare, X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by an
      abnormal gene encoding the α-galactosidase A (αGLA) enzyme. The αGLA enzyme is ubiquitously
      expressed throughout the body and is responsible for the breakdown of glycosphingolipids,
      deficiency of which results in the accumulation of specific glycosphingolipids that are
      associated with the pathophysiology of the disease. Current treatment for Fabry disease is
      limited to the symptomatic management of pain, conventional management of complications, and
      methods to increase the availability of functional αGLA.

      This clinical study aims to investigate the long-term safety and durability of αGLA in
      patients who have been dosed with a new gene therapy product (FLT190) in earlier clinical
      studies.
