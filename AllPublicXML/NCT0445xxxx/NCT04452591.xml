  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the activity of intravesical (IVE) administration of CG0070 in patients with
      tissue pathology confirmed non-muscular invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have
      Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive disease, with either carcinoma in situ with or
      without Ta/T1 disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label trial designed to evaluate CG0070 + DDM in patients with NMIBC who have failed
      prior BCG therapy. Single treatment arm that will enroll up to 110 patients with carcinoma in
      situ with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 papillary disease

      BCG failure is defined as a persistent or recurrent disease within 12 months of completion of
      adequate BCG therapy.

    <description>Patients with carcinoma in situ with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 papillary disease.
CG0070 will be administered intravesically (IVE) following a sequence of bladder washes with 5% DDM and normal saline. CG0070 will be administered weekly x 6 on Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. If the patient has persistent high-grade disease at Week 13, the patient will receive another cycle of 6 weekly treatments. If there is no disease present at Week 13 (e.g. complete response) then the patient will receive 3 weekly treatments.
Beginning at Week 25, patients will receive weekly x 3 treatments every 12 weeks through week 49then every 24 weeks thereafter.</description>
