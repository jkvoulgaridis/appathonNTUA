  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will acquire preliminary data on the feasibility and effectiveness of an
      innovative and scalable strategy for improving access to effective sleep health care for
      preschool-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The investigators will develop
      and test an on-line delivery adaptation of the existing behavioral sleep interventions for
      preschool aged children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Access to effective treatments for sleep disorders is a persistent challenge. This is due to
      the lack of trained clinicians as well as caregiver resources to seek out and utilize such
      critical services. The SweetDreams intervention will solve this problem with on-line delivery
      of educational materials and treatment strategies for an evidence-based intervention. It will
      be readily available to caregivers at any time and through multiple outlets such a computer,
      tablet, and telephone, modes of delivery favored by and effective for parents of children in
      this age group.

      This adaptation will address key challenges to sleep health care for children with ASD: (1)
      Learning differences of children with ASD by incorporating intervention principles from the
      TEACHH model; (2) Overcome the challenge of treatment access due to the limited number of
      qualified providers by developing didactic videos for online and mobile device delivery
      (referred to as SweetDreams); and, (3) Responding to the NIH emphasis on developing &quot;more
      effective interventionsâ€¦by targeting interventions to the identified needs of community
      members,&quot; SweetDreams will use a dynamic process involving extensive collaboration with
      children, parents, developmental pediatricians, and other experts on youth with ASD.
