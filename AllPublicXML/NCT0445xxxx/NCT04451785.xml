  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) are characterized by increased red
      blood cell (RBC) fragility and a loss of RBC deformability. While the clinical variability of
      the disease may be heterogenous from one patient to another, some studies reported the
      occurrence of vascular complications, notably in patients who have been splenectomized.

      Purpose : The aim of the study is to test the associations between the degree of vascular
      dysfunction and the extent of hemolysis, the amount of circulating microparticles, the level
      of erythrosis and the degree of RBC biophysical alterations.

      Abstract : Recent studies reported the occurrence of vascular complications in patients with
      HS, notably in patients who have previously been splenectomized. However, the exact reasons
      of these complications are unknown and no study investigated the vascular function in HS
      patients.

      Main objective Highlight the presence of altered vascular function in HS patients and test
      the relationships with the level of hemolysis and circulating microparticles.

      Secondary objectives To evaluate the associations between clinical severity and 1) the level
      of vascular dysfunction and 2) several biomarkers (hemolysis, hematological parameters,
      circulating microparticles, erythrosis, RBC biophysical properties).
