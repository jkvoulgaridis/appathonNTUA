  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for exploration of more definitive and cost effective non-arthroplasty treatments of
      osteoarthritis (OA) has been demonstrated by the orthopedic and health economic research.

      Embolotherapy of neovessels associated with OA joints has been shown to be promising in
      patients with knee OA. There is a need for level one evidence drawn from randomized clinical
      trials to prove the safety, feasibility and efficacy of knee embolotherapy compared to
      standard of care.

      This randomized pilot study will assign 10 patients with mild-moderate OA to undergo
      geniculate artery embolization plus standard of care (defined in this study as: physical
      therapy and oral anti-inflammatory medications, with a maximum of 1 joint injection at the
      time of enrollment) and 10 patients to receive only medical standard of care (also having had
      a maximum of 1 joint injection prior to enrollment). The goal of this pilot study is to
      obtain preliminary estimates of safety and efficacy of embolotherapy to provide sustained
      symptom control and modify disease progression in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, two-arm, open label, pilot study to assess feasibility and safety
      and obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of geniculate artery embolization in reducing
      pain compared to a control group undergoing conservative presurgical management. The 20
      patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 10 in 1:1 allocation. One group will
      have embolization of the geniculate artery branches and standard of care while the other will
      have only the standard care. Following the completion of the 10 participants in each arm, a
      safety and data review will be undertaken (Visit 4 in the GAE group and Visit 2 of the SOC).
      The data will be assessed regarding the trends between the groups as they relate to
      KOOS/WOMAC pain scale, MRI / Xray evaluation of OA, and presence of inflammatory biomarkers.

    <measure>Change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS measures 5 patient-relevant dimensions, each scored separately:
Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items).
Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems). Dimension scores are calculated as the mean score of the included items divided by 4 and multiplied by 100. Range of subscale scores is 0-100 with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Items are rated on a Likert scale of 0 (extreme) to 4 (none). Raw sub-scale scores are normalized to produce percentage scores in accordance with the KOOS by multiplying each score by 100/96. Total scores are a sum of the normalized sub-scales scores and range 0-100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>
