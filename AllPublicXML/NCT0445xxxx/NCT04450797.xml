      This study is to prospectively compare Ultrasound guided (US-G) Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt
      (VPS) placement to stereotactic navigation in a randomized controlled fashion with the
      surgical intervention time as primary outcome. All patients entering the University Hospital
      of Basel for elective or emergent VPS surgery will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to one of the
      study groups at admission or the day before the operation.

    <textblock>
      Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement is one of the most frequent procedures in
      neurosurgical practice. The position of the proximal ventricular catheter is important since
      it influences possible malfunction of the VPS. For the improvement of accuracy in proximal
      VPS placement, navigation-based insertion techniques have been developed. VPS placement using
      stereotactic navigation has shown a high accuracy of catheter placement been developed. VPS
      placement using stereotactic navigation has shown a high accuracy of catheter placement,
      while the main limitations are that for referencing, the head of the patient needs to be
      fixed in a head holder and the preoperative set-up can be time-consuming. US-G VPS placement
      using a burr hole probe was described as an alternate for image-guided VPS placement
      technique. For US-G VPS placement head fixation or preoperative registration is not needed.
      This study is to prospectively compare Ultrasound guided (US-G) Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt
      (VPS) placement to stereotactic navigation in a randomized controlled fashion with the
      surgical intervention time as primary outcome.

Catheters that did not fulfill all criteria have been defined as not optimal placed. Positioning of catheters will be further graded according to Yim et al. into grades I to IV (grade I: catheter terminates in the ipsilateral frontal horn, grade II: catheter terminates in contralateral frontal horn, grade III: catheter terminates in non-targeted CSF spaces, grade IV: catheter terminates intraparenchymally)</description>
