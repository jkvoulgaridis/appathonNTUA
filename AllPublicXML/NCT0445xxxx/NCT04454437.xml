  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacituzumab govitecan in
      Chinese patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who received at least
      two prior chemotherapy treatments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, single arm, multicenter study of sacituzumab govitecan in locally
      advanced or metastatic TNBC patients who are refractory or relapsing after at least 2 prior
      standard chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer, and these regimens will qualify regardless of triple-negative status at the time they
      were given. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the ORR per RECIST v 1.1 by Independent
      Review Committee (IRC) in all treated patients.

      Patients will be treated until progression requiring discontinuation of further treatment,
      unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Tumor response and
      progression will be assessed using RECIST v 1.1 and assessment by Investigator at the trial
      center will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis
      of response will also be performed by IRC, but this will not be used to make treatment
      decisions. All patients will visit the Investigator at regular intervals for assessment of
      safety parameters and AEs.

          4. Refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior standard of care chemotherapy
             regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

          6. Availability of archival tumor tissue or newly acquired biopsy (FFPE block or a
             minimum of number 10 unstaining tumor slides, recommended from recurrent or metastatic

             stage (adjuvant, neoadjuvant or advanced) when it was given. Patients who have
             contraindications or are intolerant to taxanes are eligible provided that they
             received at least 1 cycle of a taxane and showed contraindications or intolerance
             during or at the end of that cycle.

         11. Patients must have completed all prior cancer treatments at least 2 weeks prior to the
             first dose including chemotherapy (includes also endocrine treatment), radiotherapy
             and major surgery. Prior antibody treatment for cancer must have been completed at
             least 3 weeks prior to the first dose.

         12. Patients must have at least a 3-month life expectancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. Patients with unknown CNS
             metastatic status and any clinical signs indicative of CNS metastases are eligible if
             CNS metastases are excluded using CT and/or MRI scans.

          3. Patients with Gilbert's disease.

          4. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are

             patients with a history of HBV, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) testing is required
             and if positive, then HBV DNA testing will be performed and if positive the patient
             will be excluded.

             management.

         15. Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's
