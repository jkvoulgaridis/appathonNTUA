    <textblock>
      Acute symptoms of hypoglycemia influence all aspects of every day life and reduce quality of
      life of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents. Encountering with
      hypoglycemia can result in fobic fear of low blood glucose levels in patients with type 1
      diabetes and their parents.

    <textblock>
      Fear of hypoglycemia is the most commonly reported problem in type 1 diabetes. By definition,
      hypoglycemia is a state of low blood glucose that is lower than 3,6 mmol/L. It can lead to
      uncomfortable counter-regulatory symptoms such as headaches, nervousness, weakness sweating,
      confusion, irritability, sleepiness and dizziness. In worst cases hypoglycemia can lead to
      loss of consciousness, seizures and death.

      Unpredictability of episodes of hypoglycemia causes patients with diabetes and their family
      members to develop symptoms of anxiety and concerns related to hypoglycemia. The acute
      symptoms affect all fields of every day life and decrease quality of life of children and
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents. In some individuals and their families
      fear of hypoglycemia can lead to maintaining higher levels of blood glucose, excessive
      glucose monitoring, sleep deprivation, stress, obsessivity in self control, dependency to
      others etc.
