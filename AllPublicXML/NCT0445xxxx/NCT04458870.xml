  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot project aims to investigate the feasibility and the preliminary efficacy of a
      guided online acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention for distressed family
      caregivers of people with dementia. A one-group pretest-posttest design (n=15) will be used
      to investigate the potential effects of the 10 weekly online ACT intervention session on
      caregivers' outcomes at posttest (10 weeks).

    <textblock>
      This project will employ one-group pretest-posttest design to investigate the potential
      impact of a guided online ACT intervention on improving quality of life and psychological
      health in distressed family caregivers of people with dementia. After the baseline
      evaluation, eligible caregivers will receive 10 weekly ACT sessions, individually delivered
      by a licensed professional counselor online. Each session lasts for one hour. Primary outcome
      measures will be psychological distress measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
      (DASS)- 21 and care-related quality of life measured by the Care-related Quality of Life
      instrument (CarerQol). A one-time interview at the completion of the 10 weekly sessions will
      be conducted to explore caregivers' experiences in the intervention.
