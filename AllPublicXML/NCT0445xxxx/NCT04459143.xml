      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the participation of COPD patients to a workshop on
      advance directives increases the number of patients who write them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Disease is a common disease and should be the third leading cause of
      death in 2020. Patient hospitalized for an exacerbation of their COPD have a median survival
      of 2 years and 50% risk of being rehospitalized within 6 months.

      COPD patients may have symptoms that impair their life quality significantly and sometimes
      more than patients with cancer. This is particularly the case for dyspnea, which is
      frequently present.

      In the study, Investigators propose the setting up of health workshop on advance directives.
      This workshop is for sever or very severe COPD patients during their hospital stay in the
      post-acute care and pulmonary rehabilitation service.

      In this unit, investigators welcome patient from all the region of Ile de France for a
      hospital stay of approximately 6 weeks. A first workshop will take place during the third
      week of their care to inform them about COPD, exacerbations, prognostic and advance
      directives. Then, a personal interview with patients who have participated to this workshop
      will take place to collect their advance directives and their degree of satisfaction about
      this process.
