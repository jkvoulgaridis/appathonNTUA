  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obesity is a risk factor for the onset of obesity in adulthood and is a risk factor
      for various chronic non-communicable diseases. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is the name for a
      group of risk factors that increase cardiovascular risk and other health problems
      characterized by the presence of abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycaemia and high
      blood pressure. Numerous preclinical and clinical data suggest a potential role of the
      intestinal microbiota in these diseaes. Unfortunately, comparative studies of the gut
      microbiota are still scarce in pediatric subjects suffering from obesity than obesity
      complicated by MS. The aim is to study the metagenomics and metabolomics characteristics of
      the intestinal microbiota in obese children/adolescents with or without MS, that could
      provide useful data for innovative intervention strategies for these conditions.
