  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypokinetic gait disorder and Freezing of Gait (FOG) are frequent symptoms in the advanced
      stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). These impair quality of life and significantly increase
      the risk of falls. External movement pacemakers have been developed to improve gait and avert
      FOG by cueing strategies. The investigators developed a smart, small and lightweight,
      easy-to-handle wearable tactile cueing device (TCD), consisting of a control unit, two pulse
      generators and a battery-driven power supply. The device is programmed via a Graphical User
      Interface (GUI).

    <description>Each participant receives an individual training on how to use the Tactile Cueing Device and the set-up of the TCD will be done according to the results of a 10MWT and the participant`s preferences. Gait assessments with an activated or deactivated TCD are executed using the Timed Up and Go test, the 2-Minute Waling test and a treadmill (C-Mill). Also a long-term test run of the TCD during one day is planned.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Include patients who suffer from advanced PD. Characteristic symptoms of parkinsonian
             gait like hypokinetic movements and/or FOG have to be present.

          -  Parkinsonian gait is measured by the following items of the Movement Disorder Society
             Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS): item 2.12, item 2.13, item 3.10
             and item 3.11. The Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage during ON is 1-4/5.

          -  MoCA ≥ 22/30.

          -  Participant has signed the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability of the participant to understand the IC or to follow the procedures of the
             study (as judged by the Qualified Physician).

          -  Significantly, impaired cognitive skills render the participant unable to use the TCD.

          -  Presence of severe motor fluctuations and severely impaired walking ability as defined
             by HY stage V during ON.

          -  Clinically relevant skin lesions on the wrist or fixation points (usually the thighs).
