  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, international, comparative, randomized, open-label, phase II study conducted in
      two parallel groups.

      The study population will consist of male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years old with
      metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies, as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in patients eligible for these
      treatments.

      Patients will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio to treatment arms A and B.

        -  Arm A: regorafenib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, followed
           by trifluridine/tipiracil until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

        -  Arm B: trifluridine/tipiracil until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs,
           followed by regorafenib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
