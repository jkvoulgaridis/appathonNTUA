      Following a 10-hour overnight fast, subjects will be administered one dose of SHR1459 orally
      with 240 mL of ambient temperature water on Day 1. D2-D3 was the cleaning period.
      Itraconazole will be administered orally 200 mg/time/day form D4 to D8 after meal. On D7
      following a 10-hour overnight fast, subjects will be administered SHR1459 and itraconazole
      200 mg with 240 mL of ambient temperature water.
