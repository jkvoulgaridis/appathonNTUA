  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fremanezumab as
      compared to placebo for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine (EM).

      Secondary objectives are to further demonstrate the efficacy of Fremanezumab as compared to
      placebo for the preventive treatment of CH, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      Fremanezumab in the preventive treatment of COM and to evaluate the immunogenicity of
      Fremanezumab and the impact of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) on clinical outcomes in
      participants exposed to Fremanezumab.

      The total duration of the study is planned to be up to 36 months.

    <description>The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) is used to assess migraine disability across multiple domains of functioning including school, home, social, and recreational. The measure consists of 6 items measuring the number of days in which activities were missed as a result of headache/migraine. The measure yields a total score by summing items. Total scores correspond to one of four &quot;disability grades:&quot; 0-10 = little to no disability, 11-30 = mild disability, 31-50 = moderate disability, and &gt;50 = severe disability.</description>

    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) A health-related quality-of-life instrument that consists of a well-validated generic core measure and some condition and disease-specific modules. The instructions ask how much of a problem each item has been during the past 1 month. A 5-point response scale is utilized across child self-report and parent proxy report as follows:
0=never a problem;
almost never a problem;
sometimes a problem;
often a problem;
almost always a problem.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a clinical history of recurrent headache consistent with the diagnosis
             of migraine for at least 6 months before screening, consistent with ICHD-3 criteria
             (Headache Classification Committee of the IHS 2013), and a history of ≥15 headache
             days per month, of which ≥8 headache days were assessed as migraine days per month in
             each of the 3 months prior to screening (visit 1).

          -  The patient or parent/caregiver maintain a prospectively collected headache diary

          -  The patient does not have chronic daily headache. For the purposes of this study,
             chronic daily headache is operationally defined as &lt;4 headache-free days during the
             28-day baseline period.

        NOTE: Additional criteria apply; please contact the investigator for more information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is using medications containing opioids (including codeine) or
             barbiturates (including Fiorinal®, Fioricet®, or any other combination containing
             butalbital) for the treatment of migraine during the 3 months prior to the day of the
             screening visit.

          -  The patient or parent/caregiver maintain a prospectively collected headache diary

          -  The patient has used an intervention/device (eg, scheduled nerve block or transcranial
             magnetic stimulation) for the treatment of migraine during the 2 months prior to the
             day of the screening visit.

          -  The patient has a current history of a clinically significant psychiatric condition,
             any prior history of a suicide attempt, or a history of suicidal ideation with a
             specific plan within the past 2 years.

          -  The patient has an ongoing infection or a known history of human immunodeficiency
             virus infection, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, or chronic hepatitis B or C.

          -  The patient has a past or current history of cancer.

          -  The patient is pregnant or nursing.
