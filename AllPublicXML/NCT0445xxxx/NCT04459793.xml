  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year about 10.000 patients are referred due to suspected work-related disorders to the
      Danish departments of occupational medicine. In Denmark and internationally there is a lack
      of follow-up studies investigating the long-term prognosis of employees with work-related
      disorders. To facilitate long-term prognostic studies for work-related conditions a Danish
      Occupational Medicine Cohort has been established through the Danish population registers.

      Danish departments of occupational medicine examine around 10,000 patients each year referred
      due to suspected work-related disorders. In Denmark and internationally there is a lack of
      follow-up studies investigating the long-term prognosis of employees with work-related
      disorders. The purpose of this cohort is to facilitate long-term prognostic studies for
      conditions such as mental or musculoskeletal disorders.

      The Danish Occupational Medicine cohort has been created through The Danish National Patient
      Register and comprises all patients seen in Danish Departments of Occupational Medicine from
      2000-2018 (N=145.521). Numerous register data are included in the database from five years
      prior to time of inclusion until 2018. Examples of register data are; information on work,
      sickness absence and disability as well as number and type of contacts to health services,
      use of medication, income, education, type of occupation, social status, death and cause of
      death. Job Exposure Matrices (JEMs) on physical and psychosocial work exposure, life styles
      and other matrices are also available. The cohort will be updated with new patients and
      register data regularly.
