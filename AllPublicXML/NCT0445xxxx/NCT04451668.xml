      An Open Label Study to Evaluate Long-Term Safety and Tolerability of a Once Nightly
      Formulation of Sodium Oxybate for Extended-Release Oral Suspension (FT218) and the ability to
      switch from twice-nightly immediate release sodium oxybate to once-nightly FT218 for the
      Treatment of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness and Cataplexy in Subjects with Narcolepsy
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with narcolepsy, either NT1 or NT2, who completed the FT218
      Phase 3 REST-ON study as well as eligible subjects with narcolepsy currently receiving a
      stable dose of twice nightly sodium oxybate IR. Following a screening period, subjects who
      meet the entry criteria will be enrolled into the study. Subjects who completed the FT218
      Phase 3 REST-ON study will initiate treatment with FT218 at 4.5 g and will follow a titration
      schedule up to the highest tolerate dose (up to 9 g), or the dose deemed effective by the
      investigator. Subjects previously maintained on twice nightly sodium oxybate IR will initiate
      FT218 treatment at a dose equivalent or closest to the total gram dose of twice-nightly
      sodium oxybate IR and then titrate up or down, in accord with safety and effectiveness as
      determined by the investigator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects receiving a stable doses of twice-nightly sodium oxybate IR for at least 4
             months who are willing to switch to FT218

          -  Subjects who completed the CLFT218-1501 REST-ON Study in a compliant manner and for
             whom the Investigator determines would receive benefit from treatment with FT218

          -  Subjects have a diagnosis of narcolepsy, either confirmed prior to the REST-ON study
             or as confirmed by the Investigator for subjects currently on twice-nightly sodium
             oxybate IR.

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent for study participation. Young
             adults (16 and 17 years old) who have not reached the age of majority must be capable

             Hypnotics, Anxiolytics, Sedating antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Other experimental
             medications designed to treat narcolepsy, cataplexy or any other condition, or Other
             medications with significant sedating effects/CNS depressant effects

          -  A diagnosis of sleep apnea where AHI is â‰¥15 and/or current use of CPAP or other
             devices for sleep apnea.
