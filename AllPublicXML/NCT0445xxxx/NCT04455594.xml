    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, age at least 18 years, no more than 75 years.

          2. Previously untreated, histologically documented NSCLC with completely or potentially
             resectable IIIA-N2 nonsquamous NSCLC(according to Version 8 of AJCC staging). N2 is
             defined as as radiologically and pathologically confirmed, nonbulky metastases to
             single-station mediastinal lymph nodes (lymph nodes &lt; 2 cm in short axis) that are
             expected to be completely resectable.

          3. Tumor tissue samples or blood samples are confirmed as EGFR sensitive mutations by
             central laboratory tests (including Ex19del or L858R, both alone or with other EGFR
             mutations). If the tumor tissue is accessible, the tumor tissue is recommended to be
             submitted for examination. If tumor tissue is not accessible or patient cannot undergo
             tissue biopsy, blood sample is also allowed.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with no
             deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.

          5. At least 1 lesion that has not previously been irradiated, that has not been chosen
             for biopsy during the study screening period, and that can be accurately measured at
             Baseline as &gt;= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have
             short axis &gt;= 15mm) with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI), whichever is suitable for accurately repeated measurements. If only one
             measurable lesion exists, it is acceptable to be used (as a target lesion) as long as
             it has not been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment scans are done at
             least 14days afar the screening biopsy is performed.

          6. Women of childbearing potential must use a contraception method during the study
             treatment and for at least 3 months after the treatment is completed; must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment or proved no risk of pregancy by
             meeting one of the following criteria:

               1. Postmenopausal defined as age more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12
                  months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

               2. Women under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more, following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory.

               3. Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not by tubal ligation.

          7. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception (i.e., condoms) during
             the study treatment and for at least 3 months after the treatment is completed.

          8. Signed and dated informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with any of the following:

               1. Prior surgical resection of lung cancer.

               2. Prior treatment with any EGFR TKI.

               3. Prior treatment with any chemotherapy for NSCLC

               4. Prior treatment with any radiotherapy for NSCLC

               5. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the
                  first dose of study drug.

               6. Medications that are predominantly CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers or
                  sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range within 7 days of
                  the first dose of study drug.

          2. Any concurrent and/or other active malignancy that has required treatment within 2
             years of first dose of study drug.

          3. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment, with the
             exception of alopecia and Grade 2 prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy.

          4. Patients with malignant pleural effusion. [only exception: pleural effusion on CT scan
             (not visible on CXR) or considered too small and pericardial effusion]

          5. Patients who received yellow-fever vaccine or other attenuated live vaccine during
             pemetrexed treatment.

          6. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
             hypertension or active bleeding diatheses, which, in the Investigator's opinion, makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial OR which would jeopardize
             compliance with the protocol such as active infection. Screening for chronic
             conditions is not required.

          7. Refractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the study drug, or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude
             adequate absorption of Almonertinib.

          8. Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               1. Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 ms obtained from 3
                  electrocardiograms (ECGs), using the screening clinic's ECG machine and
                  Fridericia's formula for QT interval correction (QTcF).

               2. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of
                  the resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third-degree heart
                  block, second-degree heart block, PR interval &gt; 250 ms).

               3. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events, such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT
                  interval.

               4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;= 40%.

          9. History of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung disease,

               6. Total bilirubin (TBL) &gt; 1.5 x ULN or &gt; 3 x ULN in the presence of documented
                  Gilbert's Syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia).

               7. Creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min (measured
                  or calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation); confirmation of creatinine

         14. With lactose in the tablets, patients with rare genetic disease like galactose
             intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use
