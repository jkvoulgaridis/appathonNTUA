    <textblock>
      This study will explore the safety and antiviral activity of ABI-H0731 when added to a
      nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NrtI) in participants who are partially
      virologically suppressed.

          -  Current or prior treatment for CHB with lamivudine, telbivudine, adefovir, HBV core
             inhibitor, or previous treatment with an investigational agent for HBV infection

          -  Presence of substitutions in the HBV polymerase coding region which may confer reduced
             susceptibility to NrtIs

          -  Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus,
             hepatitis E virus, or hepatitis D virus

             hypertension; pulmonary disease; chronic or recurrent renal or urinary tract disease;
             liver disease other than CHB; endocrine disorder; autoimmune disorder; poorly
             controlled diabetes mellitus; neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, or mucocutaneous
             conditions requiring frequent treatment, seizure disorders requiring treatment;
             ongoing infection or other medical conditions requiring frequent medical management or
             pharmacologic or surgical treatment that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the
             Sponsor, makes the subject unsuitable for trial participation

          -  History of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

          -  Exclusionary laboratory parameters at Screening:

                  ng/mL, the participant is eligible if a hepatic imaging trial prior to initiation
                  of study drug reveals no lesions indicative of possible HCC.

               -  International Normalized Ratio &gt;1.5 × ULN

               -  Glomerular filtration rate &lt;50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Chronic Kidney Disease
