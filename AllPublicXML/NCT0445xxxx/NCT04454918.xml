    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine ABA of TAK-906 following single oral (capsule)
      administration of 50 milligram (mg) of TAK-906 and single intravenous microtracer dose
      administration of 100 microgram (mcg) (approximately 1 microcurie [mcCi]) of [14C]-TAK-906 in
      Period 1 (ABA), and to determine the mass balance of TAK-906 in urine and feces following a
      single oral (solution) administration of 50 mg (approximately 100 mcCi) of [14C]-TAK-906 in
      Period 2 (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination [ADME]).

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. The study will determine ABA in Period
      1, and ADME, and mass balance of TAK-906 after single oral administration in Period 2 in
      healthy adult male participants. Plasma and urine samples will be collected for PK
      determination; plasma, whole blood, urine, and feces samples will be collected for total
      radioactivity (TRA) determination; and plasma, urine, and feces samples will be collected to
      characterize the metabolite profiles of TAK-906.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study is designed to consist of 2
      periods: Period 1 (ABA study period) and Period 2 (ADME study period). In Period 1 (ABA study
      period), all participants will receive single unlabeled oral 50 mg dose of TAK-906 as capsule
      followed by microdose of 100 mcg (approximately 1 mcCi) [14C]-TAK-906 as intravenous infusion
      followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before the dose in Period 2. In Period 2
      (ADME study period), all participants will receive a single dose of 50 mg (approximately 100
      mcCi) [14C]-TAK-906 as an oral solution.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 65 days including screening period. Participants
      will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

               -  Any drug, including prescription and non-prescription medications, herbal
                  remedies, or vitamin supplements within 14 days prior to the first dosing and

                  Magnesia® (that is, magnesium hydroxide [less than or equal to (&lt;=) 60 mL per day
                  after Day 3 in Period 1 and after Day 8 in Period 2]) may be permitted during the
                  study, only after dosing, if necessary to treat adverse events (AEs). Additional
                  administration of Milk of Magnesia® may be administered on other days at
                  discretion of the Investigator.

               -  Any drugs known to significantly affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism
                  or elimination of TAK-906 within 28 days prior to the first dosing and throughout
                  the study. Appropriate sources (example, Flockhart Table TM) will be consulted to
                  confirm lack of PK/pharmacodynamics interaction with study drug.
