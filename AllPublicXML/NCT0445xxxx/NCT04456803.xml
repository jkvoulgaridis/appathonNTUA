      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ferric citrate tablet in the control of serum
      phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open‐label, parallel, phase III study. This study is
      consisting of a Screening/Washout period (14 days) and a Treatment/Observation period (12
      weeks). The subjects with regular hemodialysis should stop using the phosphorus binder before
      the Washout period. During the Treatment period, the subjects will be randomly assigned to
      the ferric citrate tablets group (study group) or sevelamer carbonate tablet group (control
      group) in the ratio of 1:1.
