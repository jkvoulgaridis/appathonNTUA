  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of the modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up
      (mABC) Intervention, adapted for use with peripartum mothers receiving medication-assisted
      treatment for opioid use disorder. The investigators expect that mothers who receive the
      modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention will show more nurturing and
      sensitive parenting and more adaptive physiological regulation than parents who receive a
      control intervention. The investigators expect that infants whose mothers receive the
      modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up will show better outcomes in attachment,
      behavior, and physiological regulation than infants of parents who receive the control
      intervention.

      Pregnant mothers will be randomly assigned to receive the modified ABC intervention or the
      control intervention (modified DEF). Hypotheses relate to parent and child outcomes
      associated with the intervention. Hypothesis 1: Compared to mothers who receive the control
      intervention, mothers who receive the mABC intervention will show more nurturing and
      sensitive parenting, enhanced neural activity during parenting-relevant tasks, and more
      normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic nervous system activity, and cortisol
      production. Hypothesis 2: Compared to infants of mothers who receive the control
      intervention, infants of mothers who receive the mABC intervention will show more organized
      and secure attachment patterns, better behavioral regulation during stressors, more advanced
      social-emotional development, and more normative patterns of DNA methylation, autonomic
      nervous system activity, and cortisol production. Hypothesis 3: Enhanced maternal sensitivity
      will mediate effects of the mABC intervention on improved infant outcomes.

    <description>The mother will be assessed interacting with the infant simulator. Parental sensitivity (a composite of following the child's lead in interactions, providing nurturance when the child is distressed, and showing positive regard) will be assessed using procedures and coding from the assessment used by the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (Brady-Smith et al., 1999). Sensitivity will be assessed on a 5-point scale with higher scores indicating greater sensitivity.</description>
