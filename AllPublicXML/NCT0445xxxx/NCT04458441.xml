  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral central catheter application, especially in extremely low birth weight premature
      babies, is an intensive care follow-up procedure. There are many clinical studies in areas
      such as catheter type, skin disinfection, catheter duration, catheter infection. In our
      practice, it was observed that premature baby was less uncomfortable, the number of trials
      decreased, and the change in body temperature was less with the application of hot skin
      disinfection in our practice. With a prospective randomized study, the investigators wanted
      to document their observational data scientifically.

      Babies under 32 gestation week and 1250 g who are treated at level 3 NICU and need peripheral
      central catheter will be included in the study. In the preparation of peripheral central
      catheter application, skin cleaning is performed with povidone iodine in our clinic. The
      investigators used during the povidione iodine preparation phase after heating the bain-marie
      method with sterile conditions. The investigators predicted that the premature baby would
      have less discomfort with warm povidion iodine. To demonstrate this, it was planned to take
      both video recordings during the application and N-PASS evaluation by an experienced person
      who does not know the povidone iodine temperature used .In preparation of the catheter except
      the person who did povidone iodine skin cleansing, nobody knows the heat. The catheters were
      administered by a single experienced person. The study was designed to be unaware of the
      povidin iodine application temperature of the person applying the catheter and the N-PASS
      assessment.
