  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of combining pembrolizumab with a
      single fraction radiation boost in patients with early/operable breast cancer. The secondary
      objectives are to assess clinical response on pre- and post-treatment clinical, imaging, and
      histology exams, and to assess immune response on pre and post treatment blood and tissue
      samples by tracking change in Ki67 + CD8 T cells in peripheral blood and in extent of tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 trial employing a Simon Two Stage design to evaluate the safety,
      feasibility, and efficacy (defined as 10% increase in Ki67+ peripheral CD8 T cells
      post-treatment) of a single pembrolizumab infusion with or without radiation boost prior to
      definitive surgery in patients with operable breast cancer. The study has four arms. Arms 1
      and 2 differ by the order of radiation boost and pembrolizumab administration. In arm 3,
      patients will receive pembrolizumab alone. A minimum of 6 patients (3 per arms 1 and 2) will
      be enrolled in the safety run-in portion of the study. An additional 30 patients (9
      additional patients in arms 1 and 2 and up to 12 patients in arm 3) will be enrolled once
      pembrolizumab with the combination radiation is considered feasible and additional funding is
      available. Arm 4 represents our control arm in which patients will follow usual care but will
      be consented for blood/tissue collection using a separate protocol (Penn IRB 801539).

    <description>Feasibility is defined as patient tolerability of the investigational treatment and no excessive delay in surgery in our participants. The interval to breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy was based on review of our records in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery in 2016. The average time to breast conservation surgery is 24.3 days (80% between 9 and 51 days) and for mastectomy with reconstruction 41.6 days (80% between 10 and 67 days).</description>

          7. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          8. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
