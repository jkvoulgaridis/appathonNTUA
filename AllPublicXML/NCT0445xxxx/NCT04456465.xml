      To understand the clinical characteristics of DPN patients in China; To investigate the
      distribution of DPN patients with depression and anxiety symptoms; To investigate the related
      factors of moderate and severe pain in DPN patients; To investigate the treatment of pain and
      depression and/or anxiety in DPN patients.

      Pain diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a heavy global economic burden. An American
      observational study in 2013 showed that the total average annual adjusted direct medical
      cost/person for DPN patients was $4,841, and the total average annual adjusted indirect
      medical cost/person was $9,730. A retrospective study in the United States in 2015 showed
      that the total annual direct medical cost per person for diabetes was $6,632, DPN ($12,492),
      DPN ($27,931), and severe DPN ($30,755) were 4.6 times higher than those for patients with
      diabetes alone. According to the 2015 European survey, the total annual direct medical cost
      per person for DPN patients in the United Kingdom was €2,963 (£2,511), of which 40% was used
      for hospitalization.

      At present, there are no studies on the population epidemiology, depression and drug use of
      DPN in China. This study mainly investigates the above problems.

    <measure>moderate and severe pain (VAS score ≥4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time at recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation factors of moderate and severe pain (VAS score ≥4) were analyzed exploratively. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is the major depressive disorder (MDD) module of the full PHQ. Scores each of the criteria of MDD as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day), providing a 0-27 severity score.</description>

    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7): This symptom assessment tool measures seven anxiety symptoms on 4-point scales. Average time to complete: 3 minutes. Interpretation: Total scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety.</description>
