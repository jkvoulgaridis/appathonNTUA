    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of a fully randomized validation trial for
      the Oxalert EPO. All patients will wear the Oxalert for 24 hours preoperatively in the
      monitoring only mode (no alerts), throughout hospitalization up to six days, and for 24
      post-discharge hours. Randomization will be to Oxalert in monitor-only mode or to its normal
      mode which provides progressive audible and tactile alerts for hypoxemia.

        The investigators will enroll patients who are at increased risk for respiratory
        insufficiency. Specifically, the investigators will focus on patients scheduled for
        laparoscopic or open major abdominal or pelvic surgery whose analgesia is primarily
        opioid-based. The investigators will further restrict enrollment to obese patients (body
        mass index kg/m2) who are likely to have respiratory compromise. Both men and women will be
        recruited.
