    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, open-label, multi-site study will explore the safety and feasibility of
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and adjunctive coaching and caregiver support for individuals
      with Anorexia Nervosa restricting subtype (AN-R) and Binge Eating Disorder (BED). The study
      will enroll 12 participants who meet DSM-5 criteria for AN-R, 6 participants who meet DSM-5
      criteria for BED, and a caregiver for non-drug psychotherapy support per participant for a
      total of 36 participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both Anorexia Nervosa restricting subtype (AN-R) and Binge Eating Disorder (BED) are
      associated with a variety of physical and mental health conditions, including anxiety,
      depression, cardiovascular complications, etc., as well as lower health-related quality of
      life and higher healthcare costs. Significant shame and stigma underlie these disorders and
      often delay treatment. As such, only 23% of persons with an eating disorder (ED) obtain
      treatment. Among those who receive treatment for an ED, remission rates vary widely from 27
      to 85%. As few as 3% of adults meeting criteria for BED are formally diagnosed, indicating
      this disorder often goes unrecognized and untreated. Of those who do receive treatment for
      BED, half do not fully respond to treatment. While various interventions have been used to
      treat adults with AN, existing treatment approaches are relatively ineffective. Furthermore,
      there is consensus in the field that risk for relapse in persons with AN is especially high
      within the first year following treatment

      MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which may counteract emotional avoidance and
      hyperarousal in the context of therapy. MDMA also alters basic emotional processes by slowing
      identification of negative emotions and increasing responses to positive emotions in others.
      Early observers noted increased acceptance of self and others, increased tolerance of
      emotionally upsetting topics and the ability to address these issues without extreme
      disorientation or ego loss. As such, MDMA has theoretical promise as a treatment for
      ED-related emotional processing, including dysregulation and poor self-esteem. MDMA could
      also create a desirable psychological state that has the potential to enhance the therapeutic
      process by providing the opportunity to process feared emotional states and memories that
      fuel ED, as well as to offer corrective emotional experiences in a supportive framework.

    <description>The EDE is a semi-structured interview that assesses the frequency of key behavioral features of eating disorders, as well as the severity of specific ED psychopathology with subscale scores for Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Readiness and Motivation Questionnaire (RMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>17 weeks post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The RMQ is a self-report measure intended to assess readiness for change among individuals with eating disorders as conceptualized according to the Transtheoretical Model of Change. For each eating disorder symptom of the EDE, the RMQ asks individuals to provide ratings for precontemplation, action/maintenance, and internality. The RMQ does not provide a contemplation rating, but does include a confidence rating to assess perceived self-efficacy for change. Symptoms are grouped into restriction, cognitive, compensatory, and bingeing domains.</description>
