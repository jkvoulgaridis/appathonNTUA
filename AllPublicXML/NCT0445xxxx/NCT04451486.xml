      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety profile of autologous-derived SB cells to
      enhance osseointegration of GBR in patients undergoing dental implant surgery.

      Enrolled subjects eligible to receive GBR procedure will be sequentially assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment cohorts as follows:

      Treatment dose 1 group：1×10*5 CD61-Lin- cells /0.25mL DPBS Treatment dose 2 group：1×10*6
      CD61-Lin- cells /0.25mL DPBS Treatment dose 3 group：1×10*7 CD61-Lin- cells /0.25mL DPBS

      After receiving the autologous SB cells solution mixed with 1 mL bone substitute, each first
      treated subject at each cohort will be followed up to 4-weeks. After the first subject at
      each cohort (3 subjects) complete a 4-weeks follow-up period, if investigator and sponsor
      judge that there is not either a safety concern or a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria is
      not met, 2 additional subjects within each cohort will be enrolled. A Data Safety Monitoring
      Committee will be conveyed after the first 3 treated subjects at each cohort complete undergo
      the dental implant procedure (12-weeks follow-up after GBR) to evaluate the safety and
      preliminary efficacy of SB cells administered during a GBR procedure, and will provide
      recommendations regarding study modification, continuation to enroll next subject(s), cohorts
      or study termination.

      If the committee recommends further subject enrollment, sequential recruitment will continue
      until subjects for each treatment cohort are enrolled, treated and followed up to 24-weeks
      after GBR (12-weeks after dental implant) unless there is a safety concern judged by
      investigator, sponsor, or a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria is met. Once this situation
      occurs, the committee will assess the progress and safety data of all subjects enrolled, and
      will provide recommendations regarding study modification, continuation to enroll next
      subject in that or other cohorts, or will recommend study termination.
