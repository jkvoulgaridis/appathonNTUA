  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to assess the serum levels of progranulin and FAM19A5
      protein in adults with metabolic syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned to be conducted on 40 adults with metabolic syndrome. As a control, it
      is planned to recruit 40 adults without metabolic syndrome. From all participants fasting
      venous blood samples, urine samples and hair samples will be collected. Next, serum
      progranulin and serum FAM19A5 protein concentrations will be determined in both groups. Also,
      serum concentration of leptin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin, neopterin,
      adropin and selected cytokines, adipokines, myokines and chemokines, total cholesterol,
      low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides and glucose will be
      determined. Serum, hair and urine mineral content will be determined. In whole blood genetic
      analyses will be performed in order to detect and examine progranulin and FAM19A5 genes, and
      genes associated with the development of metabolic syndrome and genes associated with the
      body's mineral metabolism. Also, body composition analysis, blood pressure measurement, pulse
      measurement, blood oxygen saturation measurement and nutritional interview will be performed.
