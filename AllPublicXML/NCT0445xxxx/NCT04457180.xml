      The primary objective of the study was to assess investigate the pharmacokinetic effects of
      Apatinib Mesylate on CYP2C8 Substrate Repaglinide or CYP2B6 Substrate Bupropion and
      metabolite Hydroxy bupropion in Advanced solid tumor subjects.

      The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of Apatinib or/and Repaglinide
      and Bupropion.
