  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-masked, parallel group, multicentre study to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of SB15 compared to Eylea® in subjects with
      neovascular AMD.

      Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB15 or Eylea® (administered via
      intravitreal [IVT] injection 2 mg [0.05 mL] every 4 weeks for the first 3 months (i.e., at
      Weeks 0, 4, and 8), followed by 2 mg [0.05 mL] once every 8 weeks). At Week 32, subjects in
      Eylea® treatment group will be randomised again in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on Eylea®
      treatment or be transitioned to SB15 treatment. In the 8-week treatment cycle, IPs (SB15 or
      Eylea®) will be administered up to Week 48, and the last assessment will be done at Week 56,
      corresponding to the end of follow-up for all subjects.
