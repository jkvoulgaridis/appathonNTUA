  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), is an underdiagnosed pathology, affecting
      predominantly young women without traditional cardiovascular risk factors and is associated
      with major adverse outcomes including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or death.

      Timely diagnosis of SCAD as well as clinical follow-up are of the essence in this pathology
      associated with major cardiac adverse outcomes. Despite recent improvements in diagnosis and
      recognition of the importance of SCAD, it remains poorly studied and understood.

      In this context, we designed the SwissSCAD registry, a large, observational, prospective,
      cohort study, to describe the natural history of SCAD, its outcomes and its treatments.

    <description>The investigators will review the hospital records at the investigational site for SCAD events having occurred over the last 5 years. All SCAD patients aged ≥18 years, not presenting atherosclerotic or iatrogenic coronary dissection will be informed about the SwissSCAD study by phone and will be given at least one week to decide if they wish to participate. We plan to include 500 patients in the retrospective arm.</description>

        This observational study will recruit consecutive male and female patients presenting with
        newly diagnosed SCAD or having been diagnosed with SCAD within the last 5 years.

        For the purposes of study inclusion, the definition of SCAD will be based on a central
        review of the coronary angiographic images confirmed by 2 independent assessors
