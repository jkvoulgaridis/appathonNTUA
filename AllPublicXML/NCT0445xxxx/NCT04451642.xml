    <textblock>
      Locorregional anaesthesia have been increased its role in different kind of surgeries, alone
      or combined with general anesthesia. Due to ultrasound, peripheral nerve blocks have been
      increased their importance in locoregional anaesthesia. They provide excellent intraoperative
      and postoperative analgesia, decreasing the need for intravenous opioids which increase
      postoperative nausea and vomiting which may prolong hospital stay.

      The primary study objective is to analyze retrospectively the use of peripheral nerve blocks
      in the current practice of a specialized regional anaesthesia division.

      This is an observational, retrospective and unicenter study. 1346 patients scheduled for the
      surgery needed a peripheral nerve block were enrolled.

      Locorregional anaesthesia have been increased its role in different kind of surgeries, alone
      or combined with general anesthesia. Due to ultrasound, peripheral nerve blocks have been
      increased their importance in locoregional anaesthesia. They provide excellent intraoperative
      and postoperative analgesia, decreasing the need for intravenous opioids which increase
      postoperative nausea and vomiting which may prolong hospital stay.

      However, peripheral nerve blocks may be associated with postoperative complications,
      especially neurological ones. Classically, interscalene brachial plexus block produced a 100%
      incidence of phrenic nerve paralysis with resultant pulmonary compromise. Little literature
      has published a following of complications.

      The primary study objective is to analyze retrospectively the use of peripheral nerve blocks
      in the current practice of a specialized regional anaesthesia division. The secondary
      objectives are assessed the patients characteristics of our sample, local anaesthetic dose
      used, the peripheral nerve block operator, the nerve location technique, the surgery and the
      complication rate after peripheral nerve block.

      This is an observational, retrospective and unicenter study. 1346 patients scheduled for the
      surgery needed a peripheral nerve block were enrolled.

    <description>Peripheral nerve block consists of the administration of a local anaesthetic into the nerves to inhibit nerve transmission in a specific part of the body. Ultrasound or Nerve stimulator could be used to locate the peripheral nerve. A needle is placed through the anatomical references to administer local anaesthetic around the peripheral nerve. Single-shot or continuous blocks are performed preoperatively and postoperatively as current practice in the surgery theatre. Using ultrasound, in-plane or out-plane approach could be performed. Peripheral nerve block provides excellent intraoperative and postoperative analgesia decreasing the need for intravenous pain drugs. Interscalene block, supraclavicular block, safene block, femoral block, BRILMA block are different kinds of peripheral nerve block using in the anaesthestic current practice.</description>

        Participants were recruited from the current practice of the Anesthesia Department
        (Division of Regional Anesthesia) at the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet (HUMS) in
        Zaragoza, Spain. HUMS provides health care to a population size of about 400000
        inhabitants, mostly urban, and more than 200 shoulder and upper extremity surgeries are
        performed every year.
