             insertion. Alternatively, the subject must have had a colposcopy performed within the
             appropriate screen timeframe, and prior to the study IUD insertion that showed no
             evidence of dysplasia requiring treatment per ASCCP guidelines, or treatment was

         16. Any distortions of the uterine cavity (e.g. fibroids), that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, are likely to cause issues during insertion, retention or removal of the
             IUS;

         17. Known anatomical abnormalities of the cervix such as severe cervical stenosis, prior
             trachelectomy or extensive conization that, in the opinion of the investigator would
             prevent cervical dilation and study drug placement;

         18. Untreated or unresolved acute cervicitis or vaginitis;

         19. Known or suspected breast cancer or other progestin-sensitive cancer now or in the

             investigational drug or device during the course of this investigational study.

             informed consent in this study;

         26. Subject has previously been enrolled in a VeraCept or LevoCept study (including the
             current study);

         27. Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months prior to the screening
             visit;

         28. Any general health, mental health or behavioral condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could represent an increased risk for the subject or would render the
             subject less likely to provide the needed study information;

         29. Study staff or a member of the immediate family of study staff.
