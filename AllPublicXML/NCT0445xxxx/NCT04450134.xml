  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training is beneficial for both health and performance. Histamine has been shown to
      be involved in the acute exercise response. The current study addresses the role of histamine
      H1/H2 receptor signaling in the chronic training-induced adaptations. Results from this study
      will yield more insights into the molecular mechanisms of adaptations to exercise training.
