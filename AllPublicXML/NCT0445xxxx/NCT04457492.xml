  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial or complete facial paralysis is the weakness of muscles of facial expression. Facial
      paralysis causes physical, social and emotional problems. Functional electrical stimulation
      (FES) for facial paralysis is a technique in which muscles are electrically stimulated,
      causing them to contract This study is designed to help patients with facial nerve weakness.
