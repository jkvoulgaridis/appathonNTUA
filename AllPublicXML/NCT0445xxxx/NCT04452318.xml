      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to placebo in preventing
           symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (strict-term) confirmed by RT-qPCR

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to placebo in preventing
           asymptomatic or symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-qPCR

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN10933+REGN10987 following subcutaneous
           (SC) administration compared to placebo

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Asymptomatic household contact with sustained exposure (at least 48 hours) to an
             individual with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay (index case). To be included in the
             study, participants must be randomized within 96 hours of collection of the index
             cases' positive SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR sample

          2. Participant anticipates living in the same household with the index case until study
             day 29

          3. Is judged by the investigator to be in good health based on medical history and
             physical examination at screening/baseline

          4. Willing and able to comply with study visits and study-related procedures/assessments.

          5. Provide informed consent signed by study participant or legally acceptable
             representative.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of prior positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test or positive SARS-CoV-2 serology test
             at any time before the screening

          2. Participant has lived with individuals who have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection

          3. Active respiratory or non-respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19

          4. History of respiratory illness with sign/symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the
             opinion of the investigator within the prior month to screening

          5. Nursing home resident

          6. Any physical examination findings, and/or history of any illness, concomitant
             medications or recent live vaccines that, in the opinion of the study investigator,
             might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk to the participant
             by their participation in the study
