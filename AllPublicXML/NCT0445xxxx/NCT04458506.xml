  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid maxillary expansion and quad-helix are two well established appliances in dentistry
      used for posterior cross bite treatment. This study aims to compare this two different
      appliances in patients in their early mixed dentition, regarding treatment effects of the
      extra oral soft tissue but also dental and skeletal effects, if the children experience any
      pain and discomfort during treatment and the study also aims to make a cost minimization
      analysis. Comparison of these different treatments are barely made and no randomized
      controlled trial is yet published. No study has evaluated the difference of subjective
      experience during these two treatments. After this study we will know which one of these two
      appliances are the most effective, regarding cost minimization and treatment result but we
      are also able to put it in relation to the patients subjective experience
