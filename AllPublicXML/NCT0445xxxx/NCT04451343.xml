    <textblock>
      In a context the respect of the autonomy of the patients is important, it is necessary to pay
      a sustained attention to the experiences and the lived experience as well of the patients
      suffering or in remission of cancer as of their family. It is therefore, for the family, to
      deepen the synthesis carried out by the Societal Cancer Observatory which is a societal
      observatory of cancer
