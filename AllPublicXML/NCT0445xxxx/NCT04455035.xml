      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the DynaCleft® system on soft
      tissues of infants with unilateral incomplete cleft lip and to assess influences on quality
      of life for infants who underwent DynaCleft® and that of their families.

    <description>The study population for the prospective aspect will include recruited newborns with untreated unilateral incomplete cleft lip.
DynaCleft® + Nasal Elevator therapy will be discussed with parent(s) as a presurgical orthopedic option while awaiting primary cleft lip surgical repair that typically occurs between the ages of 3 to 6 months.Study duration will be up to three months of presurgical intervention.Photographs are to be taken at initial visit prior to presurgical intervention and later at completion of the DynaCleft® therapy immediately prior to lip surgery. Angles to be pictured are to include the standard anterior-posterior, profile, and worms-eye view.
Linear measurements will be obtained with a ruler and registered in millimeters. A goniometer will be used to measure angles.</description>
