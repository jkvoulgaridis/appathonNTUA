    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), immunogenicity and (if observed) the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of M6223 as a single
      agent (Part 1A) and of M6223 combined with bintrafusp alfa (Part 1B) in participants with
      metastatic or locally advanced solid unresectable tumors.
