  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that application at 4-week or greater intervals of the human placental
      umbilical cord tissue TTAX01 to the surface of a well debrided, complex diabetic foot ulcer
      (DFU) will, with concomitant management of infection, result in a higher rate of wounds
      showing complete healing within 25 weeks of initiating therapy, compared with standard care
      alone. This second confirmatory Phase 3 study examines a population of diabetic foot ulcer
      patients having adequate perfusion, with or without neuropathy, and a high suspicion of
      associated osteomyelitis in a complex, high grade wound.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a confirmatory study of the benefits and risks of TTAX01 when used
      in the treatment of Wagner Grades 3 and 4 DFU. Experience with the use of a cryopreserved
      umbilical cord (UC) product in treating such wounds, both prior to this IND and under this
      IND, has indicated that a frequency of application of no shorter than every 4 weeks is
      associated with better than expected outcomes. Although treatment cannot be blinded, a
      &quot;standard care only&quot; arm is included to control for the benefits of aggressive baseline
      debridement combined with aggressive (6 weeks systemic) antibiotics. Current treatment
      guidelines indicate that aggressive debridement plus 1-2 weeks of antibiotics, or, minor
      debridement plus 6 weeks of antibiotics, would produce equivalent outcomes, although the
      evidence is not strong. By utilizing both maximum debridement and maximum antimicrobial
      therapy, the standard care described in this protocol may result in healing rates somewhat
      superior to current standard practice.

      The design of this second confirmatory study is matched to the design of the Phase 2 efficacy
      study TTCRNE-1501, with the exception of extending the primary endpoint from a landmark
      analysis at 16 to a &quot;wound survival&quot; analysis through 26 weeks, utilizing a proportional risk
      analysis rather than a simple test of proportions. This design consideration is based on
      analysis of previous studies (see Background section), and a desire to fold data from every
      visit into the primary analysis, rather than generating an excessive number of secondary
      endpoints.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the test article, the trial is open label, with no blinding of the site staff. The determination of wound closure will be made by the Investigator based on visual and tactile assessment of the wound. To reduce bias in the ascertainment of closure, one independent blinded reviewer will review the image obtained from a wound measurement device in each case where the Investigator makes a determination of closure. Discordant opinions will be adjudicated by a second independent blinded reviewer who will examine multiple additional images taken at various angles to the wound surface.</masking_description>

    <description>TTAX01 is a cryopreserved human umbilical cord product derived from donated human placental tissue following healthy, live, caesarian section, full-term births after determination of donor eligibility and placenta suitability. TTAX01 is manufactured by TissueTech Inc. utilizing a proprietary CRYOTEK® process, which devitalizes the living cells but retains the natural structural and biological characteristics relevant to this tissue. TTAX01 is aseptically processed in compliance with current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP). TTAX01 will be manufactured in various sizes, stored in a medium of lactated Ringer's/glycerol (1:1).</description>

    <description>Standard care is defined in this protocol to consist of the following:
Debridement;
Wound cleansing, using sterile saline, a non-ionic cleanser or a hypochlorous solution. Antiseptic agents including hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, chlorhexidine, povidone/iodine, and cetrimide should not be used. Topical antimicrobials and silver dressings are also prohibited;
Primary wound dressings including a non-adherent, standard foam pad with or without a hydrogel beneath the dressing, or and alginate dressing, as is appropriate to maintain a moist wound environment while managing exudate;
A secondary retention bandage appropriate to the amount of wound exudate, so as to avoid maceration of the peri-wound skin;
Off-loading device appropriate to the location of wound with full length boot or total contact cast (unless not appropriate where a substitute off-loading device can be made with sponsor approval); and,
Appropriate use of systemic antibiotics.</description>
