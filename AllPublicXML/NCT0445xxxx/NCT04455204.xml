      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the implication of adipokines, inflammation,
      insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and in
      pregnancy related complications.

      This observational parallel study will be conducted on pregnant women with normal pregnancy,
      pregnant women with Preeclampsia, and on healthy non-pregnant women. All participants will be
      recruited from the Outpatient Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at Menoufia
      University Hospital (Shebin El-Kom, Egypt). The study will be approved by the Research Ethics
      Committee of Menoufia University and all the involved subjects will give their written
      informed consent.

      This study will involve a total number of 60 women who will be further classified into: 20
      non-pregnant women who serve as the control group (group 1), 20 pregnant women with normal
      pregnancy at their third trimesters (group 2) and 20 pregnant women with Preeclampsia at
      their third trimester (group 3) will be screened to fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      The pregnant women will be assessed in their third trimesters and further re-evaluated 4
      weeks after delivery. The gestational ages will be determined conventionally and re-affirmed
      by ultrasonographic measurement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women with normal pregnancy (n=20)

          -  Pregnant women with Preeclampsia (n=20) at their third trimesters of pregnancy will be
             included in the study. Preeclampsia will be defined and diagnosed by constant
             elevation in blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg and by the presence of
             proteinuria above 300 mg /24 hour with the absence of both urinary tract infection and
             previous history of hypertension.

          -  Apparently healthy non-pregnant females (n=20) will be included in this study also.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with risk factors for oxidative stress such as smokers and

          -  Those with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and Tuberculosis (T.B).

          -  Women with a history of hypertension, familial hyperlipidemia, liver diseases,
             inflammatory diseases, and renal impairment.

          -  Non-pregnant women on hormonal therapy or hormonal contraceptives.
