  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) on sleep quality, disease severity,
      and respiratory muscle strength has been previously investigated in OSA syndrom. Only the
      effects of the high-intensity short-term EMST study in moderate OSAS patients were studied.
      High intensity and low intensity EMST has advantages and disadvantages.The study aims to
      compare the effects of high (60% MEP) and low (30% MEP) expiratory muscle strength training
      (EMST) on disease severity, sleep efficiency, snoring, fatigue severity and quality of life
      in severe OSAS patients.

      Ahi Evren Chest Cardiovascular Surgery Training Research Hospital In sleep lab,
      polysomnography will be directed to the physiotherapist by the pulmonologist with severe OSAS
      patients. Patients will be divided into two groups by block randomization method. The study
      was planned as double-blind. Patients will not know what treatment they are receiving, the
      doctor does not know what treatment the patient is receiving, and technicians who take and
      analyze polysomnography will not know what treatment the patients are receiving.

      Severe OSAS patients with MEP 30% (low intensity) to the first group, MEP 60% (high
      intensity) to the second group with expiratory muscle training device, 7 days / week, 25
      breaths per day, 1 minute rest for 5 breaths will be run with the cycle. The training will
      take a total of 8 weeks. The follow-up of the patients will be done remotely by phone. MEP
      measurements will be repeated every 2 weeks in the hospital and the new training workload
      will be calculated.
