  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Markers of DNA damage and repair are present in both atherosclerotic plaques and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells of patients with coronary artery disease. A positive correlation has
      been observed between the level of DNA damage and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions, as
      well as atherogenic risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. A number
      of in-vitro studies have implicated defective DNA repair in the development and progression
      of atherosclerotic lesions. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, the DNA repair signalling
      cascade has been shown to be amenable to pharmacological intervention and overexpression of
      specific repair proteins attenuate the development of atherosclerotic plaques. However, data
      regarding the role of DNA repair in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in humans are
      lacking. We have preliminary data indicating reduced DNA repair activity in patients with
      stable angina. This study will determine the molecular basis and the biological consequences
      of this observation.
