      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab administered every 2 weeks in patients with moderate or
      severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as measured by

        -  Annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (AECOPD)

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the effect of dupilumab administered every 2 weeks on

        -  Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over 12 weeks compared to
           placebo

        -  Health related quality of life, assessed by the change from baseline to Week 52 in the
           St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)

        -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 over 52 weeks compared to placebo

        -  Lung function assessments

        -  Moderate and severe COPD exacerbations

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability

        -  To evaluate dupilumab systemic exposure and incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Participants with a physician diagnosis of COPD who meet the following criteria:

               -  Current or former smokers with a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years.

               -  Moderate-to-severe COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1/ forced vital capacity [FVC]
                  ≤70 and post-bronchodilator FEV1 % predicted &gt;30% and ≤70%).

               -  Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnea Scale grade ≥2.

               -  Patient-reported history of signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis (chronic
                  productive cough) for 3 months in the year up to screening in the absence of
                  other known causes of chronic cough.

               -  Documented history of high exacerbation risk defined as exacerbation history of
                  ≥2 moderate or ≥1 severe within the year prior to inclusion. At least one
                  exacerbation should have occurred while the patient was taking inhaled
                  corticosteroid (ICS)/long acting beta agonist (LABA)/long acting muscarinic
                  antagonist (LAMA) (or LABA/LAMA if ICS is contraindicated). Moderate
                  exacerbations are recorded by the investigator and defined as AECOPD that require
                  either systemic corticosteroids (intramuscular, intravenous, or oral) and/or
                  antibiotics. One of the two required moderate exacerbations has to require the
                  use of systemic corticosteroids. Severe exacerbations are recorded by the
                  investigator and defined as AECOPD requiring hospitalization or observation &gt; 24
                  hours in emergency department/urgent care facility.

               -  Background triple therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA) for 3 months prior to randomization
                  with a stable dose of medication for ≥1 month prior to Visit 1; Double therapy
                  (LABA + LAMA) allowed if ICS is contraindicated.

          -  Evidence of Type 2 inflammation: Patients with blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/microliter
             at Visit 1.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  COPD diagnosis for less than 12 months prior to randomization.

          -  A current diagnosis of asthma or history of asthma according to the 2018 Global
             Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines or other accepted guidelines.

          -  Significant pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g., lung fibrosis, sarcoidosis,
             interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiectasis, Churg-Strauss
             Syndrome etc) or another diagnosed pulmonary or systemic disease associated with
             elevated peripheral eosinophil counts.

          -  Cor pulmonale, evidence of right cardiac failure.

          -  Treatment with oxygen of more than 12 hours per day.

          -  Hypercapnia requiring Bi-level ventilation.

          -  AECOPD as defined in inclusion criteria within 4 weeks prior to screening, or during
             the screening period.

          -  Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to screening, or during the screening
             period.

          -  History of, or planned pneumonectomy or lung volume reduction surgery. Patients who
             are participating in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program, ie, who
             started rehabilitation &lt;4 weeks prior to screening (Note: patients in the maintenance
             phase of a rehabilitation program can be included).

          -  Diagnosis of α-1 anti-trypsin deficiency.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
