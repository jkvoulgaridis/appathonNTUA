  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open label, single center, prospective study was designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Sequential Therapy of Camrelizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody
      against Programmed death 1 [PD-1] ) in combination with Chemotherapy（Irinotecan plus
      Platinum）and with Apatinib (selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]) in chemotherapy-naive participants with SCLC. Participants
      will receive Camrelizumab + Irinotecan + Platinum on 21-day cycles for 4-6 cycles in the
      induction phase followed by maintenance with Camrelizumab + Apatinib until progressive
      disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD
      or symptomatic deterioration.
