      Treatment of patients with trophic ulcers using injection of autologous adipose-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells around and inside the wound

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the implementation of the project, it was planned to develop a method for the
      treatment of trophic ulcers using injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells in the wound. The positive outlook for the effectiveness of MSCs is due to the
      following:

        -  the ability of MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration

        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of trophic ulcers in
           animals (rats).

      In study were included 18 patients (28 trophic ulcers treated). MSCs will be isolated from
      adipose tissue, cultured and then transplanted back to the wound. From 1 to 10 million MSCs
      in 4 ml were injected depending on the area of the wound. Follow up patients monitoring will
      occur at 1ï¼Œ2 and 3, 6, 12, 22 months after injection.
