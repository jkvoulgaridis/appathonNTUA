  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To clarify the changes of intestinal flora - gut - brain axis in FGIDs patients represented
      by NERD disharmony of liver and stomach and IBS-D disharmony of liver and spleen, and confirm
      that the imbalance between intestinal flora and host co-metabolism is the key to the
      pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disease. To reveal the common mechanism of
      regulating liver and spleen (stomach) in treating FGIDs dynamic disorder and visceral
      hypersensitivity by regulating intestinal flora - intestine - brain axis disorder.
