  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disorder that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal
      (GI) tract. Some patients still experience persistent diarrhea or other symptoms such as
      abdominal pain even when their Crohn's disease is in remission. Diarrhea and/or abdominal
      pain that is not responsive to standard therapies can significantly affect a patient's
      quality of life and ability to work. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and
      effectiveness of the drug ranolazine in reducing Crohn's disease-associated diarrhea and
      other symptoms. Ranolazine is approved by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic
      angina (a heart condition). This study is investigating if ranolazine could be used in the
      setting of Crohn's disease.

    <measure>Mean change in daily number of loose stools from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Daily number of loose stools and antidiarrheal use will be collected directly from all subjects using MyCap or, if installation and use of an app is not possible, through email with a survey link. MyCap is a secure mobile application developed by the REDCap team at Vanderbilt and integrated into the REDCap database system.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) combines weighted scores of clinical and laboratory variables to estimate disease severity. The CDAI consists of eight variables, two of which are subjective, related to the disease, each weighted according to its ability to be predictive of disease activity. The absolute score ranges from 0 to 600. CDAI scores of less than 150 indicate a clinical remission and scores over 450 indicate severely active disease. Since blood draws will not be performed as part of this study, the hematocrit component of the CDAI will not be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>The Harvey-Bradshaw index (Harvey-Bradshaw Index - HBI) assesses the degree of illness (activity) in patients with Crohn's disease. The HBI consists of 5 items with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum attainable score depending on the number of stools the patient identifies per day. HBI scores &lt; 5 are defined as clinical remission, HBI between 5 and 7 as mild disease, HBI between 8 and 16 as moderate disease, and HBI &gt; 16 as severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 84, and Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The SIBDQ is a 10-item questionnaire measuring quality of life in four domains: bowel symptoms, emotional health, systemic symptoms, and social function and is scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (severe problem) to 7 (no problems at all). The absolute score ranges are from 10 (poor Health-related quality of life) to 70 (optimum Health-related quality of life).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 84, Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9-item questionnaire that screens for the presence and severity of depression and can be used to make a depression diagnosis using DSM-IV criteria.
The PHQ-9 is scored on a 3-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The absolute score ranges are from 0 (none or minimal depression) to 27 (severe depression).</description>
