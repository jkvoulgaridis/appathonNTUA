  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a prosthetic knee joint infection, two types of operative approach can be
      undertaken to treat the infection: a one-stage or two-stage revision operation. Both
      approaches are widely used and are good at treating infection but we don't know which has the
      best long-term outcomes for patients. This trial aims to assess the feasibility of conducting
      a randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether treating a prosthetic knee infection with
      one-stage revision surgery gives a better outcome than two-stage revision surgery in terms of
      patient function and pain, and cost-effectiveness.
