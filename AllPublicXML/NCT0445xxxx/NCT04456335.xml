  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to characterize the supragingival plaque microbiome in children
      with early childhood caries and identify potential microorganisms associated with caries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty children with and without early childhood caries were recruited from Trakya University
      Faculty of Dentistry Department of Pediatric Dentistry. Oral examinations were performed by
      the same examiner according to diagnostic criteria of World Health Organisation (WHO) and The
      International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) . Mothers' completed a
      structured questionnaire on the socio-demographic informations, child's feeding practices and
      oral hygiene habits. After the oral examination, supragingival plaque samples were collected
      from the posterior tooth surfaces. Supragingival plaque samples were examined with the
      Illumina MiSeq new generation sequencing method.

    <description>Supragingival plaque samples were collected from the tooth surfaces using a sterile periodontal curette. DNA extraction was performed at Sugenomik Biotechnology Laboratory for library preparation and paired-end Illumina MiSeq PE250 sequencing of the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS1 (internal transcribed spacer 1) rRNA genes.</description>
