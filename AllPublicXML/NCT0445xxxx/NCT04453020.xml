  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of
      the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) as a treatment for chronic refractory obesity. This study
      will include 6 individuals with chronic refractory obesity, that have failed other treatments
      including gastric bypass surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six (N = 6) subjects with chronic refractory obesity will receive bilateral DBS implants in
      the LHA using the Boston Scientific Vercise Gevia DBS system. The primary objective is to
      evaluate the safety of DBS of the LHA using the current-driven Boston Scientific device and
      compare that to the safety data for our previous pilot using the voltage-driven DBS system
      for the treatment of chronic refractory obesity. The primary efficacy objective is to
      determine if DBS of the LHA can affect energy balance (i.e. energy intake and/or energy
      expenditure) in these patients. Secondary outcomes include quality of life outcomes and
      changes in feeding behaviors. Study participants will undergo a two-part DBS implantation
      procedure for placement of DBS electrodes in the LHA. Following this procedure, subjects with
      complete resting metabolic rate (RMR) testing to determine the optimal settings for the LHA
      stimulation. If effective, DBS technology might offer severely obese adults (BMI of â‰¥50
      kg/m2), who have failed traditional therapy, a non-destructive, adaptable, reversible
      neurosurgical option for altering eating habits leading to sustained weight loss in the
      long-term.
