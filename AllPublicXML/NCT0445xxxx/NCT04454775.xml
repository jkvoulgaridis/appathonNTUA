      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the effects of raloxifene HCl on coagulation
      parameters in healthy postmenopausal women.

      Material and method: 80 healthy postmenopausal women were evaluated at Karadeniz Technical
      University Hospital at gynecology out-patient clinic from December 2005 to December 2006.
      Local institutional ethics committee approved our study protocol and written informed consent
      was obtained from all participants before enrollment. All patients received daily 600
      milligrams of calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D (Cal-D-VÄ°TA, Roche
      Switzerland,). 60 milligrams of raloxifene HCI, which is a selective estrogen receptor
      modulator (SERM), was added to treatment protocol if patients required hormonal therapy.
      Patients receiving raloxifene therapy in addition to calcium and vitamin D therapy formed the
      study group(n=50). Control group (n=30) was made up of the patients only receiving calcium
      and vitamin D. Factor 8, von Willebrand factor, protein C, protein S, antithrombin- III and
      fibrinogen levels were measured in all patients before treatment. These measurements were
      repeated at three and twelve months after treatment. Comparisons were performed with Student
      t test or Mann Whitney test between the two groups and two-way ANOVA within the groups.
      Proportions were compared with Fisher exact or Chi-square tests. Statistically analysis was
      done with SPSS packet program (SPSS 11; SPSS Inc.) All p values were two-tailed and p&lt;0.05
      was considered statistically significant.
