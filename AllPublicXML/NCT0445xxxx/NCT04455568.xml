  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease is still one of the world's most important health problems, and it ranks second
      among the top ten causes of death among Taiwan. The main cause of death is acute coronary
      syndrome, and vascular stent placement is the main treatment method for acute coronary
      syndrome. The probability of restenosis in patients within half a year after a general stent
      is as high as 25% to 40%. Re-hospitalization and surgery is a big burden on patients and the
      country's medical costs. However, a set of convenient and accurate clinical tools to
      determine the prognosis of patients has not yet been developed. Miniaturized wearable devices
      have been the mainstream trend in medical development in recent years. ECG and heart sound
      analysis technology are an easy to used medical device for automatically calculating the
      parameters including EMAT (electromechanical activation time), S4, S4, SDI (Systolic
      dyssynchrony index). ECG and heart sound could evaluate the heart function, and has the
      potential to be an effective tools for prognosis and treatment guidelines. Heart rate
      variability (HRV) and Accelerationplethysmogram (APG) is also proved the predictive effect
      the outcome of patients.

      This study is start on June 1 2020. We will enroll 400 patients who diagnosis of acute
      coronary syndrome and have been a heart stent surgery, and registry there medical
      history,routine examination and medication, ECG and heart, HRV and APG record at admission,
      pre-discharge and every routine return visit within I year after discharge.Patients will also
      wear ECG and PPG (Photoplethysmography) band ever day after discharge, and collected the
      longitutinal data .All subjects will be tracked the medical adverse events in 1 years after
      discharge, and compare the characteristic and prognosis value of between patients with and
      without events. Therefore, our purpose of this study is to drive an effective outcome
      prediction model by non-invasive device, and establish a telecare model of patient with heart
      stent implantation to reducing medical adverse events.

      This study is open, prospective study, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, unobtrusive
      research. This study is start on June 1 2020. We will enroll 400 patients who diagnosis of
      acute coronary syndrome and have been a heart stent surgery. And random allocation 200
      experimental group (Non-invasive Wearable Device) and 200 control group (routine medical).

      Ask whether the patients who meet the exclusion criteria are willing to participate in the
      screening (Screening), if they are willing to join and sign the consent of the subject, and
      after the patient's condition is stable, conduct an electrocardiogram (V0) before discharge
      from the hospital. On day 7 (±2 weeks), day 84 (±4 weeks), 168 days (±4 weeks), 252 days (±4
      weeks), 336 days (±8 weeks) during routine clinical referral (V1-V5) Both are done once. The
      results of these two tests and other basic information of the patient, including Demography,
      Vital Signs, High, Weight, Medication, and European and Taiwan Cardiology Association
      recommended routine test results of high-risk patients, including Blood Chemistry Panel,
      NT-proBNP, Echocardiography, Myocardial Perfusion Scan, etc., will record the information of
      the logged-in subjects on the paper case report form. The CRF (case report form) only
      displays the study number, and no subject is available. In addition to the examination of
      each return visit, the subjects also took the ECG bracelet home at the time of discharge (V0)
      and wore it every day. After the discharge, the ECG was measured every morning and evening,
      and their personal activity and sleep were collected. Relevant information. After the subject
      was discharged from the hospital, the subject tracked the date of all adverse events due to
      cardiovascular disease within one year, including: heart failure, restenosis due to blood
      vessel, and non-fatal myocardial infarction , To do blood vessel-related surgery again, and
      data on the occurrence of death.
