  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial that
      simultaneously examines (1) the effectiveness of a trauma-focused intervention for youth in
      the education sector and (2) the impact of a theory-driven pragmatic implementation strategy
      designed to increase the adoption, fidelity, and sustainment of evidence-based treatments
      (EBTs). This trial will include 120 clinicians and 480 students, and it is designed to test
      the cost effectiveness and impact of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) in
      a new setting that increases access to mental health care - schools (Aim 1); test the cost
      effectiveness, immediate impact, and sustained impact of the Beliefs and Attitudes for
      Successful Implementation in Schools (BASIS) implementation strategy on proximal mechanisms
      and implementation outcomes (Aims 2a, 2b, 2d); and conduct sequential mixed-methods data
      collection to explain residuals (i.e., clinicians whose implementation behavior is
      unaccounted for by the mediation model) (Aim 2c).

    <measure>TF-CBT Adoption</measure>
    <time_frame>18 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption is operationalized as the initiation of a clinican's first TF-CBT session at any point during study participation. These data will be collected from an online TF-CBT &quot;Toolkit&quot; that facilitates tracking of services delivered and has been commonly used for large-scale TF-CBT implementation.</description>

    <measure>Child PTSD Symptom Scale for DSM-V</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The CPSS-SR-5 is a modified version of Child PTSD Symptom Scale self-report (CPSS-SR) for DSM-5. The 20 PTSD symptom items are rated on a 5-point scale of frequency and severity from 0 (not at all) to 4 (6 or more times a week /severe). The 7 functioning items are rated on yes/no.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood and Feelings Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The MFQ consists of a series of descriptive phrases regarding how the subject has been feeling or acting recently. Codings reflect whether the phrase was descriptive of the subject most of the time, sometimes, or not at all in the past two weeks.</description>

    <description>TF-CBT is an evidence-based treatment that helps children from elementary to high school to address the negative effects of trauma and promote greater emotion and behavior regulation, including processing their traumatic memories, overcoming problematic thoughts and behaviors, and developing effective coping and interpersonal skills. It also includes a treatment component for parents or other caregivers. Parents can learn skills related to stress management, positive parenting, behavior management, and effective communication.</description>
