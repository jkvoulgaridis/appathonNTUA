  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is the second most common musculoskeletal pain after lumbar pain. Prevalence is
      27.2% female and 17.4% in male population (1, 2). Approximately 1/3 of acute onset neck aches
      become chronic. It causes increasing the cost of treatment and also the loss of labor (3, 4).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute neck pain is often caused by mechanical causes and can be classified as rheumatic
      diseases, infectious and tumoral pathologies, metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis
      and osteomalacia, pain reflected the cervical region. A-V malformation and syringomyelia are
      the causes of chronic cervical pain (5). Mechanical neck pain is a non-radicular pain caused
      by local musculoskeletal structures and is characterized by a spasm of the cervical muscles.
      (6, 7). Posture, emotional stress, cold and fatigue are etiologic causes, and pain is also
      reflected in the cervical, occipital and scapular regions depending on the severity of muscle
      spasm and the presence of trigger point in myofascial pain syndrome (9, 10). Many authors
      have suggested that facet joints are associated with mechanical dysfunction as a common cause
      of cervical pain (8-10).

      The pain in the head and neck region affects the quality of life, cognitive and functional
      status of the person. The most important difficulty and failure in the treatment of such pain
      arise from the inability to diagnose the disease correctly. Good anatomical and biomechanical
      properties of the region, comprehensive anamnesis, physical examination under static and
      dynamic conditions, laboratory and radiological examinations are the most important
      milestones of diagnosis (12). In most cases, medical treatment and physical therapy
      modalities (superficial and deep heat, electrotherapy, laser, traction, massage, spa) are
      sufficient for pain relief and recovery of function, but interventional procedures and
      surgical procedures are needed for the fewer patient. Recently, spinal mobilization and
      manipulation techniques can be used to relieve pain and restore function in the early stages.
      Although it is a safe method, in order to prevent the rare complications it is necessary to
      determine the indications of treatment correctly, to exclude contiguous cases and to apply
      the manipulation by experts (12).

    <description>Pain pressure threshold (PPT). was assessed with an analogue algometry (Baseline, FEl Inc. White Plains, NY,USA) with 1 cm2 rubber tip was used to measure the pain pressure threshold. Algometer perpendicularly placed over spinous process of T1 on prone position and pressure progressively increased 1 kg/s until patients verbally reported pain under the tip of algometer or referring pain. Measurement repeated three times and average score recorded.</description>

    <description>The patient was asked to mark the severity of his or her pain with active motion on a horizontal line 100 millimeters in length. The intensity of the pain was calculated by measuring the area in which the individual marked between 0 (no pain) and 10 (the most severe pain I felt in my life).</description>
