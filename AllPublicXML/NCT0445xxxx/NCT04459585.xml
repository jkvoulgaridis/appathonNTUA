  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the one-way drug-drug interaction potential of
      quizartinib on dabigatran etexilate in healthy adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential intestinal inhibitory effect of quizartinib on the
      pharmacokinetics of a Pgp substrate dabigatran etexilate in healthy participants.

      The hypothesis for this clinical study is that quizartinib, as a P-gp inhibitor, may increase
      the systemic exposure (measured by area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum
      concentration [Cmax]) of P-gp substrates that may be sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition.
