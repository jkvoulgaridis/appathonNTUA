      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety of adjuvant hypofractionated whole pelvis
      radiation therapy (WPRT) in endometrial cancer. The primary objective of the study is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose per fraction (MTDF), defined by acceptable acute
      clinician-reported GI and GU toxicity and patient-reported GI toxicity, of WPRT from among
      the two study dose levels. Acute GI and GU toxicity will be assessed according to both the
      NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, and Patient Reported
      Outcome-CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). Clinician-reported dose-limiting toxicity (C-DLT) is a binary
      outcome (yes/no), defined as an acute grade 3 or higher GI or GU per CTCAE, occurring within
      three months of completing WPRT. Patient-reported DLT (P-DLT) is a binary outcome, defined by
      a GI toxicity with a score of ≥4 on the 5-point scale per PRO-CTCAE, occurring within three
      months of completing WPRT. The MTDF is defined as the minimum of the dose with a C-DLT rate
      closest to the clinician-reported target C-DLT rate of 20% and the dose with a P-DLT rate
      closest to the patient-reported target P-DLT rate of 55%. Toxicity results of NRG-RTOG 1203-
      A Randomized Phase III Study of Standard vs. IMRT Pelvic Radiation for Post-Operative
      Treatment of Endometrial and Cervical Cancer- were used to define the acceptable percentage
      of DLTs. The study will accrue participants in cohorts of size 3. The starting dose level
      will be dose level 1 (41.25 Gy in 15 fx).

    <intervention_model_description>Dose allocation will be based upon a Bayesian continual reassessment method that incorporates patient-reported outcomes (PRO-CRM17), which uses separate models for the probability of C-DLT and the probability of P-DLT, as well as the accumulated C-DLT and P-DLT data at each dose level, to sequentially allocate each new patient cohort.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Toxicity profile will be determined by assessment of acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity during WPRT and 3 months post-radiation using CTCAE version 5.0 and Patient Reported Outcome-CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed stage I, II, or III endometrial cancer who
             require pelvic radiation as determined by their treating radiation oncologist and/or
             gynecologic oncologist. Patients may also be identified through the Gynecologic
             Oncology Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The decision to include Stage I patients will
             be based on risk factors for recurrence including tumor grade, extent of myometrial
             invasion, presence of lymphovascular space invasion, and histology (endometrioid,
             papillary serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma). Stage I patients may include those who
             are ineligible for vaginal cuff brachytherapy due to patient anatomy or those who are
             at higher risk for pelvic nodal recurrence and pelvic external beam radiotherapy is
             preferred over vaginal cuff brachytherapy.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).

          -  Patients must have undergone total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
             with or without pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node dissection/sampling or sentinel
             lymph node (SLN) dissection.

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an Inflammatory Bowel Disease diagnosis, regardless of disease activity.

          -  Patients with current, active disease involving periaortic node(s). This is based on
             histologically positive para-aortic node(s) removed at time of surgery.

          -  Patients with gross residual disease following surgical resection. Final pathologic
             margins must be negative (no tumor on ink). This may also be determined clinically by
             the gynecologic oncologist at time of surgery or post-operative imaging if applicable.
             Post-operative imaging is not required at time of surgery.

          -  Patients who have ever had pelvic radiotherapy prior to entering the study.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients who have
             received other investigational agents previously who are no longer receiving these
             investigational agents may be eligible at the discretion of the PI.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
