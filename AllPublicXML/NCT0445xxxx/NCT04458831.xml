    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effectiveness, in terms of overall response rate (ORR) of isatuximab patients
      with RRMM in routine clinical practice, within 12 months

      To assess other effectiveness parameters such as progression free survival (PFS), PFS rate
      (PFSR), duration of response (DoR), time to response, time and intent to first subsequent
      therapy, rate of very good partial response or better, rate of complete response (CR) or
      better of isatuximab patients with RRMM in routine clinical practice

      To assess the profile of patients (demographic, disease characteristics, comorbidities and
      prior MM treatment history) who are initiated with isatuximab in routine clinical practice

      To describe safety of isatuximab in routine clinical practice (based on adverse event [AE]
      reporting)

      To assess quality of life (QoL) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC) 30 item core questionnaire (QLQ C30) and the accompanying 20 item myeloma
      questionnaire module (QLQ MY20)

        The source population for this study will be patients with a diagnosis of RRMM recruited
        from participating sites in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The study will
        aim to enroll approximately 1300 adult patients with a recorded diagnosis of RRMM from
        between 100 and 125 sites, approximately. A subset of patients, limited to the US only,
        will be recruited through the Inteliquet consortium (up to approximately 100 patients out
        of 1300), for enrichment by leveraging existing electronic medical record (EMR)
        technologies coupled with the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).

        -  Age â‰¥18 years

          -  Patients with MM who received at least one prior line of therapy and are considered as
             RRMM according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, including
             patients with:

        Refractory disease: patients who were refractory to all previous lines of treatment but
        should have achieved at least a minimal response (MR) in one previous line

        Relapsed and refractory disease: patients who were relapsed from at least one previous line
        of treatment and refractory to the last line of treatment. Patients can be refractory to
        other previous line/lines of treatment

        Note: Patients must have achieved a MR or better to at least one of the previous lines of
        treatment (i.e., primary refractory disease is not eligible)

          -  Patients who will be treated with isatuximab, solely determined by the treating
             physician, and independent of the study

          -  Able to understand and complete the study-related questionnaires

          -  Patient must have given signed informed consent prior to study start

        Most important exclusion criteria for potential participants:

          -  Patients who are receiving isatuximab for an indication other than RRMM

          -  Patients who have received any other investigational drug or prohibited therapy for
             this study within 28 days or five half-lives from randomization, whichever is longer

          -  Patients having contraindication to the isatuximab summary of product characteristics
             (SMPC) or package insert (PI)

          -  Patients having contraindications as noted in the drug-specific local isatuximab
             SMPC/PI of combination drugs

          -  Any country-related specific regulation that would prevent the patient from entering
             the study

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within three years prior to study
             inclusion with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin, an in -situ malignancy, or low risk prostate cancer after
             curative therapy

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
