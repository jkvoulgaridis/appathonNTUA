      Lynch Syndrome increases Endometrial Cancer Occurrence in women due to failure in MisMatch
      Repair System. Lifetime Cumulative risk of developing endometrial Cancer is approximatively
      40% in women with Lynch Syndrome.

      Endometrial cancer is the third women cancer in France. Many risk factors are known in
      general population. Lots of factors are related to over exposure to estrogen.

      Data about influence of general risk factors in Women with Lynch Syndrome are poor. Recently,
      a cohort study appears to have shown a significant decrease in the risk of endometrial cancer
      with multiparity, the use of hormonal contraception and late menopause in Lynch women. The
      impact of weight and certain metabolic parameters on the occurrence of endometrial cancers
      remains poorly known to this day.

        Women included are all carriers of Lynch syndrome, already diagnosed by genetic analysis in
        the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the CHU de Lille and whose analysis was transmitted
        during a consultation at the Guy Fontaine Genetics Clinic during the period from 01/01/1998
        to 30/11/2019 at the CHU de Lille or in advanced consultations in the regions.The database
        PROGENY will be use to extract population corresponding to the study
