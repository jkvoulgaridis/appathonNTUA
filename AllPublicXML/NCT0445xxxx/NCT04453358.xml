  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if interactive technology (i.e. virtual coaching)
      that facilitates vest therapy goal setting and provides positive reinforcement will increase
      adherence to vest therapy for airway clearance in individuals with CF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting multi-system disease primarily characterized by
      chronic lung infections and pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest tightness.
      Those with CF rely on numerous pharmaceutical and treatment-based therapies as part of their
      routine care to maintain lung health. Airway clearance, one such treatment-based therapy,
      uses breathing techniques and various vibrating devices to mobilize lung secretions and is
      considered a cornerstone of CF care. Vest therapy, a &quot;shaking vest&quot; that applies pressure and
      high frequency vibrations to the chest wall is the most commonly used technique for airway
      clearance in the U.S., but adherence to recommended goals for airway clearance is low.
      Barriers to adherence include the time limitations and unclear goal setting for effective
      treatment. A previous pilot study by this research team showed that CF patients find the use
      of airway clearance vests equipped with both pre-set and individually determined programing
      capabilities as well as electronic monitoring and transmitting capabilities to be acceptable
      and feasible. Information such as vest-use time, vest pressure measures, programming choices
      and symptom reporting is captured by these devices and transmitted to health care teams for
      review as well as provided to patients to provide feedback on treatment goals. This study
      aims to determine if providing patients with clearly stated treatment goals and the means to
      monitor and receive positive reinforcing feedback on vest use through interactive technology
      (i.e. virtual coaching) will improve vest therapy adherence in individuals with CF.

    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention comparison based upon pre and post Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R).
Name of categories/domains CFQ-R:
9 Quality of life domains: Physical, role/school, vitality, emotion, social, body image, eating, treatment burden, health perceptions.
3 symptom scales: Weight, respiratory, and digestion.
Scaling of items:
5 distinct 4-point Likert scales (e.g., always/often/ sometime/never)
Scoring:
Scores for each domain; after recording, each item is summed to generate a domain score and standardized. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

    <measure>CF Respiratory Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention comparison based upon pre and post CF Respiratory Symptom Score (CRSS) assessment.
The score evaluates four symptoms: cough, sputum, breathlessness and fatigue. Each symptom is scored from one (mild symptoms) to four (severe symptoms). The total symptom score was the summation of all the four symptoms.
Scores range from 4 to 16 with 4 being mild to 16 being most severe.</description>
