  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global health problem. New and more efficient interventions are needed to
      overcome this disease. This randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of
      changing eating behavior using cognitive training. These types of interventions have the role
      of creating new routines (unconsciously processed), in terms of healthy eating behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial with three groups. Participants will be found through
      social media announcements. The active interventions of cognitive training will be delivered
      at two groups: one group will receive through hypnosis and the other will receive through
      food inhibition training (a GO NO GO task). The control group will receive a simple GO NO GO
      task as an active placebo. The trial will be exclusive online and it consists of four
      sessions. Participants will complete their tasks on four Zoom sessions. Cognitive, emotional
      and behavioral data will be taken at four times: before the intervention starts, in the
      middle (after two sessions), at the end and at two follow up moments:one month and six month
      after the trial ends.

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention; immediately after the intervention;1 month; 6 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported Three Factor Eating Questionnaire. The scale measures three aspects of eating behavior: cognitive restraint (CR), uncontrolled eating (UE), and emotional eating (EE). It has 21 items and the responses are on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 Definitely true to 4 Definitely false with three subscales one for each domain. Higher scores indicate greater CR, UE, or EE.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention; during the intervention (after 2 days), immediately after the intervention;1 month; 6 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report - Positive and Negative Schedule (PANAS). The responses are made using Likert type ratings from 1 - Not at all, to 5 Very much. Higher scores on negative affect representing higher levels of negative affect and higher scores on positive affect representing higher levels of positive affect.</description>

    <description>Self-report - Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The interest/enjoyment subscale is considered the self-report measure of intrinsic motivation; The responses are made using Likert type ratings from 1 - not at all true to 7 very true. Higher total scores indicate higher intrinsic motivation.</description>

    <description>Self-report - Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire. The response is given using a Likert scale in 0 to10 points: 0 for &quot;Not confident at all&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;Very confident&quot;. Higher total scores are associated with higher eating self-efficacy and motivation to make positive lifestyle changes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention; immediately after the intervention; 1 month; 6 month.</time_frame>
