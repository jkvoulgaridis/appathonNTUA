  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy affecting women's health.
      About 15% of the patients will have local late disease (stage III) with high risk of
      recurrence and tumor related mortality. There is a consensus that adjuvant radiochemotherapy
      is needed for stage Ⅲ endometrial cancer, but the best modality of radiochemotherapy is still
      uncertain. The retrospective data of our center showed that the sequential radiochemotherapy
      of &quot;chemotherapy-radiotherapy-chemotherapy&quot; in the &quot;sanwich&quot; mode could improve the survival
      outcome in patients with advanced endometrial cancer. A multicenter, prospective, randomized
      controlled study to compare the &quot;sanwich&quot; mode of radiochemotherapy and the &quot;concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy&quot; mode will be carried out to determine the better
      modality of radiochemotherapy in stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma.
