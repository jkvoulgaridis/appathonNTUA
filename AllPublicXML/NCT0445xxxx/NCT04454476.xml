      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Trametinib in reversing metaplasia in participants with
           Stage 1 gastric cancer

        -  To evaluate the safety of Trametinibin in Stage I gastric cancer patients

    <description>The ability of Trametinib treatment to decrease the presence of metaplastic cell lineages in biopsies of the lining of the stomach, while also allowing the return of normal cell lineages (i.e. acid-secreting parietal cells). Cell lineages will be identified by immunostaining of tissue sections from biopsies.</description>
