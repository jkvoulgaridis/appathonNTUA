  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 2 different vascular closure
      device (VCD) strategies during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
      The study hypothesizes that the choice of one over the other VCD in patients undergoing
      transfemoral TAVI may demonstrate relevant differences in the rate of peri-procedural
      complications and effectiveness of vascular closure.
