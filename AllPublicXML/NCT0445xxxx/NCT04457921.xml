      The aim of this study to determine the effect of deep tissue massage applied to the back on
      pain and comfort after cesarean section. Personal information form was used as data
      collection form, Visual Analog Scala was used to assess pain, and Postpartum Comfort
      Questionnaire was used to assess comfort.

      Material and Method

      This research was conducted between May 2019 and November 2019 in Inonu University Turgut
      Ozal Medical Center Training and Research Hospital. When power analysis was performed, the
      sample size was calculated to be at least 81 women for each group (81 experiments, 81
      controls). Experimental group received deep tissue massage twice at 11st and 23rd hours after
      cesarean section. Data collection form for experimental and control groups before the first
      massage; Visual Analog Scala was applied four times before and after both massages. After the
      second massage, both groups were re-administered. Descriptive statistics and independent
      t-test were used for data analysis.
