  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TRACK-MSA is an observational, non-interventional, longitudinal natural history study to
      define changes in clinical, neurological, blood, CSF, and neuroimaging biomarkers in patients
      with multiple system atrophy (MSA) comparing baseline to 6-month and 1-year assessments. The
      study will enroll 50 patients with MSA-P or MSA-C at 2 or more participating sites.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRACK-MSA is designed to relate phenotypic characteristics of participants with MSA using
      several modalities (i.e., clinical, quantitative motor, imaging, laboratory) in order to
      relate phenotypic characteristics with data derived from the study of blood and CSF (&quot;wet
      biomarkers&quot;) and imaging or wearables (&quot;dry biomarkers&quot;).

      It is possible that the cohort enrolled in this study will, after study completion, be
      recruited into the earliest multicenter biomarker-driven clinical trials of disease modifying
      agents for MSA. As such, the data collected in the TRACK-MSA study could constitute a
      valuable observational non-interventional arm of potential disease-modifying treatments.

      The objective of the study will therefore be to determine the combination of measures that
      most sensitively detects changes over the natural course of MSA, with a goal of validating
      these measures for use in future clinical trials.

      TRACK-MSA will be a 1-year observational, longitudinal, non-interventional natural history
      study of patients with MSA. The study will be carried out at least at 2 sites (NYU being the
      primary site). All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-month and 1-year visits.
      Participants will undergo clinical, neurological, quantitative motor, MRI assessments, in
      addition to donating blood and CSF samples at some or all of the visits.

      For a given participant, the same investigator should carry out the clinical assessment
      throughout the study where possible.

      It is anticipated that the study will complete enrollment in 2 years since startup, and
      complete all the follow-up evaluations within 3 years from startup.

      Biomarker analysis will be focused on measuring the levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL)
      in serum and/or plasma, which is one of the most promising blood biomarkers in MSA.

      Analysis of CSF may include but is not limited to the following biomarkers: total alpha
      synuclein, aggregated alpha synuclein Tau/phosphorylated Tau, neurofilament light chain,
      neurofilament heavy chain, and catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, DOPAC, DHPG).
