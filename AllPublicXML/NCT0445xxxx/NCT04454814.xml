      A hundred twenty patients who had an asymptomatic mandibular molar teeth with periapical
      lesion were included. For each patient, teeth were prepared with Reciproc Blue or Protaper
      Universal instruments. Each tooth was obturated with gutta-percha and resin-based sealer
      using single cone technique for mesial roots and for distal roots single cone and cold
      lateral compaction technique. Root canal treatment was performed in a single visit.
      Postoperative pain was assessed as no, mild, moderate, or severe at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours
      and 7 days after obturation.

      The aim of this study was to compare the effect of root canal preparation techniques on the
      occurrence and intensity of postoperative pain in patients with asymptomatic mandibular molar
      teeth with periapical lesions.A hundred twenty patients who had an asymptomatic mandibular
      molar teeth with periapical lesion were included. For each patient, teeth were prepared with
      Reciproc Blue or Protaper Universal instruments. Each tooth was obturated with gutta-percha
      and resin-based sealer using single cone technique for mesial roots and for distal roots
      single cone and cold lateral compaction technique. Root canal treatment was performed in a
      single visit. Postoperative pain was assessed as no, mild, moderate, or severe at 6, 12, 24,
      48, 72 hours and 7 days after obturation.For the comparison of pain scores between the tested
      instrumentation systems, the Mann Whitney test was used. Differences between postoperative
      pain intencity for each instrumentation technique, at different time intervals, were assessed
      by the Friedman test. For the association of pain and an analgesic intake with gender, the
      chi-square test was performed. For the association of pain with age and an analgesic intake
      were calculated using Mann Whitney test. A P value &lt; .05 or less was considered significant.

    <description>The instrumentation protocol with Protaper Universal rotary files was began with an S1 file with a brushing movement to the two thirds of the working length and then an SX file was introduced to the two thirds of the working length with a brushing movement Afterwards, S1, S2, F1, F2 files in mesial roots and F4 files in distal roots were used to the working length, respectively. Protaper F2 instrument was then used to complete the canal preparation in mesial roots and Protaper F4 instrument was used to complete the canal preparation in distal roots.</description>

    <description>The instrumentation of the root canal in the Reciproc Blue group began with a R25 instrument with a slow in-and-out pecking movement.According to the manufacturer instructions, a #10 K-file was inserted to the canal to check the canal is free to 1 mm beyond the prepared canal section. After each 3 pecks or when a resistance was encountered the instrument was pulled out of the canal. Afterward, the R25 instrument was inserted in to root canal until approximately two thirds of the working length.RB R25 instrument was then used to complete the canal preparation in mesial roots and RB R40 instrument was used to complete the canal preparation in distal roots.</description>
