  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is currently the leading cause of disability and suicide death worldwide. Several
      studies, however, have shown that a significant proportion of patients do not respond to
      standard antidepressants, especially since their symptomatology is dominated by anhedonia or
      psychomotor retardation reflecting central dopaminergic dysfunction. In order to improve the
      efficiency and speed of the antidepressant response, it seems essential to highlight this
      dopaminergic dysfunction, by defining a P300 wave profile specific to the subtype of
      depressed patients with anhedonic phenotype to whom personalized treatment targeting
      dopaminergic transmission could in the future be proposed earlier. The investigators
      therefore wish to highlight an increase in the latency time of P300 and a modification of
      motor skills (of the walking cycle and of the movement of the hands), without modification of
      the dopaminergic transmission measured by PETScan, specific to the sub-type of depressive
      patients, resistant to at least 2 antidepressants of different classes with an anhedonia
      score&gt; 5/14 on the SHAPS scale. The increased latency of P300 could then be used in the
      future as a predictive biomarker of resistance to conventional antidepressant treatments
      specific to this population of anhedonic depressed patients
