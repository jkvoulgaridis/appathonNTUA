    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the safety profile of the different formulations in all participants

        -  To describe the hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) and seroneutralization (SN) antibody
           responses against hemagglutinin (H1, H3, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) antigens present in
           the control vaccine in all groups at all timepoints.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To describe antigenic coverage in each group by assessing the HAI and SN antibody
           responses against a panel of H3 antigens (not present in any of the vaccine
           formulations).

        -  To describe SN antibody responses in each group against each of the H3 antigens.

        -  To compare H3 HAI and SN antibody responses for the groups with quadrivalent recombinant
           influenza vaccine (RIV) formulations with H3 antigens to those of the quadrivalent RIV
           control group.

        -  To compare the HAI and SN antibody responses for the groups with quadrivalent RIV
           formulation with adjuvant to the group without adjuvant.
