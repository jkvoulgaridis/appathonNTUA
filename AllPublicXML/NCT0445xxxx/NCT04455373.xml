      Introduction:

      Vascular bypass surgery in children differs significantly from adults. It is a rarely
      performed procedure in the setting of trauma and tumor surgery to facilitate limb salvage.
      Beside the technical challenges to reconstruct the small and spastic vessels, bypass grafting
      should not impede growth of the extremity. The primary aim of this study was to assess
      long-term outcome after pediatric bypass grafting, in a single academic center, focusing on
      potential effects on limb development.

      Methods:

      In this retrospective cohort analyses we included all pediatric patients undergoing vascular
      bypass grafting at the Medical University of Vienna between 2002-2017. All patients ≤ 18
      years suffered a traumatic injury or underwent a tumor resection of the lower or upper limb,
      respectively. The youngest female patient was 0.4 years, the youngest male patient was 3.5
      years.

        This study represents a retrospective cohort analysis of pediatric patients who underwent
        vascular bypass grafting by an experienced team of vascular surgeons at the Medical
        University Vienna between 2002-2017.

        All data regarding demographics, operative techniques and outcome were collected from the
        in-hospital database registry in collaboration with the Department of Orthopedics and
        Trauma-Surgery. All patients ≤ 18 years who suffered a traumatic injury or vascular surgery
        due to a planned orthopedic extremity tumor resection were included in this study. 33
        patients underwent vascular repair, a total of 15 patients fulfilling the criteria could be
        identified.
