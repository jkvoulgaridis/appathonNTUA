  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Researchers seek ways to study people s medical problems in order to teach and further
      general knowledge. The ability to assess and treat people with a wide range of diseases is
      critical to training people to be good doctors. It is also needed to keep medical staff up to
      date. In this study, researchers want to study the course of some illnesses to learn more
      about them. To do this, they will collect and review people s medical records. In some cases,
      they may also provide treatment.

      Objective:

      To collect data that may be used to help researchers create ideas for future research.

      Eligibility:

      People age 2 and older who have or are suspected to have a medical condition for which they
      have been referred to NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, as well as stem cell
      donors

      Design:

      Participants may be screened with a review of the following:

      Medical records

      Scans and images

      Other existing samples and reports.

      Participants medical data will be collected from the standard care they receive. This
      includes their routine blood and urine tests, X-rays and scans, and other tests to diagnose
      or follow their medical condition. Data will also be collected from the treatments they may
      receive. For stem cell donors, data from apheresis procedures will be collected. Demographic
      data will also be collected.

      All of the data will be kept in the medical records or on secure network drives.

      Some participants may need to be treated for their medical condition. If so, they will sign a
      separate consent form for that treatment.

      Participation lasts up to 2 years.

      This protocol is designed to provide a repository of information to allow for hypothesis
      generation in future research. This information will be drawn from standard medical
      care/procedures and follow up of patients and healthy volunteers, including transplant
      donors, who are not currently receiving therapy on an active NHLBI research protocol. It
      allows investigation into the problems of these patients for the purpose of teaching and
      furthering general knowledge. The ability to evaluate and treat patients with a wide variety
      of diseases is critical to maintaining our accreditation with the hematology-oncology,
      cardiology, and pulmonary fellowship programs and training our fellows to be competent
      physicians, as well as for keeping all staff, including senior staff, up-to-date and familiar
      with the evaluation and treatment of patients with a wide spectrum of diseases. Periodic
      follow-up and treatment of patients previously entered on NHLBI protocols in order to monitor
      the long-term course of the underlying disease and the consequences of experimental
      treatments is also required for fellowship training, and for maintenance of good referral
      relationships with patients and their physicians. This study also allows for standard
      apheresis procedures for transplant donors and for care of volunteers who may present with a
      treatable condition.
