  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multi-centre study to assess the safety, tolerability, PD,
      and efficacy of adjuvant immunotherapy EVX-02 vaccine and anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) in patients
      who have had a complete resection of a Stage IIIB/IIIC/IIID or Stage IV melanoma who are at
      high risk of recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts: a safety, efficacy and PD response part using two
      different drug delivery methods and an expansion cohort.

      All patients will be administered with anti-PD-1 once every 4 weeks for up to 1 year
      commencing on Day 1 and with EVX-02 vaccine as soon as it is produced.

      Part 1 will consist of two cohorts:

      Cohort A: Will receive EVX- 02A delivered by delivery methodology 1. Cohort B: Will receive
      EVX- 02B delivered by delivery device 2. Part 2 (Cohort C) will be an expansion cohort. In
      this part, only one delivery methods, either EVX-02A or EVX-02B with will be used.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated written ICF prior to performing any protocol-related procedures,
             which are not part of normal standard care.

          2. Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,
             laboratory tests, tumour sample including core needle biopsy as required, and other
             requirements of the study.

          3. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age at the time of informed consent.

          4. Stage IIIB/IIIC/IIID or Stage IV AJCC (8th edition) (AJCC, 2018) before complete
             resection.

             Please note: If Stage III melanoma (whether Stage IIIB or IIIC or IIID) the patients
             must have clinically detectable lymph nodes that are confirmed as malignant on the
             pathology report and/or ulcerated primary lesions. The pathology report must be
             reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigator; this process must be done prior to
             enrolling patients into the study. Clinically detectable lymph nodes are defined as:

               1. a palpable node (confirmed as malignant by pathology) after the CLND

               2. a non-palpable but enlarged lymph node by CT scan (at least 15 mm in short axis)
                  and confirmed as malignant by pathology after the CLND

               3. a PET scan positive lymph node of any size confirmed by pathology after CLND

               4. evidence of pathologically macro metastatic disease in one or more lymph nodes
                  defined by one or more foci of melanoma at least 1 cm in diameter If Stage IV
                  melanoma, the pathology report confirming negative margins must be reviewed,
                  dated, and signed by the Investigator prior to randomisation.

          5. Cutaneous Melanoma, with metastases to regional lymph nodes or distant metastases that
             can be surgically resected with negative margin on resected specimens.

          6. Specimen from the resected tumour tissue must be provided for evaluation by NGS.

          7. ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1.

          8. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and must be reconfirmed
             for eligibility within 72 hours prior to first dose of anti-PD-1 on Day 1:

             i. WBCs ≥ 2000/μL (2.0 x 109/L) ii. Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL (1.5 x109/L) iii. Platelets
             ≥ 100 x 10³/μL (100 x 109/L) iv. Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (90 g/L) v. Creatinine Serum
             creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute (using Cockcroft/Gault
             formula) vi. AST ≤ 3 x ULN vii. ALT ≤ 3 x ULN viii. Total Bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN
             (except patients with Gilbert Syndrome who must have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

          9. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months at Screening.

         10. WOCBP and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         11. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of hCG]) within 24 hours prior to first dose of anti-PD-1 on Day
             1.

         12. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the
             duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug plus 30 days
             (duration of ovulatory cycle). The half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days. WOCBP
             should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for a total of 23 weeks
             post-treatment completion.

         13. Men who are sexually active with a WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5
             half-lives of the study drug(s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover). The
             half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days, men should therefore use an adequate method
             of contraception for a total of 31 weeks post-treatment completion.

         14. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing.

         15. Disease-free at study enrolment (after surgery) based upon pathology report review by
             the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of additional malignancies, except:

             i. Non-melanoma skin cancer where a complete remission was achieved at least 3 years

             iii. Patients with the following cancers if diagnosed and treated within the past 5
             years:

               -  Cervical cancer in situ;

             safety of the patient or impact the validity of the study results.

          7. Uncontrolled mental disease or psychotic manifestation that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would prohibit compliance with the protocol, the understanding of the
