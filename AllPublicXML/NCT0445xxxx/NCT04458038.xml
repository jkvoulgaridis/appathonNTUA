    <textblock>
      Studies have documented impaired cognitive function in patients with COPD. The possible
      reasons for this and correlation to the severity of the disease are not well described. This
      explorative study examines the cognitive skills of COPD patients, quantified by their ability
      to drive a vehicle and other cognitive test. Furthermore, we want to study the cognitive
      skills in COPD patients before and after they are diagnosed with and treated for obstructive
      sleep apnoea (OSA). The overall hypothesis is that chronic lung patients´ cognitive skills
      correlate with the severity of their disease. We expect that their ability to drive a vehicle
      drops in relation to the severity of the disease and to comorbidities.

    <description>For this study a driving simulator is being used which is an internationally approved method. Besides the driving simulator following tests are done: COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a clock drawing test and a continuous reaction time test (CRT). A CardioRespiratory Monitor (CRM), NOX T3TM, is used to measure if the patients have moderate to severe OSA. Furthermore, following tests are done: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Nighttime Symptoms of COPD Instrument (NiSCI). Additionally the 36 Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) is being performed by all patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Doctor-diagnosed chronic obstructive lung disease (forced expiratory volume in the
             first second (FEV1) / forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70).

          2. Severity of COPD - GOLD 3+4 (GOLD 2019 classification).

          3. No exacerbations in the last 6 weeks (aggravation of the respiratory symptoms compared
             with habitual state, which require treatment).

          4. Age ≥ 40 years and ≤ 75 years

          5. The patient must have driven a vehicle within the last 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lacking the ability to operate the driving simulator (physical deformities or lack of
             comprehensive skills to understand instruction of operating the simulator).

          2. No valid driver´s license.

          3. Do not read and understand Danish.

          4. Known obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

          5. Alcohol consumption (&gt;21 units per week for men, &gt;14 units per week for women).

          6. Consumption of alcohol and/or narcotics within the last 24 hours.

          7. Uncorrected sight- or hearing reduction.

          8. Unstable ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, left sided
             heart failure, serious neurologic conditions, cancer, phlebitis, severe psychiatric
             diseases, uncontrolled thyroid disease or former apoplexy.
