  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this trial is to determine the effect of GB002 on improving
      pulmonary hemodynamics in subjects with World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 PAH who are
      Functional Class (FC) II and III. The secondary objective for this trial is to determine the
      effect of GB002 on improving exercise capacity in this population.

               2. PAH associated with connective tissue diseases.

               3. PAH associated with anorexigen or methamphetamine use.

               4. Congenital heart disease with simple systemic to pulmonary shunt at least 1 year
                  after surgical repair.

          2. 6MWD ≥ 150 meters and ≤ 550 meters at screening.

          3. WHO FC II or III symptomatology.

          4. Treatment with standard of care PAH background therapies.

          5. Documentation of cardiac catheterization within the screening period that is
             consistent with the diagnosis of PAH and meeting all the following criteria, to be
             confirmed by a central hemodynamic core laboratory:

               1. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg (at rest);

               2. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg, or mean left atrial pressure (mLAP)
                  or left ventricular-end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≤ 15 mmHg in the absence of
                  left atrial obstruction;

               3. PVR ≥ 400 dyne•s/cm5.

          6. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon
             monoxide (DLCO) at screening with the following criteria met:

               1. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥60% (predicted);

               2. DLCO ≥40% predicted except for subject with PAH associated with systemic

             hemorrhage).

         14. Chronic renal insufficiency as defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate
             (eGFR) ≤ 30 mL/min via Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-epi) at
             screening or requires dialytic therapy or hemofiltration.

         15. Hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration &lt; 8.5 g/dL at screening.

         16. Evidence of active HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C, or tuberculosis (TB) infections.

         17. Inhaled prostanoids; these drugs must be withdrawn prior to or at screening.
