  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, hematologists have noticed that persons of African descent sometimes have
      lower white blood cell counts of a certain type, called granulocytes. These cells help to
      fight infections. The lower number of granulocytes in this situation does not appear to lead
      to more infections, and these individuals do not have any symptoms. This condition is called
      benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), and is observed in a small percentage of individuals of
      African descent. This study will investigate the condition by studying people with and
      without BEN.

      The goals of this study are to:

        1. identify individuals of African descent with BEN.

        2. determine the effects of two drugs, G-CSF and dexamethasone, on granulocyte production
           and movement.

        3. determine whether there are differences in those with and without BEN in the way genes
           are stimulated after the administration of G-CSF and dexamethasone.

      Study participants will be asked to interview with the research team, undergo physical exams,
      donate a blood sample, and receive G-CSF by injection, followed by dexamethasone (orally)
      about three weeks later. They also will be required to undergo apheresis three times, a
      procedure in which blood is drawn from a donor and separated into its components. Some
      components are retained for research analyses, such as granulocytes, and small amount of
      blood; the remainder is returned by transfusion to the donor. This procedure will be required
      of participants before they receive G-CSF, the day after they receive G-CSF, and the day
      after they receive dexamethasone. Gene messages (mRNA will be isolated from granulocytes, and
      analyzed to better understand granulocyte growth and movement.

    <textblock>
      Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is defined by peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count less
      than 1.5 x 10 (9) per liter without an increase in infections. This condition has been
      described in individuals of African descent. Although these individuals have normal myeloid
      maturation on bone marrow examinations, they appear to release fewer neutrophils into the
      circulation when stimulated by hydrocortisone, compared to normal controls. This suggests
      that there may be differences in the regulation of neutrophil release or trafficking. In the
      past decade, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been widely used in a variety
      of clinical settings, from patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia to normal
      volunteers for peripheral blood stem cell collection. G-CSF, however, has not been used in
      individuals with BEN. Furthermore, gene expression in neutrophil proliferation and
      trafficking has not been studied in these individuals. The purpose of this study are to (1)
      identify individuals with BEN; (2) follow the natural history of BEN; (3) determine if there
      is a familial inheritance pattern; (4) characterize and compare neutrophil response to
      dexamethasone and G-CSF; (5) compare the pattern of neutrophil gene expression by microarray
      analyses; and (6) determine if mutations are present at the DNA level to account for gene
      expression pattern differences in individuals of African descent with and without BEN at
      baseline, post dexamethasone, and post G-CSF stimulation.

    <description>In our study, we hope to further elucidate the etiology of BEN in research subjects by isolating granulocyte mRNA after G-CSF and dexamethasone stimulation, applying microarray analyses to screen for gene expression differences, and confirming expression pattern differences by DNA analyses. We will focus on genes that are important in the proliferation and trafficking of neutrophils,such as PRV-1, elastase, myeloblastin, transcription factor PU.1, CAAT enhancing binding protein-alpha (C /EBP), stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and CXC receptor-4 (CXCR4).</description>

        Since BEN is a condition of individuals of African descent, volunteer recruitment will be
        focused in this ethnic population. Accrual for BEN subjects will be based on entry
        criteria, and not on gender or age (in those 5 years or greater). The minimum age is 5
        years because these older children would have larger veins and would be more likely to
        cooperate with blood draws. Subjects without BEN will be selected to match age and gender
        of BEN subjects to minimize the differential effects of age and gender to the responses to
        G-CSF and dexamethasone and in microarray analyses.
