  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of hereditary factors in different forms of severe combined
      immunodeficiency (SCID).

      Patients with immunodeficiencies may be eligible for this study. Candidates include:

        -  Patients with diminished numbers of T cells or NK cells or both, or

        -  Patients with normal T cell and NK cell numbers but diminished T cell, B cell, or NK
           cell function.

      Relatives of patients will also be studied.

      Participants will have blood samples collected for genetic analysis in studies related to
      SCID at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions.

      The goal of this project is to identify the genetic basis of new forms of inherited
      immunodeficiency. The particular focus relates to cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9,
      IL-15, and IL-21 that share the common cytokine receptor (Gamma) chain, (Gamma c), and to
      molecules that are important for signaling or gene regulation in response to these cytokines,
      although other causes of inherited immunodeficiency are also encompassed.

    <description>In an effort to determine the cause of the immunodeficiency, we will perform studies that may include but not be limited to evaluating the levels of expression of protein and/or mRNA, obtaining DNA sequence data, performing epigenetic studies, and evaluating biological function using cellular, biochemical, or other molecular studies.</description>

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Index cases to be included are those with diminished numbers of T cells and/or NK cells
        and/or B cells or other immune cells or those who have normal numbers of T cell, B cells,
        NK cells and other immune cells but diminished function of one or more immune cells.
        Relatives of affected individuals may also be studied

          -  Patients (index cases): 6 months of age and older

          -  Siblings: 6 months of age and older

          -  Non-sibling relatives (biological parent, aunt, uncle or grandparent): 18 years or
             older

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients to be excluded are those with a known diagnosis. Other patients may be excluded
        based on the particular immunological phenotype or the inability of the laboratory to
        handle additional cases at a given time.
