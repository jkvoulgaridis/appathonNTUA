      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may improve the
      ability to detect cancer in the unaffected breast of women recently diagnosed with unilateral
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to determine the effectiveness of MRI in evaluating the unaffected
      breast of women recently diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating the
           contralateral breast of women with a recent unilateral diagnosis of breast cancer and a
           negative contralateral mammogram and clinical breast exam.

        -  Determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value for both call backs
           for additional imaging and biopsy recommendations, and receiver operating characteristic
           curves of MRI in evaluating these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of the following patient-related factors: age (50 years old and
           over vs less than 50 years old), breast parenchymal density (fatty vs non fatty breast),
           and tumor histology (invasive lobular vs invasive ductal, invasive vs in situ) on the
           performance of MRI (cancer yield, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gadopentetate dimeglumine IV and then undergo magnetic resonance imaging of
      the contralateral breast.

      Patients are followed at 12-18 and 24-30 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>To assess the diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating the contralateral breast of women with a recent unilateral diagnosis of breast cancer and a negative contralateral mammogram and clinical breast exam.
the &quot;Test&quot; status was defined based on combinations of the following 4 factors:
The initial BI-RADs: from the MRI of the contralateral breast
The final BI-RADs: determined after all subsequent work-up and follow-up within 365 from the initial MRI (an explicit recommendation for biopsy always resulted in a final BI-RADs of 4).
Subsequent work-up includes all procedures resultant from an Initial MRI finding (generally triggered by a BI-RADs 0 or 3) within 365 from the initial MRI
Whether or not biopsy procedure (Bx) were performed on the contralateral (Study) breast within 365 from the initial MRI</description>

          <title>MRI Evaluation of Contralateral Breast</title>
          <description>The cohort is a distinct population of women at high risk for breast carcinoma: women with a recent (within 60 days) personal diagnosis of breast cancer who will have MRI to evaluate the contralateral breast.
MRI: Breast contralateral to the breast diagnosed with cancer was scanned prior to initiation of chemotherapy and within 90 days of a negative mammogram of the study breast. A recent (within 90 days) negative or benign mammogram (defined by final BI RADS category 1 or 2) and negative or benign clinical breast exam of the study breast were required for entry into the study.</description>

        <description>To assess the diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating the contralateral breast of women with a recent unilateral diagnosis of breast cancer and a negative contralateral mammogram and clinical breast exam.
the &quot;Test&quot; status was defined based on combinations of the following 4 factors:
The initial BI-RADs: from the MRI of the contralateral breast
The final BI-RADs: determined after all subsequent work-up and follow-up within 365 from the initial MRI (an explicit recommendation for biopsy always resulted in a final BI-RADs of 4).
Subsequent work-up includes all procedures resultant from an Initial MRI finding (generally triggered by a BI-RADs 0 or 3) within 365 from the initial MRI

          <title>MRI Evaluation of Contralateral Breast</title>
          <description>The cohort is a distinct population of women at high risk for breast carcinoma: women with a recent (within 60 days) personal diagnosis of breast cancer who will have MRI to evaluate the contralateral breast.
MRI: Breast contralateral to the breast diagnosed with cancer was scanned prior to initiation of chemotherapy and within 90 days of a negative mammogram of the study breast. A recent (within 90 days) negative or benign mammogram (defined by final BI RADS category 1 or 2) and negative or benign clinical breast exam of the study breast were required for entry into the study.</description>
