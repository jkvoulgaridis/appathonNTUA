  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a web-based program is effective in
      reducing the incidence of eating disorders in college women who are at high risk for
      developing an eating disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female college students who use unhealthy weight control methods and have body image concerns
      may be at risk for developing an eating disorder. Developing and evaluating interventions to
      reduce eating disorders in high-risk populations is of great public health importance.

      Participants are randomly assigned to either join a web-based risk-reduction program or
      receive no intervention. The 9-week risk-reduction program focuses on reducing body image and
      weight/shape concerns, identifying the risks of eating disorders, and increasing healthy
      weight regulation practices. The program includes weekly readings, writing assignments, and
      participation in a moderated electronic discussion group. Changes in body mass index (BMI)
      and the occurrence of major stressors and psychiatric events are assessed to determine their
      impact on the incidence of eating disorders. One-year incidence of eating disorders is
      determined by a diagnostic interview, and follow up may continue for up to 2.5 years.
