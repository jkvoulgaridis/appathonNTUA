      Ph2a study planned to be run at approximately 16-18 sites in 4 EU countries (Denmark,
      Hungary, Poland and Sweden) enrolling approximately 170 patients to ensure 70 randomized
      patients with eosinophilic, moderate to severe asthma. The patients will receive 13 once
      weekly inhaled doses of the study drug. Treatment is initiated on top of their ICS/LABA
      controller medication, which is then tapered down and withdrawn during a period of 3 weeks
      and during the last 3 weeks of treatment the study drug is given as monotherapy. SABA is used
      as reliever medication during the whole study period. Primary endpoint is Loss of asthma
      control. When the endpoint is met, patients will resume their ICS/LABA, will be followed for
      an additional 4 weeks and will thereafter discontinue the study.

      Ph2a study planned to be run in approximately 16-18 sites in 4 EU countries (Denmark,
      Hungary, Poland and Sweden) enrolling approximately 170 patients to ensure 70 randomized
      patients with eosinophilic, moderate to severe asthma.

      The study has a withdrawal design.The patients will receive 13 once weekly inhaled doses of
      the study drug (AZD1419 or placebo). Treatment is initiated with 6 doses of the study drug on
      top of their ICS/LABA controller medication. Prior to the 7th dose of the study drug the LABA
      is withdrawn. The following 3 doses are given when ICS is tapered down. Dose 7 is given on
      top of 100% of their ICS, dose 8 is given on top of 50% of the ICS dose, which is then
      tapered down to 25% the following week and withdrawn completely prior to dose 10 of the study
      drug. During the last 3 weeks of treatment (ie last 4 doses), the study drug is given as
      monotherapy. SABA is used as reliever medication during the whole study period. Primary
      endpoint is Loss of asthma control, defined as any of the following criteria: a) An increase
      of ACQ-5 to 1.5 or more b) A reduction of 30% or more in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF)
      from baseline on 2 consecutive days c) At least six additional reliever inhalations of SABA
      in a 24-hour period relative to baseline on 2 consecutive days and d) An exacerbation
      requiring systemic corticosteroids

      When the endpoint is met, patients will resume their regular ICS/LABA controller medication
      and will be followed for an additional 4 weeks, when they do an Early Discontinuation (ED)
      Visit and will thereafter leave the study. For patients not loosing their asthma control, the
      full Observational period is up to week 52, when they will do an End of Treatment Visit
      (EOT). Study procedures are the same on ED and EOT Visits.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Events for Time to Loss of Asthma Control (LOAC) up to Week 52 - Cox Regression Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>LOAC was defined as any of the following:
Increase of asthma control questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) to ≥ 1.5.
≥ 30% reduction in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) from baseline on 2 consecutive days.
≥ 6 additional reliever inhalations of short-acting β agonist (SABA) in a 24-hour period relative to baseline on 2 consecutive days.
Exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids as decided by Investigator. Time to LOAC was calculated as start date of first LOAC - date of randomization + 1. Start date of LOAC was latest date that 1 of the 4 criteria were satisfied immediately prior to the exacerbation start date, provided no more than 7 days between LOAC and exacerbation start date. Time to LOAC was displayed using a Kaplan-Meier plot and the outcome measure is presented as number of participants with events. Cox regression analysis was used to compare treatments.</description>

    <description>LOAC was defined as any of the following:
Increase of ACQ-5 to ≥ 1.5.
≥ 30% reduction in morning PEF from baseline on 2 consecutive days.
≥ 6 additional reliever inhalations of SABA in a 24-hour period relative to baseline on 2 consecutive days.
Exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids. Number of participants experiencing LOAC up to Week 52 is presented. A generalized linear model based on a generalized estimating equation was used to compare treatments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Least Squares (LS) Mean ACQ-5 Score Over 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>In the ACQ-5 questionnaire, participants were asked to recall the status of their asthma during the previous week with regards to symptoms. The questionnaire included the items:
Awoken at night by asthma symptoms.
Severity of asthma symptoms in the morning.
Limitation of daily activities due to asthma.
Shortness of breath.
Wheeze. The ACQ-5 score was computed as the un-weighted mean of responses to the 5 items, measured on a 7-point scale from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). A lower score indicated a better outcome. If ACQ-5 reached a value of 1.5 or more, the participant was reported as having LOAC. Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline ACQ-5, week and treatment-by-week with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the average of non-missing daily measures/scores over the last 5 days prior to and including the morning of randomization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>LS Mean Asthma Daily Diary Score (Weekly Total) Over 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms during night-time and daytime were recorded by the participant each morning and evening in the Asthma Daily Diary. Symptoms were recorded using a 4-point response scale, which ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 indicated no asthma symptoms. Asthma symptom daytime score (recorded in the evening), night-time score (recorded in the morning), and total score were calculated separately. The daily asthma symptom total score was calculated by taking the sum of the night-time and daytime asthma symptom scores recorded each day, ranging from 0 to 6. A lower symptom score indicated a better outcome. Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline asthma daily diary weekly average, week and treatment-by-week with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the average of non-missing daily measures/scores over the last 5 days prior to and including the morning of randomization.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Events for Time to Moderate Or Severe Exacerbation up to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Moderate exacerbation was defined as a temporary increase in maintenance therapy to prevent a severe event supported by sustained (≥ 2 day) worsening in at least 1 key control metric ie, asthma score, reliever medication use, night time awakening or morning PEF.
Severe exacerbation was defined as a worsening in asthma symptoms and:
Use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days and/or
An unscheduled or emergency room visit due to asthma symptoms requiring systemic corticosteroids and/or
An in-patient hospitalization due to asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids. Time to moderate or severe asthma exacerbation was calculated as start date of first moderate or severe exacerbation - date of randomization + 1. Time to moderate or severe asthma exacerbation was displayed using a Kaplan-Meier plot and the outcome measure is presented as number of participants with events.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Using Reliever Medication up to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The use of SABAs was allowed as rescue medication (reliever bronchodilator) throughout the study. Reliever medication use was captured in the Asthma Daily Diary twice daily (morning and evening), recorded as the number of inhaler puffs. The number of inhalations (puffs) per day was calculated as: number of night inhaler puffs + number of day inhaler puffs. Percentage of participants using reliever medication (SABA) up to Week 52 is presented.</description>

    <measure>LS Mean Pre- and Post-Bronchodilator (BD) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Over 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function was assessed by pre- and post-BD FEV1 which was measured by spirometry. To ensure quality control, all spirometry measurements were reviewed to ensure that they met American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society criteria for acceptability. Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline FEV1 (pre- or post-BD, as applicable), visit and treatment-by-visit with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the last non-missing measurement recorded prior to randomization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>LS Mean Total PEF (Weekly) Over 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Morning and evening PEF measurements were recorded by the participant on a daily basis and then averaged over the week. The weekly average total PEF was calculated by taking the sum of the average of the weekly morning mean and weekly evening mean. Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline PEF, week and treatment-by-week with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the average of non-missing daily measures/scores over the last 5 days prior to and including the morning of randomization.</description>

    <measure>LS Mean Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) (Weekly) Over 52 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO measurements were taken at home by participants every second day. The weekly average FeNO was based on the average of measurements taken at home for a specific week. Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline FeNO, week and treatment-by-week with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the average of non-missing daily measures/scores over the last 5 days prior to and including the morning of randomization.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 16 centers in 4 countries (Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Sweden) between 12 October 2016 and 25 September 2018. Participants with eosinophilic moderate to severe asthma on a maintenance treatment of controller inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) + long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) and no other controller medication were recruited.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study had a screening period (2-4 weeks), a 12-week dosing period and an observation period (up to 40 weeks). A total of 81 participants were randomized in this study to test the hypothesis that AZD1419 provided sustained asthma control in eosinophilic asthma participants after removal of ICS and LABA medication.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>AZD1419</title>
          <description>Participants received AZD1419 for inhalation via nebuliser solution (up to 13 doses). All participants received 4 milligrams (mg) AZD1419 once weekly for 4 doses. The following 9 doses were adapted based on tolerability (severity of flu-like symptoms). Participants were prescribed their usual controller medication (ICS + LABA) in separate inhalers. During the dosing period, controller medications were gradually reduced and discontinued. Treatment was initiated with 6 doses of AZD1419 on top of the participant's controller medication, LABA was then stopped on the evening prior to receiving dose 7, and ICS was gradually tapered down and discontinued during the next 3 weeks before being discontinued in the evening prior to receiving AZD1419 dose 10.</description>

During the dosing period, controller medications were gradually reduced and discontinued. Treatment was initiated with 6 doses of placebo on top of the participant's controller medication, LABA was then stopped on the evening prior to receiving dose 7, and ICS was gradually tapered down and discontinued during the next 3 weeks before being discontinued in the evening prior to receiving placebo dose 10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Events for Time to Loss of Asthma Control (LOAC) up to Week 52 - Cox Regression Analysis</title>
        <description>LOAC was defined as any of the following:
Increase of asthma control questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) to ≥ 1.5.
≥ 30% reduction in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) from baseline on 2 consecutive days.
≥ 6 additional reliever inhalations of short-acting β agonist (SABA) in a 24-hour period relative to baseline on 2 consecutive days.
Exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids as decided by Investigator. Time to LOAC was calculated as start date of first LOAC - date of randomization + 1. Start date of LOAC was latest date that 1 of the 4 criteria were satisfied immediately prior to the exacerbation start date, provided no more than 7 days between LOAC and exacerbation start date. Time to LOAC was displayed using a Kaplan-Meier plot and the outcome measure is presented as number of participants with events. Cox regression analysis was used to compare treatments.</description>

        <description>In the ACQ-5 questionnaire, participants were asked to recall the status of their asthma during the previous week with regards to symptoms. The questionnaire included the items:
Awoken at night by asthma symptoms.
Severity of asthma symptoms in the morning.
Limitation of daily activities due to asthma.
Shortness of breath.
Wheeze. The ACQ-5 score was computed as the un-weighted mean of responses to the 5 items, measured on a 7-point scale from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). A lower score indicated a better outcome. If ACQ-5 reached a value of 1.5 or more, the participant was reported as having LOAC. Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline ACQ-5, week and treatment-by-week with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the average of non-missing daily measures/scores over the last 5 days prior to and including the morning of randomization.</description>

Estimates of the LS mean over 52 weeks were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis with treatment, baseline FeNO, week and treatment-by-week with participant as random effects, and age and gender as covariates. Baseline was the average of non-missing daily measures/scores over the last 5 days prior to and including the morning of randomization.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>The FAS included all randomized participants who received any IP, irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. Only participants with data available for analysis are presented.</population>

            <title>AZD1419</title>
            <description>Participants received AZD1419 for inhalation via nebuliser solution (up to 13 doses). All participants received 4 mg AZD1419 once weekly for 4 doses. The following 9 doses were adapted based on tolerability (severity of flu-like symptoms). Participants were prescribed their usual controller medication (ICS + LABA) in separate inhalers. During the dosing period, controller medications were gradually reduced and discontinued. Treatment was initiated with 6 doses of AZD1419 on top of the participant's controller medication, LABA was then stopped on the evening prior to receiving dose 7, and ICS was gradually tapered down and discontinued during the next 3 weeks before being discontinued in the evening prior to receiving AZD1419 dose 10.</description>

The following 9 doses were adapted based on tolerability (severity of flu-like symptoms). Participants were prescribed their usual controller medication (ICS + LABA) in separate inhalers. During the dosing period, controller medications were gradually reduced and discontinued.
