  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that the efficacy of intravenous
      (IV) itraconazole followed by oral itraconazole is non-inferior to that of intravenous
      caspofungin as empiric therapy for suspected fungal infection participants with fever and
      neutropenia.
