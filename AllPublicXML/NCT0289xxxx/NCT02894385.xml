      Evaluate the potential effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety
      and tolerability of BAY 1841788 (ODM-201).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was closed after Part 1 because additional investigation in volunteers with
      moderate renal impairment in Part 2 was not deemed to be ethically or scientifically
      justified.

                  previous liver biopsy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, or fibroscan.

               -  Patients with mild hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh class A).

             months prior to dosing, congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             grade III or IV.

          -  Subjects with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass
             graft less than 6 months prior to study drug administration.

          -  Strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 28 days
             or 5 drug half-lives (if drug half-life in patients is known), before start of study
             treatment.

          -  Known BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) and OATP (organic anion-transporting
             polypeptide) substrates not specifically mentioned in the protocol within 28 days or 5
             drug half-lives (if drug half-life in patients is known), before start of study
             treatment.

          -  Smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily.
