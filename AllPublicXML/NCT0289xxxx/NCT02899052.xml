    <description>Part 1: Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles while providing information to determine the appropriate doses of venetoclax and carfilzomib (VenKd) to be used in the VenKd combination in approximately 9-18 subjects. The dose levels are Venetoclax 400 mg or 800 mg; Carfilzomib 20/27 mg/m2, 20/70 mg/m2, and/or 20/56 mg/m2; Dexamethasone 40 mg Part 2: Further evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of the VenKd combination selected after completion of Part 1 in approximately 22 - 31 additional subjects. Participants may discontinue Kd but may continue receiving venetoclax once daily (QD) as monotherapy.
Part 3: Further evaluation of the efficacy of the VenKd combination after completion of Part 1 and Part 2 in 60 additional subjects.</description>
