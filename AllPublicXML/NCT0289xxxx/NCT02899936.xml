      The DOLF Triple Drug Therapy for Lymphatic Filariasis study will determine the frequency,
      type and severity of adverse events following triple-drug therapy (IVM+DEC+ALB, IDA) compared
      to the standard two-drug treatment (DEC+ALB, DA) in infected and uninfected individuals in a
      community in 5 different countries. The objective is to acquire safety, efficacy, and
      acceptability data to assess the safety and acceptability of the IDA drug combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Programme to Eliminate
      Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem by
      2020. To interrupt transmission, WHO recommends therapy using combinations of two medicines
      delivered to entire at-risk populations through a strategy known as mass drug administration.
      Ivermectin (IVM) and albendazole (ALB) are administered in areas where onchocerciasis is
      co-endemic; diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (ALB) are administered in areas where
      onchocerciasis is not co-endemic.

      Results of a pilot study in Papua New Guinea suggest that triple drug therapy (ivermectin,
      diethylcarbamazine and albendazole) is superior to the currently recommended two-drug regimen
      (DEC+ALB, DA). A single dose of the triple therapy (IVM+DEC+ALB, IDA) rapidly achieved
      complete clearance of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae from the blood of 12 individuals for
      at least one year post-treatment. All six individuals tested at 24 months were still
      amicrofilaremic, suggesting that the triple therapy might permanently sterilizes adult
      filarial worms. Many people treated in these studies experienced transient systemic adverse
      events commonly associated with diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin treatment of filariasis.
      Adverse events were more frequent after the triple therapy than after the usual combination
      of two drugs. However, no serious adverse events were observed. The dramatic reduction and
      sustained decrease of microfilaria along with the safety profile seen in the Papua New Guinea
      studies suggest that the triple drug therapy may be a useful tool to achieve the goal of
      eliminating lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem by 2020.

      Although the study cited above has clearly demonstrated the superiority of the triple therapy
      for clearing W. bancrofti microfilaria from the blood, more safety and efficacy data are
      needed before triple therapy can be rolled out on a large scale as a mass drug administration
      regimen in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries. WHO recommends a best practice called
      &quot;cohort event monitoring&quot; for demonstrating safety of new drug regimens for public health
      program use. Establishing safety through such methodology requires pre and post treatment
      assessment from at least 10,000 people treated with the triple therapy across multiple
      settings.

      It is therefore proposed to conduct a cohort event monitoring study to acquire safety data.
      Efficacy and acceptability components will also be included in the study. Similar studies
      will be conducted simultaneously in Haiti, India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka
      to reach the 10,000 people necessary to assess the safety of this new drug combination.

      This will be an open label, two-armed study. The two arms are (1) mass drug administration
      (MDA) with the currently used combination of two-drug regimen (DA) and (2) MDA with triple
      drug therapy (IDA).

    <description>To compare the efficacy of IDA vs. DA administered in communities for clearance of MF and filarial antigenemia (Ag) in cohort and effectiveness (prevalence) in community settings. A minimum of 21 (70%) of MF-positive participants in each arm will be retested at 12 months post-treatment for antigenemia and microfilaremia. This sample size is adequate to demonstrate superiority of the IDA regimen (assumptions: 90% reduction in MF prevalence after IDA and 60% reduction after DA, 80% power for detecting an effect size of 30%). The primary endpoint for efficacy will be complete clearance of MF 12 months post Mass Drug Administration (MDA). Clearance of filarial antigenemia at 12 months will be a secondary endpoint for the efficacy analysis. Testing of microfilaria is by analyzing 60 microliter (ul) measured volume thick blood smear by finger prick method and results are either positive or negative for MF presence.</description>

    <description>To assess the presence and intensity of filarial infection on the frequency and severity of adverse events. One year post MDA, all participants who were positive for either microfilaremia or filarial antigenemia during the baseline visit will be tested for filarial antigen using the FTS to assess their response to treatment and to compare the efficacy of the two treatment regimens. Participants with positive FTS will also be tested for nocturnal microfilaremia by blood smear (finger prick - 60ul)</description>

    <measure>Community acceptance will be measured using on a survey using likert scale questions based on perception of efficacy, intent to participate and relevance of the treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Community acceptance will be measured using a survey to community members receiving both the 2-drug and 3-drug treatments during the safety trial. To complement this survey, a series of focus group discussions in the community as well as key informant interviews are proposed with community leaders, health personnel and drug distributors in the same communities to assess perceptions about the 3-drug versus the 2-drug regimen. The community acceptability study will be carried out within one month of the completion of the safety trial. The acceptability score will use a set of likert scale questions based on perception of efficacy, intent to participate and relevance of the treatment. Some of the questions have been inspired by Reimer's Treatment Acceptability Rating form-Revised and general principles of social validity but mostly the questions are not from one particular survey instrument.</description>
