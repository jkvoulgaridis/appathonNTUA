  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 30 million patients require a major surgery annually in the US alone and more than half
      of them are performed in patients over 60 years of age. Post-operative cognitive dysfunction
      (POCD) is a keystone complication of these surgeries and affects up to 40% of surgical
      patients aged over 60 years on discharge from the hospital. Despite controlled longitudinal
      studies have shown that POCD is transient, it is associated with delirium, higher mortality,
      earlier retirement, and greater utilization of social financial assistance The
      pathophysiology of persistent postoperative cognitive dysfunction and causal relationship
      between POCD and delirium remain incompletely understood. Identified clinical risk factors
      for both include advanced age, type of surgery, preexisting cognitive impairment, and drug
      addiction. We and others have provided evidence that the inflammatory response triggered by
      surgical trauma and pain may contribute to the development of delirium and cognitive
      impairment after surgery.

      Ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, is commonly used in anaesthesia and
      postoperative analgesia. By reducing both pain and glutamate excitotoxic effects on neuronal
      and microglial brain cells, it contributes to tone down the neuroinflammatory process
      associated with surgery. A recent body of evidence has shown that ketamine reduces the
      depressive-like behavior induced by inflammatory or stress-induced stimuli in mice. Ketamine
      was also found to reduce levels of inflammatory biomarkers in cardiac surgical patients.

      Orthopaedic surgery is a high-risk situation for developing postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction. In patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, the prevalence of POCD is 26% one
      week after surgery and decreased to 10% at 3 months postoperatively, and a similar prevalence
      is found 12 months after the operation. Postoperative delirium is associated with an
      increased risk of POCD. Hundred thousands of patients &gt; 60 years undergo elective orthopaedic
      procedures per year around the world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design consists in a prospective multicenter randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial
      in elderly patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery.

      Patients will be informed at the pre-anaesthetic consultation, 7 to 30 days before surgery.
      They will be randomized the day before surgery. Cognitive and depressive status at baseline
      will be assessed precisely the day pior to surgery with cognitive tests. Self-administered
      scores will be recorded to evaluate depression, anxiety, and quality of life.

      At the day of surgery, patients in the experimental group will receive a bolus of low
      intravenous dose (sub-anaesthetic) 0.5 mg/kg ketamine following induction of anaesthesia.
      Patients in the control group will receive a bolus of an intravenous normal saline solution
      following induction of anaesthesia.

      From D0 (2 hours after surgery end) to D7 or discharge from the hospital if earlier,
      delirium, pain, adverse clinical and psychiatric events will be measured and recorded.

      Cognitive functions, neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and quality of life will be
      assessed at D7 or discharge from the hospital if earlier and D90.

      Inflammatory markers will be measured before surgery, at D1, D7 or discharge from the
      hospital if earlier and D90.
