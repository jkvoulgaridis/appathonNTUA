    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis during
      cataract surgery between two drugs: epinephrine, which has routinely been used for decades,
      and Omidria, a newly FDA approved combination drug of phenylephrine and ketorolac. Patients
      undergoing cataract surgery that are enrolled in the trial will randomly receive one of the
      drugs in one eye, and the other eye will receive the drug during the subsequent cataract
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract remains a leading cause of correctable blindness worldwide. Over 3.5 million
      cataract surgeries in the United States and 20 million cataract surgeries worldwide are
      performed every year. Cataract surgery is performed by making a small incision, removing the
      cataractous lens, most often through the process of phacoemulsification, and replacement with
      an intraocular lens. Like all surgeries, adequate exposure and field of view is vital for a
      safe and effective surgery. In cataract surgery, the field of view is limited by the diameter
      of the pupil. Several different drugs, such as cyclopentolate, tropicamide, phenylephrine,
      and epinephrine are utilized to maintain dilation (mydriasis) of the pupil during surgery.

      There are currently two prospective randomized controlled trials comparing
      phenylephrine/ketorolac to placebo in the published literature. Both of these studies
      demonstrated that phenylephrine/ketorolac is superior to placebo for the maintenance of
      mydriasis during cataract surgery. Epinephrine has been the standard of care for
      intraoperative mydriasis. Phenylephrine/ketorolac (Omidria) is a newly FDA-approved additive
      for the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis, but there are currently no published studies
      comparing epinephrine to phenylephrine/ketorolac for maintenance of mydriasis during cataract
      surgery.

      While both of these drugs have been shown to be superior to placebo for the maintenance of
      mydriasis, there is a significant cost difference between epinephrine, which has been used
      for many years, and phenylephrine/ketorolac, which gained FDA approval in 2014. One 4 mL vial
      of Omidria® is utilized for one cataract surgery, which costs $465.

      The primary endpoint to be measured in the study is the mean area under the curve change from
      baseline in pupil diameter over time to the end of cataract surgery.

      Secondary endpoints will be maximum intraoperative pupil constriction, subjects with pupil
      diameter less than 6.5 mm at any during surgery, subjects with pupil less than 6.0 mm during
      cortical clean-up, and subjects with greater than 2.5 mm of pupillary constriction at any
      time during surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are older than 18 years of age

          -  Patients who are planned to undergo bilateral cataract surgery

          -  Patients with baseline IOP of 5 - 22 mm Hg

          -  Medicare insurance*

               -  There is a significant cost difference between our two study drugs. Therefore,
                  Medicare insurance is part of our inclusion criteria, because there is a
                  pass-through reimbursement in place to cover the cost of phenylephrine/ketorolac.
                  Other insurances (for example, Aetna Better Health, Highmark Freedom, Gateway)
                  have variable or poor coverage for phenylephrine/ketorolac, which would leave the
                  medical center responsible for the cost. Patients can never be held responsible
                  for the cost of the medication because it is included in &quot;covered services&quot; for
                  cataract surgery billing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are planned to undergo only unilateral cataract surgery

          -  Patients who are planned to undergo cataract surgery and another surgical procedure in
             the same operation (eg. combined cataract and glaucoma surgery)

          -  Patients with concurrent clinically significant disease, connective tissue disease,
             abnormal blood pressure at screening, narrow-angle or unstable glaucoma or treatment
             with prostaglandins, uncontrolled chronic eye disease or active corneal pathology or
             scarring

          -  Patients with history of iritis or trauma with iris damage

          -  Patients with recent eye surgery (non-laser surgery within 3 months or laser surgery
             within 30 days prior to study surgery)

          -  Patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to the study medications

          -  Patients who have used pilocarpine (a pupil constrictor) within 6 months prior to
             surgery
