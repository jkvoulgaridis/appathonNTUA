        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the sinuses
           (primary objective for Japanese participants).

        -  To evaluate ability of dupilumab in reducing proportion of participants who required
           treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS) or surgery for NP.

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on participant reported outcomes and health related
           quality of life.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w up to Week 52.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w up to Week 24 followed by 300 mg every
           4 weeks (q4w) up to Week 52.

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in the subgroups of participants with prior surgery
           and comorbid asthma including non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory
           disease.

        -  To evaluate the safety of dupilumab in participants with bilateral NP.

        -  To evaluate functional dupilumab concentrations (systemic exposure) and incidence of
           treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies.

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 52 in Nasal Polyp Score: Subgroup of Participants With Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. For each nostril, NPS was graded from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. LS mean and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model.</description>

          <description>NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. For each nostril, NPS was graded based on polyp size from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyps) to 8 (large polyps), with higher score representing more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Nasal Congestion/Obstruction Symptom Severity Score</title>
        <description>NC symptom severity was assessed by the participants on a daily basis from visit 1 and throughout the study using an e-diary on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms, with higher scores indicated more severity. Least squares (LS) means and standard error (SE) were obtained from Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model described in Statistical Analysis Overview. All participants randomized to receive Dupilumab had been on 300 mg q2w regimen until Week 24 and analyzed as a pooled population for Week 24 assessments.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Opacification of Sinuses Measured by Lund Mackay (LMK) Score</title>
        <description>The LMK scoring system rated each of both the left and right frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, ostiomeatal complex, anterior ethmoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses using following grading: 0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total opacification. The total score was the sum of scores from each side and ranges from 0 (normal) to 24 (more opacified); higher score indicated more severe disease. LS means and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model described in Statistical Analysis Overview. NOTE: For Japan regulatory submission only, this endpoint is not included as a secondary outcome measure and is instead one of the co-primary outcome measures.

For each nostril, NPS was graded based on polyp size from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI.

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 52 in Total Symptom Score</title>
        <description>The TSS was the sum of participant-assessed nasal symptom scores for NC/obstruction, decreased/loss of sense of smell, and rhinorrhea (anterior/posterior nasal discharge), each accessed on 0-3 categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms). Total score ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). Higher score indicated more severe symptoms. Data was analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline value, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline at Week 52 in Visual Analogue Scale for Rhinosinusitis</title>
          <description>The VAS for rhinosinusitis was used to evaluate the total disease severity. The participants were asked to indicate on a 10 centimeters VAS the answer to the question, &quot;How troublesome are your symptoms of your rhinosinusitis?&quot; The range of the VAS was from 0 (not troublesome) to 10 (worse thinkable troublesome), where higher score indicated worse thinkable troublesome. Data was analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline value, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.</description>

        <description>ACQ-6 had 6 questions which assessed the most common asthma symptoms (woken by asthma, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, puffs/inhalations use). Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale ranged from 0 = no impairment to 6 = maximum impairment. The ACQ-6 score was the mean of the scores of all 6 questions and therefore, ranged from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled), with higher scores indicated lower asthma control. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline value, treatment, asthma status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates.

For each nostril, NPS was graded from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI.

          <title>Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Nasal Polyp Score: Subgroup of Participants With Prior Nasal Polyp Surgery</title>
          <description>NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. For each nostril, NPS was graded from 0 to 4 (0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps. Total NPS was the sum of right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 (no polyp) to 8 (large polyp), with highest score representing more severe disease. NPS was assessed by centralized, blinded, independent review of the nasal endoscopy video recordings. Data were analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. LS mean and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model. All participants randomized to receive Dupilumab had been on 300 mg q2w regimen until Week 24 and analyzed as a pooled population for Week 24 assessments.</description>

        <description>The LMK scoring system rated each of both the left and right frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, ostiomeatal complex, anterior ethmoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses using following grading: 0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total opacification. The total score was the sum of scores from each side and ranges from 0 (normal) to 24 (more opacified); higher score indicated more severe disease. Data was analyzed using a hybrid method of the WOCF and MI. The imputed completed data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with corresponding baseline value, treatment group, asthma/NSAID-ERD status, prior surgery history, and regions as covariates. All participants randomized to receive Dupilumab had been on 300 mg q2w regimen until Week 24 and analyzed as a pooled population for Week 24 assessments.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and TEAEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study treatment. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened in grade or became serious during TEAE period which was defined as the period from the time of first dose of drug until 84 days following the last administration of drug. SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a medically important event.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D was a standardized HRQoL questionnaire consisting of EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension had 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. EQ VAS recorded the participant's self-rated health on a vertical VAS that allowed them to indicate their health state that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). All participants randomized to receive Dupilumab had been on 300 mg q2w regimen until Week 24 and analyzed as a pooled population for Week 24 assessments.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on ADA population which included participants who received at least 1 dose of IMP with at least one evaluable ADA serum sample that was assayed successfully in the ADA assay (either ‘ADA negative’ or ‘ADA positive’) following the first dose of the study medication.</population>
