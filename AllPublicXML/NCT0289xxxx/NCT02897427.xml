    <textblock>
      This trial studies the screening of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal and
      uncommon cancers. Learning the relationship between HPV and cancer risk in men who test
      positive for HPV antibodies may help doctors to develop early methods of screening for
      certain types of cancer, and screening for HPV may help doctors to learn which patients may
      be at a higher risk for developing certain types of cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the cumulative 5-year incidence rate of HPV-related malignancies,
      oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancer, in men aged 50-64 who test serologically positive for
      antibodies to HPV 16 E antigens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association of persistent oral HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
      subsequent diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer.

      II. To estimate the prevalence of serological antibodies to HPV E antigens in men aged 50-64.

      III. To investigate behavioral risk factors for HPV-related malignancies in men.

      IV. To compare the incidence rates of HPV-related malignancies, oropharyngeal, anal, and
      penile cancer, between the matched HPV serologically positive and negative men.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the performance of serological testing of HPV, when used for screening men for
      HPV-related malignancies.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of narrow band imaging to diagnose
      oropharyngeal cancer.

      III. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of transcervical ultrasonography of the neck
      lymph nodes and oropharynx for early diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer.

      IV. To evaluate the performance of anoscopy and HPV/cytology testing of anal swab (anal
      Papanicolaou [Pap]) to diagnose anal cancer.

      V. To determine the feasibility of nucleic acid-based techniques (circulating HPV16 DNA
      [cvDNA] in serum as well as oral HPV16 DNA and integrated HPV16 DNA in oral rinse and swabs)
      to refine high-risk group selection for screening and to facilitate oropharyngeal
      localization of cancers and pre-cancers within a group undergoing screening.

      VI. To evaluate T cell response to E2, E6, and E7 antigens as a diagnostic biomarker for
      HPV-related cancer.

      VII. To evaluate the association between oral HPV16 infection and the oral microbiota as well
      as factors that modify any such association.

      OUTLINE:

      STAGE I: Participants undergo collection of blood and oral gargle samples.

      STAGE II: Participants complete a head and neck exam by using brushing of the oropharyngeal
      mucosa, a thorough oropharyngeal exam including narrow band imaging, undergo collection of
      oral gargle sample, transcervical ultrasonography of the neck lymph nodes and oropharynx,
      anoscopy, and complete Papanicolaou/HPV testing. Participants undergo repeat oropharyngeal
      screening, oral HPV DNA test, oral HPV integration testing, and ultrasound once every 6
      months for 5 years. Participants also undergo collection of blood.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer detection rate of the seropositive group</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will use the proportion equality test to compare the cancer detection rate of the seropositive group using the screening strategy with the historical rate of 0.08 (4/50). To evaluate the performance of the new techniques for early detection, will test whether the proportion of patients diagnosed at stage I, II, or III from the screening strategy is larger than the historical rate of 17.7% using the proportion equality test. Will further compute and compare the pre-cancer detection rates with the historical information.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of serum antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E antigens</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will calculate the prevalence of serum antibodies to HPV16 E antigens along with 95% confidence intervals. Will use descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic and sexual behavior characteristics of study participants overall and by HPV16 E antibody status (positive, negative). Logistic regression models will be used to determine the association between serostatus or oral HPV infection status and demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors.</description>
