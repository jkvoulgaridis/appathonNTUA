    <textblock>
      In this study positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate
      evaluation of estrogen receptor heterogeneity and functionality in Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension (PAH) using the investigational radiotracer [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES).

      This is a feasibility study of serial FES scanning in female patients with Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension (PAH) to determine whether patients have detectable changes in FES SUV following
      treatment with fulvestrant on the separate therapeutic protocol IRB# 824861 &quot;Estrogen
      Receptor Antagonist in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (ERA PAH)&quot;. Subjects
      will undergo up to 2 [18F]FES PET/CT scans for this protocol. A baseline FES PET/CT will
      occur on Day 0 (-2 days) of the companion treatment trial prior to initiation of fulvestrant.
      The second FES PET/CT scan will occur on week 9 (63 ± 7 days) after initiation of
      fulvestrant. We will compare SUV values after fulvestrant to pre-treatment values.
