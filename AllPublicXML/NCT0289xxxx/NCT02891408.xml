  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      firsocostat in adults with normal hepatic function, and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic
      impairment and to evaluate the single-dose PK of fenofibrate in subjects with normal hepatic
      function and mild hepatic impairment.
