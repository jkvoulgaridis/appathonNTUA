    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to better understand Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) in
      adolescent transplant recipients and their parent/guardian and to see if PTSS play a role in
      the way adolescent transplant recipients take their prescribed medicine.

      Target population: medically stable adolescent solid organ (e.g., heart, kidney, liver, lung,
      small bowel) transplant recipients and their parent(s)/guardian.
