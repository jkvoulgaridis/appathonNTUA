    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status (utility). The 5 items in the EQ-5D-3L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 3 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating some/moderate problems, 3: indicating extreme problems). A single preference-weighted health utility index score was calculated by applying country-specific weights, with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health).</description>

        <description>ASDAS is a composite disease activity outcome measure which combines patient reported back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global assessment of disease activity, patient assessment of peripheral joint pain and swelling and an acute phase reactant (C-reactive protein [CRP] or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) as an objective measure of inflammation. The overall score ranges from 0 with no defined upper score; published ranges for disease activity states as defined by the ASDAS are: &lt; 1.3 for &quot;inactive disease&quot;; ≥ 1.3 to &lt; 2.1 for &quot;moderate disease activity&quot;; ≥ 2.1 to ≤ 3.5 for &quot;high disease activity&quot; and &gt; 3.5 for &quot;very high disease activity.&quot; The percentage of participants with ASDAS inactive disease (defined as ASDAS &lt; 1.3) calculated using CRP is reported.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status (utility). The 5 items in the EQ-5D-3L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 3 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating some/moderate problems, 3: indicating extreme problems). A single preference-weighted health utility index score was calculated by applying country-specific weights, with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status (utility). The 5 items in the EQ-5D-3L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 3 levels of severity (1: indicating no problem, 2: indicating some/moderate problems, 3: indicating extreme problems). A single preference-weighted health utility index score was calculated by applying country-specific weights, with scores ranging from approximately 0 (death) to 1 (full health).</description>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) axSpA is an axSpA specific questionnaire consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), overall work impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health. WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - Axial Spondyloarthritis (WPAI-axSpA): Total Activity Impairment</title>
        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) axSpA is an axSpA specific questionnaire consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), overall work impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health. WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The ASAS HI measures functioning and health across 17 aspects of health in patients with AS, including pain, emotional functions, sleep, sexual function, mobility, self care, and community life. The ASAS HI consists of 17 questions, each answered by the participant as agree (1) or disagree (0). The responses to the 17 dichotomous items are summed up to give a total score ranging from 0 to 17, with a lower score indicating a better and a higher score indicating an inferior health status.</description>

        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) assesses disease activity by asking the participant to answer 6 questions (each on a 10 point numeric rating scale [NRS]) pertaining to symptoms experienced for the past week. For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</title>
        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a validated index to determine the degree of functional limitation in patients with AS. BASFI consists of 10 questions assessing participants' ability to perform activities, on a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (easy to perform an activity) to 10 (impossible to perform an activity). The overall score is the mean of the 10 items and ranges from 0 (best) to 10 (worst).</description>

        <description>ASDAS is a composite disease activity outcome measure which combines patient reported back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global assessment of disease activity, patient assessment of peripheral joint pain and swelling and an acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR) as an objective measure of inflammation. The overall score ranges from 0 with no defined upper score; published ranges for disease activity states as defined by the ASDAS are: &lt; 1.3 for &quot;inactive disease&quot;; ≥ 1.3 to &lt; 2.1 for &quot;moderate disease activity&quot;; ≥ 2.1 to ≤ 3.5 for &quot;high disease activity&quot; and &gt; 3.5 for &quot;very high disease activity.&quot; The percentage of participants with very high disease activity (defined as an ASDAS &gt; 3.5) calculated using CRP is reported</description>

        <description>ASAS partial remission is defined as an absolute score of ≤ 2 units on a 0 to 10 scale for each of the four following domains:
Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity, measured on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 (none) to 10 (severe);
Pain, measured by the total back pain NRS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe);
Function, measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) which consists of 10 items assessing participants' ability to perform activities on an NRS ranging from 0 (easy) to 10 (impossible);
Inflammation, measured by the mean of the 2 morning stiffness-related Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) NRS scores (items 5 [level of stiffness] and 6 [duration of stiffness]) each on a scale from 0 (none/0 hours) to 10 (very severe/2 hours or more duration).</description>

If ASDAS was ≥ 2.1 after 4 weeks of NSAID 2, participants were switched to receive a combination of NSAID and adalimumab 40 mg every other week for up to 48 weeks.</description>
