  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a
      single intranasal dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
      vaccine in RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.

      This study was a companion study to CIR 312.

    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSV LID cp ΔM2-2, a
      recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, in RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV LID cp ΔM2-2 vaccine
      or placebo at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants were enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 14 (outside of RSV
      season) and remained on study until they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1
      and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration
      was between 6 and 10 months, depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants
      attended several study visits throughout the study, which may include physical examinations,
      blood collection, and nasal washes. Participants' parents or guardians were contacted by
      study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.

      The study was closed to accrual early after interim data were reviewed by a subset of
      protocol team members and it was concluded that this vaccine candidate will not meet the
      criteria listed in the protocol for a good vaccine candidate. This recommendation was shared
      with the (blinded) protocol chair and the Medical Officers, as well as the Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board (DSMB), who agreed with the unblinded protocol team members' assessment. The
      targeted sample size was 33 (22 in the vaccine arm and 11 in the placebo arm). Participants
      already on study at the time of the early closing decision remained on study and completed
      the follow-up per protocol.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited adverse events include fever; otitis media; upper respiratory illness (URI); lower respiratory illness (LRI) and cough (without LRI). The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each solicited AE category, and that is in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. These events were graded (Grade 1-mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) following protocol-defined grading system outlined in Table 3 and Table 4 in the protocol document.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unsolicited AEs by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited adverse events were other events, not included in the solicited AEs. The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each unsolicited AE category, and that is in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. AE grading (Grade 1- mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) was done by DAIDS AE Grading table v2.0 (see References).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE, whether considered related to the study product or not, that:
Results in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance
Is life threatening: defined as an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death were it more severe
Requires inpatient hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization): defined as at least an overnight stay in the hospital or emergency ward for treatment that would have been inappropriate if administered in the outpatient setting
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE, whether considered related to the study product or not, that:
Results in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance
Is life threatening: defined as an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death were it more severe
Requires inpatient hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization): defined as at least an overnight stay in the hospital or emergency ward for treatment that would have been inappropriate if administered in the outpatient setting
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
