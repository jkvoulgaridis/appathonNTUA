      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels
      after 8 weeks of treatment in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) participants
      aged of 8 to 17 years, with LDL-C &gt;=130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.37 millimoles per
      litre [mmol/L]) on optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy +/- other lipid modifying
      therapies (LMTs) or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins for at
      least 4 weeks prior to the screening period.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of alirocumab.

        -  To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters.

    <textblock>
      For Cohorts 1 to 3, a study duration of approximately 16-23 weeks (screening period: up to 6
      (+1) weeks, open-label dose finding treatment period: 8 weeks, follow up period: 6-8 weeks).

      For Cohort 4, a study duration of approximately 14-19 weeks (screening period up to 6 [+1]
      weeks, open-label dose finding treatment period: 12 weeks).

      Optional extension period: up to a maximum of 2 years for the first participants enrolled in
      Cohorts 1 to 3, but a maximum of approximately 5 months for the first participants enrolled
      in Cohort 4.

      For all participants who declined participation in the phase 3 study, their last alirocumab
      injection was on December 2018.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Calculated Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in calculated LDL-C was defined as 100*(calculated LDL-C value at Week 8 - calculated LDL-C value at baseline)/calculated LDL-C value at baseline. All available baseline and post-baseline calculated LDL-C value during the OLDFI efficacy treatment period &amp; within one of the analysis windows up to Week 8 were used in the model. OLDFI efficacy treatment period was defined as the period from first investigational medicinal product (IMP) injection to last OLDFI IMP injection + 21 days(for Cohorts 1 &amp; 2) or +35 days (for Cohorts 3 &amp; 4). Adjusted Least-squares (LS) mean &amp; standard error (SE) at Week 8 were obtained from mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, with fixed categorical effects of alirocumab dose/dose regimen (30 mg Q2W [&lt;50 kg], 40 mg Q2W [&lt;50 kg], 50 mg Q2W [&gt;=50 kg], 75 mg Q2W [&gt;=50 kg], 75 mg Q4W [&lt;50 kg],150 mg Q4W [&gt;=50 kg], 150 mg Q4W [&lt;50 kg] and 300 mg Q4W ([&gt;=50 kg] dose), time point &amp; dose/dose regimen-by-time point interaction.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Calculated Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) at Week 8</title>
        <description>Percent change in calculated LDL-C was defined as 100*(calculated LDL-C value at Week 8 - calculated LDL-C value at baseline)/calculated LDL-C value at baseline. All available baseline and post-baseline calculated LDL-C value during the OLDFI efficacy treatment period &amp; within one of the analysis windows up to Week 8 were used in the model. OLDFI efficacy treatment period was defined as the period from first investigational medicinal product (IMP) injection to last OLDFI IMP injection + 21 days(for Cohorts 1 &amp; 2) or +35 days (for Cohorts 3 &amp; 4). Adjusted Least-squares (LS) mean &amp; standard error (SE) at Week 8 were obtained from mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, with fixed categorical effects of alirocumab dose/dose regimen (30 mg Q2W [&lt;50 kg], 40 mg Q2W [&lt;50 kg], 50 mg Q2W [&gt;=50 kg], 75 mg Q2W [&gt;=50 kg], 75 mg Q4W [&lt;50 kg],150 mg Q4W [&gt;=50 kg], 150 mg Q4W [&lt;50 kg] and 300 mg Q4W ([&gt;=50 kg] dose), time point &amp; dose/dose regimen-by-time point interaction.</description>

        <description>Combined estimate for percentage of participants was obtained by averaging out all the imputed percentage of participants reaching the level of interest. A two-step multiple imputation procedure was used to address missing values in the mITT population in the two steps respectively; with number of imputations = 1000. In the first step, the monotone missing pattern was induced in the multiply-imputed data. In the second step, the missing data at subsequent visits were imputed using the regression method for continuous variables.</description>

          <description>Combined estimate for percentage of participants was obtained by averaging out all the imputed percentage of participants reaching the level of interest. A two-step multiple imputation procedure was used to address missing values in the mITT population in the two steps respectively; with number of imputations = 1000. In the first step, the monotone missing pattern was induced in the multiply-imputed data.

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lipoprotein(a) at Week 8</title>
        <description>Combined estimates and SE were obtained by combining adjusted means and SE from robust regression model analyses of the different imputed data sets. The robust regression models included the fixed categorical effect of alirocumab dose/dose regimen. A two-step multiple imputation procedure was used to address missing values in the mITT population in the two steps respectively (with number of imputations = 1000). In the first step, the monotone missing pattern was induced in the multiply-imputed data. In the second step, the missing data at subsequent visits were imputed using the regression method for continuous variables.</description>

In the second step, the missing data at subsequent visits were imputed using the regression method for continuous variables.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Lipoprotein(a) at Week 8</title>
        <description>Combined estimates and SE were obtained by combining adjusted means and SE from robust regression model analyses of the different imputed data sets. The robust regression models included the fixed categorical effect of alirocumab dose/dose regimen. A two-step multiple imputation procedure was used to address missing values in the mITT population (in the two steps respectively; with number of imputations = 1000). In the first step, the monotone missing pattern was induced in the multiply-imputed data. In the second step, the missing data at subsequent visits were imputed using the regression method for continuous variables.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Fasting Triglyceride at Week 8</title>
        <description>Combined estimates and SE were obtained by combining adjusted means and SE from robust regression model analyses of the different imputed data sets. The robust regression models included the fixed categorical effect of alirocumab dose/dose regimen. A two-step multiple imputation procedure was used to address missing values in the mITT population (in the two steps respectively; with number of imputations = 1000). In the first step, the monotone missing pattern was induced in the multiply-imputed data. In the second step, the missing data at subsequent visits were imputed using the regression method for continuous variables.</description>
