  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is associated with an extremely poor prognosis, reflected by a 5-y survival
      probability of less than 5% when all stages are combined. At present, only approximately
      10%-20% of patients are considered candidates for curative resection. The majority of
      patients (50%-60%) are present with metastatic disease, and substantial number of patients
      (approximately 30%-40%) are considered ''locally advanced'' at the time of diagnosis.

      Replication-competent Adenovirus-mediated Double Suicide Gene Therapy
      (Theragene®,Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP) showed an anti-cancer effect in patients with prostatic
      cancer in phase I study. From the experience of prostatic cancer, the safety of combination
      with standard chemotherapy with Theragene treatment is assessed in this study.
