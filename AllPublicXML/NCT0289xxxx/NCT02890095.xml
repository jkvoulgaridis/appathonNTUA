  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to certain classes of chemical contaminants, including certain persistent organic
      pollutants (POPs) with a character of endocrine disruptors, could be one of the factors that
      lead to increase incidence of breast cancer in the Western world .

      However, the causal role of POPs in the onset of breast cancer remains nowadays unproven.
      Preliminary epidemiological studies on the impact of these environmental factors in breast
      cancer etiology have ignored the critical periods of exposure. Similarly, they have
      considered a limited number of pollutants (not including possible joint or synergistic
      effects between individual compounds) and did not distinguish the different breast cancer
      subtypes may have different etiologies or even of genetic susceptibility factors (POP
      polymorphism of detoxification enzymes).

      Thus, POPCASE study examines the association between the presence of breast cancer and the
      levels and exposure profiles to a group of POPs measured in adipose tissue (AT) and blood, in
      particular using spectrometric methods developed by the team LABERCA (Nantes, France). These
      internal levels of POPs (organochlorine pesticides, dioxins, PCBs, brominated flame
      retardants) will be measured both quantitatively (tissue concentrations) and qualitative
      (relative proportions of different pollutants sought).

      subtypes may have different etiologies or even of genetic susceptibility factors (POP
      polymorphism of detoxification enzymes).

      Finally, this demonstration has not been done for 2 reasons:

        -  Multidisciplinary Issues,

        -  Need innovative tools for statistical analysis and interpretation of these more
           integrated environmental data.

      Thus, POPCASE study examines the association between the presence of breast cancer and the
      levels and exposure profiles to a group of POPs measured in adipose tissue (AT) and blood, in
      particular using spectrometric methods developed by the team LABERCA (Nantes, France). These
      internal levels of POPs (organochlorine pesticides, dioxins, PCBs, brominated flame
      retardants) will be measured both quantitatively (tissue concentrations) and qualitative
      (relative proportions of different pollutants sought).

      It is therefore to improve the level of knowledge between environmental chemical exposure and
      increased incidence of breast cancer (in its environmental, genetic and molecular components)
      within the general population, in response to a public health issue, the question of the
      actual impact on the health of major classes of chemical pollutants present in our
      environment and our staying power behind debates and being associated with high stakes, both
      scientists but economic and societal.

    <description>The main objective is to establish a correlation between the individual risk of breast cancer and persistent chemical contaminants (POPs) respectively measured in adipose tissue (i.e. storage compartment) and blood (i.e. circulating compartment).
=&gt; Comparison of the assay in the body of a set of chemical pollutants in the environment between the following two groups:
Group A: women receiving breast cancer surgery,
Group B: women receiving breast surgery for the purpose of plastic surgery (control) This contamination profile is &quot;exposure of interest&quot; in this study. The quantification of this exposure is based on a targeted measure, by mass spectrometry, an expanded set of representative substances of the main families of lipophilic POPs (pesticides, PCBs, dioxins and polybrominated compounds) present to trace (femtomol).</description>

    <description>First, 2 specific adipose tissue samples will be performed during the surgery :
1 sample near the tumor, to measure the contaminants (dioxins, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, polybrominated compounds)
1 remote sample of the tumor bed, superficial, at least 5 cm from the tumor, to be used to determine the level of expression of hormone receptors and to establish the expression profiles, after cutting and inclusion in paraffin blocks for marking IHC.
These withdrawals are made during surgery, during surgery, as part of the intervention and the remodeling of the mammary gland (standard care for patients). This is unused balance for diagnostic.

to determine the level of expression of hormone receptors and to establish the expression profiles, after cutting and inclusion in paraffin blocks for marking IHC. These samples are all made during surgery, for usual care surgery these patients.
