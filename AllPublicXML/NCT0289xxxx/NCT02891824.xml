      This is a phase III, randomized, double-blinded, comparative, multi-centre study to assess
      the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
      administered concurrent to chemotherapy and in maintenance, in patients presenting epithelial
      ovarian cancer (including patients with primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube
      adenocarcinoma) who have platinum-sensitive relapse (platinum-free interval &gt; 6 months).
