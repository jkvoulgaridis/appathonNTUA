    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab when given together
      with decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia
      that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment
      (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ipilimumab and decitabine may work better in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients who are post
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT).

      II. To determine the MTD or RP2D of combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or
      refractory MDS or relapsed or refractory AML in patients who are transplant naive.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate
      (ORR) including complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery
      (CRi) for AML following 2003 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria.

      III. To determine the ORR including CR, partial remission, marrow CR, hematologic improvement
      for MDS using 2006 IWG criteria.

      IV. To determine the overall survival and progression free survival at 1 year. V. To
      determine the duration of remission. VI. To capture the incidence and severity of acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the post allo-HCT cohort.

      VII. To capture the incidence and severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the
      post allo-HCT cohort.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) prior to treatment and during treatment.

      II. To evaluate the genome for evidence of clonal evolution among longitudinal samples (prior
      to treatment, during treatment, and at relapse if relevant) from individual patients.

      III. To evaluate the histopathologic findings of immune response using immunohistochemistry.

      IV. To determine the immune response in the AML tumor microenvironment by using flow
      cytometry and single cell mass cytometry to evaluate T cell subsets.

                  expansion cohorts

          -  Prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy is allowed, however this study excludes
             patients with progression or relapse that occur while receiving HMA-based therapy
             within 12 weeks prior to treatment start on study; disease progression is defined as
             either: (1) patients with prior MDS who progress to AML (defined by the presence of &gt;=

             study requirements; any other prior or ongoing condition, in the opinion of the
             investigator, that could adversely affect the safety of the patient or impair the
             assessment of study results; as patients with AML and MDS are prone to infections, if
             patients are actively being treated with appropriate antibiotics or antifungal therapy
             with clinical evidence of infection control, then they will be considered eligible for
             study

             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus
             erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]); CNS or motor
             neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and
             myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis); patients with a history of autoimmune disease
             (specifically including: diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) who are
             asymptomatic, do not require immune suppression or steroids, and do not have
             threatened vital organ function from these conditions may be considered after
             discussion with the principal investigator (PI)

             treatment start with the exception of currently treated basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or breast

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should be excluded
             because of potential effects on immune function and/or drug interactions; however, if
             a patient has HBV history with an undetectable HBV load by polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR), no liver-related complications, and is on definitive HBV therapy, then he/she
             would be eligible for study

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; patients with a history
             of HCV infection who received definitive therapy and has an undetectable viral load by
             PCR would be eligible

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             ipilimumab; these potential risks may also apply to decitabine
