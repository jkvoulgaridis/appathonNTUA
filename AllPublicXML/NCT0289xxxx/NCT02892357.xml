      suffer from non-erosive reflux disease and then divide them into two groups:treatment group
      and control group.Treatment group take Jianpi Qinghua granule and half-dose omeprazole for 4
      weeks,control group take a normal dose of omeprazole for 4 weeks.Finally we investigate the
      safety of Jianpi Qinghua granule combined with half-dose omeprazole in treatment of
      non-erosive reflux disease(NERD),and contrast the efficacy of Jianpi Qinghua granule with
      omeprazole.

    <measure>Change of GERD Q Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>GerdQ was developed through the integration of validated questionnaires reflecting psychological problems and the data of diagnoses of GERD in primary and secondary medical institutions. GerdQ is used for the diagnosis and management of GERD with good authenticity and reliability. GerdQ has six items: heartburn, regurgitation, abdominal pain, nausea, sleep disorders and use of OTC medications. The score is evaluated according to the frequency of every item occurred in recent one week. 0 day, 1 day, 2-3 days, 4-7days respectively assessed to the score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 in the items of heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disorders and use of OTC medications. 0 day, 1 day, 2-3 days, 4-7days respectively assessed to the score of 3, 2, 1 and 0 in the items of abdominal pain and nausea.</description>

    <measure>Change of TCM Syndrome Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is based on the Clinical Guideline of New Drugs for Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is uesd to evaluate the discomfort of gastrointestinal system based on TCM theory. It contains 15 items of TCM terminology which used to assess severity of physical discomfort (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). The main concerns of these items include stomach distension, stomachache, appetite decrease, heartburn, acid regurgitation, sputum increase, feeling of obstruction in pharynx, feeling thirsty but not want water, feeling of distention on both sides of the lower abdomen, limbs weakness, short of breath, feeling weak and unwilling to speak, somatosensory heaviness, feeling afraid of the cold and having loose stool.</description>

    <measure>Change of Patients Report Clinical Outcomes(PRO)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PRO was developed by the digestive department of Xiyuan hospital. Considering the clinical characteristics of patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases in China, we have spended two years to collect measurement indicators, screen and optimizing items, implement pre-survey of small samples and field survey, and finally formulated this current PRO. It contains 35 items in six dimensions (regurgitation, dyspepsia, physical status, ability to life, defecation situation and mental state). Our analysis of 274 questionnaires show that the PRO has good reliability and validity in reflecting the situation of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Every item in PRO has five levels of discomfort(never, occasionally, sometimes, often, always) and they respectively represent the score of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.</description>
