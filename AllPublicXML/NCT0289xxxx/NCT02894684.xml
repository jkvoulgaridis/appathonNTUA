  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the role of AZLI in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations of
      CF. For consecutive exacerbations patients will receive AZLI + IV Colistin, or two IV
      anti-pseudomonals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZLI, marketed as Cayston, is an inhaled beta-lactam antibiotic. It has a license for the
      chronic suppression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Current standard practice dictates the
      use of two IV antipseudomonal antibiotics for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations.
      The increasing survival, and hence population, in CF means that newer antimicrobial
      strategies are required in order to manage antimicrobial resistance, minimise adverse
      systemic effects of heavy antimicrobial exposure and also make effective use of resources.
      Inhaled antibiotics are commonly used in the chronic suppression of PA yet their use has not
      been thoroughly investigated in acute pulmonary exacerbation. Inhaled antibiotics deliver
      their drugs directly to the target-site with minimal systemic absorbance, making them an
      attractive candidate for treatment of acute exacerbations.

      Recently, it has become apparent that the bacterial community is much more complex than
      initially thought. The microbiome, a term used to describe the polymicrobial community in the
      lungs, has become apparent due to the use of modern culture-independent methods to detect
      bacteria. The microbiome changes in composition and structure around the time of
      exacerbations and in response to treatment, although these changes have not been
      prospectively characterised.

      We have designed an open-label randomised, controlled cross-over trial to investigate the
      clinical effectiveness of of AZLI in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation, whilst
      simultaneously comparing the effect inhaled and intravenous antibiotics have on the
      microbiome.
