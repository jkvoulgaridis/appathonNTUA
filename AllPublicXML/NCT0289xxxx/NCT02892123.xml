  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, 3-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and
      effectiveness of ZW25 by itself and combined with selected chemotherapy agents in patients
      with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 (HER2)-expressing cancers. This study will also the evaluate the way the body absorbs,
      distributes, and eliminates ZW25 (pharmacokinetics or PK).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will evaluate increasing doses of ZW25 to find the highest dose of ZW25
      that does not cause unacceptable side effects (maximum-tolerated dose or MTD), the lowest
      safe dose with the highest rate of effectiveness (optimal biological dose or OBD), and/or
      other recommended dosages (RDs) of ZW25 in up to 7 dose-specific cohorts. Eligible patients
      include those with selected HER2-expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic
      cancers that have progressed after receipt of all therapies known to confer clinical benefit
      (or ineligible to receive therapy).

      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ZW25 in
      patients with selected HER2-expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic
      cancers that have progressed after receipt of all therapies known to confer clinical benefit
      (or ineligible to receive therapy) in up to 5 separate disease-specific cohorts.

      Part 3 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ZW25 combined
      with selected chemotherapy agents, including paclitaxel, capecitabine, or vinorelbine.
      Patients with selected HER2-expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic
      cancers that have progressed after at least 1 and no more than 3 prior systemic chemotherapy
      regimens will be evaluated in this part of the study.
