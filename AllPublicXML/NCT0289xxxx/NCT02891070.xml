    <measure>Number of Participants With No CSF Leak During and After Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Intra-operative) to Day 30 (+/-3 days) post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who have no intra-operative CSF leak from dural repair after up to two applications during Valsalva maneuver (25 cm H2O for up to 5 - 10 seconds), or post-operative CSF leak within 30 (+3) days post-operatively. The Valsalva maneuver was performed by the anaesthesiologist to increase the intra-thoracic pressure (e.g., by increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure or by giving a large tidal volume and holding the inflating pressure) to approximately 25 cm H2O, constantly for up to 5 - 10 seconds to transiently elevate the intracranial pressure and test for any CSF leaks. The suture line was to be watertight after up to two product/control applications and Valsalva maneuvers.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With CSF Leaks Within 30 (+3) Days Post-operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Intra-operative) to Day 30 (+/-3 days) post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebrospinal fluid leak was defined as any overt flow, seepage, weeping, or sweating of CSF through the dura suture line, regardless of volume. All post-operative CSF leaks were primarily diagnosed based on a detailed history and physical examination, including neurological examination. Although not standard of care post-operatively, imaging tests such as computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were considered if there was a high clinical suspicion of a CSF leak.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing craniotomy/craniectomy for pathological processes in the PF or ST
             region

          2. Patients must be willing and able to participate in the study and provide written IC
             before any protocol specific assessment is performed

          3. Patients must be willing to receive peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must present with a negative serum pregnancy
             test, and must agree to employ adequate birth control measures [restricted to
             abstinence, barrier contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive devices or licensed
             hormonal products] for the duration of their participation in the study

          5. Patients are willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a dural lesion from a recent surgery that still has the potential for
             CSF leakage

          2. Patients who had undergone chemotherapy treatment, excluding hormonal therapy, within
             3 weeks prior to the planned procedure, or with chemotherapy scheduled within 7 days
             following surgery

             procedure

The Valsalva maneuver was performed by the anaesthesiologist to increase the intra-thoracic pressure (e.g., by increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure or by giving a large tidal volume and holding the inflating pressure) to approximately 25 cm H2O, constantly for up to 5 - 10 seconds to transiently elevate the intracranial pressure and test for any CSF leaks. The suture line was to be watertight after up to two product/control applications and Valsalva maneuvers.</description>

        <description>Cerebrospinal fluid leak was defined as any overt flow, seepage, weeping, or sweating of CSF through the dura suture line, regardless of volume. All post-operative CSF leaks were primarily diagnosed based on a detailed history and physical examination, including neurological examination. Although not standard of care post-operatively, imaging tests such as computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were considered if there was a high clinical suspicion of a CSF leak.</description>
