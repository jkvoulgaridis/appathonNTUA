    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN(R)-Filo and
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects
      aged 18 - 45 years. The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics,
      lipidomics, metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, and plasmablast
      responses to MVA-BN(R)-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study
      are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses
      to the study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by
      transcriptomics. 3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study
      group to filovirus antigens.

      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN(R)-Filo and
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects
      aged 18 - 45 years. The two heterologous prime-boost groups will also receive MVA-BN(R)-Filo
      at day 366. Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of four study groups (15 per
      group). Subjects and study staff will be blinded to a subject's study vaccine assignment
      within study vaccination schedule (e.g., enrollment into Group 1 or 4 versus 2 or 3 will be
      known). The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics,
      metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, and plasmablast responses to
      MVA-BN(R)-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to the study
      vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by transcriptomics. 3) To
      assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study group to filovirus
      antigens. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess antigen-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI)
      responses to the study vaccination by study group. 2) To assess antibody-dependent
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses to the study vaccination by study group.

                            should be reviewed with potential subjects for receipt of
                            vaccinia-based vaccine. The presence of a typical vaccinia scar should
                            be considered exclusionary.

                            the 3 days prior to Day 1.* *Note: Potential subjects can be
                            rescheduled due to acute illness within the 28 day window between
                            screening and enrollment. If acute illness prevents administration of
                            vaccine within the 28 day screening window, the potential subject can
                            be enrolled once the acute illness resolves after repeating safety
                            laboratories and if the subject is otherwise eligible. The ECG does not
                            need to be repeated as it is not a safety laboratory and unlikely to
                            change without clinical event in this age group of volunteers.

                        10. Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become
                            pregnant while enrolled in the study or within 3 months after the last
                            boost vaccination.

                        11. A history of bleeding or clotting disorders.

                        12. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition* that, in
                            the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation.

                              -  E.g., history of seizure disorders, autoimmune disease,
                                 immunodeficiency, any spleen disease, active malignancy, active
                                 tuberculosis, asthma, or other systemic infections.

                        13. History of malignancy other than squamous cell or basal cell skin
                            cancer*, unless there has been surgical excision that is considered to
                            have achieved cure.

                              -  Note: Subjects with a history of skin cancer must not be
                                 vaccinated at the previous tumor site.

                        14. Prior organ and/or stem cell transplant.

                            medication, treatment, or clinical follow-up.

                        17. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with clinically significant findings,* or
                            features that would interfere with the assessment of

                  interval &gt; / = 210 ms, any second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, or
                  prolongation of the QT interval corrected according to Bazett's formula [QTcB] [&gt;
                  450 ms]) b. Significant repolarization (ST-segment or T-wave) abnormality. c.
                  Significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmia; frequent atrial or ventricular
                  ectopy (e.g., frequent premature atrial contractions, 2 premature ventricular
                  contractions in a row).

                  d. ST-elevation consistent with ischemia or evidence of past or evolving
                  myocardial infarction.

                  with diet alone.

                    -  Note: A history of isolated gestational diabetes is not an exclusion
                       criterion. 19. Thyroidectomy or thyroid disease requiring medication during
                       the last 12 months.

                       determined to be normal-variant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal
                       heart rate or blood pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the
                       subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure
                       and/or heart rate may be re-measured. Repeated vital signs may be used to
                       determine eligibility.

                       21. Received a licensed live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment in
                       this study, or plans to receive a licensed live vaccine within 30 days
                       before or after each study vaccine.

                       22. Received a licensed inactivated vaccine within 14 days prior to
                       enrollment in this study, or plans to receive a licensed inactivated vaccine
