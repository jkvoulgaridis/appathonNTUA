    <measure>Progression-Free Survival, as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until date of first documented PD or date of death from any cause within 18 weeks after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of progressive disease (PD), as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause within 18 weeks after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.1, PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 millimeters (mm), and the appearance of new lesions. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm. Data for participants who did not have a PFS event were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment (if no tumor assessments performed after baseline, at randomization plus 1 day). At the primary completion date, mean (standard deviation) duration of time on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median OS for each treatment arm. Participants who were alive or lost to follow-up at the time of the analysis were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. Participants with no post-baseline information were censored at the time of randomization plus 1 day. At the primary completion date, mean (standard deviation) duration of time on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Measurable Disease at Baseline Who Achieved an Objective Response (Complete or Partial Response), as Determined by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and every 9 weeks from date of randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Also per RECIST v1.1, stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum on study; PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 mm, and the appearance of new lesions. The same assessment technique must be used throughout the study for evaluating a particular lesion, and the same investigator should assess all tumor responses for each participant. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks from the date of randomization until the treatment discontinuation visit, then every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter for up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) at any time during the study, as determined using echocardiography (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan, were summarized by treatment arm. Symptomatic LVSD was evaluated according to NCI CTCAE v4.0 (for &quot;heart failure&quot;) and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. At the primary completion date, the mean (standard deviation) duration of time that participants were on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks from the date of randomization until the treatment discontinuation visit, then every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter for up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>An asymptomatic LVEF event is reported as an adverse event of &quot;ejection fraction decreased&quot; and is defined as either of the following: an absolute decrease in LVEF of ≥10 percentage points from baseline to an LVEF of &lt;50%; or an asymptomatic decrease in LVEF requiring treatment or leading to discontinuation of pertuzumab (or placebo) and trastuzumab. At the primary completion date, the mean (standard deviation) duration of time that participants were on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks from the date of randomization until the treatment discontinuation visit, then every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter for up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Here, we report the change from baseline in LVEF over time. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. LVEF was calculated using the modified Simpson method and must have been ≥55% at baseline as determined by the local facility before a participant could be enrolled in the study. The investigator must have decided which method of LVEF assessment (ECHO [preferred] or MUGA scan) would be used for each participant at baseline, and the same method should have been used throughout the study, to the extent possible. At the primary completion date, the mean (standard deviation) duration of time that participants were on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival, as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of progressive disease (PD), as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause within 18 weeks after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.1, PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 millimeters (mm), and the appearance of new lesions. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm. Data for participants who did not have a PFS event were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment (if no tumor assessments performed after baseline, at randomization plus 1 day). At the primary completion date, mean (standard deviation) duration of time on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

          <title>Progression-Free Survival, as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of progressive disease (PD), as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause within 18 weeks after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.1, PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 millimeters (mm), and the appearance of new lesions. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm. Data for participants who did not have a PFS event were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment (if no tumor assessments performed after baseline, at randomization plus 1 day). At the primary completion date, mean (standard deviation) duration of time on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

        <description>An objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Also per RECIST v1.1, stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum on study; PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 mm, and the appearance of new lesions. The same assessment technique must be used throughout the study for evaluating a particular lesion, and the same investigator should assess all tumor responses for each participant. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders.</description>

        <title>Duration of Objective Response, as Determined by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1</title>
        <description>Duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to the time of disease progression, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause within 18 weeks after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median duration of objective response. Data for participants who did not have an event were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment (if no tumor assessments were performed after baseline visit, at randomization plus 1 day). At the primary completion date, mean (standard deviation) duration of time on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in LVEF Over Time, as Determined Using ECHO or MUGA Scan</title>
        <description>Here, we report the change from baseline in LVEF over time. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. LVEF was calculated using the modified Simpson method and must have been ≥55% at baseline as determined by the local facility before a participant could be enrolled in the study. The investigator must have decided which method of LVEF assessment (ECHO [preferred] or MUGA scan) would be used for each participant at baseline, and the same method should have been used throughout the study, to the extent possible. At the primary completion date, the mean (standard deviation) duration of time that participants were on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Maximum On-Treatment Decrease in LVEF at Any Point During the Study</title>
        <description>The baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and change from baseline to the maximum on-treatment decrease in LVEF at any point during the study are reported here. LVEF is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. LVEF was calculated using the modified Simpson method and must have been ≥55% at baseline as determined by the local facility before a participant could be enrolled in the study. The investigator decided which method of LVEF assessment (ECHO [preferred] or MUGA scan) would be used for each participant at baseline, and the same method should have been used throughout the study, to the extent possible. At the primary completion date, the mean (standard deviation) duration of time that participants were on study in Arms A and B were 57.74 (19.14) weeks and 59.46 (16.80) weeks, respectively.</description>
