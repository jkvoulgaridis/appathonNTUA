  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study of combination therapy with
      ensartinib, an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, and durvalumab, an anti-programmed
      cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in subjects with ALK-rearranged (ALK-positive)
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Primary study objectives were to determine the
      recommended combination dose (RCD) and safety and tolerability of the combination. Further
      objectives were to evaluate the clinical efficacy and biologic activity of the combination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to initiation of combination therapy with ensartinib plus durvalumab, subjects were
      enrolled sequentially to receive ensartinib monotherapy (orally once daily) during a
      pre-immunotherapy Run-in Period for one to two 28-day cycles. The purpose of the Run-in
      Period was to determine whether any safety signals might compromise combination therapy and
      to determine the effect of ALK inhibitor therapy on the immune tumor microenvironment. For
      subjects with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the Run-in Period, combination therapy
      was then initiated during a dose-finding phase using a standard 3 + 3 design until
      determination of the RCD, which was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 of 6
      subjects (i.e., &lt; 33%) experienced DLTs during the first 2 cycles of combination treatment.

      A fixed dose of durvalumab (1500 mg by intravenous [IV] infusion every 4 weeks) was
      administered in all cohorts. Ensartinib dosing started at 200 mg, with subsequent cohorts
      receiving a reduced (150 mg) or escalated (225 mg) ensartinib dose depending upon observed
      toxicity. The study was then designed to include an expansion phase, in which the RCD cohort
      would be expanded to a total of 20 subjects.

      Subjects were monitored for safety (including immune-related adverse events), disease status
      (using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1 and
      immune-related RECIST), and biologic activity (peripheral blood assays and immunological
      changes in the tumor microenvironment) for the duration of study participation.

    <description>Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from pre-treatment through the end of the study period. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the Run-in Period was defined as ≥ Grade 2 rash or other toxicity requiring discontinuation of ensartinib dosing.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Best Overall Tumor Response at the Last Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was evaluated using computed tomography and categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1) at Baseline, every 2 cycles, and at the end of the study. Per RECIST, target lesions are categorized as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Immune-related Tumor Response at the Last Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Immune-related tumor response was evaluated by computed tomography at Baseline, every 2 cycles, and at the end of the study. Tumor response was designated according to the immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:7412-20) into the following categories: immune-related complete response (irCR) requires disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart; immune-related partial response (irPR) requires ≥ 50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two observations at least 4 weeks apart; immune-related stable disease (irSD) is assigned when neither a 50% decrease from baseline tumor burden nor a 25% increase in tumor burden from nadir can be established; immune-related progressive disease (irPD) requires a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in tumor burden at any single time point in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic confirmation of metastatic NSCLC. Subjects must have had confirmed ALK
             rearrangement as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Subjects may have had prior therapy
             with ALK inhibitors (other than ensartinib) or been ALK inhibitor naïve. ALK inhibitor
             naïve subjects were informed of the availability of approved ALK inhibitors.

          2. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1, defined as ≥ 1 lesion that could be
             accurately measured in ≥ 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-lymph
             node lesions, shortest diameter to be recorded for lymph node lesions). Each lesion
             must have been ≥ 10 mm when measured by computed tomography, magnetic resonance

          2. Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, PD-L1 (including durvalumab), or cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), or ensartinib (X-396).

          3. Active, suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease (including but not restricted
             to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegner's granulomatosis, Hashimoto's
             thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, scleroderma and its variants,

               1. New York Heart Association Class II or higher congestive heart failure.

               2. Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident or transient
                  ischemic attack within 6 months of start of study drug (Day -28).

               3. Clinically significant supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia.

               4. QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥ 450 ms (male) or QTcF ≥
                  470 ms (female).

               5. Clinically uncontrolled hypertension.

          5. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, or any unresolved immune-related
             adverse events following prior therapy.

          6. Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting treatment (or scheduled for surgery during
             the projected course of the study).

          7. Women of child bearing potential who were pregnant as evidenced by positive serum
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin) or nursing.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception (see table below) from the time of screening and must have agreed to
             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             products. Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms
             plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             Female subjects should have refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females &lt;50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year prior to
                  study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year prior to
                  study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male
             subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control
             after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

          9. Subjects who were immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency.

         10. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that included clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive 1/2
             antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus infection (defined as
             the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen) were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only
             if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.

         11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or components of the
             study drugs.

         12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders).

         13. Mental impairment that may have compromised compliance with the requirements of the
             study.

         14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment.

         15. Inability to swallow or retain oral medication, presence of active gastrointestinal
             disease or other condition that would have interfered significantly with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ensartinib.

         16. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         17. History of allogeneic organ transplant.

         18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment.

        <description>Immune-related tumor response was evaluated by computed tomography at Baseline, every 2 cycles, and at the end of the study. Tumor response was designated according to the immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:7412-20) into the following categories: immune-related complete response (irCR) requires disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart; immune-related partial response (irPR) requires ≥ 50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two observations at least 4 weeks apart; immune-related stable disease (irSD) is assigned when neither a 50% decrease from baseline tumor burden nor a 25% increase in tumor burden from nadir can be established; immune-related progressive disease (irPD) requires a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in tumor burden at any single time point in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

      <time_frame>All adverse events (AEs) occurring between the signing of informed consent and the off-study date were documented, regardless of the causal relationship to study drug. AEs occurring after the first dose of study drug were considered treatment emergent (i.e., TEAEs). The AE reporting period for this study was up to 3 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>AE documentation included onset/resolution dates, severity using the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03), seriousness, relationship to study drug, study drug action taken, treatment, and outcome. In summaries, treatment-related AEs included those with a “possible”, “probable”, or “definite” relationship to study drug; preferred terms were counted only once per subject at the maximum reported grade.</desc>
