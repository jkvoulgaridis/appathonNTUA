    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether providing Medicare beneficiaries with a
      web-based patient-centered decision tool to help them choose among prescription medication
      coverage plans improves outcomes for patients including a greater likelihood of changing a
      plan, better coverage for prescribed drugs, less decisional conflict when choosing plans, and
      greater satisfaction with the choice process relative to current practice.

      In this study, the investigators tested the effectiveness of two versions of a web-based tool
      (called CHOICE) to help people choose among Medicare Part D plans (Treatments A and B)
      relative to standard care (Control). Both treatment arms incorporated simplified design and
      automated importation of an individual's prescription drugs relative to standard care. The
      treatment arms varied based on whether they provided expert guidance on recommended plans. In
      the control arm, study participants were directed to the existing, publicly available
      Medicare.gov website and received instructions on how to download their drugs from the Palo
      Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF) patient-facing online personal health portal (myhealthonline).
      The study sample included PAMF patients who were enrolled in Part D plans (not Medicare
      Advantage) during the 2016 enrollment period. Prior to the 2017 open enrollment period
      (October 15 to December 7, 2016), we invited a subset of PAMF patients not covered by either
      MediCal or a Medicare Advantage plan, aged 66-85, residing in 4 counties served by PAMF, and
      with at least one active medication order to participate in a study examining the
      effectiveness of decision tools that provide personalized information on the financial
      implications of enrolling in different Part D plans. The primary study outcomes included 1)
      Plan switching, 2) Decisional conflict 3) Satisfaction with the choice process, and 4) Change
      in generosity of coverage of prescription drugs. The investigators measured the primary study
      outcomes using a combination of administrative data and a post open enrollment survey. The
      investigators also collected information on individual characteristics at the time of
      enrollment in the study and implemented a survey examining use of the intervention tool to
      assess patient experience at the time of use.

    <measure>Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>within 50 days of the end of the open enrollment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Low literacy decisional conflict scale (Linder et al., 2011), edited slightly for context of health insurance rather than treatment choice. The scale has 4 subscales (uncertainty, informed, values clarity and support) with 2 to 3 questions per subscale. Respondents can indicate &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;unsure&quot; for each item. An answer of &quot;yes&quot; receives 0, &quot;unsure&quot; receives 2 and &quot;no&quot; receives 4 points. The sum of the responses to each question within a subscale is normalized to a scale of 25. The subscales are then summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 represents the lowest level of decisional conflict and 100 represents the highest level of decisional conflict.</description>

    <description>Response to the question of, &quot;How satisfied are you with the process of choosing a plan?&quot; with 4 potential responses: very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied and very dissatisfied. The count of participants who responded &quot;very satisfied&quot; is reported.</description>

    <description>Change in estimated prescription drug spending is the difference in estimated spending in US dollars, including both premiums and out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs, between the participant's 2016 and 2017 plans based on their initial drug list.</description>

        <title>Decisional Conflict</title>
        <description>Low literacy decisional conflict scale (Linder et al., 2011), edited slightly for context of health insurance rather than treatment choice. The scale has 4 subscales (uncertainty, informed, values clarity and support) with 2 to 3 questions per subscale. Respondents can indicate &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;unsure&quot; for each item. An answer of &quot;yes&quot; receives 0, &quot;unsure&quot; receives 2 and &quot;no&quot; receives 4 points. The sum of the responses to each question within a subscale is normalized to a scale of 25. The subscales are then summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 represents the lowest level of decisional conflict and 100 represents the highest level of decisional conflict.</description>
