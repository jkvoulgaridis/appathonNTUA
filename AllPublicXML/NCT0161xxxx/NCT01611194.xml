      Purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of action of hyperbaric oxygen therapy
      for persistent post-concussive symptoms after mild tramatic brain injury
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active duty military personnel and Veterans received for 60-minute daily chamber sessions in
      which they received HBO2, 1.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA), or sham intervention (1.2 ATA, room
      air) for post concussion syndrome (PCS).

      The study is to provide a rationale for the selection of outcome assessments to serve as
      primary and secondary endpoints for a pivotal randomized clinical trial of hyperbaric oxygen
      for the treatment of PCS. The participants will undergo a comprehensive battery of symptom
      and quality of life assessments. The distribution of response, change in response over time,
      homogeneity of variance across subgroups, and relationships between outcome measures will be
      compared by treatment assignment with a cohort from a study of similar design among a normal
      study population.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>RPQ/RPQ-3 was created to measure the severity of post-concussion symptoms following traumatic brain injury. Scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to the TBI. The RPQ is the most commonly used clinical measure for mild TBI research because it is simple and reflects psychosocial function. The RPQ is intended to measure the presence and severity of 16 of the most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms found in the literature. The RPQ scale includes 16 common post-concussion symptom items whose responses range from &quot;0= Not experienced at&quot; to &quot;4= A severe problem&quot;. Total range is 0 to 64. RPQ-3 ranges from 0-12 and access a subset of symptoms. RPQ-13 ranges from 0-52 and access's 13 remaining symptoms. Analyses of the RPQ-3 and RPQ-13 domain scores are presented separately. For each of the RPQ-3, RPQ-13, and RPQ total scales, the scores were derived by totaling the corresponding question scores for each domain.</description>

        Participants must have a history of at least one (minimum requirement) mild traumatic brain
        injury (mTBI) with persistent symptoms that meets all the following criteria:

          -  Brain injury that occurred more than 3 months prior to baseline screening at the local
             site, with the most recent injury occurring no more than 5 years prior to
             randomization.

          -  Most recent traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurred on active duty.

          -  TBI was caused by non-penetrating trauma or blast exposure.

          -  TBI resulted in at least one of the following at the time of injury: a period of loss
             of or a decreased level of consciousness (up to 30 minutes); a loss of memory for
             events immediately before or after the injury (up to 24 hours); or alteration in

        <title>Presence of Post Concussion Symptoms Following Traumatic Brain Injury Using The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ, RPQ3 and RPQ13) - Baseline (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>RPQ/RPQ-3 was created to measure the severity of post-concussion symptoms following traumatic brain injury. Scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to the TBI. The RPQ is the most commonly used clinical measure for mild TBI research because it is simple and reflects psychosocial function. The RPQ is intended to measure the presence and severity of 16 of the most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms found in the literature. The RPQ scale includes 16 common post-concussion symptom items whose responses range from &quot;0= Not experienced at&quot; to &quot;4= A severe problem&quot;. Total range is 0 to 64. RPQ-3 ranges from 0-12 and access a subset of symptoms. RPQ-13 ranges from 0-52 and access's 13 remaining symptoms. Analyses of the RPQ-3 and RPQ-13 domain scores are presented separately. For each of the RPQ-3, RPQ-13, and RPQ total scales, the scores were derived by totaling the corresponding question scores for each domain.</description>

        <title>Presence of Post Concussion Symptoms Following Traumatic Brain Injury Using The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ3) - Change From Baseline (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>RPQ-3 was created to measure the severity of post-concussion symptoms following traumatic brain injury. Scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to the TBI. The RPQ is the most commonly used clinical measure for mild TBI research because it is simple and reflects psychosocial function. The RPQ is intended to measure the presence and severity of 16 of the most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms found in the literature. The RPQ scale includes 16 common post-concussion symptom items whose responses range from &quot;0= Not experienced at&quot; to &quot;4= A severe problem&quot;. Total range is 0 to 64. RPQ-3 ranges from 0-12 and access a subset of symptoms. Analyses of the RPQ-3 domain scores are presented separately. For the RPQ-3 total scales, the scores were derived by totaling the corresponding question scores for each domain and it's change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Presence of Post Concussion Symptoms Following Traumatic Brain Injury Using The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ3) - Change From Baseline (Per Protocol (PP) Population)</title>
        <description>RPQ/RPQ-3 was created to measure the severity of post-concussion symptoms following traumatic brain injury. Scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to the TBI. The RPQ is the most commonly used clinical measure for mild TBI research because it is simple and reflects psychosocial function. The RPQ is intended to measure the presence and severity of 16 of the most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms found in the literature. The RPQ scale includes 16 common post-concussion symptom items whose responses range from &quot;0= Not experienced at&quot; to &quot;4= A severe problem&quot;. Total range is 0 to 64. RPQ-3 ranges from 0-12 and access a subset of symptoms. For the RPQ-3total scale, the scores were derived by totaling the corresponding question scores for each domain and change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Presence of Post Concussion Symptoms Following Traumatic Brain Injury Using The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) - Change From Baseline: 24 and 36 Months (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>RPQ was created to measure the severity of post-concussion symptoms following traumatic brain injury. Scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to the TBI. The RPQ is the most commonly used clinical measure for mild TBI research because it is simple and reflects psychosocial function. The RPQ is intended to measure the presence and severity of 16 of the most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms found in the literature. The RPQ scale includes 16 common post-concussion symptom items whose responses range from &quot;0= Not experienced at&quot; to &quot;4= A severe problem&quot;. Total range is 0 to 64. For the RPQ total scales, the scores were derived by totaling the corresponding question scores for each domain and change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Presence of Post Concussion Symptoms Following Traumatic Brain Injury Using The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) - Change From Baseline (Per Protocol (PP) Population)</title>
        <description>RPQ was created to measure the severity of post-concussion symptoms following traumatic brain injury. Scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to the TBI. The RPQ is the most commonly used clinical measure for mild TBI research because it is simple and reflects psychosocial function. The RPQ is intended to measure the presence and severity of 16 of the most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms found in the literature. The RPQ scale includes 16 common post-concussion symptom items whose responses range from &quot;0= Not experienced at&quot; to &quot;4= A severe problem&quot;. Total range is 0 to 64. For the RPQ total scales, the scores were derived by totaling the corresponding question scores for each domain and change from baseline.</description>
