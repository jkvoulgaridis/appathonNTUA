  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a combined set of parameters deemed to impact the
      quality of CMI analyses in terms of the proportion of viable lymphocytes in antiretroviral
      therapy-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects.

      This study will address the respective and combined impact of (i) timing between blood
      collection and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) processing [&quot;time-to-process&quot;] and
      (ii) timing of PBMC resting before stimulation [&quot;resting -time&quot;].

    <description>The objective was to model lymphocyte viability according to &quot;time-to-process&quot; (TP=2h, 7h or 24h) and &quot;resting time&quot; (RT=2h, 6h or 18h [&quot;none&quot; resting time not included]) conditions to select the best combination of these two parameters to maximize the post-ICS viability in CMI samples collected from ART-naïve HIV-1-infected subjects. Viability (%) = 10^P/(1 + 10^P)*100 with P for Prediction.The optimum of the viability was predicted as P (LOGIT)= intercept + a*TP + b*RT + a*b*TP*RT + a*a*TP*TP + b*b*RT*RT. Where &quot;intercept&quot;, &quot;TP&quot;, &quot;RT&quot;, &quot;TP*RT&quot;, &quot;TP *TP&quot;, &quot;RT*RT&quot; are the parameters evaluated and presented in the 3 first primary outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must satisfy all the following criteria at study entry:

          -  Subjects who the Investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study procedure.

          -  A male or female between and including 18 and 55 years of age at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Confirmed HIV-1 infection.

          -  ART-naïve and not eligible for ART treatment as per established guidelines. Subjects
             must never have received ART after HIV diagnosis, including lamivudine used for
             chronic hepatitis B infection. The exception to this is short-term ART for prevention
             of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) which must have been completed at least 360
             days prior to enrollment.

          -  Viral load level between and including 2,000 and 100,000 copies/mL at screening.

          -  CD4+ T cell count &gt;500 cells/mm3 at screening.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., have a
             current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal. Female
             subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any exclusion
        criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study:

          -  Infection with HIV-2. This includes subjects with dual infection with HIV-1/HIV-2.

          -  Planned use of any hematotoxic product during the study period.

          -  Planned use of any investigational or non-registered product during the study period.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically relevant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination, serology and/or medical
             history at screening.

          -  Grade 3 or grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, as defined by Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
             grading table, at screening.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, could compromise the
             subject's adherence to the study protocol.

          -  Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the
             period starting 30 days before the Sample Collection Visit (Visit 2). Vaccine can be
             administered as after sampling in Visit 2.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

        <title>Lymphocytes Viability Prediction (LOGIT Transformed) in CMI Samples Post-overnight Incubation Time Before Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS): &quot;Intercept&quot; Parameter Estimate of the Prediction Model - Condition &quot;None&quot; Resting Time Not Included</title>
        <description>The objective was to model lymphocyte viability according to &quot;time-to-process&quot; (TP=2h, 7h or 24h) and &quot;resting time&quot; (RT=2h, 6h or 18h [&quot;none&quot; resting time not included]) conditions to select the best combination of these two parameters to maximize the post-ICS viability in CMI samples collected from ART-naïve HIV-1-infected subjects. Viability (%) = 10^P/(1 + 10^P)*100 with P for Prediction.The optimum of the viability was predicted as P (LOGIT)= intercept + a*TP + b*RT + a*b*TP*RT + a*a*TP*TP + b*b*RT*RT. Where &quot;intercept&quot;, &quot;TP&quot;, &quot;RT&quot;, &quot;TP*RT&quot;, &quot;TP *TP&quot;, &quot;RT*RT&quot; are the parameters evaluated and presented in the 3 first primary outcomes. And a and b are log-transformed parameters corresponding respectively to the &quot;TP&quot; and the &quot;RT&quot; where the prediction has to be done. This outcome is presenting the intercept i.e. expected mean value of Prediction when &quot;TP&quot; and &quot;RT&quot; = 0. The optimum of this Design of Experiment is presented in outcome 4.</description>

        <description>The objective was to model lymphocyte viability according to &quot;time-to-process&quot; (TP=2h, 7h or 24h) and &quot;resting time&quot; (RT=0h) conditions in order to select the best combination of these two parameters with the aim to maximize the post-ICS viability in CMI samples collected from ART-naïve HIV-1-infected subjects. Viability (%) = 10 ^ P / (1 + 10 ^ P) * 100 with P for Prediction. The optimum of the viability was predicted as follows. P (LOGIT)= intercept + a*TP + b*RT + a*b*TP*RT + + b*b*RT*RT. Where &quot;intercept&quot;, &quot;TP&quot;, &quot;RT&quot;, &quot;TP*RT&quot;, &quot;TP *TP&quot;, &quot;RT*RT&quot; are the parameters evaluated and presented in the primary outcomes 5, 6 and 7. And &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parameters (hour) corresponding respectively to the &quot;TP&quot; and the &quot;RT&quot; where the prediction has to be done. This outcome is presenting the intercept i.e. expected mean value of Prediction when &quot;TP&quot; and &quot;RT&quot; = 0.
