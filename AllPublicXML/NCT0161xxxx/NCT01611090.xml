  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Ibrutinib administered in
      combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (patients will be assigned by chance to study treatments), double-blind
      (patients and study personnel will not know the identity of study treatments), placebo (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in
      a clinical trial)-controlled study to determine the benefits and risks of combining ibrutinib
      with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL
      following at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy. Approximately 580 patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment arm A (placebo) or treatment arm B (ibrutinib
      420 mg).

      Study medication will be administered orally once daily on a continuous schedule. All
      patients will receive BR as the background therapy plus either ibrutinib or placebo for a
      maximum of 6 cycles, after which treatment with ibrutinib or placebo will continue until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      A treatment cycle will be defined as 28 days. The study will include a screening phase, a
      treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Study end is defined as when either 80% of the
      patients have died or 5 years after the last patient is randomized into the study, whichever
      occurs first.

      Patients in treatment arm A (placebo) who complete the treatment phase, with disease
      progression or (after interim analysis) meet International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria for treatment, may crossover to ibrutinib treatment (as in
      treatment arm B), at the investigators discretion. This open-label, next-line treatment with
      ibrutinib will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal from
      study, or until the study end, whichever occurs earlier. One interim analysis is planned for
      the study. Efficacy evaluations will include computed tomography scans, laboratory testing,
      focused physical examinations, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, and assessment of
      patient-reported outcomes. In both treatment arms, samples for the development of a
      population-based pharmacokinetic (PK; study of what the body does to a drug) approach will be
      collected. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients. It is composed of 30 items, multi-item measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4-point scale is used and the score for each item range from &quot;1 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which was rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;7 = excellent&quot;. Lower scores indicate worsening. All scale and item scores were linearly transformed to be in range from 0-100. A higher score represents a higher (better) level of functioning, or a higher (worse) level of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CLL 16 is a 16-item disease specific module that comprises 5 domains of patient-reported health status important in CLL. There are three multi-item scales that include fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects and disease symptoms (8 items), and infection (4 items), and 2 single-item scales on social activities and future health worries. Responses are measured on a 4 point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D questionnaire assesses HRQOL in terms of degree of limitation on 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and as overall health using a visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score Scale at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1. High score indicating a high level of utility.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 578 participants were enrolled in the study. Among these, 289 participants were randomized in each ibrutinib + bendamustine/rituximab (BR) treatment group and placebo+BR treatment group.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Ibrutinib+BR</title>
          <description>Participants received ibrutinib 420 milligram (mg) (3 * 140 mg capsules) orally once daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 2 for a maximum of 6 cycles (each cycle of 28 days except Cycle 1 which was of 29 days) along with BR. After 6 cycles ibrutinib alone was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

        <description>Time to improvement is defined as the time interval (months) from randomization to the first observation of improvement. FACIT-Fatigue is an instrument for use as a measure of the effect of fatigue in patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.

The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worst score) to 52 (best score).</description>

          <description>FACIT-Fatigue is an instrument for use as a measure of the effect of fatigue in patients with cancer and other chronic diseases. Responses to the 13-item FACIT Fatigue Scale are reported on a 5‐point categorical response scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worst score) to 52 (best score).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score at End of Treatment</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients. It is composed of 30 items, multi-item measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4-point scale is used and the score for each item range from &quot;1 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which was rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;7 = excellent&quot;. Lower scores indicate worsening. All scale and item scores were linearly transformed to be in range from 0-100. A higher score represents a higher (better) level of functioning, or a higher (worse) level of symptoms.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D questionnaire assesses HRQOL in terms of degree of limitation on 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and as overall health using a visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>

        <population>ITT population included all participants randomized into the study regardless of treatment actually received. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants evaluable for this endpoint.</population>
