    <textblock>
      The skin barrier lipids will be lower in premature infants than in full term infants and will
      become normal over 3-4 months after birth. The higher skin pH in premature infants will be
      related to an altered lipid composition which will change as the skin acidifies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants have a poor epidermal barrier with few cornified layers, putting them at
      significant risk for increased permeability to external agents, skin compromise, high water
      loss and infection. While the skin develops rapidly after birth upon exposure to the dry
      environment, the ontogeny of the skin maturation and the time to a fully functional and
      protective stratum corneum (SC) barrier is largely unknown. The impact of a poor skin barrier
      on nosocomial infections and the morbidity associated with prematurity is not well defined.
      The purpose is to evaluate skin barrier maturation in premature infants compared to full term
      infants. The skin barrier lipids will be lower in premature infants than in full term infants
      and will become normal over 3-4 months after birth. The higher skin surface acidity in
      premature infants will be related to an altered lipid composition which will change as the
      skin acidifies.

      Full thickness skin samples will be collected from premature and full term infants during the
      time of medically necessary surgical procedures for genomic/transcriptomics analyses. The
      gene profiles will be compared to the corresponding biomarker profiles to determine the
      relationship between genes and gene expression products, i.e., biomarkers. The
      genomic/transcriptomics, biomarker, instrumental and clinical assessments will be examined
      for relationships and compared between premature and full term cohorts.

    <description>Stratum corneum ceramides, sphingoid bases, and free fatty acids in premature infants will be compared with those in full term infants and adults. The composition will be evaluated over six months for premature infants and full term infants and compared to those of adults. Lipid composition is determined from extracts of stratum corneum collected from the skin surface at designated skin sites on each leg. Analyses are conducted using supercritical fluid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry and reported as total free fatty acids, cholesterol, total ceramides and total sphingoid bases normalized to total protein.</description>

    <measure>Skin Surface Acidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Until six months after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Skin surface acidity in premature infants will be compared to the lipid composition. The skin surface acidity and the lipid composition will be compared over time for premature and full term infants. An acidic skin surface is necessary for the effective functioning of enzymes in stratum formation and integrity and for bacterial homeostasis, skin colonization and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria. In very low birth weight infants, skin acidity varies with gestational age and is higher for a longer time compared with full term infants.</description>
