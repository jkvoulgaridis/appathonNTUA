  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase III study
      to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with buparlisib plus fulvestrant versus
      fulvestrant plus placebo in postmenopausal women with hormone Receptor-positive
      (HR-positive), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-negative), locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) whose disease has progressed on or after aromatase
      inhibitor (AI) treatment.

      Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive buparlisib (100 mg/day) or placebo with fulvestrant
      (500 mg); randomization was stratified by PI3K pathway activation status (activated,
      non-activated, unknown determined in archival tumor tissue) and visceral disease status
      (present or absent). Tumor evaluation was performed 6 weeks after the randomization date and
      then every 8 weeks until radiological progression (based on Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1).

      Novartis made the decision not to pursue further development of buparlisib and to terminate
      the ongoing studies in the program. Accordingly, on 19-Dec-2016, Novartis notified all the
      Investigators about the decision not to pursue further development of buparlisib in Breast
      Cancer. As a result, the CBKM120F2302 study was terminated on 19-Apr-2019 (last subject last
      visit).

    <time_frame>Date of randomization to the date of first documented tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, reported between day of first patient randomized up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. ORR was analyzed in the full population. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target/non target lesions: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target/non target lesions (all lymph nodes assigned as non-target lesions must be non-pathological in size (&lt; 10 mm short axis)); Partial response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions ; Overall Response (OR)= CR+PR.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15, 6 weeks after randomisation and then every 8 weeks until end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The global health status/QoL scale score of the QLQ-C30 is identified as the primary PRO variable of interest. Physical Functioning (PF), Emotional Functioning (EF) and Social Functioning (SF) scale scores of the QLQ-C30. The time to definitive 10% deterioration is defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of an event, which is defined as a worsening (decrease) in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study or death due to any cause. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high /healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL. Patients were assessed up to approx. 8.3 months. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on Local Investigator Assessment - Full Analysis Set (FAS) in Full Population, Main Study Cohort and PI3K Unknown Cohort</title>
        <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

        <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. ORR was analyzed in the full population. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target/non target lesions: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target/non target lesions (all lymph nodes assigned as non-target lesions must be non-pathological in size (&lt; 10 mm short axis)); Partial response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions ; Overall Response (OR)= CR+PR. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>

          <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. ORR was analyzed in the full population. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target/non target lesions: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target/non target lesions (all lymph nodes assigned as non-target lesions must be non-pathological in size (&lt; 10 mm short axis)); Partial response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions ; Overall Response (OR)= CR+PR. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) in the Full Population, the Main Study Cohort (known PI3K pathway activation status [activated, non activated]) and the PI3K unknown cohort (PI3K pathway unknown status) were considered.</population>

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL):Time to 10% Definitive Deterioration in the Global Health Status/Quality of Life Per EORTC-QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>The global health status/QoL scale score of the QLQ-C30 is identified as the primary PRO variable of interest. Physical Functioning (PF), Emotional Functioning (EF) and Social Functioning (SF) scale scores of the QLQ-C30. The time to definitive 10% deterioration is defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of an event, which is defined as a worsening (decrease) in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study or death due to any cause. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high /healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL. Patients were assessed up to approx. 8.3 months. Only descriptive analysis performed.</description>
