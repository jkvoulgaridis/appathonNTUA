      This study will examine the use of Aflibercept in patients with exudative macular
      degeneration requiring intravitreal injections. Patients will be followed for 24 months. The
      follow up phase will be completed at month 36.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the use of Aflibercept in patients who have been
      previously treated with Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab for exudative macular degeneration.
      Specifically, we will examine its effect on macular degeneration, measured by SDOCT (Spectral
      Domain Optical Coherence Tomography) and ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study)
      visual acuity. This will be a prospective study with patients to receive an intravitreal
      injection of Aflibercept at the time of treatment.

             ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm
             plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

               -  *Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to
                  be considered of child bearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are
