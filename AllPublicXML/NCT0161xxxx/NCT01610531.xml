      Melanoma is nowadays an important public health problem because its growing incidence. Mass
      screening for melanoma is not recommended worldwide because of its low cost-effectiveness.
      Nevertheless targeted screening for patients at high risk for melanoma is promoted. This
      study is designed to assess the effectiveness and the acceptability of a melanoma targeted
      screening of melanoma, to estimate the risk function to develop a melanoma among patients at
      high risk according to the SAMScore and to estimate the ratio cost/ efficacy of the melanoma
      targeted screening. A cohort of 7700 patients is carried out in 2 departments covered by a
      registry of cancers. The recruitment had began in April 2011. Patients assessed at high risk
      according to the SAMScore were proposed a skin examination by their GP every year.
