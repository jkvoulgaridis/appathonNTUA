  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Strategies are needed to improve oral rotavirus vaccine (RV), which provides
      suboptimal protection in developing countries. Probiotics and zinc supplementation could
      improve RV immunogenicity by altering the intestinal microbiota and immune function.

      This study enrolled infants 5 weeks old living in urban Vellore, India to assess the effects
      of daily zinc (5 mg), probiotic (1010 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) or placebo on the
      immunogenicity of two doses of RV (Rotarix,GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) given at 6 and 10
      weeks of age. Probiotics and zinc (or placebo) were provided for six weeks. A single dose of
      test product was administered daily one week prior to first study dose of rotavirus and polio
      vaccines through 1 week following second study dose of rotavirus and polio vaccines.

      Co- Primary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the serologic immune response to rotavirus vaccine (sero-conversion or
           four-fold rise in rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies) among Indian infants
           receiving zinc supplementation given daily for a week prior to the administration of the
           first dose through a week following the second dose of oral rotavirus vaccine compared
           to those receiving a zinc placebo.

        2. To evaluate the serologic immune response to rotavirus vaccine (sero-conversion or
           four-fold rise in rotavirus IgA antibodies) among Indian infants receiving probiotic
           supplementation given daily for a week prior to the administration of the first dose
           through a week following the second dose of oral rotavirus vaccine compared to those
           receiving a probiotic placebo.

    <measure>Number/Percentage of Subjects With Immune Response to Rotavirus Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose of rotavirus vaccine to 4 weeks after last dose of vaccine</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as an increase in serum anti-rotavirus (RV) VP6 IgA antibodies consistent with seroconversion (detection of serum anti-RV VP6 immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies at a concentration ≥20 U/ml in a previously seronegative individual) or a fourfold rise in anti-RV VP6 IgA antibodies between baseline and 14 weeks of age.
Pre-vaccination blood samples were taken when the subject received the first dose of rotavirus vaccine (when the subject was 6 weeks of age); post-vaccination blood samples were taken 4 weeks after the second dose of rotavirus vaccine was administered (14 weeks of age).</description>

    <measure>Number/Percentage of Subjects With Immune Response to Trivalent Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV)</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose of OPV to 4 weeks after last dose of OPV</time_frame>
    <description>A serologic immune response to OPV is defined as a neutralizing antibody titer to polio virus subtype 3 greater than or equal to 1:8 at 14 weeks of age. This antigen will be used as a conservative estimate because it gives the lowest immune response of all three polio antigens.

    <description>Field workers documented information on SAEs through the duration of the study during home visits (twice weekly between study clinic visits) or SAEs were documented by study clinicians at the study clinic or hospital. All SAEs occurring at any time during the study were recorded on a SAE Form and were reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician and the local IRB. The relationship of the SAE to study vaccine was evaluated and recorded and reported to the local institutional review board (IRB). All SAEs were followed until satisfactory resolution.</description>

          <description>Defined as an increase in serum anti-rotavirus (RV) VP6 IgA antibodies consistent with seroconversion (detection of serum anti-RV VP6 immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies at a concentration ≥20 U/ml in a previously seronegative individual) or a fourfold rise in anti-RV VP6 IgA antibodies between baseline and 14 weeks of age.
Pre-vaccination blood samples were taken when the subject received the first dose of rotavirus vaccine (when the subject was 6 weeks of age); post-vaccination blood samples were taken 4 weeks after the second dose of rotavirus vaccine was administered (14 weeks of age).</description>

        <description>Field workers documented information on SAEs through the duration of the study during home visits (twice weekly between study clinic visits) or SAEs were documented by study clinicians at the study clinic or hospital. All SAEs occurring at any time during the study were recorded on a SAE Form and were reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician and the local IRB. The relationship of the SAE to study vaccine was evaluated and recorded and reported to the local institutional review board (IRB). All SAEs were followed until satisfactory resolution.</description>
