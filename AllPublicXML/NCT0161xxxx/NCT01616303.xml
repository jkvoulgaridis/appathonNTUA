  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized study with two treatment arms to compare the effectiveness of
      oregovomab (a murine monoclonal antibody directed against cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) when
      combined with first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) to first-line chemotherapy
      (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone) in female patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

    <textblock>
      Oregovomab is an investigational drug previously used in clinical trials as an
      immunotherapeutic treatment of ovarian cancer patients whose tumor cells express the tumor
      associated antigen, CA125. The active component of oregovomab is the activated murine
      monoclonal antibody B43.13, an immunoglobulin G1k (IgG1k) subclass immunoglobulin that binds
      with high affinity (1.16E10/M) to CA125.

      CA125 is a surface glycoprotein antigen that is expressed on more than 80% of all
      non-mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinomas where it occurs at elevated levels in the serum of
      patients with ovarian cancer. Little is known about its biological function. CA125 is
      associated with a large molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein complex of 200-250
      kilodaltons (kDa) and its genetic structure has recently been elucidated. There is good
      evidence to suggest that CA125 is a relevant target antigen for antigen-mediated
      immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.

      The study will compare the effectiveness of oregovomab (a murine monoclonal antibody directed
      against cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) when combined with first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin
      and paclitaxel) to first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone) in female
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
