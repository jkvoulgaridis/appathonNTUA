    <textblock>
      The University of Michigan (UM) Schools of Nursing, Public Health, and Medicine, the Michigan
      Department of Community Health (MDCH) and the Michigan Cancer Consortium (MCC) are conducting
      a multidisciplinary academic/practice three-year project to increase appropriate breast
      cancer screening for young breast cancer survivors and their cancer-free, female relatives at
      greatest risk for breast cancer. The aims of this project are to: 1) identify and survey 3000
      breast cancer survivors reported to the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program who were
      diagnosed between the ages of 20-45 years regarding their breast cancer screening
      utilization; 2) identify and survey the survivors' female relatives regarding their breast
      cancer screening utilization; and 3) implement two versions (targeted vs. enhanced tailored)
      of an evidence-based intervention recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services
      to increase breast cancer screening. A follow-up survey will assess the effectiveness of each
      intervention on a) breast cancer screening utilization; b) perceived barriers and
      facilitators to screening; c) self-efficacy in utilizing screening services; d) family
      support related to screening; e) knowledge of the genetics of breast cancer and personal risk
      factors; and f) satisfaction with the intervention.

      The University of Michigan (UM) Schools of Nursing, Public Health, and Medicine, the Michigan
      Department of Community Health (MDCH) and the Michigan Cancer Consortium (MCC) propose a
      multidisciplinary academic/practice three-year project to increase appropriate breast cancer
      screening utilization for young breast cancer survivors (YBCS), and their cancer-free, female
      relatives at greatest risk for breast cancer (high-risk relatives). The aims of this project
      are to: 1) identify and survey 3000 breast cancer survivors reported to the Michigan Cancer
      Surveillance Program who were diagnosed between the ages of 25-45 years regarding their
      breast cancer screening utilization; 2) identify and survey YBCS' high-risk relatives
      regarding their breast cancer screening utilization; and 3) implement two versions (targeted
      vs. enhanced tailored) of an evidence-based intervention recommended by the Guide to
      Community Preventive Services to increase breast cancer screening. Aim 1, will be
      accomplished in year 1 by MDCH, UM and MCSP. Following approval by appropriate review boards
      (MDCH, UM, and MCSP), reporting facilities and physicians of record, 3000 YBCS will be mailed
      a request to participate in the project and a baseline survey. The baseline survey will
      obtain information on the YBCS's: a) willingness to participate; b) current breast cancer
      screening utilization; c) perceived barriers and facilitators to screening and other outcomes
      related to breast cancer screening; d) identification of high-risk relatives to participate
      in the study and interest in serving as an advocate for their high-risk relatives to
      participate. Aim 2, will be accomplished in year 2 by the UM and MDCH. Based on the
      information provided by YBCS, the MDCH will identify up to two high-risk relatives per YBCS.
      UM and MDCH will mail YBCS who agree to participate in the study baseline surveys to
      distribute to their selected high-risk relatives. The baseline survey to high-risk relatives
      will obtain information on their: a) willingness to participate in the project; b) current
      breast cancer screening utilization; and c) perceived barriers and facilitators to screening
      and other outcomes related to breast cancer screening. Aim 3, will be accomplished by UM and
      MDCH. YBCS and their high-risk relatives will be randomized (as a family unit) to receive two
      versions of a small media, evidence-based intervention aiming to increase appropriate
      utilization of breast cancer screening services and other outcomes. In year 2-3, 9 months
      after YBCS and high-risk female relatives receive the intervention, UM will mail a follow-up
      survey to YBCS and their high-risk relatives to evaluate the effectiveness of each
      intervention version on: a) breast cancer screening utilization; b) perceived barriers and
      facilitators to screening; c) self-efficacy in utilizing screening services; d) family
      support related to screening; e) knowledge of the genetics of breast cancer and personal risk
      factors; and f) satisfaction with the intervention. The State of Michigan is considered a
      national leader in cancer prevention, control, and public health genomics. Key partners have
      significant prior experience in conducting studies with cancer survivors and their high-risk
      relatives. This project would greatly enhance state efforts in cancer prevention and control.
