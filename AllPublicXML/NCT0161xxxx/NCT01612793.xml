      This study will look at the safety, improving symptoms and decreasing the length of stay of
      patients admitted to the hospital with COPD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary safety measurement for this study is the type, occurrence and severity of adverse
      events (anticipated and unanticipated), including serious and non-serious device-related
      events.

      The primary outcome measure is hospital length of stay (LOS) defined as the number of days
      from hospital admission to the date the subject meets the medical elements of the GOLD
      Discharge Criteria.

        Potential study subjects will be provided a study information sheet (informed consent form)
        to review. Those who are interested in participating will provide signed informed consent
        and then be screened for eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria). Subjects meeting the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a study ID number, randomized and enrolled in
        the study.
