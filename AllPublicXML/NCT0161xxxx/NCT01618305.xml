      HIV-infected pregnant women who begin taking antiretroviral (ARV) medications in the late
      stages of pregnancy need an effective medication regimen to reduce the risk of transmitting
      HIV to their children. This study examined the virologic response, safety, and tolerability
      of two different ARV medication regimens in HIV-infected pregnant women who were between 20
      and 36 weeks pregnant when they entered the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When initiating this study there were many ARV medications and combination regimens available
      to treat HIV-infected people. However, the number of ARV medications that had been studied in
      HIV-infected pregnant women for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission was limited.
      Although HIV-infected pregnant women who began taking ARV medications late in their
      pregnancies required effective therapy to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their
      children, there were no published data available that compared the effects of non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and integrase inhibitors (which are two classes of
      ARV medications) in pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety,
      tolerability, and virologic responses to two different medication regimens, each of which
      included an NNRTI or integrase inhibitor, in pregnant HIV-infected women who began ARV
      therapy late in their pregnancies (i.e., had gestational age between 20 and 36 weeks).

      This study was originally opened under IMPAACT P1081, protocol version 2.0 (version 1.0 never
      opened to accrual) as a three arm study. However, IMPAACT P1081 was closed due to slow
      accrual, at which point NICHD took over the study, streamlined it to two arms, and reopened
      it as NICHD P1081 under protocol Version 3.0. Women who enrolled under IMPAACT P1081 (N=20)
      and were randomized to one of the two continuing arms (efavirenz- or raltegravir-based ART;
      N=14) were included in NICHD P1081, while IMPAACT P1081 women randomized to the dropped arm
      (lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART; N=6) were not eligible for inclusion in NICHD P1081.

      In this study HIV-infected pregnant women were randomly assigned to one of two arms. Women in
      Arm A received lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice a day and efavirenz 600 mg each
      night. Women in Arm B received lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice a day and
      raltegravir 400 mg twice a day. All women were scheduled to receive their assigned
      medications from study entry through delivery. Antepartum study visits were scheduled at
      entry and Weeks 1, 2, and 4; and thereafter, every two weeks until labor and delivery. Study
      visits included a medical history review, physical examination, questionnaires, blood
      collection, and a vaginal swab procedure.

      While women were in labor, they were scheduled to continue to receive their study
      medications. Some women may have received additional or alternate medications according to
      local standard of care/guidelines. Women had a physical examination and blood collection at
      the delivery visit. After delivery, some women continued to receive ARV medications according
      to the local guidelines, and could have received study ARV for up to eight weeks postpartum
      while they transitioned to the ARV regimen indicated per their local standard of care. Women
      were scheduled to attend study visits following delivery at Weeks 2, 6, 16, and 24, which
      included a medical history review, physical examination, and blood collection. Select visits
      were scheduled to include a vaginal swab procedure. Some women had vaginal specimens stored
      for future research.

      Infants delivered on study were scheduled to receive ARV medications as prescribed by the
      babies' doctors per local standard of care/guidelines. Study visits for infants were
      scheduled at birth, and at Weeks 2, 6, 16, and 24. Each study visit included a medical
      history review, physical examination, and blood collection. Select visits included oral and
      nasopharyngeal swab collection.Some infants had oral and/or nasopharyngeal specimens stored
      for future research.

    <time_frame>Measured at participants' delivery visit (or last visit within three weeks prior to delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>If there was no viral load measurement at the delivery visit, the last viral load within three weeks prior to delivery was considered.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants Who Discontinued Randomized Study Drug Prior to Labor and Delivery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from entry through participants' delivery visit (approximately 36 to 40 weeks gestation)</time_frame>
    <description>Only women who initiated (i.e. received at least one dose of) their randomized treatment were eligible for this outcome measure. Women were considered to have discontinued study drug if they stopped receiving efavirenz or raltegravir (whichever was assigned) prior to labor and delivery for any reason, including loss to follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Women Who Experienced at Least One New Adverse Event of Greater Than or Equal to Grade 3 as Defined in the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Toxicity Table</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from entry through participants' last study visit, approximately 24 weeks after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;New&quot; adverse events were those with an onset date on or after randomization. Adverse events present at baseline would only be considered &quot;New&quot; if they increased in grade on or after randomization.
All women who received at least one dose of study drug were eligible for this analysis.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Infants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event of Greater Than or Equal to Grade 3.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from birth through infants' last study visit, approximately 24 weeks after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>All infants who were live births on study were eligible for this analysis. Adverse event grades were defined based on the DAIDS toxicity table.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Women Who Achieved HIV-1 RNA Virologic Suppression Below the Lower Limit of Quantification of the Assay at Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at participants' delivery visit (or last visit within three weeks prior to delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>A successful outcome was defined as maternal HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load less than the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) for the testing assay, which could vary. Most (99%) women had their viral load measured using an assay with LLQ equal to 40 or 20 copies/mL.
If the viral load at delivery was missing, the last observed viral load within 21 days prior to the delivery date was considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Women With 1) Successful Viral Load (Plasma HIV-1 RNA VL) Decrease From Entry to Week 2 and VL Less Than 1,000 Copies/ml at All Time Points After 4 Weeks on Study Drugs, Until Delivery; and 2) Who Remain on the Assigned Study Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from entry through delivery (approximately 36 to 40 weeks gestation).</time_frame>
    <description>A successful viral load decrease was defined as follows: for women having HIV-1 RNA viral load greater than or equal to 10,000 copies/mL at entry, a viral load &lt;200 copies/mL; for women with VL less than 10,000 copies/mL at entry, a Log10 viral load decrease of at least 2.0 from entry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Log10 Change in Viral Load From Entry to Each Time Point Prior to Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at antepartum Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in viral load from entry (or screening, if there was no entry viral load) to each study week prior to delivery, calculated on the log10 scale as log10(week X RNA) - log10(baseline RNA).
For this analysis, HIV-1 RNA values that were censored below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were imputed to be equal to the LLQ - 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Women With HIV-1 RNA Plasma Viral Load Less Than 200 Copies/mL at Weeks 4 and 6 From Treatment Initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Weeks 4 and 6 from first dose of randomized treatment, prior to delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The Week 4 and 6 participant viral loads were the viral load results obtained closest to (within four days of) the target date for that visit from initiation of treatment (for Week 4, day 24-32 after first dose; for Week 6, day 38-46 after first dose).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Women With HIV-1 RNA Vaginal Viral Load Less Than 1200 Copies/mL at Weeks 4 and 6 From Treatment Initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Weeks 4 and 6 from first dose of randomized treatment, prior to delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The Week 4 and 6 participant viral loads were the viral load results obtained closest to (within four days of) the target date for that visit from initiation of treatment (for Week 4, day 24-32 after first dose; for Week 6, day 38-46 after first dose).
Vaginal swabs produce much less testable sample volume than blood plasma draws. Each vaginal swab specimen had to be diluted, and this dilution factor raised the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). The most commonly observed LLQs were 300 and 1200. For consistency, the higher LLQ was considered the threshold for this outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infectivity of Plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on or after delivery up to participants' last postpartum study visit (approximately 26 weeks after delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of this outcome measure was to address an objective relevant to protease inhibitors, one of which was originally included as a third arm in the Version 2.0 of the study. This outcome measure was included to assess how the infectivity of plasma changed over time among women receiving protease inhibitors, and whether this differed from other classes of antiretroviral drugs. However, the lopinavir/ritonavir arm was later dropped in Version 3.0, and only Version 2.0 women who received efavirenz or raltegravir were included in the study analyses. Therefore, because no women included in the study analyses received lopinavir/ritonavir, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Deliveries That Had an Outcome of a Stillbirth/Fetal Demise.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at delivery (approximately 36 to 40 weeks gestation)</time_frame>
    <description>The unit of analysis was the mother-infant set. All sets where the woman received at least one dose of study treatment and remained on study through delivery were eligible. In the case of twins, the worst outcome (i.e. a stillbirth) was used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Deliveries That Were Premature (Less Than 37 Weeks Gestation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at delivery (within 72 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>The unit of analysis for this outcome measure was the mother-infant set. A mother-infant set was counted as having a premature delivery if any infant in the mother-infant set was delivered prior to 37 weeks gestation (i.e. in the case of twins, if either of the twins was delivered prior to 37 weeks gestation then this set would count as one premature delivery outcome).
All mother-infant sets that delivered at least one live birth on study were eligible for this outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Deliveries That Were Extremely Premature (Less Than 34 Weeks Gestation).</measure>
    <time_frame>At delivery (within 72 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>The unit of analysis for this outcome measure was the mother-infant set. A mother-infant set was counted as having an extremely premature delivery if any infant in the mother-infant set was delivered prior to 34 weeks gestation (i.e. in the case of twins, if either of the twins was delivered prior to 34 weeks gestation then this set would count as one extremely premature delivery outcome).
Only women who enrolled prior to 34 weeks gestation were included in this analysis. Those that enrolled from 34 to less than 37 weeks gestation were excluded because they were already past the gestational age where this outcome could have occurred at entry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Deliveries With a Low Birth Weight (Less Than 2,500 Grams)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured within 72 hours after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The unit of analysis was the mother-infant pair or set; in the case of multiple gestation, the worst outcome was considered in analysis (e.g. if two twins were delivered to one mother, one at 2,000 grams and one at 3,000 grams, this mother-infant set would count as one instance of low birth weight in analysis because at least one of the infants had the outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Deliveries With an Extremely Low Birth Weight (&lt;1,500 Grams).</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured within 72 hours after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The unit of analysis was the mother-infant pair or set; in the case of multiple gestation, the worst outcome was considered in analysis (e.g. if two twins were delivered to one mother, one at 2,000 grams and one at 1,000 grams, this mother-infant set would count as one instance of extremely low birth weight in analysis because at least one of the infants had the outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant HIV Infection Status (Per International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group [IMPAACT] Definitions)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from birth through infants' last study visit at Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Infants were considered infected if they had both a positive HIV nucleic acid test and a subsequent confirmatory test on a different sample. Uninfected infants were those that had no positive test results and negative test results obtained at two or more of the following visits: Week 6, Week 16, and/or Week 24 postpartum.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of HIV-infected Infants With Genotypic Resistance to Study Drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on or after confirmation of HIV-infection up to the infants' last study visit at Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Genotypic resistance to each class of study drug (reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors) was assessed separately among HIV infected infants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Women With HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutations at Screening, 2-4 Weeks Postpartum in Women Who Stopped Antiretroviral Therapy, and at the Time of Inadequate Virologic Response Using Standard and Ultrasensitive Methods.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at screening and at the time of inadequate virologic response (from Week 2 antepartum through participants' last study visit 24 weeks after delivery).</time_frame>
    <description>Consensus sequencing was performed on a sample from screening. Women were evaluated for integrase and reverse transcriptase resistance mutations separately.
Additionally, consensus sequencing was performed among women who had an inadequate virologic response (defined in the protocol) on a sample taken at that time of inadequate virologic response.
Genotypic resistance among women who stopped antiretroviral therapy was not assessed. Because World Health Organization guidelines have been updated to indicate all people living with HIV should remain on antiretroviral therapy, even postpartum women, no women stopped antiretroviral therapy after delivery. Therefore, this aspect of the outcome measure is no longer relevant and was not assessed.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Women With HIV-1 RNA Vaginal Viral Load Less Than 1200 Copies/mL at Weeks 4 and 6 From Treatment Initiation</title>
        <description>The Week 4 and 6 participant viral loads were the viral load results obtained closest to (within four days of) the target date for that visit from initiation of treatment (for Week 4, day 24-32 after first dose; for Week 6, day 38-46 after first dose).
Vaginal swabs produce much less testable sample volume than blood plasma draws. Each vaginal swab specimen had to be diluted, and this dilution factor raised the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). The most commonly observed LLQs were 300 and 1200. For consistency, the higher LLQ was considered the threshold for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Infectivity of Plasma</title>
        <description>The goal of this outcome measure was to address an objective relevant to protease inhibitors, one of which was originally included as a third arm in the Version 2.0 of the study. This outcome measure was included to assess how the infectivity of plasma changed over time among women receiving protease inhibitors, and whether this differed from other classes of antiretroviral drugs. However, the lopinavir/ritonavir arm was later dropped in Version 3.0, and only Version 2.0 women who received efavirenz or raltegravir were included in the study analyses. Therefore, because no women included in the study analyses received lopinavir/ritonavir, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

          <description>The goal of this outcome measure was to address an objective relevant to protease inhibitors, one of which was originally included as a third arm in the Version 2.0 of the study. This outcome measure was included to assess how the infectivity of plasma changed over time among women receiving protease inhibitors, and whether this differed from other classes of antiretroviral drugs. However, the lopinavir/ritonavir arm was later dropped in Version 3.0, and only Version 2.0 women who received efavirenz or raltegravir were included in the study analyses. Therefore, because no women included in the study analyses received lopinavir/ritonavir, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

        <description>Consensus sequencing was performed on a sample from screening. Women were evaluated for integrase and reverse transcriptase resistance mutations separately.
Additionally, consensus sequencing was performed among women who had an inadequate virologic response (defined in the protocol) on a sample taken at that time of inadequate virologic response.
Genotypic resistance among women who stopped antiretroviral therapy was not assessed. Because World Health Organization guidelines have been updated to indicate all people living with HIV should remain on antiretroviral therapy, even postpartum women, no women stopped antiretroviral therapy after delivery.

Only women who received at least one dose of study drug (and their infants) were included in the assessment of &quot;other&quot; events, which included grade 3 or higher signs/symptoms, laboratory events, and diagnoses that occurred in at least 5 percent of women (or infants) in at least one arm.
The DAIDS AE Grading Table (V2.0) and EAE Manual (V2.0) were used.</desc>
