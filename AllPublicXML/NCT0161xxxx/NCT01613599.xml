    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will evaluate the long-term safety of MabThera/Rituxan
      (rituximab) in participants with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) or microscopic
      polyangiitis. Data will be collected for a maximum of 4 years from participants initiated on
      MabThera/Rituxan therapy by their physician according to prescribing information.

    <measure>Incidence Rate of Serious Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose until participant withdrawal or the date of last participant, last visit (up to 4.32 years)</time_frame>
    <description>A serious infection was defined as an infection that was a serious adverse event (SAE) or a non-SAE infection that required treatment with intravenous antimicrobials. A SAE was defined as any adverse event that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: •Was fatal (results in death) •Was life-threatening •Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity •Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect •Was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above. Multiple events reported in the same participant were counted multiple times in the calculation of incidence. Incidence rate is defined as events per 100 patient years.</description>

    <description>A serious infusion-related reaction was defined as a SAE during or within 24 hours after any rituximab infusion and considered infusion related by the Principal Investigator. A SAE was defined as any adverse event that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: •Was fatal (results in death) •Was life-threatening •Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity •Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect •Was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <description>A serious cardiac adverse event was defined as a SAE that was coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) cardiac system organ class. A SAE was defined as any adverse event that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: •Was fatal (results in death) •Was life-threatening •Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity •Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect •Was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.

        <title>Incidence Rate of Serious Infections</title>
        <description>A serious infection was defined as an infection that was a serious adverse event (SAE) or a non-SAE infection that required treatment with intravenous antimicrobials. A SAE was defined as any adverse event that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: •Was fatal (results in death) •Was life-threatening •Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity •Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect •Was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above. Multiple events reported in the same participant were counted multiple times in the calculation of incidence. Incidence rate is defined as events per 100 patient years.</description>

          <description>A SAE was defined as any adverse event that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: •Was fatal (results in death) •Was life-threatening •Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity •Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect •Was medically significant or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above. Multiple events reported in the same participant were counted multiple times in the calculation of incidence. Incidence rate is defined as events per 100 patient years.</description>
