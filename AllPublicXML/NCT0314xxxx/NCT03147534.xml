  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare and assess the accuracy and reliability of the InstaTemp MD® device to techniques
      presently in use for measuring temperature in infants and children in a Canadian clinical
      setting.

      This study is designed as a multi-center study. This study will involve collecting
      temperatures on patients using the InstaTemp MD® device and the traditional method used in
      the clinical setting. Reliability and agreement of the InstaTemp MD® will be compared to the
      current Canadian Paediatric Society's definitely recommended methods of temperature
      measurement in certain age cohorts of infants and children.

          -  Subjects currently using cooling blankets or fans

          -  Subjects with tubes in their ear(s) cannot participate in the tympanic comparison, but
             this is not exclusionary for InstaTemp MD and definitive comparator (e.g. rectal or
             oral) measurements.

          -  Subjects currently receiving treatment with thyroxine, barbiturates, antipsychotics,

             reading

          -  Subject is taking any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may alter the
             temperature of the child

          -  Subjects participating in a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product
             within the last 30 days.
