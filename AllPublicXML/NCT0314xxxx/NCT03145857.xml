  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT or PET/MRI scan is a nuclear medicine test used to create
      pictures of the whole body that will show where somatostatin receptors are found, including
      on tumours. Somatostatin receptors are found on most neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), and some
      other types of tumours. Currently at the Cross Cancer Institute, most patients with suspected
      somatostatin positive tumours (e.g. NETs) have an In-111 Octreotide (Octreoscan™) scan. A
      scientific study has shown that a scan with a similar product ([68]Ga-DOTATATE) is more
      accurate than an Octreoscan™. This study will look at [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE, a product virtually
      identical to [68]Ga-DOTATATE.

      The purpose of this study is to: 1) demonstrate the safety of [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE; and 2)
      confirm that [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT or PET/MRI is effective at diagnosing somatostatin
      positive tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will be a sequential Phase I/II, diagnostic imaging, controlled,
      open label, single site study in a broad cross-section of patients with known or suspected
      somatostatin receptor positive tumours. All participants will be imaged with
      [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT or PET/MRI for uptake by somatostatin receptor positive tumours. Up
      to seven [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scans may be performed per participant, as clinically indicated.
      A safety evaluation will be conducted on the first 10 consecutively enrolled participants
      (safety sub-group), consisting of vital signs, haematology and serum biochemistry profile
      (pre-injection and post-imaging), and an adverse event (AE) assessment (up to 24 hours) after
      [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE imaging. The safety evaluation for subsequent [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scan
      visits for participants in the safety sub-group and for the remaining participants will
      consist of an AE assessment while in the Nuclear Medicine department. The efficacy evaluation
      will include [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scan clinical accuracy compared to standard of care CT or
      MRI.
