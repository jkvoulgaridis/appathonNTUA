    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells. This study looks at
      neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).

      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells, including Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease and Frontotemporal degeneration. [18F]T807
      (also known as 18F-AV- 1451) is a specialized radioactive PET tracer that sticks to the tau
      protein in the brain. In this study, researchers will use [18F]T807 to form images of tau
      binding in the brain. [18F]T807 is an investigational or experimental imaging agent that has
      not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in brain imaging.

      In this study, researchers want to find out how accurate and useful [18F]T807 is in imaging
      patients who have problems with thinking, remembering, speech, and visual activities, and may
      be diagnosed with different types of neurodegenerative disease. This study will help test how
      imaging measures may provide information that could be used to determine diagnosis for
      patients in the future. The results of the PET/CT scan will be compared with other
      information obtained under related protocols, including brain magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), spinal fluid and cognitive test results.

    <intervention_name>[18F]T807 (also known as 18F-AV- 1451)</intervention_name>
    <description>experimental PET/CT scan of the brain. In this scan, imaging is done with specialized cameras that can pick up radiation signals given off by a radioactive tracer and determine where the signals come from.
The tracer used for this study is called [18]FT807 (also known as 18F-AV-1451). [18]FT807 is a specialized radioactive PET tracer used to detect the presence of tau proteins in the brain. [18]FT807 is an experimental tracer that has been studied in patients with known or suspected Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBS/CBD). In this study, patients will have one (1) [18F]T807 PET/CT scan performed at the University of Pennsylvania. The [18F]T807 PET/CT scan will require up to 3 hours of time, including preparation. The scan will take place using PET/CT scanners in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine or the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE SUBJECTS

          1. Participants has been diagnosed with one of the following neurodegenerative diseases:
             Frontotemporal Degeneration, Primary Progressive Aphasia, Corticobasal Degeneration,
             Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease,
             Posterior Cortical Atrophy, Parkinson's Disease, Parkinson's Disease Dementia,
             Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Multiple Systems Atrophy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or
             Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Frontotemporal Degeneration.

          2. Participants will be 18 years of age or older

          3. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures. If the subject is unable to provide informed consent,
             the subject's legal representative may consent on behalf of the patient but the
             patient will be asked to confirm assent.

          4. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging
             procedures.

          5. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is required prior to the first [18F]T807 PET/CT scan. If
             the participant has had an ECG completed within 3 months prior to the enrollment date,
             the ECG may be used for this study, if not; an ECG will be completed as part of this
             study's activities at screening. At each longitudinal visit participants will be
             queried to any changes to their cardiac health since their last visit. If there have
             been changes that put the participant at high risk for Torsades de Pointes an ECG will
             be performed to evaluate for a prolonged QT interval. If the participant has had an
             ECG completed within 3 months prior to the visit date, the ECG may be used for the
             evaluation.

          6. A brain MRI is required to participate in this study. If a brain MRI has been
             performed within 6 months prior to enrollment in this study and is of adequate
             quality, in the judgment of an investigator, the MRI may be used for the study
             analysis. Subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as part of one
             of the Center's other ongoing study protocols.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS

          1. Participants will be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

          3. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging
             procedures.

          4. An ECG is required prior to the first [18F]T807 PET/CT scan. If the participant has
             had an ECG completed within 3 months prior to the enrollment date, the ECG may be used
             for this study, if not; an ECG will be completed as part of this study's activities at
             screening. At each longitudinal visit participants will be queried to any changes to
             their cardiac health since their last visit. If there have been changes that put the
             participant at high risk for Torsades de Pointes an ECG will be performed to evaluate
             for a prolonged QT interval. If the participant has had an ECG completed within 3
             months prior to the visit date, the ECG may be used for the evaluation.

        6. A brain MRI is required to participate in this study. If a brain MRI has been performed
        within 6 months prior to enrollment in this study and is of research quality, that scan may
        be used for the study analysis. Subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain
        MRI as part of one of the Center's other ongoing study protocols.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL SUBJECTS

          1. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of the baseline PET/CT scan
             will not be eligible for this study. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women
             of child-bearing potential at screening and within 24 hours of any scheduled PET/CT or
             MRI scanning

          2. Inability to tolerate or contraindication to imaging procedures in the opinion of an
             investigator or treating physician

          3. QTc &gt; 450 msec on screening ECG.

          4. Any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study

        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS

          1. No pre-existing psychiatric conditions (e.g., active depression, schizophrenia, or
             active anxiety) or neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, head trauma) per
             medical record review or self-report.

          2. No current use of psychoactive medications or substances per medical record review or
             self-report.
