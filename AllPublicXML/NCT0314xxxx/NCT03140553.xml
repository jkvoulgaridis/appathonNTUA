  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both TCH (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab) and EC followed by
      TH(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab) regimens as Neoadjuvant
      Treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer have been recommended by NCCN guideline. It is
      unknown which regimen is better. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCH
      (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab) and EC followed by TH(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide
      followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2-Positive
      breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a surrogate marker for
      survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by number of grade 4 toxicities and
      hospitalizations.
