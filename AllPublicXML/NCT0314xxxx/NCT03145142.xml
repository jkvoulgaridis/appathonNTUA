  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early hemodynamic effects (within 3 hours of life) of Delayed Cord Clamping compared to
      Umbilical Cord Milking are still unknown. Four sites experienced in the use of NIRS and who
      have appropriate data collection equipment in the delivery room (Alberta, Ulm, Cork and San
      Diego) will obtain and report the physiological changes with UCM and DCC from birth until 24
      hours of life. This data will yield the largest available sample of continuously recorded
      heart rate, cerebral tissue oxygenation, peripheral oxygen saturation, airway pressure, and
      administered FiO2 to delineate the short term responses to two methods of placental
      transfusion. In our initial trial we demonstrated increased blood pressure from 3-15 HOL with
      UCM compared to DCC in premature newborns &lt;32 weeks, but did not show any differences in
      cerebral oxygenation.

  <detailed_description>

      This substudy will include 400 infants &lt;28 weeks GA enrolled in the PREMOD2 trial. Once the
      newborn has been delivered, received the intervention (UCM or DCC), and been placed on the
      resuscitation bed a NIRS sensor and a pulse oximeter will be placed within 60 seconds. While
      arterial saturation and heart rate data will be available to the clinical team, data from
      NIRS will be blinded. Data on all study infants will be recorded for at least the first 10
      minutes in the delivery room, and then for 24 hours in the NICU. Heart rate, oxygen
      saturations, and cerebral oxygenation, will be downloaded as per each site's practice for
      neonatal resuscitation.
