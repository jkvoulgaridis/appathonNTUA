  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether
      the use of the COach2Quit application (app) reduces smoking more than brief advice for
      smoking cessation. The investigators hypothesize that real time biomarker feedback and
      messaging support from the COach2Quit app will lead to greater smoking cessation rates than
      brief anti-smoking advice alone. If effective, the COach2Quit app could be an easily
      accessible and cost-effective tool to help smokers quit. The findings from this trial could
      have implications for the delivery of future outpatient smoking cessation programs.

      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of the novel
      COach2Quit smartphone application by determining whether the use of this app reduces smoking
      more than brief anti-smoking advice alone. This will be a two-arm individually randomized
      trial and participants who are currently smoking will be assigned 1:1 to either study arm.
      Smoking behavior will be measured through self-report at baseline, 2-week and 1-month follow
      up visits. Smoking behavior will also be verified by 2 biomarker measurements: carbon
      monoxide breath test and urine cotinine, collected at baseline, 2-week and 1-month follow-up
      visits. In addition, participants will receive weekly follow-up calls. The primary outcome
      will be smoking cessation at the 1-month follow-up visit.

    <description>A point of care test for measuring carbon monoxide (CO) will be conducted via the piCO Smokerlyzer from OPS Medical, designed specifically for smoking cessation programs and tobacco control programs. Carbon monoxide will be measured in an exhaled breath in parts-per-million (ppm). A reading of ≤ 10ppm will indicate abstinence.</description>

    <measure>Reasons for Quitting Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We used the Reasons for Quitting (RFQ) scale to measure motivation to quit smoking. The scale is used to measure intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for quitting smoking. Each item in the scale is evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale regarding how true the statement is about the participant's motivation to quit smoking (Not at all true, a little bit true, moderately true, quite true, extremely true). Each option takes on a numerical score from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (extremely true). Scores are summed across all items in the scale and divided by the number of items in the scale to obtain the RFQ score. The range of possible scores is 0 to 4. A higher score indicates greater motivation to quit smoking.</description>

          <title>Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence</title>
          <description>We used the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) to measure nicotine dependence.
The measure consists of 6 Questions. Each question has multiple response options out of which one option must be selected. Each option carries a corresponding numerical score. The scores for each question are summed to obtain a total score. The range of possible scores is 1 to 10, with a higher value indicating greater nicotine dependence (worse outcome).
The interpretation of scores is as follows:
1-2: low dependence 3-4: low to moderate dependence 5-7: moderate dependence 8+: high dependence</description>

Carbon monoxide will be measured in an exhaled breath in parts-per-million (ppm). A reading of ≤ 10ppm will indicate abstinence.</description>

        <title>Reasons for Quitting Scale</title>
        <description>We used the Reasons for Quitting (RFQ) scale to measure motivation to quit smoking. The scale is used to measure intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for quitting smoking. Each item in the scale is evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale regarding how true the statement is about the participant's motivation to quit smoking (Not at all true, a little bit true, moderately true, quite true, extremely true). Each option takes on a numerical score from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (extremely true). Scores are summed across all items in the scale and divided by the number of items in the scale to obtain the RFQ score. The range of possible scores is 0 to 4. A higher score indicates greater motivation to quit smoking.</description>
