    <textblock>
      Carotid stenosis of atherosclerotic origin may be responsible for stroke, which is one of the
      most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. The constitution of
      the atheroma plaque is linked to the deregulation of several biological phenomena, including
      angiogenesis, adipogenesis, inflammatory response, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In
      addition to its anatomical and physiological characteristics, the notion of plate stability
      is of paramount importance for clinical implications. This stability depends largely on the
      biological composition of the plate. A vulnerable or unstable plaque often has a large lipid
      body consisting of foam cells (macrophages laden with oxidized LDL) with a thin fibrous
      screed consisting of smooth muscle cells (CML), collagen fibers and extracellular matrix.
      This plaque is also made up of numerous inflammatory cells including macrophages, rich
      vascularization and intraplate hemorrhage. Although the cell composition of the unstable
      plate is still relatively established, its molecular analysis remains little known.

      The benefit of carotid surgery in asymptomatic patients with stenosis greater than 70% is
      increasingly controversial given the moderate risk of spontaneous stroke under optimal
      medical treatment. This annual average risk is less than 5%. Thus, the discovery of an
      original and innovative biomarker, predictive of plate rupture, would define the patients
      most at risk, who benefit most from this surgery.
