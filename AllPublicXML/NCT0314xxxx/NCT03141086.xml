  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to demonstrate that LML134 can increase wakefulness
      compared to placebo in patients with shift work disorder (SWD) measured by objective and
      subjective endpoints of wakefulness, i.e. the sleep latency in the multiple sleep latency
      test (MSLT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), respectively. Safety and PK of LML134
      were also evaluated. In addition, novel methodologies to measure wakefulness and sleep were
      also to be tested and compared to gold standard methods like the MSLT and polysomnography
      (PSG) (at sites where staff have appropriate equipment and training). The aim of such
      comparisons was to evaluate the usefulness of the new technologies in clinical studies and
      provide preliminary validation data.

      This was a randomized, subject and investigator-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover,
      multi-center Proof of Concept (PoC) study with in-house simulated laboratory night shifts in
      patients with SWD. This non-confirmatory study included two treatment arms: LML134 and
      placebo. After a screening period, the treatment phase of the study consisted of two
      overnight stays in a sleep lab in each of two treatment periods, with a minimum one week
      wash-out in between.

    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2 of each treatment period (midnight until 8:00)</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the ability of a subject to remain awake. Long latencies to sleep are indicative of a patient's ability to remain awake. Mean sleep latency from MSLT was measured for four MSLT naps performed at scheduled timepoints (01:30, 03:30, 05:30, and 07:30). The primary efficacy variable was the mean MSLT sleep latency assessed at Day 1 and Day 2 of each treatment period.</description>

          -  Heavy caffeine consumers, i.e. subjects who consume greater than 850 mg of caffeine

        <title>Mean Sleep Latency Over Two Consecutive Test Nights as Measured by the the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the ability of a subject to remain awake. Long latencies to sleep are indicative of a patient's ability to remain awake. Mean sleep latency from MSLT was measured for four MSLT naps performed at scheduled timepoints (01:30, 03:30, 05:30, and 07:30). The primary efficacy variable was the mean MSLT sleep latency assessed at Day 1 and Day 2 of each treatment period.</description>

        <title>Latency to Onset of Persistent Sleep Measured by Polysomnography (PSG)</title>
        <description>PSG encompasses the monitoring of subjects in a sleep facility using an array of medical equipment with simultaneously recording on a multi-channel analog or digital system. PSG was performed in the study to record and evaluate various aspects of sleep. Latency to onset of persistent sleep is defined as latency from Lights-Off to the first epoch (30 seconds) of 20 consecutive epochs of non-Wake.</description>

        <description>N1: is defined by a relatively low amplitude, mixed frequency EEG. N2: is defined by the presence of sleep spindles and/or K complexes and the absence of sufficient high-amplitude, slow activity to define the presence of stage N3 sleep.
N3: is defined as an EEG with at least 20% of an epoch consisting of slow, high amplitude waveforms of .5 - 2 Hz and peak-to-peak amplitude of greater than 75mV.
REM: is defined by the concomitant appearance of relatively low amplitude, mixed frequency EEG activity and episodes of rapid eye movement. Sawtooth waves may be present. Chin EMG activity is typically low.</description>
