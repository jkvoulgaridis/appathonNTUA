      This study aims to research on the association between the inclination of the proximal
      tibiofibular joint surface and medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. The proximal
      tibiofibular joint radiographs of the participants will be taken. The angle of inclination of
      the proximal tibiofibular joint surface in two groups will be compared.

    <textblock>
      The nonuniform settlement of the tibial plateau has been introduced to explain the
      development of knee varus and medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. It is believed that the
      lateral support of the fibula to the tibial plateau leads to the nonuniform settlement and
      degeneration of the plateau bilaterally.

      Bone mass decreases as part of the normal aging process. Varying degrees of settlement of
      bone mass exist in the load-bearing joints, such as the knees, hips, ankles, and spine. In
      the proximal tibia, the lateral support of the fibula to the lateral tibial plateau routinely
      leads to nonuniform settlement, which is more severe in the medial plateau than in the
      lateral plateau. The slope of the tibial plateau arising from nonuniform settlement results
      in a transverse shearing force, with the femoral condyle shifting medially during walking and
      sports. Furthermore, side-slip aggravates the nonuniform settlement of the tibial plateau,
      especially in the medial plateau. Accordingly, a cycle of increasing the load distribution in
      the medial compartment and nonuniform settlement occurs. This results in the load from the
      normal distribution shifting farther medially to the medial plateau and consequently leads to
      knee varus, aggravating the progression of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

      However, the angle of inclination of the proximal tibiofibular joint surface in different
      individuals varied widely. The angle of inclination of the proximal tibiofibular joint may
      affect the nonuniform settlement of the bilateral tibial plateau.

      A sample size power analysis was conducted before the study, which revealed that a minimum of
      39 subjects per group was needed to achieve statistical significance with two-sided α=0.05
      and 1-ß=0.80 and an assumed mean differences between two groups = 65% of the standard
      deviation.
