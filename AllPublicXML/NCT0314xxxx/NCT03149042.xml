    <textblock>
      Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) contrast opacification gradients and FFR-CT
      estimation can aid in the severity estimation of significant atherosclerotic lesions.
      Currently, FFR-CT algorithms can only be optimized using theoretical models and can only be
      validated in large multi-center clinical trials. Using patient specific 3D printed coronary
      phantoms would allow optimization of FFR-CT algorithms with a measured validation technique
      without the need for large clinical trials. Thus the investigators believe that this study
      will result in a FFR-CT algorithm/method with a better predictability for arterial lesion
      severity than those existing on the market today. Flow measurements will be compared with:
      CT-FFR for both patients and phantoms, angio lab FFR measurements and 30 days follow-up. This
      pilot clinical study includes ~50 patients over a year and half at GVI.

      Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) contrast opacification gradients and FFR-CT
      estimation can aid in the severity estimation of significant atherosclerotic lesions.
      Following this trend, the investigators recently developed a collaboration between Brigham
      and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Gates Vascular Institute (GVI). The investigators 3D-printed
      patient specific coronary phantoms at (GVI) and scanned them with a Toshiba Aquilion scanner
      to test several aspects of the contrast opacification gradients using a method established at
      BWH. The initial results showed strong correlation between the flow in the phantom and
      opacification gradients. The investigators believe that this approach could be further
      developed to test and validate FFR-CT algorithms. Currently, FFR-CT algorithms can only be
      optimized using theoretical models and can only be validated in large multi-center clinical
      trials. This phantom approach would allow optimization of FFR-CT algorithms with a measured
      validation technique without the need for large clinical trials. Thus the investigators
      believe that this study will result in a FFR-CT algorithm/method with a better predictability
      for arterial lesion severity than those existing on the market today. The approach is to use
      the infrastructure at GVI to perform a detailed validation of the FFR-CT method using 3D
      printed patient specific phantoms. The subject enrollment criteria is: at least one CCTA, at
      least one lesion with &gt;50% stenosis or 30-50% and an angio based FFR. Each patient will have
      a 3D phantom printed, containing the culprit lesion and used in a benchtop flow analysis.
      Flow measurements will be compared with: CT-FFR for both patients and phantoms, angio lab FFR
      measurements and 30 days follow-up. This pilot clinical study will include ~50 patients over
      a year and half at GVI. The investigators are confident that this approach performed via
      3D-phantom testing will prove the validity of FFR-CT based measurements as well as develop a
      new standard for validating FFR-CT algorithms.

    <description>Patient CCTA images were imported into Vitrea segmentation software (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN) for use in the research-based CT based FFR algorithm. The software analyzes four data volumes acquired a 70%, 80%, 90% and 99% of the R-R interval and computes the FFR based on the changes in vessel diameter and computational fluid dynamics. Within the algorithm, the aortic root and three main coronary arteries (LAD, LCX, and RCA) were automatically segmented, and then manually adjusted to obtain accurate centerline and contours. The CT based FFR was calculated and the user adjusted the location of the distal pressure measurement to calculate the CT basedFFR at the same location as Invasive-FFR, two lesion lengths below the distal end of the lesion.
Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic were measured where an Invasive FFR&lt;=0.8 was considered positive.</description>

    <description>CT images were used to measure CT-FFR and to generate patient-specific 3D printed models of the aortic root and three main coronary arteries. Each patient-specific 3D printed model was connected to a programmable pulsatile pump and bench-top FFR (B-FFR) was derived from pressures measured proximal and distal to coronary stenosis using pressure transducers. B-FFR was measured for hyperemic&quot;, 500 mL/min by adjusting the model's distal coronary resistance. Linear regression and Pearson correlation was calculated.</description>

          <title>Coronary Calcium Score</title>
          <description>The Coronary Calcium Score also referred as Agatston score is calculated using a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan to measure for the presence and severity of coronary artery disease through identification of calcification in the coronary arteries. Scores can range from 0 to several thousands. The measure is without units. Score categories are as follows: 0 = no coronary disease; 1-100 = low amount of coronary artery disease; 101-400 = moderately elevated score / moderate coronary artery disease; 401-1000 = severely elevated score; &gt;1000 very severely elevated score</description>

        <title>Comparison of CT Based FFR With Invasive FFR, ROC Analysis</title>
        <description>Patient CCTA images were imported into Vitrea segmentation software (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN) for use in the research-based CT based FFR algorithm. The software analyzes four data volumes acquired a 70%, 80%, 90% and 99% of the R-R interval and computes the FFR based on the changes in vessel diameter and computational fluid dynamics. Within the algorithm, the aortic root and three main coronary arteries (LAD, LCX, and RCA) were automatically segmented, and then manually adjusted to obtain accurate centerline and contours. The CT based FFR was calculated and the user adjusted the location of the distal pressure measurement to calculate the CT basedFFR at the same location as Invasive-FFR, two lesion lengths below the distal end of the lesion.
Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic were measured where an Invasive FFR&lt;=0.8 was considered positive.</description>
        <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
        <population>From the total number of patients, nine patients had multi-vessel disease and I-FFR was measured in two vessels. In total I-FFR was measured in: 42 LADs, 11 LCXs and 8 RCAs. Invasive -FFR measurement location was from the ostium to two lesion lengths below the distal throat of the lesion .</population>

          <description>Patient CCTA images were imported into Vitrea segmentation software (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN) for use in the research-based CT based FFR algorithm. The software analyzes four data volumes acquired a 70%, 80%, 90% and 99% of the R-R interval and computes the FFR based on the changes in vessel diameter and computational fluid dynamics. Within the algorithm, the aortic root and three main coronary arteries (LAD, LCX, and RCA) were automatically segmented, and then manually adjusted to obtain accurate centerline and contours. The CT based FFR was calculated and the user adjusted the location of the distal pressure measurement to calculate the CT basedFFR at the same location as Invasive-FFR, two lesion lengths below the distal end of the lesion.
Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic were measured where an Invasive FFR&lt;=0.8 was considered positive.</description>
          <population>From the total number of patients, nine patients had multi-vessel disease and I-FFR was measured in two vessels. In total I-FFR was measured in: 42 LADs, 11 LCXs and 8 RCAs. Invasive -FFR measurement location was from the ostium to two lesion lengths below the distal throat of the lesion .</population>

        <title>Comparison of Bench-top FFR Using 3D Printed Patient Specific Phantoms With Invasive FFR, Pearson Correlation</title>
        <description>CT images were used to create patient specific 3d-printed phantom. Each patient-specific 3D printed model was connected to a programmable pulsatile pump and benchtop FFR (B-FFR) was derived from pressures measured proximal and distal to coronary stenosis using pressure transducers. B-FFR was measured for hyperemic&quot;, 500 mL/min by adjusting the model's distal coronary resistance. Benchtop-FFR was compared with Invasive-FFR. Pearson Correlation factor was calculated.</description>
        <time_frame>4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
        <population>From the total number of patients, nine patients had multi-vessel disease and Invasive-FFR was measured in two vessels. In total I-FFR was measured in: 42 LADs, 11 LCXs and 8 RCAs. Bench-top FFR was measured at the same locations as Invasive -FFR, from the ostium to two lesion lengths below the distal throat of the lesion .</population>
