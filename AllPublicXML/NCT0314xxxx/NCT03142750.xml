    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy tube (G-tube) complications, such as granulation tissue formation and tube
      dislodgements, are frequent causes of emergency department visits. The investigators have
      developed two G-tube dressing designs using commercially available materials and products to
      decrease the risk of G-tube related complications. The investigators aim in this study is to
      pilot two novel G-tube dressings in patients with pre-existing G-tubes to gain parental
      feedback on device designs, ease of use and G-tube stability in preparation for a final
      design and trial. Based on the feedback, further iterations will be developed and trialed in
      eligible study subjects.

    <textblock>
      In order to address complications associated with gastrostomy buttons (G-buttons) or tubes
      (G-tubes) in children, the investigators developed two multi-component securement dressings.
      The purpose of this study is to try these dressings and obtain parental feedback.

      This will involve survey using questionnaires before and after the use of two different
      G-tube dressings. Eligible patients will be identified by a nurse practitioner or attending
      surgeon. The researcher will obtain consent from the patient or their parents/legal guardian.
      The investigators will ask a series of questions regarding their current experience dressing
      and maintaining G-tube stomas. A week supply of each new prototype dressing will be provided
      to the patient or parent. Caregivers will be educated on the use of each dressing and will be
      given a number to call should they have any questions or concerns. The dressings will be
      changed daily and as needed. Once the patient is enrolled and provided with dressings, the
      investigators will perform a follow up telephone interview at one week to evaluate their
      experience and ensure they did not experience any adverse events. Caregivers will be given a
      second questionnaire to collect feedback on the dressings after two weeks either in person or
      over the telephone. They will be asked to choose their preferred dressing, provide feedback
      on advantages and disadvantages of each type and report adverse events. For inpatients, the
      investigators will obtain opinions from parents, patients, nurses and doctors. Photographs
      will be obtained at each outpatient visit or during the inpatient period for objective
      comparison.

      Once more iterations are developed, they will undergo the same clinical trial process
      (involving 10-15 subjects).

    <description>Overall satisfaction of the current dressings used at baseline were assessed using a qualitative questionnaire. Questionnaires queried the level of agreement in the following aspects: overall satisfaction, ease of use, adequate level of security for the G-button, adherence to skin, ability to absorb leakage, cost, availability at drug store, allergenic potential and reusability. Answer choices to measure level of satisfaction were: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. Surveys also included open-ended questions about participant satisfaction. Survey responses were evaluated and determined to indicate &quot;Satisfied&quot; or &quot;Not Satisfied&quot; by the Investigators.This measurement reflects participants satisfaction with whatever dressing they were currently using at baseline, not with the study interventions to which they were assigned.</description>

    <description>Overall satisfaction of the dressings when assessed using a qualitative questionnaire. Questionnaires queried the level of agreement in the following aspects: overall satisfaction, ease of use, adequate level of security for the G-button, ease of connecting and disconnecting the feeding tube, reduction in leakage, painless device removal, improvement in gastrostomy wound appearance, preference over the traditional dressing, and whether they would purchase the securement device if it was commercially available. Answer choices to measure level of satisfaction were: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. Surveys also included open-ended questions about participant satisfaction. Survey responses were evaluated and determined to indicate &quot;Satisfied&quot; or &quot;Not Satisfied&quot; by the Investigators.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Satisfied With Current Dressings</title>
        <description>Overall satisfaction of the current dressings used at baseline were assessed using a qualitative questionnaire. Questionnaires queried the level of agreement in the following aspects: overall satisfaction, ease of use, adequate level of security for the G-button, adherence to skin, ability to absorb leakage, cost, availability at drug store, allergenic potential and reusability. Answer choices to measure level of satisfaction were: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. Surveys also included open-ended questions about participant satisfaction. Survey responses were evaluated and determined to indicate &quot;Satisfied&quot; or &quot;Not Satisfied&quot; by the Investigators.This measurement reflects participants satisfaction with whatever dressing they were currently using at baseline, not with the study interventions to which they were assigned.</description>

Questionnaires queried the level of agreement in the following aspects: overall satisfaction, ease of use, adequate level of security for the G-button, ease of connecting and disconnecting the feeding tube, reduction in leakage, painless device removal, improvement in gastrostomy wound appearance, preference over the traditional dressing, and whether they would purchase the securement device if it was commercially available. Answer choices to measure level of satisfaction were: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. Surveys also included open-ended questions about participant satisfaction.
