      LPS Challenge in Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to understand the biological differences between two distinct
      subtypes of depression, patients with and without inflammation as defined by c-reactive
      protein (CRP). Using a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo-controlled design,
      participants will be phenotyped before and after a low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      challenge designed to perturb the immune system and trigger a transient, mild inflammatory
      response. This experimental design will allow for the delineation of the homeostatic
      mechanisms underlying sensitivity to inflammation-related depression. Low-dose LPS has been
      used by multiple groups to safely induce transient inflammatory responses in humans. The
      pilot study is expected to take approximately one year to complete.

    <description>The SHAPS is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire, with each item scored from 1-4 (strongly agree through strongly disagree; range 14-56), with higher scores indicating greater anticipatory, not consummatory, anhedonia. Disagreement (i.e. score of 3 or 4) on at least three items is defined as indicating clinically significant anhedonia.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Depressed participants will be required to be in good general health (as evaluated during
        Visit 1, including EKG) and to be 18-55 years of age. Depressed participants will be
        required to have symptoms of depression (i.e. a PHQ-9 score ≥10) and be unmedicated for at
        least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine) or treated with only one anti-depressant medication.
        Half the depressed participants (N=50) will be required to have a high-sensitivity
        C-Reactive Protein (CRP) score of ≥3 mg/L, and half the participants will be required to
        have a CRP score of ≤1 mg/L.
