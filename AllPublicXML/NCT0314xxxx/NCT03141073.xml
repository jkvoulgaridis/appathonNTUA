  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety and population PK of HMS5552 add-on to Metformin
      in adult type 2 diabetic subjects. There will be 2 groups in the first 24 weeks, one group
      will receive HMS5552 plus Metformin, while the other group will receive placebo plus
      Metformin; after 24 weeks, all subjects will receive HMS5552 plus Metformin for 28 weeks.

      This study is a phase III study in subjects with T2DM. As designed, the study will start with
      a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period based on diet and exercise interventions for
      screening eligible subjects, meanwhile, subjects are treated with Metformin (Glucophage) at
      1500mg/day as basic therapy throughout the treatment period. 3 weeks after run-in,
      eligibility is confirmed with required laboratory tests at -5±2 days prior to randomization.
      The eligible subjects are randomly assigned to HMS5552 75mg BID group or placebo BID group
      with ratio 1:1 to receive a 24-week double-blind treatment. Then all subjects receive 28-week
      open-label treatment of HMS5552 75mg BID add-on to Metformin. After 52-week treatment, all
      investigational drugs should be discontinued, followed by 1 week for safety evaluation. The
      dosage of Metformin (Glucophage) should be maintained at 1500 mg/day from run-in period to
      treatment completion.
