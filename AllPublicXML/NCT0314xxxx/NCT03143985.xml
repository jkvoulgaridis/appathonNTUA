  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, called Vactosertib, is safe and
      determine what the best dose is to treat future patients when given in combination with
      pomalidomide (POM). The study will also look to see if it has any effect on multiple myeloma,
      when given in combination with POM.

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum tested dose level of
           Vactosertib given in combination with pomalidomide (POM) for the treatment of relapsed
           or relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of Vactosertib in combination with
           POM at the MTD

      Secondary Objectives

      To evaluate the activity of the combination of Vactosertib/POM regimen in terms of:

        -  Overall response rate (complete response [CR] + very good partial response [VGPR]
           +partial response [PR]) and clinical benefit rate (CR + VGPR + PR + minimal response
           [MR]) based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria and
           the duration of response (DOR) in RRMM patients.

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6)

      Exploratory Objective:

      To evaluate the bone remodeling and immunologic effects of POM/Vactosertib combination
      therapy and its correlation with clinical outcome in patients with multiple myeloma.

      Study Design To evaluate the bone remodeling and immunologic effects of POM/Vactosertib
      combination therapy and its correlation with clinical outcome in patients with multiple
      myeloma. This study is a Phase I, open label trial of Vactosertib in combination with
      standard doses of POM. The study will be conducted as a modified Fibonacci 3 + 3 dose
      escalation design to determine the MTD of Vactosertib in combination with standard doses of
      POM. Patients will receive combination Vactosertib/POM.

    <description>Vactosertib tablets, taken once daily for the first and second dose levels and twice a day for third and fourth dose level levels for 5 days followed by 2 days without treatment, repeated for 28-day cycles until evidence of progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or participant discontinuation.
For dose escalation - dosing initiated at 60 mg once daily by oral administration and will be increased to determine MTD. Provisional subsequent doses are 60, 120, once daily and 100 mg and 200 mg twice daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26. Extension cohorts will enter at 200 mg twice daily (i.e. if MTD not defined) for 12 months until progression or intolerable toxicity.
POM is administered orally (4 mg/day daily on Days 1 - 21 days). Treatment will occur in a suitable outpatient ambulatory care setting that is equipped for monitoring of patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing early clinical trial research.</description>

    <description>Vactosertib is an inhibitor of protein serine/threonine kinase activity of TGF-β receptor type 1 (TGFBR1; ALK5). Vactosertib inhibits the phosphorylation of the ALK5 substrates, Smad2 and Smad3, and the intracellular signaling of TGF-β. Dosing begins at 60mg by mouth, daily and may increase to 240mg by mouth daily in the absence of dose limiting toxicities</description>

    <description>POM, an analog of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic activity. Myeloma tumor cells exposed to POM, undergo growth arrest and increased apoptotic cell death. POM enhances T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated immunity and inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. POM may be taken orally with water. Capsules should not be broken, chewed or opened. POM should be taken without food (at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal). POM will be commercially available. POM will be taken by mouth at a dose of 4mg per day</description>
