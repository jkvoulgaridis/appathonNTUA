  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that poor cerebral perfusion during critical
      illness is a risk factor for acute and long-term neurological dysfunction among survivors. We
      use near-infrared spectroscopy to measure brain tissue oxygenation as a non-invasive
      surrogate marker for cerebral perfusion. Acute neurological dysfunction is defined as the
      presence of delirium, which is assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care
      Unit (CAM-ICU). Chronic neurological dysfunction is defined as having quantitative
      impairments on robotic testing (KINARM robot) and traditional neuropsychological screening
      (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status).

    <measure>Regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) and delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Multivariate linear regression will be used to characterize the association between poor cerebral perfusion (as measured using duration of time (minutes) outside of MAPOPT, mean rSO2, and duration of disturbed cerebral autoregulation) and delirium severity to determine if poor cerebral perfusion is an independent predictor of delirium severity. We will estimate the unadjusted effect of each individual predictor on delirium severity (i.e., cumulative CAM-7 scores per patient). The simultaneous multivariate regression model will adjust for the following covariates (sex, a history of hypertension, a history of alcohol abuse, total sedative dose (in midazolam equivalents), total narcotic dose (fentanyl equivalents), severity of illness (APACHE II scores), pre-existing cognitive impairment (CDR score), length of ICU stay, and blood urea nitrogen. The multivariable model will provide the adjusted regression coefficients after controlling for all predictors included in the model.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of secondary outcomes-physiological determinants of cerebral oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the physiological determinants of rSO2, multiple linear regression will be performed using the patient average of each variable over the 72 hour data collection period. The following predictors will be included in the regression model: heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), MAP, arterial blood gas data (i.e., pH, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide), central venous oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin concentration (Hb). In addition, the multivariate model will control for the following covariates associated with cerebral perfusion: sex, age, as well as total sedative, narcotic, and vasopressor dosing. Simultaneous multiple linear regression with adjustment for all aforementioned covariates will be implemented. A within patient repeated measures analysis will also be performed by using the linear mixed effects model with 6 observations per subject reflecting each 12 hour period during the 72 hour data collection period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral oxygenation as an independent risk factor for long-term cognitive impairment-RBANS</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple linear regression analysis will be used to assess if poor cerebral perfusion (i.e. time below MAPOPT, mean rSO2, duration of disturbed cerebral autoregulation) is associated with RBANS global cognition scores at 3- and 12-months post-ICU discharge. We will use the following clinical covariates collected on admission (i.e., pre-existing cognitive impairment, age, severity of illness) and data collected within the first 72 hours of the patients' ICU stay (i.e., narcotic dosing and benzodiazepine dosing). All covariates will be adjusted for in separate regression models for the cognitive outcomes at 3- and 12-months post-ICU discharge. If global cognition is significantly predicted by the impaired cerebral perfusion, we will conduct an exploratory analysis of the RBANS subdomains of cognition (i.e., delay and immediate memory, language, attention, visuospatial/constructional) adjusting for the aforementioned covariates to further explore specific domains of impairment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time outside optimal MAP</measure>
    <time_frame>72h, 3- and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>We define the optimal MAP as the MAP at which there is no statistically significant correlation between MAP and rSO2. The time outside the optimal MAP will be calculated, and will be assessed as an independent predictor of delirium, and 3- and 12-month cognitive outcomes.</description>
