      Multicentre (Ottawa and Halifax) prospective cohort study using a diagnostic approach in
      patients clinically suspected to have HIT that combines pretest probability assessment with
      quantitative interpretation of anti-PF4 assay.

      The proposed is a prospective cohort study exploring a novel diagnostic approach to Heparin
      Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) using a combination of pretest probability assessment and
      quantitative interpretation of the anti-platelet factor 4 Immunological assay (anti-PF4).
      Patient with a clinical suspicion of HIT will follow the study diagnostic algorithm (Figure
      1). The study algorithm will be considered a safe approach to move forward into a larger RCT
      if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for 'false negative management failures' is
      ≤ 4% based on a Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) gold standard. The main objective of the pilot
      study is to inform feasibility and recruitment barriers for a larger randomized control
      trial.

    <measure>False negative management failures</measure>

    <measure>Major arterial and venous thromboembolism events</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours of baseline and 24 of study enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Events will be ascertained from the date of study consent. However, venous or arterial thrombotic events detected on investigations ordered within 24 hours of study entry will be captured as baseline events and will be counted separately from thrombotic events which occur after the initial 24 hours of study enrolment.</description>

    <description>Testing performed because of symptoms in a patient with (new) non-compressibility of the common femoral vein, popliteal vein or calf trifurcation vein of the leg on ultrasound; or new non-compressibility or visualization of thrombus in the jugular vein, subclavian vein or axillary vein on ultrasound; or an intraluminal defect seen in one more than one view in proximal leg or arm veins on venography will be diagnostic for deep vein thrombosis.</description>

    <description>Testing performed because of symptoms in a patient with a high probability lung scan (i.e. at least one segmental perfusion mismatch) or CT pulmonary angiography (i.e. intraluminal filling defect in the main, lobar or segmental pulmonary arteries) will be diagnostic for pulmonary embolism.</description>
