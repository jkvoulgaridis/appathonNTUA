  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open-label study designed to evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab
      and cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma. Sequential dose escalation of cabozantinib with standard dose pembrolizumab will
      occur in the phase I dose escalation part of the study to determine the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D). Subsequently, subjects will receive cabozantinib at the RP2D in combination with
      pembrolizumab in the phase II dose expansion part of the study.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the efficacy based on objective response rate [ORR = complete response (CR)
           + partial response (PR)] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in
           combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination.

        -  To assess other measures of anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and
           cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

                  lesions.

               -  Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for PD-L1 expression and is
                  therefore not acceptable.

               -  A subject with insufficient or unavailable archival tissue may be eligible, upon
                  discussion with the Principal Investigator, if the subject is willing to consent
