    <description>Clinical response was either success or failure. Success was defined as resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of complicated bacteremia or infective endocarditis (IE) such that no additional antibiotic therapy was required. Failure was defined as: ongoing signs and symptoms considered by the investigator to be related to complicated bacteremia or IE requiring additional antibacterial therapy or unplanned valve replacement, recurrent bacteremia, death during the study period up to Day 84 or discontinuation of the study medication due to an adverse event.</description>

Success was defined as resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of complicated bacteremia or infective endocarditis (IE) such that no additional antibiotic therapy was required. Failure was defined as: ongoing signs and symptoms considered by the investigator to be related to complicated bacteremia or IE requiring additional antibacterial therapy or unplanned valve replacement, recurrent bacteremia, death during the study period up to Day 84 or discontinuation of the study medication due to an adverse event.</description>
