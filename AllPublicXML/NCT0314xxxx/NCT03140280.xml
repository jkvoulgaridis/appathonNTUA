      This is a phase II, single-group pilot study to evaluate efficacy and methylation. This
      study's overarching aim is to evaluate the systemic effects of black raspberries in patients
      with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.
      Twenty-one patients with MDS will be treated with 25 gm (2x/day) of BRB powder taken orally.

      STUDY RATIONALE:

      Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as azacitidine and decitabine are FDA approved therapies
      for MDS patients. Approximately 50% of patients respond to HMAs. In addition, HMAs have
      improved survival and quality of life of patients with MDS when compared with other
      therapies.

      Preclinical research shows black raspberries (BRBs) have hypomethylating effects in the
      colon, blood, spleen, and bone marrow of mice treated with BRBs. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the hypomethylating properties of BRBs in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN for three
      cycles (one cycle = 28 days) of BRB supplementation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the potential hypomethylating effects of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRBs) in
      the peripheral blood of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic
      syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) after three cycles of BRB administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        1. To evaluate the toxicity of BRBs in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN.

        2. To evaluate the hematological response according to modified International Working Group
           (IWG) criteria (Appendix 2) in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN regardless of the initial
           blood count.
