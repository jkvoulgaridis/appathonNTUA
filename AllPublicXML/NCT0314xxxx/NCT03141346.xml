    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a health education program incorporating
      sugar sweetened beverage and juice (SSB/J) reduction and home water delivery affects maternal
      and infant risk for obesity by randomizing mother-infant dyads to one of three 24-month
      interventions: Group 1 (control): standard health education program only; Group 2
      (translation): health education program focused on sugar reduction; and Group 3 (efficacy):
      health education program focused on sugar reduction and bottled water delivery. The
      intervention program will be delivered by trained health educators during in-person home
      visits, or virtually via phone or video calls.

    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a health education program incorporating sugar sweetened
      beverage and juice (SSB/J) reduction and home water delivery affects maternal and infant risk
      for obesity. The postpartum period is a time of both opportunity and vulnerability for
      mothers and their infants to diminish risk for obesity and related health problems. This is
      particularly relevant in the context of Hispanic families. Hispanic mothers are at high-risk
      for excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention, and their infants are at
      high-risk for rapid weight gain associated with early onset obesity. A contributing factor
      may be their intake of SSB/J. There is a high prevalence of reported SSB/J consumption in
      low-income Hispanic households, and Hispanic mothers are more likely to incorporate sweet
      foods during weaning. Because evidence suggests that obese Hispanic children are responsive
      to SSB/J reduction and substitution with non-caloric beverages, this may be a potential
      strategy for Hispanic mothers that may also be beneficial for their infants.

      This study will be conducted in Los Angeles. Two-hundred-and-forty Hispanic mothers and their
      infants will be recruited. They will be randomly assigned to: group 1, a standard health
      education program only; group 2, a health education program that incorporates sugar
      reduction; and group 3, a health education program that incorporates sugar reduction with
      home bottled water delivery. The intervention program will be delivered by trained health
      educators during in-person home visits, or virtually via phone or video calls. The main
      outcomes are maternal weight status and infant weight change. We will also assess maternal
      and infant diet using 24-hour recalls, and maternal feeding style and infant eating behaviors
      using questionnaires.
