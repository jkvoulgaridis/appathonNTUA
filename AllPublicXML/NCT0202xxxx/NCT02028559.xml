    <textblock>
      A feasibility study to test the ability to move kidney stones using focused ultrasound. It is
      the goal of our technology to: a) move stone fragments to a location within the kidney to
      improve their chances of passage, and thus reduce the occurrence of additional symptomatic
      events and retreatment or b) move a symptomatic stone to relieve symptoms and pain.

      Our research group has developed a new, non-invasive technology using low intensity focused
      ultrasound to reposition kidney stones by imparting sufficient acoustic energy to physically
      move a stone. The focused ultrasound pulses are similar to pulses that may be used in
      elastography or acoustic radiation force imaging. Like conventional ultrasound, the probe is
      placed in contact with the patient's skin to image the stone following standard ultrasound
      imaging procedure. The same probe is then used to focus the ultrasound and apply a burst (a
      sequence of pulses) of acoustic force to push the stone. Brightness mode (B-mode) imaging is
      interleaved with the &quot;pushing&quot; pulses (Push-mode) to monitor stone movement. The user
      controls the burst amplitude. For patient safety, there is a slight delay before the operator
      can execute the next push.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of stone displacement caused by ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement occurs at the time of treatment and is evaluated with each treatment pulse. The entire procedure, including screening, is expected to last 1 hour with treatment lasting approximately 30 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is whether the stone moved a distance greater than 2 mm. Measurement is made by positioning calipers on the original stone location and the final stone location on the ultrasound image and measuring the distance between them.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of discomfort or adverse effects of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of treatment, weekly for 3 weeks following treatment (5-10 minute phone call), and follow-up imaging 4-6 weeks after treatment requiring about 1 hour of time.</time_frame>
    <description>The study measures any subject discomfort or adverse response to the device or procedure. The subject will be asked directly what feeling or discomfort, if any, they experienced with each treatment pulse. The subject will be asked to fill out a pain questionnaire before and after the research study. The subject will be contacted for several follow-up phone interviews to assess for adverse events and asked to return for a follow-up imaging examination.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of direction of movement of the stone</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of treatment. To be evaluated with each treatment pulse over a 1 hour study</time_frame>
    <description>We test the ability to move the stone in a pre-determined direction with device application.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of effect of stone size</measure>
    <time_frame>The stone size is measured during prescreening.</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure if fewer large ( &gt; 5 mm) stones move versus small ( &lt; 5 mm) stones.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in acute stone symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes while being evaluated in clinic or in the emergency department.</time_frame>
    <description>We test the ability to move an acute obstructing stone and relieve the emergent symptoms. The study would be done in clinic or the emergency department after the symptoms have been managed.</description>
