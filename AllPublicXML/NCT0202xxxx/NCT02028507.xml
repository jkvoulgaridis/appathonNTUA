    <textblock>
      This is an international (4 countries) randomized phase III study with 2 cohorts, patients
      will be randomized 1:1 to endocrine therapy (cohort 1: exemestane 25 mg daily, cohort 2:
      fulvestrant 500mg days 1 and 15 cycle 1 and then day 1 every 4 weeks) plus palbociclib (125
      mg daily x3 weeks every 4 weeks) vs. capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2 twice daily x2 weeks every 3
      weeks). Postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 MBC are eligible if resistant to previous
      nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) (letrozole or anastrozole) in cohort 1 or previous
      aromatase inhibitors (AI) (letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane) in cohort 2 defined as:
      recurrence while on or within 12 months after the end of adjuvant treatment with NSAI/AI or
      progression while on or within 1 month after the end of treatment with NSAI/AI for MBC.
      Previous chemotherapy is permitted either in the (neo)adjuvant setting and/or as first line
      for MBC. Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 or bone lesions, lytic
      or mixed, in the absence of measurable disease.

      296 patients have been randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm (Arm A: approximately 125
      patients treated with palbociclib plus exemestane) and the control arm (Arm B: approximately
      125 patients treated with capecitabine) before the approval of this protocol version (Cohort
      1).

      Approximately 300 patients will be randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm (Arm A:
      approximately 150 patients treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant) and the control arm
      (Arm B: approximately 150 patients treated with capecitabine) from the approval of this
      protocol version (Cohort 2).

    <description>The primary efficacy variable is PFS based on the investigator's assessment. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease based on the investigator's assessment, using RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) mutational status will be determined in circulating free DNA (cDNA) obtained from baseline plasma samples and will be prospectively determined before the interims or final analyses. ESR1 mutational status will be blinded to the patients, investigators and study team.</description>

Tumor assessment will be performed at baseline, the same method of measurement used at baseline will be used for further evaluations, that will be conducted every 8 weeks (±7days). The best response across treatment will be recorded. OR is defined as the complete plus partial responses out of the patients who had measurable disease at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Outcomes: biomarkers related to breast tumor sensitivity and/or resistance to palbociclib (e.g., Ki67, p16/CDKN2A, pRb, CyclinD and others) or breast cancer (e.g. PTEN, ERBB2, BRCA 1 and BRCA2).</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately September 2019</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline biomarker values from most recently obtained tumor tissue (deeply recommended from metastatic tumor) will be used for central assessment of biomarkers related to breast tumor sensitivity and/or resistance to palbociclib (e.g., Ki67, p16/CDKN2A, pRb, CyclinD and others) or breast cancer (e.g. PTEN, ERBB2, BRCA1 and BRCA2). A whole blood sample will be collected for potential pharmacogenomic analyses related to drug response or adverse drug reactions. For example, putative safety biomarkers, drug metabolizing enzyme genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the drug mechanism of action may be examined. Correlative plasma samples will be collected for exploratory analysis to analyze the pharmacodynamic (PD) treatment effects on circulating free DNA or RNA and explore specific breast cancer and efficacy predictive biomarkers (e.g. PIK3CA mutation). Sample will be collected from all patients, unless prohibited by local regulations.</description>
