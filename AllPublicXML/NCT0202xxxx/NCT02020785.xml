  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phosphorus-based food additives are commonly used by food manufacturers for many
      applications, such as enhancing flavor, in ready-to-eat foods and beverages. While these
      additives can significantly increase an individual's daily phosphorus intake, little is known
      about the effect of dietary phosphorus on kidney health. In this study, the investigators
      will first lower baseline phosphorus intake to about 1000mg/d by educating participants to
      avoid foods with phosphorus additives. Then, participants will be randomized to a higher
      phosphorus period (~2gm/d) and a lower phosphorus period (~1gm/d) by providing unaltered,
      commercially-available food/beverage products with and without phosphorus additives.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants will have higher urine albumin excretion and
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) during the higher phosphorus period compared to the
      lower phosphorus period.

      The Study of Dietary Additive Phosphorus on Proteinuria and FGF-23 (SODA-POP) was a
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over study that examined the effect
      of higher vs. lower phosphorus intake for 3 week periods, achieved by addition of
      commercially available diet beverages and breakfast bars to diet on albuminuria and
      fibroblast growth factor 23, in adults with presumed early chronic kidney disease (estimated
      glomerular filtration rate &gt;= 45 ml/min/1.73m2; and urine albumin/creatinine ratio &gt;=17 mg/g
      for men or &gt;=25 mg/g for women).

    <description>Blood pressure was measured at the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3. At each visit, 3 readings were obtained in the seated position by trained and certified observers after 5 minutes of rest with an Omron HEM-907 device (Omron Healthcare Inc, Bannockburn, Ill) using a standardized protocol. We used the average of all blood pressure measurements at the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3 for each period.</description>

        <description>Blood pressure measured at the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3. At each visit, 3 readings were obtained in the seated position by trained and certified observers after 5 minutes of rest with an Omron HEM-907 device (Omron Healthcare Inc, Bannockburn, Ill) using a standardized protocol. We used the average of all these readings taken during end of weeks 1, 2, and 3 for each period.</description>

Patients then randomized to higher phosphorus period or lower phosphorus period first.
