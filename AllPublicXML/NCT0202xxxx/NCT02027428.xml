      Maintenance treatment of advanced stage squamous cell NSCLC.

      Phase III, randomized, open-label, multi-center study of nab-paclitaxel with best supportive
      care (BSC) or BSC alone as maintenance treatment after response or stable disease (SD) with
      nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin as induction in subjects with stage IIIB/IV squamous cell
      NSCLC.

      Subjects who discontinued treatment from the maintenance part for any reason other than
      withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or death, were entered into a Follow-up period that
      had a visit 28 days after progression or discontinuation.

      Those who entered Follow-up without progression continued with follow-up scans according to
      standard of care (SOC) until documentation of progression of disease. Additionally, subjects
      were followed for OS by phone approximately every 90 days for a minimum of 18 months, for up
      to approximately 5 years after the last subject was randomized.

Stage 0: the cancer has not spread beyond the inner lining of the lung. Stage I: the cancer is small and hasn't spread to the lymph nodes (LN). Stage II: the cancer has spread to some LN near the original tumor. Stage III: the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or spread to far away LN. Stage IV: the cancer has spread to other organs such as lung, brain, or liver. BLC are displayed for participants randomized in the maintenance phase.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression based on the investigator's assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria (documented by computerized axial tomography [CT scan], not including symptomatic deterioration) or death (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cut-off date of September 15, 2017. RECIST 1.1 Definition: - Complete response (CR) -disappearance of all target lesions; - Partial response (PR) -at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline - Stable disease (SD) -neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease (PD) - Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir, and/or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

RECIST 1.1 Definition: - Complete response (CR) -disappearance of all target lesions; - Partial response (PR) -at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline - Stable disease (SD) -neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease (PD) - Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir, and/or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

        <description>Overall response in the Maintenance was defined as the percentage of participants who showed an improvement in best overall response from stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) during Induction to a Complete Response (CR) or PR during Maintenance according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and confirmed in no less than 28 days. Evaluation takes as reference the lesion measurement or status at the last tumor assessment before randomization to Maintenance. The 95% CI was calculated using Clopper-Pearson method. RECIST 1.1 Definition: - Complete response-disappearance of all target lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. - Partial response-at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline. - Stable disease-neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease.</description>

          <description>Time to confirmed complete or partial response (CR/PR) is defined as the time from day 1 of treatment in Induction to the first occurrence of confirmed CR/PR. Two timeframes are offered: - Time to confirmed response within the Induction timeframe. - Time to Confirmed Response Over the Entire Study, i.e. the time from Day 1 of treatment in Induction to the first occurrence of confirmed CR/PR any time during the study. Only participants with a confirmed CR or PR are included in this summary.</description>

          <title>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Over the Entire Study</title>
          <description>TEAE over entire study is defined as any adverse event (AE) with an onset on or after Day 1 of treatment for the Induction part, and before the treatment discontinuation date plus 28 days, or any serious AE which occurred thereafter but was determined to be related to any study drug by the investigator. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 and the scale: Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life threatening, Grade 5 = Death. Relation to study drug was determined by the investigator.</description>
