    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT) and high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy) to induce renal allograft
      tolerance and thus enable discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy in haploidentical
      living related donor renal transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transplantation is a good treatment for people with end-stage kidney disease. However, there
      is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it working
      for a long time. Unless a person receiving a kidney from someone else takes drugs that reduce
      immune function, the kidney will be rejected. Those drugs must be continued life-long and
      cause many issues. Therefore, tolerance of the transplanted kidney, without chronic rejection
      and without the need for permanent immunosuppressive drug treatment, is a highly desirable
      goal. If this can be achieved, it would make &quot;one kidney for life&quot; possible.

      The study treatment includes several days of study medications followed by a kidney and bone
      marrow transplant. After the transplant, the study treatment will continue with a few more
      doses of study medications and then anti-rejection medication is started. After a while, the
      anti-rejection medication is slowly stopped. Researchers will examine blood and tissue
      samples and try to identify genetic markers for certain conditions like chimerism, response
      to therapy, and tolerance.

      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the
      Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy
      for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed,
      controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can
      result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare
      circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipient participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for this
             study:

               -  Recipient of a first renal allograft from an Human Leukocyte Antigen
                  (HLA)-haploidentical, living related donor. The donor and recipient must be HLA
                  identical for at least one allele (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the
                  following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of this
                  criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient
                  share one HLA haplotype.

               -  Age 18 to 65 years.

               -  Single solid organ recipients (kidney only).

               -  Blood Group System (ABO) compatibility with donor.

               -  Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) will be assessed by the local laboratory 30 days or
                  less prior to transplant using solid phase micro particle technology (by Luminex®
                  phenotype panel or Luminex single antigen bead test.) The following criteria
                  apply:

          -  Participants without detectable DSA will be deemed eligible if they meet other entry
             criteria.

          -  Participants with detectable DSA and a positive flow cytometric crossmatch may undergo
             de-sensitization per standard of care if they are cytotoxic crossmatch negative. Such
             participants must demonstrate a negative flow cytometric crossmatch by day -9 in order
             to receive the first dose of study therapy (ATG). Participants who do not demonstrate
             an acceptable response to de-sensitization by day -9 will be considered screen
             failures and will be terminated from the study.

          -  Participants with a positive cytotoxicity crossmatch will be excluded.

          -  No known history of anti-HLA antibodies. Recipients with low- level anti-HLA
             antibodies not considered to be clinically significant may be eligible, following
             consultation with the Protocol Chairs, the local HLA Laboratory Director, the NIAID
             Medical Monitor and the ITN Clinical Trial Physician.

          -  Negative T and B cell flow crossmatches with the designated donor; as assessed by
             local laboratories. If one or more of the crossmatches is positive, the participant
             will be considered a screen failure unless combined results of antibody and cross
             match testing implicate a non-HLA antibody as the cause of the positive flow
             crossmatch. In this case, the Protocol Chair must approve the participant as a
             screening success after consultation with the local HLA Laboratory Director.

          -  Normal estimated left ventricular ejection fraction and no history of ischemic heart
             disease requiring revascularization, unless cleared by a cardiologist.

          -  Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt; 40% of predicted at
             the screening visit.

          -  Serological evidence of prior Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection as documented by
             positive IgG and negative IgM antibodies against EBV.

          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with
             sensitivity less than 50 Milli-International unit (mIU)/m within 72 hours before the
             start of study medication.

          -  Use of two forms of contraception with less than a 5% failure rate or abstinence by
             all transplanted participants for 18 months after the first dose of study therapy. For
             the first 60 days post-transplant, recipients should be encouraged to use non-hormonal
             contraceptives due to the potential adverse effect of hormones on bone marrow
             engraftment.

          -  Ability to receive oral medication.

          -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent.

          -  All participants must demonstrate a negative QuantiFERON® (QFT) assay result within 52
             weeks of transplant regardless of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) status.
             Participants with a positive QFT assay will not be eligible for the study unless they
             have completed treatment for latent TB and have a negative chest x-ray. QFT testing
             done within 52 weeks before transplant is acceptable as long as there is documentation
             of the results. Prior recipients of a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination are
             not exempt.

          -  Donor participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for this
             study:

               -  HLA-haploidentical, first-degree relatives or half-siblings of the recipient
                  participant at the allele or allele group. The donor and recipient must be HLA
                  identical for at least one allele (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the
                  following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of this
                  criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient
                  share one HLA haplotype.

               -  Age 18 to 65 years.

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;80 ml/minute as measured from a 24 hour urine collection
                  within 26 weeks of the screening visit. If a serum creatinine drawn at the
                  screening visit is &gt; 20% higher than the serum creatinine drawn at the time of
                  the 24 urine collection, the creatinine clearance must be re-evaluated by a
                  repeat 24 hour urine test. If the new value is ≤80mg/dL the donor will be
                  excluded.

               -  Meets institutional selection criteria for organ and bone marrow donation.

               -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent for all study procedures
                  including kidney transplant and bone marrow harvest.

               -  Serologic evidence of prior EBV infection as documented by positive
                  Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and negative Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against
                  EBV.

          <description>Participants were consented, enrolled, fulfilling all study criteria. Participants received three .5, 2, and 2 mg/kg doses of ATG (7-9 days before transplant) pre-medicated with 650 mg acetaminophen, 25 mg diphenhydramine and steroid taper of methylprednisolone, five 30 mg/m^2/day doses of fludarabine (2-6 days before transplant), and two 14.5 mg/kg/day doses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (5-6 days before transplant), along with total body irradiation the day before transplant. Participants received a living renal transplant followed by bone marrow infusion. Two 50 mg/kg/day doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide were given days 3 and 4 post-transplant with MESNA. Filgrastim was given starting on day 5 post-transplant until absolute neutrophil recovery. Standard immunosuppression of tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone began on day 5 post-transplant and given for at least 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from medication over a period of 24-40 weeks.</description>

          <title>Serum Creatinine</title>
          <description>Serum creatinine (Cr) is an indicator of kidney function. Cr is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine.The baseline Cr interval per protocol is defined as the interval prior to immunosuppressive maintenance withdrawal (IMW) initiation.This is the 2 to 4 week interval post-kidney transplant, calculated using the lowest 3 serum Cr values during this pre-defined interval (excluded:days on dialysis). Normal:adult males, 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL; adult females, 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL.</description>

        <description>Operational tolerance is defined as remaining off all immunosuppression 52 weeks after completion of immunosuppression withdrawal, with no evidence of biopsy-proven allograft rejection and, with acceptable renal function defined as a serum creatinine that has increased no more than 25% above baseline at the primary endpoint visit. Baseline creatinine is defined as the average of the lowest three creatinine values during 2 to 4 weeks post-transplant, excluding days on dialysis. The endpoint is summarized with a two-sided, 95% exact binomial confidence interval.</description>

Participants received three .5, 2, and 2 mg/kg doses of ATG (7-9 days before transplant) pre-medicated with 650 mg acetaminophen, 25 mg diphenhydramine and steroid taper of methylprednisolone, five 30 mg/m^2/day doses of fludarabine (2-6 days before transplant), and two 14.5 mg/kg/day doses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (5-6 days before transplant), along with total body irradiation the day before transplant. Participants received a living renal transplant followed by bone marrow infusion. Two 50 mg/kg/day doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide were given days 3 and 4 post-transplant with MESNA. Filgrastim was given starting on day 5 post-transplant until absolute neutrophil recovery. Standard immunosuppression of tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone began on day 5 post-transplant and given for at least 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from medication over a period of 24-40 weeks.</description>

        <title>Duration in Days of Graft-versus-Host Disease in Transplanted Participants</title>
        <description>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a medical complication that can occur after a person receives transplanted tissue, most commonly occurring after a bone marrow transplant. The white blood cells from the donated tissue recognize the tissue recipient's cells as foreign. These donor cells then attack the recipient's cells. Duration (in days) is measured as the time from the start of the GVHD event to the end of the GVHD event.</description>

Participants received three .5, 2, and 2 mg/kg doses of ATG (7-9 days before transplant) pre-medicated with 650 mg acetaminophen, 25 mg diphenhydramine and steroid taper of methylprednisolone, five 30 mg/m^2/day doses of fludarabine (2-6 days before transplant), and two 14.5 mg/kg/day doses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (5-6 days before transplant), along with total body irradiation the day before transplant. Participants received a living renal transplant followed by bone marrow infusion. Two 50 mg/kg/day doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide were given days 3 and 4 post-transplant with MESNA. Filgrastim was given starting on day 5 post-transplant until absolute neutrophil recovery. Standard immunosuppression of tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone began on day 5 post-transplant and given for at least 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from medication over a period of 24-40 weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Transplanted Participants With Engraftment Syndrome</title>
        <description>Engraftment syndrome is a complication that can occur following bone marrow transplant. The presence of engraftment syndrome is diagnosed by monitoring the common symptoms, which include: fever, rash, fluid in the lungs, and serum creatinine values above 4 mg/dL occurring within a week of absolute neutrophil recovery (e.g., first day after three consecutive daily absolute neutrophil counts ≥ 500 per µL), without apparent other cause.</description>

            <description>Participants were consented, enrolled, and fulfilled all study criteria. Participants received three .5, 2, and 2 mg/kg doses of ATG (7-9 days before transplant) pre-medicated with 650 mg acetaminophen, 25 mg diphenhydramine and steroid taper of methylprednisolone, five 30 mg/m^2/day doses of fludarabine (2-6 days before transplant), and two 14.5 mg/kg/day doses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (5-6 days before transplant), along with total body irradiation the day before transplant. Participants received a living renal transplant followed by bone marrow infusion. Two 50 mg/kg/day doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide were given days 3 and 4 post-transplant with MESNA. Filgrastim was given starting on day 5 post-transplant until absolute neutrophil recovery. Standard immunosuppression of tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone began on day 5 post-transplant and given for at least 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from medication over a period of 24-40 weeks.</description>

Participants received three .5, 2, and 2 mg/kg doses of ATG (7-9 days before transplant) pre-medicated with 650 mg acetaminophen, 25 mg diphenhydramine and steroid taper of methylprednisolone, five 30 mg/m^2/day doses of fludarabine (2-6 days before transplant), and two 14.5 mg/kg/day doses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (5-6 days before transplant), along with total body irradiation the day before transplant. Participants received a living renal transplant followed by bone marrow infusion. Two 50 mg/kg/day doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide were given days 3 and 4 post-transplant with MESNA. Filgrastim was given starting on day 5 post-transplant until absolute neutrophil recovery. Standard immunosuppression of tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone began on day 5 post-transplant and given for at least 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from medication over a period of 24-40 weeks.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Enrolled, Transplanted</title>
          <description>Participants were consented, enrolled, fulfilling all study criteria. Participants received three .5, 2, and 2 mg/kg doses of ATG (7-9 days before transplant) pre-medicated with 650 mg acetaminophen, 25 mg diphenhydramine and steroid taper of methylprednisolone, five 30 mg/m^2/day doses of fludarabine (2-6 days before transplant), and two 14.5 mg/kg/day doses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (5-6 days before transplant), along with total body irradiation the day before transplant. Participants received a living renal transplant followed by bone marrow infusion. Two 50 mg/kg/day doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide were given days 3 and 4 post-transplant with MESNA. Filgrastim was given starting on day 5 post-transplant until absolute neutrophil recovery. Standard immunosuppression of tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone began on day 5 post-transplant and given for at least 26 weeks post-transplant. Eligible participants were gradually withdrawn from medication over a period of 24-40 weeks.</description>
