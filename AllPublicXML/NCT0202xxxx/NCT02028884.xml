      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamic,
      pharmacokinetic, and immunogenic profiles of satralizumab, compared with placebo, in addition
      to baseline immunosuppressive treatment in participants with NMO and NMOSD.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for pain is a subjective measure and it consists of a 100 millimeter (mm) line with two end points representing 'no pain' to 'pain as bad as it could be'. Participants are asked to rate their pain by placing a mark on the line corresponding to their current level of pain. The distance along the line from the 'no pain' marker is then measured with a ruler giving a pain score out of 10.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT fatigue scale includes 13 statements, which measures fatigue/asthenia for participants with chronic, life-threatening illnesses. For each question, a participant rates his/her condition for the past week on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A score is calculated by averaging the individual question scores, with lower scores indicative of less fatigue.</description>
