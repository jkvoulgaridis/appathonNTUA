  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in the Pediatric Emergency Department.
      The primary objective is to determine whether nebulized 3% hypertonic saline is more
      effective than nebulized 0.9% saline in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the emergency
      department.

    <description>The primary outcome variable is the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) which is a sum of the change in the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI)score plus a standardized score for the change in respiratory rate; the change in respiratory rate is assigned 1 point per each 10% change in the respiratory rate.The RDAI score is the sum of the row scores, with total range 0 to 17; higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Once consented, the study drug (in this arm: 3% Hypertonic Saline) will be ordered by a physician at the request of a study team member. Once the drug order set is received by a pharmacist, he/she will obtain the study drug from an Omnicell and prepare the medication to a volume of 3 mL in a syringe with a blinded study label prepared in advance by the IDS pharmacy. The pharmacist will then give the study drug to the patient's respiratory therapist or the bedside nurse. The respiratory therapist or the nurse will pour the drug from a syringe to an inhaler cup and the study drug will be given by the standard nebulizer over the course of 15 minutes.</description>

          <title>Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS)</title>
          <description>The primary outcome variable is the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) which is a sum of the change in the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI)score plus a standardized score for the change in respiratory rate; the change in respiratory rate is assigned 1 point per each 10% change in the respiratory rate.The RDAI score is the sum of the row scores, with total range 0 to 17; higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>
