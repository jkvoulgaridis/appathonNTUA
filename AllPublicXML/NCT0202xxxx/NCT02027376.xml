    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase Ib study. In this trial, patients with Triple
      Negative (TN) Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) will be treated with increasing doses of LDE225
      (sonidegib) and docetaxel to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose Limiting
      Toxicity (DLT) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of the combination.

      Eligible patients with hormonal receptors negative and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
      2 (HER2) negative ABC will be included and treated with docetaxel intravenously in every
      three weeks cycles. LDE225 will be administered orally at three dose levels 400, 600 and
      800mg one a day (QD) (a -1 dose level is included just in case dose de-escalation is needed).
      Treatment will be repeated on day 1 of a 21-day cycle until radiographic or symptomatic
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdraws informed consent.

      The investigators propose to develop a phase Ib trial with the combination of docetaxel with
      LDE225 in TN ABC patients to define the safety, tolerability and RP2D, as well as to have
      some information about the efficacy of the combination.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the MTD and RP2D of LDE225 administered orally in combination with docetaxel in
      TN ABC patients.

      Primary End-point:

      To determine the incidence rate of DLT within the first two cycles of LDE225 in combination
      with docetaxel at each dose level.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of LDE225 given in combination with docetaxel.

        -  To characterize the effects of LDE225 in combination with docetaxel on corrected QT
           (QTc) intervals and their correlation with systemic drug exposure.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of docetaxel with LDE225 in TN ABC patients.

        -  To evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination of docetaxel with LDE225.

      Secondary End-points:

        -  Safety will be assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (hematology, serum
           chemistry). Adverse events grade will be defined by the NCI CTCAE v4.0.

        -  Changes in QT/QTc from baseline ECG values and correlation with systemic drug exposure.

        -  The efficacy endpoints are Time To Progression (TTP) and Objective Response Rate (ORR).
           TTP is measured from the initiation of treatment till disease progression and ORR is
           defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria as complete response rate + partial response rate.

        -  The PK will determine whether LDE225 influences the pharmacology of docetaxel. Blood
           samples will be taken at the times defined in the protocol.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To study potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy by evaluating activation of Hh
           signaling pathway and related pathways.

        -  To analyze the pharmacodynamic (PD) treatment effects on the expression of Smo related
           biomarkers and Hg target genes in correlative samples.

        -  To correlate biomarker, PD and PK findings with efficacy and toxicity data.

      Exploratory End-points:

        -  Hh gene expression signature associated to pathway activation (at least Shh, Smo, Ptch1,
           Ptch2, Gli1, Gli2), analyzed in tumor samples.

        -  Changes in Smo related pathway biomarkers (at least Gli1) in skin and blood correlative
           samples.

        -  Pharmacodynamic and biomarker analysis results will be correlated with PK findings,
           efficacy and toxicity data.

      Demographics and Baseline Characteristics:

      Standard descriptive statistics, such as the mean, median, range and proportion, will be used
      to summarize the patient sample and to estimate parameters of interest. 95% confidence
      intervals will be provided for estimates of interest wherever possible.

      Safety Analyses:

      Adverse events data and serious adverse events will be reported in frequency tables (overall
      and by intensity). The safety analysis will be performed in the population that has received
      at least one dose of the drugs.

      Efficacy Analyses:

      Response will be analyzed in patients with measurable disease that have received at least one
      dose of the drugs.

      TTP will be evaluated in all patients that have received at least one dose of the drugs.

      Study population:

      Patient with hormonal receptors negative and HER2 negative ABC.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of LDE225 (Sonidegib) in Combination With Docetaxel</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study treatment, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>MTD was determined by testing increasing doses of LDE225 on dose escalation cohorts 1 to 6 patients. MTD reflects the highest dose tested in which a DLT is experienced by 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6 patients among the dose levels.</description>

    <measure>Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of LDE225 (Sonidegib) in Combination With Docetaxel</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study treatment, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RP2D was decided by the investigators taken into consideration the information obtained in the study and based on the MTD. To define the RP2D, information about toxicity observed during the full treatment were taken into consideration (relative dose intensity and toxicity observed).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study treatment, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests [vital signs including blood pressure, pulse and body temperature, triplicate 12-lead ECGs at screening and on day 1 of cycle 3, blood tests including hematology (hemoglobin, platelets count, red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) with differential count and serum chemistry (serum creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AP), creatine phosphokinase (CPK))]. Adverse events grade were defined by the NCI CTCAE v4.0.</description>

    <measure>Changes in QT/QTc From Baseline and Cycle 3 ECG Values.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to cycle 3</time_frame>
    <description>The QTc intervals have been characterized by comparing QTc at baseline (QTc interval measured in milliseconds (msec) by Fridericia's formula) and at cycle 3 pre-dose, 1 hour post-dose, 2 hours post-dose, 4 hours post-dose and 6 hours post-dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time To Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study treatment, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed until disease progression in order to evaluate the TTP. TTP is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease. For patients not known to have objectively-determined progressive disease, TTP will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment. For patients who receive subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to objective disease progression, TTP will be censored at the date of last objective progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of postdiscontinuation systemic anticancer therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>LDE225 (Sonidegib) Trough Concentration (Pharmacokinetics (PK))</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of LDE225 on the docetaxel PK, the main pharmacokinetic parameters of docetaxel were estimated on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, and compared between them. PK parameters were estimated by non-compartmental approach using Phoenix® WinNonlin® software (version 7.0). In the case of the effect of docetaxel on the LDE225 PK, since patients were always under both drugs at all the assessed PK profiles, the trough LDE225 concentrations obtained in our study were compared with those simulated from a previous developed PK model from LDE225 given as monotherapy. Therefore, a population PK model of LDE225 reported in the literature and developed in healthy subjects and patients with advanced solid tumors was implemented in NONMEN version 7.3 program and Monte-Carlo simulations of LDE225 concentrations after the same doses than those of our study, were performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Docetaxel Clearance on Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (Pharmacokinetics (PK))</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycles 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>PK sampling of docetaxel was performed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2 of treatment and docetaxel concentrations. Blood samples were collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) K3 tubes and after plasma separation by centrifugation were stored at -70 degrees Celsius until analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study treatment, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The best response across all treatment was recorded. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete or partial response out of the patients who had measurable disease at baseline.</description>

        <description>Tumor assessments were performed until disease progression in order to evaluate the TTP. TTP is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease. For patients not known to have objectively-determined progressive disease, TTP will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment. For patients who receive subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to objective disease progression, TTP will be censored at the date of last objective progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of postdiscontinuation systemic anticancer therapy.</description>

        <title>LDE225 (Sonidegib) Trough Concentration (Pharmacokinetics (PK))</title>
        <description>To evaluate the effect of LDE225 on the docetaxel PK, the main pharmacokinetic parameters of docetaxel were estimated on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, and compared between them. PK parameters were estimated by non-compartmental approach using Phoenix® WinNonlin® software (version 7.0). In the case of the effect of docetaxel on the LDE225 PK, since patients were always under both drugs at all the assessed PK profiles, the trough LDE225 concentrations obtained in our study were compared with those simulated from a previous developed PK model from LDE225 given as monotherapy. Therefore, a population PK model of LDE225 reported in the literature and developed in healthy subjects and patients with advanced solid tumors was implemented in NONMEN version 7.3 program and Monte-Carlo simulations of LDE225 concentrations after the same doses than those of our study, were performed.</description>
