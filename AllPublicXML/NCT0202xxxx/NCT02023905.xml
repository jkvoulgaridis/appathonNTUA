  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, everolimus (RAD001,
      also known as Afinitor®) alone or with temozolomide has on the patient and the patient's
      low-grade glioma. Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its
      potential to prevent tumor cells from growing and multiplying. Specifically, there is a
      protein called mTOR that we think helps many tumors to grow, and everolimus blocks the effect
      of mTOR. Temozolomide is also an anticancer agent that prevents tumor cells from growing and
      multiplying. About 159 people total will take part in this study. Patients will be assigned
      to one of three treatment groups depending on the results of some tests done on their tumor.
      Each group will have 53 patients in it. 2 groups will receive treatment with everolimus
      alone, while the third group will receive treatment with both everolimus and temozolomide. In
      this study, patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on two characteristics
      of their tumor, called &quot;1p/19q&quot; (this is a test of the tumor chromosomes) and &quot;p-PRAS40&quot;
      (this is a test of a pathway in the tumor called mTOR). If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q
      intact and p-PRAS40 positive, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 1, and the
      patient will receive everolimus alone. If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q intact and p-PRAS40
      negative, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 2 and the patient will receive
      everolimus and temozolomide. If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q co-deleted, regardless of the
      p-PRAS40 result, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 3, and the patient will
      receive everolimus alone.

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) (Arms 1 and 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be analyzed based on intention to treat using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for progression. Analyses will be performed after all enrolled participants in arm 1 or arm 2 have completed 33 months on study, or whenever the progression status of all participants has been established, whichever comes first. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated for the 33-month PFS separately for the two arms. The Cox proportional hazards model will also be used to allow for adjustment of the prognostic factors including age, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), and extent of resection</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 38 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be analyzed based on intention to treat using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for progression. Analyses will be performed after all participants enrolled in arm 3 have completed 38 months on study, or whenever the progression status of all participants has been established, whichever comes first. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the associated 95% CIs will be calculated for the 38-month PFS. The Cox proportional hazards model will also be used to allow for adjustment of the prognostic factors including age, KPS, and extent of resection</description>

    <measure>Median and distribution of overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be analyzed based on intention to treat. Overall survival is defined as the first day of treatment until death, or completion of 36 months on study whichever comes first. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the associated 95% CIs will be calculated for the 36-month survival rate by treatment arm. The Cox proportional hazards model will also be used to allow for adjustment of the prognostic factors including age, KPS, and extent of resection</description>

    <measure>Rate of Reduction in Seizures</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the reduction in seizure rate we will compare the seizure rate on study to that experienced one month prior to enrolling in the study. We will follow the RANO low grade gliomas (LGG) guideline which calls a 50% or more reduction number of monthly seizures an 'improvement'; a 50% or more increase a worsening'; and anything less than 50% in either direction a 'stable seizure rate'.</description>

    <description>If the tumor is 1p/19q intact, then patients will be further selected by whether or not their tumor demonstrates activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. If activation is present, patients will be treated in Arm 1 with single-agent everolimus at 10 mg daily continuously. In all arms, treatment with everolimus will continue for up to 24 cycles, after which patients will be followed with interval MRIs until progression.</description>
