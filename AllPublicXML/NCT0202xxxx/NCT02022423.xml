  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a significant vascular condition affecting millions of
      adults. Exercise such as walking is highly effective for reducing PAD symptoms such as
      claudication (pain with walking) and improving physical function. The trial examines the
      efficacy of a internet-delivered walking program for patients with PAD. Comparator groups
      including telephone counselling, the combination of internet-delivered walking program +
      telephone counseling, or usual care. The primary outcome of interest is maximal walking
      distance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of the American population, the numbers of adults with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) will increase significantly over the next several decades. Patients with PAD
      are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality including both cardiovascular and all-cause
      mortality. While regular physical activity reduces risk for vascular events and is
      recommended for treatment of PAD patients, few patients meet recommended goals. Exercise
      programs which increase long-term adherence to walking can be an important contribution to
      PAD treatment. Our Internet-based intervention, builds on a walking enhancement program
      developed by members of our team and is shown to improve adherence among patients with
      vascular disease such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Using a randomized, controlled trial
      study design, we propose to test an automated Internet-based walking program to improve
      long-term adherence to walking while increasing walking distance, and health-related quality
      of life, among patients with PAD. Participants will be randomized to 1 of four study groups:
      1) weekly telephone counseling, 2) an Internet-based walking program, 3) a combination of
      telephone counseling and Internet-based walking program, or 4) a usual care group. The
      Internet-based walking program has been shown to increase both adherence to walking and
      overall walking duration in populations with chronic complex conditions such as CAD and
      diabetes. There is a strong need to develop interventions, easily generalizable to a
      real-world population, to improve the reach of lifestyle interventions which result in
      improved physical function and adherence to regular exercise among complex medical patients.
      Patients such as those with PAD (a CAD risk equivalent) stand to benefit the most from such
      programs.
