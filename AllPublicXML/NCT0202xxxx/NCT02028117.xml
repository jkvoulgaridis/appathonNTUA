    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I / Dose Expansion open label clinical study in patients with
      platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. The Phase Ia part of the study will determine
      the dose of enadenotucirev to be recommended for further studies and will examine primarily
      the safety and tolerability but also the pharmacokinetics of administering enadenotucirev
      intraperitoneally. In Phase Ib, the safety and tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of
      administering enadenotucirev intravenously in combination with weekly paclitaxel will be
      determined. The Dose Expansion Phase will begin as an open label dose expansion of that
      regimen and aims to determine whether intravenous enadenotucirev in combination with weekly
      paclitaxel has a risk benefit profile that supports further investigation in the treatment of
      patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.
