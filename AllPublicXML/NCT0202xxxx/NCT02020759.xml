  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is progressively used in critically ill patients
      with cardiac or respiratory failure as a bridging option for potential organ recovery.
      However, ECMO survivors often suffer from poor neurocognitive outcome due to neurological
      complications such as microembolic (ME) strokes.

      In venoarterial (va) ECMO circuits the pulmonary circulation, which usually serves as
      microembolic filter, may be bypassed and generated ME are prone to reach the brain in
      substantial amounts and potentially impair cerebral integrity. Although patient exposure to
      cerebral ME has been thoroughly investigated in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, there is
      only limited research on cerebral ME in patients undergoing ECMO therapy.

      The primary study goal of this study is to determine the load and nature of cerebral ME in
      critically ill patients under va-ECMO support. We also aim to compare the results to
      measurements in healthy subjects und intensive care unit (ICU) patients without
      extracorporeal support to get a better impression on the relevance of ME generation during
      ECMO support.

        The study population consists of three patient groups with all receiving transcranial
        Doppler exam: 1. patients undergoing ECMO therapy in the ICU; 2. healthy volunteers, and 3.
        critically ill controls (patients on the ICU without ECMO)
