      Primary Aim: To test the efficacy of an elementary school-based, school nurse-led weight
      management program to reduce excess weight gain among children, 8 to 12 years old who are
      overweight and at risk of overweight by increasing healthy dietary practices and physical
      activity levels and decreasing sedentary practices.

      Primary Hypothesis: Relative to the control condition, the children receiving the
      intervention will have a significantly lower body mass index (BMI), following implementation
      of the 9-month intervention, controlling for baseline values.

    <time_frame>Measurement data will be collected at baseline prior to randomization and 12 (YR-1 post intervention), and 24 (YR-2 follow up) months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index (primary outcome) is the recommended method of assessing overweight among children and was calculated with the formula: weight (kg)/height (m) 2. To determine child BMI percentile, we calculated age- and gender-adjusted BMI with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts.. The primary outcome measure is BMI Z-Score, which indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. A higher Z-score is a less favorable outcome when assessing overweight/obesity across conditions in a healthy weight management intervention..</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary: Healthy Eating Index</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure was collected at 12 months (YR-1 post intervention) following randomization with result adjusted for baseline value, percent body fat, sex and economic assistance</time_frame>
    <description>The Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) will be assessed with multiple 24-hour dietary recall interviews. A score on the HEI-2015 ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 meeting the recommendations for all 13 components of the HEI-2015. The higher the score the better.</description>

    <measure>Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure was collected at 12 months (YR-1 post intervention), following randomization with result adjusted for baseline value, percent body fat, sex and age</time_frame>
    <description>Activity will be assessed with the MTI ActiGraph uniaxial accelerometer worn for a 7-day period. Time spent in each category of sedentary or moderate-vigorous physical activity was calculated as a percent of total wear time, with higher numbers indicating more time spent in the category.</description>

    <measure>Total Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement data will be collected at baseline prior to randomization and 12 (YR-1 post intervention) , and 24 (YR-2 follow up) months following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The 23-item Pediatric Quality of Life (QOL) child inventory or PedsQL 4.0 was used to assess physical, emotional, social and school functioning. Responses are reversed scored and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale which is used to calculate a total health-related quality of life summary score (mean of 23 items) which includes a physical health summary score (mean of 8 physical functioning items) and psycho-social health summary score (mean of 15 emotional, social and school functioning items). A higher score indicates better child-reported health-related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Child Body Mass Index (BMI)</title>
        <description>Body Mass Index (primary outcome) is the recommended method of assessing overweight among children and was calculated with the formula: weight (kg)/height (m) 2. To determine child BMI percentile, we calculated age- and gender-adjusted BMI with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts.. The primary outcome measure is BMI Z-Score, which indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. A higher Z-score is a less favorable outcome when assessing overweight/obesity across conditions in a healthy weight management intervention..</description>
