  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand why patients in the World Trade Center program
      have continuing breathing problems. This study will improve investigators understanding of
      breathing problems among individuals with World Trade Center exposure by allowing them to
      review and monitor medication use, lung function, and examine other conditions that can
      contribute to problems with breathing. The findings from the study will help investigators
      understand why some people have persistent lower respiratory symptoms (breathing problems)
      after their exposure to World Trade Center dust and fumes, and may help guide better
      management and treatment of these symptoms.

      Investigators will conduct a clinical study with aggressive treatment for lower respiratory
      symptoms in patients in the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center. Patients in the
      WTC EHC with uncontrolled LRS at visit 1 will be identified and placed on high-dose inhaled
      corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists for three months. Adherence will be assessed at
      monthly visits. Patients will perform spirometry and oscillometry at baseline and after 3
      months of treatment. They will also be assessed for markers of airway inflammation, bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness and co-morbid conditions including depression,anxiety,post-traumatic
      stress disorder, gastroesophageal reflux, paradoxical vocal cord motion and rhinosinusitis.
