    <textblock>
      Exercise is one of the primary interventions used with people with chronic, mechanical low
      back pain. It is unknown, however, which exercise is best for which person, which exercises a
      person will adhere to and for how long, and the effect of adhering to a specific type of
      exercise on how the person functions, particularly in the long run. The purpose of this study
      is to examine if the short- and long-term effects are different between 1) commonly
      prescribed strength and flexibility exercises for the trunk and limbs, and 2) individualized
      practice in daily functional activities that are difficult or painful to perform. Adherence
      to the different interventions, the relationship between adherence and outcomes,as well as
      the effect of a booster intervention also will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many people, mechanical low back pain (LBP) is a long-term, function-limiting condition
      rather than a short-term, self-limiting condition. Exercise is one of the primary
      non-surgical approaches used worldwide for managing LBP. Specifically in people with chronic
      LBP, exercise has been found to be as efficacious, if not more efficacious than 1) no
      treatment, 2) usual care, and 3) many other treatments, such as massage or laser therapy.
      Despite the growing body of evidence for the beneficial effects of exercise, however, there
      is limited evidence about 1) which exercise is best for which person, 2) how long the effects
      of different exercises last, 3) which types of exercise people will adhere to, and for how
      long, and 4) the mechanisms underlying the effects of different types of exercise.

      This study aims to address these limitations by directly comparing the effects of 1) exercise
      to increase strength of the trunk and increase flexibility of the trunk and extremities, and
      2) individualized, motor skill training directed at performance of daily functional
      activities that are painful or limited due to the person's LBP. This study also will examine
      1) the effects of a booster phase of intervention, 2) the relationship between adherence to
      intervention and function, and 3) the relationship between performance of functional
      activities and function-related outcomes. People with chronic LBP will be randomized to 1) an
      intervention of strength and flexibility exercise or motor skill training, and 2) a booster
      or no-booster intervention. Intervention will be provided in 2 phases: 1) initial phase: 6 -
      1 hour sessions, once/week for 6 weeks, and 2) booster phase: # of sessions needed to regain
      independence in home program, beginning 6 months after the initial phase. The investigators
      will collect 1) measurements of pain, function, disability, and economic outcomes, 2) reports
      of adherence, and 3) laboratory-based measures of performance of functional activities.
      People will be followed for 12 months after the initial intervention phase. Three sets of
      hypotheses are proposed. First, the investigators hypothesize that both interventions will
      result in improvements in pain, function, disability, and economic outcomes, but that the
      motor skill training will result in more long lasting improvements than the strength and
      flexibility exercise. Second, the investigators hypothesize that the effect of a booster
      phase of intervention will 1) result in longer lasting improvement in function and better
      adherence than a no-booster intervention, and 2) be greater for motor skill training than for
      strength and flexibility exercise. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that 1) adherence
      to motor skill training will be more strongly related to function than will adherence to
      strength and flexibility exercise, and 2) performance of functional activities by people
      receiving motor skill training will be more strongly related to function than performance of
      functional activities by people receiving strength and flexibility exercise.

    <measure>Change in Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (0-100%) From Baseline to Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, completion of initial 6 week intervention phase</time_frame>
    <description>Background/Purpose: The 10-item Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire is a disease-specific measure that provides an index of a participant's perceived low back pain-related functional limitation.
Procedure: Participants will answer each of the 10 questions by placing a mark in the one box that best describes his current condition. Since a participant may feel that 2 of the statements describe his condition, he is instructed to mark only the box that most closely describes his current condition.
Scoring: Each item is given a value from 0-5. The total score is the sum of all questions divided by 50, multiplied by 100 to get a percent. 100 represents the highest level of limitation.</description>

    <time_frame>completion of initial 6 week intervention phase</time_frame>
    <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to provide information about how often a participant performs his treatment as it was prescribed.
Procedure: Participants will use a VAS to indicate for each day the percentage of the treatment they were able to perform as prescribed. At each clinic visit the therapist will ask the participant to provide an estimate of the average percentage of the treatment he was able to perform as prescribed in the interval of time between 2 clinic visits.
Scoring: Average adherence is calculated by averaging the participants' daily adherence. Scores range from 0-100%. Higher values indicate higher adherence to treatment.</description>

        <title>Change in Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (0-100%) From Baseline to Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: The 10-item Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire is a disease-specific measure that provides an index of a participant's perceived low back pain-related functional limitation.
Procedure: Participants will answer each of the 10 questions by placing a mark in the one box that best describes his current condition. Since a participant may feel that 2 of the statements describe his condition, he is instructed to mark only the box that most closely describes his current condition.
Scoring: Each item is given a value from 0-5. The total score is the sum of all questions divided by 50, multiplied by 100 to get a percent. 100 represents the highest level of limitation.</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to give the therapist information on the intensity of a participant's LBP symptoms.
Procedure: Participants will rate their LBP symptoms on a numeric scale of 0-10 where 0 represents no symptoms and 10 represents symptoms as bad as can be. They will rate their average symptoms over the prior 7 days, and worst symptoms over the prior 7 days.
Scoring: The score for each item is the rating the participant provides for each symptom category (average and worst).</description>

            <title>Motor Skill Training</title>
            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

Strength and flexibility exercise: Exercises based on best evidence for effectiveness in people with chronic low back pain will be prescribed. Strengthening exercises will target all trunk muscles. Flexibility exercises will target all trunk and hip motions. All exercises will be performed at the intensity appropriate for the person's musculoskeletal fitness level based on the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.

        <title>Change in Number of Acute Flare-ups of Low Back Pain (#) in Past 6 Months, From Baseline to 6 Months After Initial Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to give the therapist information about the history of a participant's LBP flare-ups in the past 6 months.
Definition: A flare-up is an increase in symptoms of at least 2 points on the NRS above a person's typical low back pain and lasts for at least 2 consecutive days Procedure: Participants will fill in information on how many acute flare-ups they have had over the past 6 months.
Scoring: The score will be the number the participant provides for the number of acute flare-ups over the last 6 months.</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

Strength and flexibility exercise: Exercises based on best evidence for effectiveness in people with chronic low back pain will be prescribed. Strengthening exercises will target all trunk muscles. Flexibility exercises will target all trunk and hip motions. All exercises will be performed at the intensity appropriate for the person's musculoskeletal fitness level based on the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.

Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

        <title>Change in Absenteeism From Usual Activities Due to Low Back Pain (Number of Participants Who Report Absenteeism) From 6 Months After Initial Intervention Phase to 12 Months After Initial Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to assess the number of days a participant has been kept from his usual activities (work, school or housework) because of LBP.
Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking the answer as indicated.
Scoring: Reported as the number of participants who reported absenteeism from usual activities over the past 4 weeks.</description>

            <title>Motor Skill Training</title>
            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

Strength and flexibility exercise: Exercises based on best evidence for effectiveness in people with chronic low back pain will be prescribed. Strengthening exercises will target all trunk muscles. Flexibility exercises will target all trunk and hip motions. All exercises will be performed at the intensity appropriate for the person's musculoskeletal fitness level based on the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.

Each of the WIS questions is ranked on a 5-point Likert scale. All scores are 1-5, with questions 2, 5, 6, 8, and 10 reverse scored (5-1). The score ranges from 10-50 with 50 indicating the highest degree of impairment.</description>

        <title>Change in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary Score From Baseline to Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to assess information about a participant's mental and physical health, and how well he is able to do his usual activities.
Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking the answer as indicated. If participants are unsure how to answer a question, they are instructed to choose the best answer they can.
Scoring: Using a scoring application, the SF-36 provides 8 scales: a Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and a Mental Health score. The scores are combined to provide a Physical Component (PCS) and Mental Component (MCS) Summary score. For the PCS and the MCS, norm-based scores are scaled and normalized to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 based on the 1998 population norms. Higher scores indicate better health.</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

Strength and flexibility exercise: Exercises based on best evidence for effectiveness in people with chronic low back pain will be prescribed. Strengthening exercises will target all trunk muscles. Flexibility exercises will target all trunk and hip motions. All exercises will be performed at the intensity appropriate for the person's musculoskeletal fitness level based on the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.

        <title>Change in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Component Summary Score From Baseline to Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to assess information about a participant's mental and physical health, and how well he is able to do his usual activities.
Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking the answer as indicated. If participants are unsure how to answer a question, they are instructed to choose the best answer they can.
Scoring: Using a scoring application, the SF-36 provides 8 scales: a Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and a Mental Health score. The scores are combined to provide a Physical Component (PCS) and Mental Component (MCS) Summary score. For the PCS and the MCS, norm-based scores are scaled and normalized to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 based on the 1998 population norms. Higher scores indicate better health.</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

            <description>The strength and flexibility exercise condition involves performance of 1) strengthening exercises that target all trunk muscles, and 2) flexibility exercises that target all trunk and lower extremity motions.
Strength and flexibility exercise: Exercises based on best evidence for effectiveness in people with chronic low back pain will be prescribed. Strengthening exercises will target all trunk muscles. Flexibility exercises will target all trunk and hip motions. All exercises will be performed at the intensity appropriate for the person's musculoskeletal fitness level based on the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. Difficulty level, frequency, and number of repetitions will be modified based on guidelines described in the literature. Equipment will be provided as needed.</description>

        <title>Change in Use of Other Low Back Pain-related Treatments (Health Professional Care Seeking or Equipment Use (# of Participants)) From Baseline to Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to provide general information on the use of additional treatments for a participant's LBP.
Health Professional Care Seeking Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking yes or no for a list of other healthcare professionals they are seeing for treatment of their LBP.
Equipment Use Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking yes or no for a list of equipment they are using to treat their LBP.
Scoring: Reported as the number of participants seeking care from health professionals for LBP or using equipment for LBP.</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

        <title>Satisfaction With Care (15-75 Points)</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire assesses information about how satisfied a participant feels with the physical therapist and treatment he was provided.
Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking the answer as indicated. They may only check off one answer per item.
Scoring: Each question is ranked on a 5-point Likert scale. All scores are 1-5, with questions 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 13 reverse scored (5-1). The total score is the sum of all of the answers (15-75) with higher scores indicating more satisfaction with care.</description>

Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to provide information about how often a participant performs his treatment as it was prescribed.
Procedure: Participants will use a VAS to indicate for each day the percentage of the treatment they were able to perform as prescribed. At each clinic visit the therapist will ask the participant to provide an estimate of the average percentage of the treatment he was able to perform as prescribed in the interval of time between 2 clinic visits.
Scoring: Average adherence is calculated by averaging the participants' daily adherence. Scores range from 0-100%. Higher values indicate higher adherence to treatment.</description>

Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

          <title>Change in Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire Work Subscale Score (0-42 Points) From Baseline to Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase</title>
          <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to assess a participant's fear of pain and beliefs about how work and physical activity affect his LBP.
Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking the answer as indicated.
Scoring: Each question is ranked on a 7-point Likert scale (0-6). Higher scores indicate higher fear-avoidance. Two subscale scores are calculated. The physical activity subscale score (FABQ-PA) is the sum of questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 and ranges from 0-24. The work subscale score (FABQ-W) is the sum of items 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 and ranges from 0-42.</description>

        <title>Change in Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire Physical Activity Subscale Score (0-24 Points) From Completion of Initial 6 Week Intervention Phase to 6 Months After Initial Intervention Phase</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to assess a participant's fear of pain and beliefs about how work and physical activity affect his LBP.
Procedure: Participants will answer each question by marking the answer as indicated.
Scoring: Each question is ranked on a 7-point Likert scale (0-6). Higher scores indicate higher fear-avoidance. Two subscale scores are calculated. The physical activity subscale score (FABQ-PA) is the sum of questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 and ranges from 0-24. The work subscale score (FABQ-W) is the sum of items 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 and ranges from 0-42.</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.

        <title>Treatment Preference Assessment Measure, Suitability/Appropriateness Subscale (0-4 Points)</title>
        <description>Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to provide information about a participant's treatment preferences and the participant's perceptions of four attributes of each treatment: effectiveness, acceptability, suitability/appropriateness, and convenience. The questionnaire is modified from a preference questionnaire designed by Sidani et al to reflect the treatments provided in the trial.
Procedure: The two treatment descriptions will be given in a random order to each participant.
Scoring: The four treatment attributes (effectiveness, acceptability, suitability/appropriateness, and convenience) will be rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The anchors are not at all (rating=0) and very much (rating=4).</description>

            <description>The motor skill training condition involves supervised, massed practice of novel, challenging functional activities that are difficult or painful for the participant to perform due to his low back pain.
Motor skill training: The participant will assist in selecting both simple and complex functional activities to practice. Difficulty will be graded to match the participant's motor capabilities. Three activities will be practiced per session. Within the practice of activities the training will emphasize 1) contraction of groups of specific trunk muscles, 2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic spine relative to the lumbar spine, 3) later and less movement of the lumbar spine relative to other regions. Within each activity the conditions of practice will vary based on 1) the participant's ability to perform the activity, and 2) the level of challenge the participant is faced with when performing the activity during his day.
