    <measure>St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) - Absolute change</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change in the SGRQ in the EBV treatment arm at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months relative to Baseline and the difference between the two arms at 3, 6 and 12 months.
The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire measures health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airways obstruction. The questionnaire comprises of two parts:
Part I: Symptoms (frequency &amp; severity) Part II: Activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness; Impacts (social functioning, psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease)
A Total score is calculated which summarizes the impact of the disease on overall health status. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>

EQ-5D is a standardized instrument used to measure health-related quality of life for a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS.
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.</description>
