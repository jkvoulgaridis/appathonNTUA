  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to provide 6 months of safety follow-up for children and
      adolescents with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia who had previously
      participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial and to assess the efficacy of tolvaptan in
      increasing serum sodium for those participants who received optional continuing tolvaptan
      treatment of variable duration (up to 6 months).

      Core Safety Follow-up Component

      • For all participants: To evaluate the post-treatment safety follow-up of children and
      adolescent participants with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia who have
      previously participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial.

      Optional Tolvaptan Treatment Component

      • For participants who receive optional tolvaptan treatment: To demonstrate that tolvaptan
      safely and effectively achieves and maintains increased serum sodium concentrations in
      children and adolescent participants with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia
      when used for both multiple short-term treatments, and/or longer chronic treatments.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL GCS was used for quality of life assessment. It is appropriate for at least 2 years of age, however availability may be limited for certain ages and languages. It encompasses 4 dimensions of functioning (physical, emotional, social, school). The age groups covered are: Toddler (2-4 years), Young child (5-7 years), Child (8-12 years), and Adolescent (13-18 years). Depending on the participant's age, the questionnaire may be completed by either the participant or the parent/caregiver, as appropriate. For the Toddler group, the PedsQL GCS consists of 21 items, using a 5-point Likert scale (0 to 4); for all other groups, the PedsQL GCS consists of 23 items, with a 3-point Likert scale (0, 2, 4) for the Young Child, and a 5-point Likert scale for the Child and Adolescent groups. Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 and averaged. Higher scores indicate improved quality of life. The change from baseline in the GCS total score is presented.</description>

             12 hours apart (these values can be documented using historical values previously
             obtained per standard of care); a third (STAT) serum sodium assessment &lt; 130 mEq/L
             (mmol/L), which will serve as the baseline value for efficacy endpoints, had to be
             obtained within 2 to 4 hours prior to the first dose of tolvaptan.

          4. Ability to swallow tablets.

             from the trial at any time. All informed consent/assent procedures must be in
             accordance with the trial center's Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics
             Committee and local regulatory requirements.

             fluid monitoring and management.

          5. Had a history or current diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome.

             [dL]).

          9. Had acute kidney injury defined as: Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥

      <recruitment_details>Eligible participants included those enrolled in a previous tolvaptan pediatric trial for hyponatremia (NCT02012959); who provided written informed consent at baseline and were able to understand that he/she could withdraw at any time; with the ability to comply with all requirements of the trial; ready to be followed up for 6 months.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was no screening phase. Approximately 100 male or female participants were planned to be enrolled in this trial. A total of 3 participants were enrolled in this trial, but no participant received optional investigational medicinal product during this trial.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>All participants enrolled first entered a 6-month follow-up trial that evaluated post-treatment safety after participation in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial. Participants were then eligible to receive open-label tolvaptan if they had a clinical need as determined by the investigator and met the eligibility criteria for optional tolvaptan treatment during the 6-month follow-up period. In this trial, no participants qualified for treatment during the 6-month follow-up period. Daily dose levels would have included 3.75 milligrams (mg), 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg.</description>

        <description>The PedsQL GCS was used for quality of life assessment. It is appropriate for at least 2 years of age, however availability may be limited for certain ages and languages. It encompasses 4 dimensions of functioning (physical, emotional, social, school). The age groups covered are: Toddler (2-4 years), Young child (5-7 years), Child (8-12 years), and Adolescent (13-18 years). Depending on the participant's age, the questionnaire may be completed by either the participant or the parent/caregiver, as appropriate. For the Toddler group, the PedsQL GCS consists of 21 items, using a 5-point Likert scale (0 to 4); for all other groups, the PedsQL GCS consists of 23 items, with a 3-point Likert scale (0, 2, 4) for the Young Child, and a 5-point Likert scale for the Child and Adolescent groups. Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100 and averaged. Higher scores indicate improved quality of life. The change from baseline in the GCS total score is presented.</description>

        <title>Participants With A Tanner Staging Score Of 1 At Month 6</title>
        <description>Tanner Staging assessment consists of 2 domains (pubic hair and breast development) for girls and 3 domains (pubic hair, penis development, and testes development) for boys. Staging was based on a single score summarizing the domains (not individual domain scores). Stages range from 1-5, with 1 indicating preadolescent and 5 adult. Participants with a Tanner staging score of 1 (preadolescent) at Month 6 are reported.</description>

          <description>All participants enrolled first entered a 6-month follow-up trial that evaluated post-treatment safety after participation in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial. Participants were then eligible to receive open-label tolvaptan if they had a clinical need as determined by the investigator and met the eligibility criteria for optional tolvaptan treatment during the 6-month follow-up period. In this trial, no participants qualified for treatment during the 6-month follow-up period. Daily dose levels would have included 3.75 milligrams (mg), 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg.</description>
