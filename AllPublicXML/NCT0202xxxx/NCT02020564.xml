  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a technique
      designed to improve processing speed (i.e. the amount of time it takes to process
      information) in a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) population. The study is designed to study how
      well this technique can help people with TBI increase their processing speed and their
      ability to function better in everyday life.

      The current proposal is designed to apply this treatment protocol to a large sample of
      individuals with moderate to severe TBI with documented impairment in PS. The goals of the
      trial are to (a) test the efficacy of this treatment protocol within a TBI population, (b)
      evaluate the impact of the treatment on everyday functioning, (c) evaluate the longer-term
      efficacy of the treatment, and (d) examine the utility of booster sessions in facilitating
      longer-term treatment effects. Individuals with moderate to severe TBI, with documented
      impairment in PS, will be randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group. Both
      groups will undergo baseline, immediate post-treatment and long-term follow-up assessment
      consisting of: (1) a standardized neuropsychological battery and (2) an assessment of global
      functioning examining the impact of the treatment on daily activities. This design will allow
      us to assess the efficacy of SPT in persons with TBI and evaluate its impact on everyday
      life.
