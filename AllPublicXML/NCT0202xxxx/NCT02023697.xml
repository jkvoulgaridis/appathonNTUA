  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess different doses and regimens of radium-223 dichloride on the incidence
      of symptomatic skeletal events. Eligible subjects must have castration resistant prostate
      cancer with 2 or more skeletal metastases documented within 8 weeks of randomization.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 fashion: a standard regimen
      of radium-223 dichloride of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update)
      injections every month for 6 months, a high dose regimen of 80 kBq/kg (88 kBq/kg after
      implementation of NIST update)injections every month for 6 months or an extended duration
      regimen of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) injections every month
      for 12 months. Following the treatment phase, subjects will be followed up every 12 weeks for
      a minimum of 2 years, at which point they will enter a long term follow-up period during
      which they are seen every 6 months for up to 7 years after the last dose of radium
      dichloride. Symptomatic skeletal event and safety endpoints will be assessed at each clinic
      visit. Pain and analgesic use data will be collected every 4 weeks through Week 48.
      Additionally, radiological assessments including MRI/CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest
      CT, as well as technetium-99 bone scans will be performed at Weeks 8, 16, and 24 and continue
      every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression is documented in either the bone or in
      soft tissue. Radiological imaging will be evaluated by blinded central review.

      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 391 participants assigned to treatment in the intention to treatment (ITT) analysis set, 370 participants (94.6%) received at least one dose of radium-223 dichloride, and a total of 21 participants (5.4%) never received treatment</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants who were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion received Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223) 55 kBq/kg intravenously (IV) every 28 days for up to 6 doses (“standard dose”). Participants who discontinued study treatment and who did not have an SSE entered an active follow-up period with clinic visits. Participants from the treatment period or the active follow-up period with clinic visits who could no longer travel entered an active follow-up period without clinic visits. All study participants eligible for further follow-up were either in this study or in a separate long term follow-up study for up to 7 years.</description>

          <description>Participants who were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion received Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223) 55 kBq/kg intravenously (IV) every 28 days for up to 6 doses (“standard dose”). Participants who discontinued study treatment and who did not have an SSE entered an active follow-up period with clinic visits. Participants from the treatment period or the active follow-up period with clinic visits who could no longer travel entered an active follow-up period without clinic visits.

          <title>Average Worst Pain Score (WPS)</title>
          <description>Brief Pain Short Form (BPI-SF) encompasses 4 different items to capture the variability of pain over time (pain at its “worst,” “least,” “average,” and “now”). For this study, only the worst pain score (WPS) in the last 24 hours was assessed (a visual analogic scale ranging 0-10, with 0 meaning “no pain” and 10 meaning “pain as bad as you can imagine”), and the mean score of the 7 days prior to the study visit or telephone contact was calculated and this value was recorded in the participant's reported outcome pain data.</description>
          <population>The last assessment collected prior to randomization was used as baseline value. If no assessment was done prior to randomization, then the assessment collected after randomization but prior to first dose was used as baseline. Number of analyzed reflect the participants with data available at baseline.</population>
