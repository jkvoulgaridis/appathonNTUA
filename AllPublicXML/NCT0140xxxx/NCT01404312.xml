  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people have an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). At the
      time the study was designed, the standard course of treatment for TB was 6 to 9 months of
      isoniazid (INH).This study compared the safety and effectiveness of a 4-week regimen of
      rifapentine (RPT) plus INH versus a standard 9-month regimen of INH in HIV-infected people
      who are at risk of developing active TB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2017 there were 10 million new cases of
      TB, and 1.6 million people died as a result of TB. Among new TB cases, it is estimated that
      920,000 occurred in people who were HIV-coinfected, and 23% of TB deaths were among
      HIV-coinfected individuals. In Africa, TB is the leading AIDS-related opportunistic
      infection. Latent TB infection occurs when people are infected with the bacteria that cause
      TB, but they do not have any symptoms of TB infection. Latent TB can develop into active TB,
      and HIV-infected people have an increased risk of progressing from latent TB to active TB.
      INH is a medication that is prescribed for people with latent TB to help prevent active TB
      from developing. The standard INH treatment regimen is 6 to 9 months; a shorter treatment
      regimen of 3 months of once-weekly RPT plus INH has proven to be as effective and improved
      adherence. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of a 4-week
      daily regimen of RPT plus INH to a standard 9-month daily INH regimen for TB prevention in
      HIV-infected individuals.

      This study enrolled HIV-infected people who did not have evidence of active TB but who were
      at high risk of developing active TB. Participants were randomly assigned to receive RPT and
      INH once a day for 4 weeks or INH once a day for 9 months. All participants received
      pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with each dose of INH to help prevent possible side effects. Study
      visits occurred at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 36. At select study
      visits, participants had a physical exam, clinical assessment, blood collection, and a chest
      radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) scan (if needed). Some participants had their
      blood stored for future testing. Follow-up study visits occurred every 12 weeks starting at
      Week 48 and continued for 3 years after the last participant enrolled.

Participants who weighed 30 kg to less than 35 kg received 300 mg once daily (administered as two 150-mg tablets).
Participants who weighed 35 kg to less than 45 kg received 450 mg once daily (administered as three 150-mg tablets).
Participants who weighed greater than 45 kg will receive 600 mg once daily (administered as four 150-mg tablets).
Isoniazid (INH): Participants received one 300-mg tablet or three 100-mg tablets of INH once daily.
Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6): Participants received 25 mg or 50 mg of pyridoxine, based on the current local, national, or international dosing guidelines.
Participants receiving 25 mg of pyridoxine took one 25-mg tablet once daily.</description>
