      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single center study of a laparoscopically placed,
      adjustable gastric band medical device for the treatment of adolescent obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population We plan to enroll 30 subjects between the ages of 14 and 17 years with the
      LAP-BAND®. The inclusion criteria are in accordance with recent evidence-based indications
      for the surgical management of severe obesity in the pediatric population (Pratt, Lenders et
      al. 2009). The enrollees will be children who have a body-mass index in the 99th percentile,
      corresponding to a BMI&gt;= 35 kg/m2, and who exhibit significant comorbidities.

      This sample size will provide over 90% power to detect a 15% change in body mass index with a
      standard deviation of 6, two-tailed alpha of 0.05, and allow for 20% loss to follow-up, using
      a paired design.

    <description>Placement of the LAP-BAND® system will be performed laparoscopically under general anesthesia, using the pars flaccida technique. The device will be placed by surgeons from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Obesity Management Program at Children's Medical Center Dallas. Surgeons will be fully trained in the placement of the LAP-BAND® device, in accordance with FDA approval of the device for the placement in adults. As is current practice in adults undergoing the procedure, incidentally discovered hiatal hernias are repaired at the time of band placement, to reduce the incidence of post-operative reflux. Children receive prophylactic antibiotics, and are observed overnight after surgery. Patients are generally discharged from the hospital the next day. The band will initially be left empty at the end of the placement procedure.</description>
