      The purpose of the NOSE Study is to carefully examine the efficacy and safety of 3 nasal
      sprays (bevacizumab, estriol, and tranexamic acid), compared to placebo, for the treatment of
      HHT related nosebleeds.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      140 patients with moderate to severe epistaxis secondary to HHT will be randomized to receive
      one of four intranasal sprays for a period of 12 weeks and then followed for an additional 12
      weeks off therapy. Enrollment will occur over a period of 18-36 months. The primary endpoint
      will be the frequency of epistaxis. Secondary endpoints will include duration of epistaxis,
      the Hoag Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), a quality of life survey, satisfaction with
      treatment, hemoglobin and ferritin levels, transfusion requirements, and treatment failure.
      The sprays will be: saline spray (Placebo); estriol 0.1% in methylcellulose suspension (EST);
      tranexamic acid 10% in saline (TA), and bevacizumab 1% in saline (BEV). All sprays will be
      applied to the nasal mucosa by an identical spray bottle at a dose of 0.1 ml per nostril
      twice daily (total dose of 0.4 ml daily). Thus, the delivered doses will be: EST, 0.4 mg/day;
      TA, 40 mg/day; BEV, 4 mg/day.

        14. Baseline use of the following anticoagulants is not allowed: warfarin or other vitamin
        K antagonists at any dose; unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins at standard
        doses for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE); or aspirin at &gt;325 mg/day. Baseline
        use of the following anticoagulants is allowed: heparins at standard doses for VTE

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited from the HHT clinics at 6 sites if they met all of the following criteria: age &gt;=18; diagnosis of definite or possible HHT; epistaxis lasting at least 1 minute, occurring at least once weekly, and clinically stable during the preceding 8weeks; and had an Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) of at least 3.0.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>123 patients provided consent but 1 withdrew consent and 1 was excluded due to brain arteriovenous malformation. Therefore 121 patients were randomized and included in participant flow. 1 patient in the estriol group was subsequently removed after it was discovered that she was taking estrogen outside the protocol (protocol violation).</pre_assignment_details>

      <desc>Patients were queried at various time points about a specific list of key adverse events and asked for any additional side effects that they may have experienced. Nasal symptoms included rhinorrhea, congestion and sneezing but were not monitored in such a way to allow distinction. Nausea and vomiting were not monitored in such a way to allow distinction and are reported collectively as nausea/vomiting.</desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>1. One key limitation is the lack of a baseline epistaxis diary. 2. Drug absorption may have been hampered because of local scab and crust formation causing a barrier to drug penetration. 3. Saline may not be a true placebo due to hydration effects.</limitations_and_caveats>
