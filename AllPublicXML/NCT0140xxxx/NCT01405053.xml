    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Problem T-scores at the End of 2-year Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment Period (up to approximately Week 106)</time_frame>
    <description>CBCL: 99-item questionnaire measures specific behavioral problems or developmental delays, answered by a parent/legal guardian or suitable caregiver. Each item were rated using 3-point scale (0=Not True, 1=Somewhat/Sometimes True, 2=Very True/ Often True) to indicate how often or typical the behavior was. The 99 items were combined to yield scores for 8 problem area scales (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, sleep problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and other problems) and 3 summary scores (internalizing, externalizing, and total problems). Total Problem score was sum of all the problem areas plus 1 additional item, ranging from 0 to 198. Total raw scores are converted to t-scores with mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. T-scores were standardized test scores that indicate same degree of elevation in problems relative to the normative sample of peers. Higher scores were indicative of more problems.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in CBCL Sub Scores at Week 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>CBCL: 99-item questionnaire, measures behavioral problems/developmental delays, answered by parent/guardian/caregiver. Each item rated on 3-point scale (0=Not True,1=Somewhat/Sometimes True, 2=Very/Often True). 99 items were combined to give scores for 8 problem area scales, where 1 for each 8 syndrome (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic, withdrawn, sleep, attention, aggressive behavior, and other problems) were calculated, range: 0 (normal) to 16 (clinical behavior) and 3 summary scores (internalizing, externalizing, and total problems). All 3 summary scores reported scaled to T-scores. Total Problem score was sum of all the problem areas plus 1 additional item, ranging from 0 to 198. Total raw score were converted to t-scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10. T-scores were standardized test scores that indicate same degree of elevation in problems relative to normative sample of peers. Higher scores were indicative of more problems.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Language Development Survey (LDS) Scores During Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24, 56, 88, and 106</time_frame>
    <description>LDS, a caregiver-administered survey consisted of 8-item questionnaire and vocabulary list of 310 words organized within 14 semantic categories. List contained high frequency words (e.g. more), less common words (e.g. hamburger), and lexical chunks (e.g. Sesame Street). Average LDS score, calculated by dividing total number of words across all valid phrases by number of phrases with greater than (&gt;) 0words; for participants with no words, average was 0. This value was compared to standardized chart to obtain percentile rating. LDS provided 2 scores: average phrase length (number of words/phrase) and number of endorsed vocabulary words. LDS phrase length was categorized into delay (less than or equal to [&lt;=] 20th percentile) and no delay (&gt;20th percentile). LDS vocabulary was categorized into delay(&lt;=15th percentile)and no delay(&gt;15th percentile). Both raw scores were used to provide 2 normative scores based on child's age in months. Higher scores indicated better language development.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score of Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QoLCE) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>The QoLCE was a 76-item questionnaire designed specifically to measure quality of life in children with epilepsy. QOLCE consists of 16 quality of life subscales (14 multi-item and 2 single item). Each subscales had number of items or questions with responses as excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. They were changed to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as per instructions. Then changed on a scale of 100, where 1 is equal to (=) 0, 2=25, 3=50, 4=75, and 5=100. Items corresponding to each subscale were marked and there mean score was score of that subscale. The form was completed by a parent or caregiver who interacted with the child on a consistent, daily basis and took about 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The higher the score, the better the child's quality of life.</description>

        <description>CBCL: 99-item questionnaire measures specific behavioral problems or developmental delays, answered by a parent/legal guardian or suitable caregiver. Each item were rated using 3-point scale (0=Not True, 1=Somewhat/Sometimes True, 2=Very True/ Often True) to indicate how often or typical the behavior was. The 99 items were combined to yield scores for 8 problem area scales (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, sleep problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and other problems) and 3 summary scores (internalizing, externalizing, and total problems). Total Problem score was sum of all the problem areas plus 1 additional item, ranging from 0 to 198. Total raw scores are converted to t-scores with mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. T-scores were standardized test scores that indicate same degree of elevation in problems relative to the normative sample of peers. Higher scores were indicative of more problems.</description>

Total Problem score was sum of all the problem areas plus 1 additional item, ranging from 0 to 198. Total raw scores are converted to t-scores with mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. T-scores were standardized test scores that indicate same degree of elevation in problems relative to the normative sample of peers. Higher scores were indicative of more problems.</description>

        <description>CBCL: 99-item questionnaire, measures behavioral problems/developmental delays, answered by parent/guardian/caregiver. Each item rated on 3-point scale (0=Not True,1=Somewhat/Sometimes True, 2=Very/Often True). 99 items were combined to give scores for 8 problem area scales, where 1 for each 8 syndrome (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic, withdrawn, sleep, attention, aggressive behavior, and other problems) were calculated, range: 0 (normal) to 16 (clinical behavior) and 3 summary scores (internalizing, externalizing, and total problems). All 3 summary scores reported scaled to T-scores. Total Problem score was sum of all the problem areas plus 1 additional item, ranging from 0 to 198. Total raw score were converted to t-scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10. T-scores were standardized test scores that indicate same degree of elevation in problems relative to normative sample of peers. Higher scores were indicative of more problems.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Language Development Survey (LDS) Scores During Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>LDS, a caregiver-administered survey consisted of 8-item questionnaire and vocabulary list of 310 words organized within 14 semantic categories. List contained high frequency words (e.g. more), less common words (e.g. hamburger), and lexical chunks (e.g. Sesame Street). Average LDS score, calculated by dividing total number of words across all valid phrases by number of phrases with greater than (&gt;) 0words; for participants with no words, average was 0. This value was compared to standardized chart to obtain percentile rating. LDS provided 2 scores: average phrase length (number of words/phrase) and number of endorsed vocabulary words. LDS phrase length was categorized into delay (less than or equal to [&lt;=] 20th percentile) and no delay (&gt;20th percentile). LDS vocabulary was categorized into delay(&lt;=15th percentile)and no delay(&gt;15th percentile). Both raw scores were used to provide 2 normative scores based on child's age in months. Higher scores indicated better language development.</description>

        <description>The QoLCE was a 76-item questionnaire designed specifically to measure quality of life in children with epilepsy. QOLCE consists of 16 quality of life subscales (14 multi-item and 2 single item). Each subscales had number of items or questions with responses as excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. They were changed to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as per instructions. Then changed on a scale of 100, where 1 is equal to (=) 0, 2=25, 3=50, 4=75, and 5=100. Items corresponding to each subscale were marked and there mean score was score of that subscale. The form was completed by a parent or caregiver who interacted with the child on a consistent, daily basis and took about 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The higher the score, the better the child's quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sub-scores in QoLCE</title>
        <description>The QoLCE was a 76-item questionnaire designed specifically to measure quality of life in children with epilepsy. QOLCE consists of 16 quality of life subscales (14 multi-item and 2 single item). Each subscales had number of items or questions with responses as excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. They were changed to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as per instructions. Then changed on a scale of 100, where 1=0, 2=25, 3=50, 4=75, and 5=100. Items corresponding to each subscale were marked and there mean score was score of that subscale. The form was completed by a parent or caregiver who interacted with the child on a consistent, daily basis and took about 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The higher the score, the better the child's quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set for other efficacy variable included randomized participants who received rufinamide or any other approved add-on AED of the investigator's choice and had a baseline efficacy and at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment. Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at given time period were included for assessment.</population>

            <title>Rufinamide</title>
            <description>Participants received rufinamide oral suspension as an add-on therapy to the participant’s existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs. Participants underwent a 2 week Titration Period during which rufinamide dose was increased from 10 mg/kg/day in increments of 10 mg/kg/day every 3 days to 40 mg/kg/day and thereafter in increments of 5 mg/kg/day to the target maintenance dose of 45 mg/kg/day (all daily treatments were to be administered in 2 equally divided doses). Rufinamide dose reached at the end of the Titration period were to be maintained the same throughout the 104-week Maintenance Period. At the end of Maintenance Period, rufinamide dose should be tapered (as needed) over a period of 2 weeks.</description>

          <description>Participants received rufinamide oral suspension as an add-on therapy to the participant’s existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs. Participants underwent a 2 week Titration Period during which rufinamide dose was increased from 10 mg/kg/day in increments of 10 mg/kg/day every 3 days to 40 mg/kg/day and thereafter in increments of 5 mg/kg/day to the target maintenance dose of 45 mg/kg/day (all daily treatments were to be administered in 2 equally divided doses). Rufinamide dose reached at the end of the Titration period were to be maintained the same throughout the 104-week Maintenance Period. At the end of Maintenance Period, rufinamide dose should be tapered (as needed) over a period of 2 weeks.</description>
