    <textblock>
      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and
      effectiveness of a 6-month nurse-led, interprofessional mental health promotion intervention
      aimed at older home care clients with depressive symptoms using personal support services.

      Methods/Design: This one-group pre-test post-test study aims to recruit a total of 250
      long-stay (&gt; 60 days) home care clients, 70 years or older, with depressive symptoms who are
      receiving personal support services through a home care program in Ontario, Canada. The
      nurse-led intervention is a multi-faceted 6-month program led by a Registered Nurse that
      involves regular home visits, monthly case conferences, and evidence-based assessment and
      management of depression using an interprofessional approach. The primary outcome is the
      change in severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to 6 months using the Centre for
      Epidemiological Studies in Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include changes in the
      prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety, health-related quality of life, cognitive
      function, and the rate and appropriateness of depression treatment from baseline to 12
      months. Changes in the costs of use of health services will be assessed from a societal
      perspective.

    <description>The CES-D consists of 20 items, which range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. It has been used in prior randomized controlled trials by three of the study investigators that involved older home care clients with mood disorders and has a high degree of reliability, content, construct and criterion related validity, distinguishes between depressed and non-depressed people, and is a sensitive tool for measuring changes in depressive symptoms over time in psychiatric populations.</description>

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) is a seven item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;several days&quot;, &quot;more than half the days&quot; and &quot;nearly every day&quot;.
The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; respectively, and then adding together the scores for the seven questions.
GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores represent:
0-5 = Mild anxiety
6-10 = Moderate anxiety
11-15 = Moderately severe anxiety
15-21 = Severe anxiety
When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater</description>

        <title>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener</title>
        <description>The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) is a seven item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;several days&quot;, &quot;more than half the days&quot; and &quot;nearly every day&quot;.
The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; respectively, and then adding together the scores for the seven questions.
GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores represent:
0-5 = Mild anxiety
6-10 = Moderate anxiety
11-15 = Moderately severe anxiety
15-21 = Severe anxiety
When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater</description>
