  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-interventional research registry is designed to study the comparative
      effectiveness and comparative safety of approved treatments for RA in a cohort of patients
      cared for by rheumatologists across North America. Secondary objectives include analyzing the
      epidemiology and natural history of the disease, its comorbidities, and current treatment
      practices.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this registry is to systematically collect and document use
      patterns, effectiveness, and safety of DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs),
      biologic agents, and any other treatments currently used in the management of RA.

      The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with RA under the care
      of a rheumatologist. Longitudinal data are collected from both patients and their treating
      rheumatology providers during routine clinical encounters using a structured and standardized
      data collection method. The scope of data collection includes but is not limited to patient
      demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments
      for RA), smoking status, alcohol use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other
      clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections,
      hospitalizations, and other targeted safety outcomes. After the enrollment visit, RA patients
      and physicians will complete the follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical
      encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals.
      Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result
      of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the
      Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.

        Patients are enrolled in the CORRONA Data Collection Program during regularly-scheduled
        office visits. Selected rheumatologists are invited to participate as investigators in the
        CORRONA Data Collection Program. Physicians are selected carefully in an effort to ensure
        enrollment of subjects that represent a reasonable representation of a cross-section of the
        population throughout the country with rheumatic diseases. All potential sites are screened
        for clinical research experience and adherence to GCP (Good Clinical Practice) guidelines

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 18 years of age or older.

          2. Be able and willing to provide written consent for participation in the registry as
             well as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that includes Full Name and Date of
             Birth at a minimum.

          3. Have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis by a rheumatologist.

          4. Meet at least one of the following criteria:

        (A) Currently receiving an Eligible Medication** that was started within 365 days of the
        Enrollment Visit.

        i. A temporary interruption of an Eligible Medication is allowed if the interruption in
        treatment lasted &lt;180 days.

        (B) Prescribed or receiving the first dose of an Eligible Medication** on the day of the
        Enrollment Visit.

        (C) Diagnosed with RA within 365 days of the Enrollment Visit regardless of treatment
        regimen (&quot;Early RA&quot;).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The patient must not:

          1. Have a diagnosis of Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Psoriatic arthritis (PsA),
             Spondyloarthritis (SpA), Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Systemic lupus erythematosus
             (SLE), or any other form of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis.

          2. Be starting only a non-eligible medication, unless the patient was diagnosed with RA
             within 365 days of the Enrollment Visit. Non-eligible medications include conventional
             DMARDs - for example methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, etc. - and including
             prednisone.

          3. Be participating in or planning to participate in a double-blind randomized clinical
             trial of an RA drug. Of note, concurrent participation in another observational
             registry or open-label Phase 3b/4 trial is not excluded.

             Early Follow-Up Visit Criteria

             To be eligible for an early Corrona Follow-Up Visit that is conducted &lt;150 days since
             the last registry visit, the following conditions must be met:

          4. A follow-up set of questionnaires should always be completed whenever a registry
             subject is being prescribed or receiving the first dose of a new (different) Eligible
             Medication** at a routine office visit. If this occurs less than 150 days from the
             previous visit at which Corrona questionnaires had been completed, it is considered an
             &quot;Early Follow-Up Visit.&quot; The next anticipated visit that follow-up questionnaires
             would be completed would be calculated off the Early Follow-up Visit date (=&gt;150
             days). Prior use of an Eligible Medication** does not exclude a patient from an Early
             Follow-Up visit.

               -  Eligible Medications are biologics, biosimilars, and JAK-inhibitors FDA-approved
                  for the treatment of RA. Prior use of an Eligible Medication does not exclude a
                  patient from enrollment
