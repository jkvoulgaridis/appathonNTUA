      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a parent training program in the
      treatment of social and communication deficits in children with autism. Specifically, this
      study will evaluate a developmentally based parent delivered intervention in the community
      developed by Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many treatments that claim to be effective for children with autism; however many
      of these treatments have not been investigated using scientifically rigorous methodology. A
      variety of developmentally based parent delivered interventions are gaining popularity as a
      type of treatment parents utilize to improve symptoms related to their child's diagnosis of
      autism. Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE)is a agency that provides a developmentally
      based parent delivered intervention in the community. Currently, this parent training program
      has not been evaluated using scientific methodology. Investigation into this community
      delivered treatment and its effectiveness to improve social and communication deficits will
      aid clinicians in providing better care for children with autism.
