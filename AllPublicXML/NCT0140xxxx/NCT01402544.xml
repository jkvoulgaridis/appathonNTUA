  <brief_summary>

      To determine if patients treated early after diagnosis of wet age-related macular
      degeneration can return/maintain to their baseline pre-disease BCVA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct an open label, multi-center study of naïve AMD patients that are identified
      early upon disease progression (had a normal VA, FA or OCT within 4 months prior to entry) to
      assess if treating with ranibizumab monthly can restore all patients to their baseline vision
      pre-AMD. Recent randomized clinical trials (MARINA, ANCHOR) have conclusively demonstrated
      that continued intravitreal therapy with ranibizumab in patients with subfoveal CNV from AMD
      leads to stabilization of vision in over 90% of patients and improvement in vision in at
      least a third of the patients and has led to the approval of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) for the
      treatment of neovascular AMD.

      Patients will receive monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections for 12 months (with dose
      holding for return to baseline/ 20/20 or better and no evidence of fluid on SD-OCT or FA).
      All patients will have ETDRS vision and SD-OCT, and complete exam at each monthly visit.
      Patients will each have a blood analysis for genetics (either during the GALLEY study in
      which they converted to wet AMD and entered COMPASS or during this study).

             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 50 years

          -  Naïve wet-AMD within 4 months of disease onset (for GALLEY patients) and within 3
             months of disease onset for all others

          -  Patients that have lost &gt; 5 letters from baseline best vision

          -  BCVA 20/25-20/320

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. The following are considered

             with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch.

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial which includes an
             intervention (Patients could be participating in a non-interventional study such as
             the GALLEY study)
