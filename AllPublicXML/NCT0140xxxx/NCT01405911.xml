    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dose level of sitagliptin
      (MK-0431/ONO-5435) used once daily (qd) in Japanese participants with impaired glucose
      tolerance who have inadequate glycemic control using diet and exercise therapy.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Glucose Total Area Under the Concentration Curve 0 to 2 Hours (AUC 0-2 Hrs) for Meal Tolerance Test (MTT) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose total AUC 0-2 hours for MTT was measured at Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 8. After fasting for ≥10 hours, blood samples for glucose measurement were drawn at 0 minutes (at standard meal loading), 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes. At Week 8, participants received study drug or placebo 30 minutes prior to consuming a standard meal.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Glucose Total Area Under the Concentration Curve 0 to 2 Hours (AUC 0-2 Hrs) for Meal Tolerance Test (MTT) at Week 8</title>
          <description>Glucose total AUC 0-2 hours for MTT was measured at Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 8. After fasting for ≥10 hours, blood samples for glucose measurement were drawn at 0 minutes (at standard meal loading), 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes. At Week 8, participants received study drug or placebo 30 minutes prior to consuming a standard meal.</description>
