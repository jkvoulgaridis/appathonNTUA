  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Insulin-Related Treatment Change From Initial Insulin Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Multivariable logistic regression model examined baseline participant-, physician-, and healthcare system-related factors associated with the occurrence of any change in insulin therapy. Discrimination domain of the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey [IPC] ranges from 1-5 with higher scores indicating more discrimination and Diabetes Distress Scale ranges from 1-6 with higher scores indicating more distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hypoglycemic and Severe Hypoglycemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia episodes are self-reported by all participants with complete treatment data from one month prior to the baseline visit until the last visit (24 months). Patients were asked at each visit to self-report any hypoglycemia since their last visit. At the baseline visit participants were asked their hypoglycemia information for the month prior to the baseline visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Adherent to Prescribed Insulin Therapy During the Study (Study Adherent)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>MOSAIC participants answered the question: &quot;How often did you miss your insulin shots during the last 7 days?&quot;. At each visit, participants were defined as visit adherent if the participant answered &quot;I did not miss any shots&quot; or &quot;I missed some of my shots&quot;. They were defined as not visit adherent if he/she answered any of the following: &quot;I missed about half of my shots&quot;, &quot;I missed most of my shots&quot;, or &quot;I missed all of my shots&quot;. A participant is defined to be study adherent if at least: 4 out of 5 visit adherent.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Their Personalized HbA1c Target by the End of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>As diabetes management practices vary across the countries represented in MOSAIC, a more apt measure of reaching goal is the personalized target that was set for each patient at the beginning of the study.</description>

        <description>MOSAIC participants answered the question: &quot;How often did you miss your insulin shots during the last 7 days?&quot;. At each visit, participants were defined as visit adherent if the participant answered &quot;I did not miss any shots&quot; or &quot;I missed some of my shots&quot;. They were defined as not visit adherent if he/she answered any of the following: &quot;I missed about half of my shots&quot;, &quot;I missed most of my shots&quot;, or &quot;I missed all of my shots&quot;. A participant is defined to be study adherent if at least: 4 out of 5 visit adherent.</description>
