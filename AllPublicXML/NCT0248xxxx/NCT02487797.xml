  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is a medication that is often used to strengthen contractions to overcome delayed
      labor progress. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether receiving a higher dose
      of oxytocin lowers the chance of needing a cesarean section when compared to a lower dose of
      oxytocin. Other aims include examining the relationship between dose of oxytocin regimen and
      length of labor, postpartum hemorrhage, intrauterine infection, umbilical cord gas, neonatal
      Apgar score &lt;5 at 5 minutes, and need for neonatal intensive care.

      This randomized double blind clinical trial of consenting nulliparous women in spontaneous
      labor who require oxytocin for labor augmentation seeks to determine whether use of a high
      dose oxytocin regimen improves obstetric outcomes when compared with a low dose oxytocin
      regimen, in a manner that is safe for both mother and neonate.

      This project will include 1002 women recruited from the obstetrical service at Prentice
      Women's Hospital. Women will be included if they are at least 36 weeks gestation, have a
      singleton pregnancy, and have been diagnosed with spontaneous labor or spontaneous rupture of
      membranes. Women will be exposed to oxytocin for the indication of labor augmentation at the
      discretion of their obstetric provider.

      Women will be randomized with equal probability to intervention group using a fixed
      allocation procedure. To maintain a double blind design, the Prentice Women's Hospital
      pharmacy will carry out the randomization of oxytocin solutions according to the random
      assignment so that neither the women or their care providers nor the investigators will know
      the identity of the intervention assignment. The low-dose oxytocin regimen group will receive
      a starting oxytocin regimen concentration rate of 2 milliunits/minute that can be increased
      at increments of 2 milliunits/minute, as per the discretion of their obstetric provider. The
      high-dose oxytocin regimen group will receive a starting oxytocin regimen concentration rate
      of 6 milliunits/minute that can be increased at increments of 6 milliunits/minute, as per the
      discretion of their obstetric provider.

      Once the women are enrolled, randomized, and in receipt of their assigned interventions,
      further clinical management will be left to the discretion of each woman's obstetric
      provider.

      Prior to discharge from the hospital, baseline demographic and clinical data will be obtained
      via chart review.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to give informed written consent

          -  Age 18-45 years

          -  Nulliparous

          -  Pregnant with a live singleton gestation that is equal to or greater than 36 weeks

          -  Diagnosed with at least 6 regular uterine contractions in an observation period of no
             more than 60 minutes and at least one of the following: spontaneous rupture of
             membranes, OR cervix greater than or equal to 3 centimeters dilated OR cervix at least
             80% effaced.

          -  The participant's attending obstetric physician or midwife has determined that the
             participant needs administration of oxytocin infusion for labor augmentation. Labor
             augmentation will be defined as stimulation of uterine contractions when spontaneous
             contractions have failed to result in progressive cervical dilation of descent of
             fetus.
