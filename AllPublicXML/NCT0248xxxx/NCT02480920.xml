      NOACs have several clinical and pharmacological advantages over warfarin however suboptimal
      adherence is one of the most common causes of failure to respond to medications and outcomes.

      This observational multicenter, retrospective study, will compose a national database of drug
      adherence and investigate the factors that affect drug adherence in patients taking new oral
      anticoagulation therapy in Turkey.

      Social support and adherence to therapy factors that may affect drug adherence and adverse
      events will be assessed by self-report questionnaires.

      Non-adherence will be tested for demographic, clinical, awareness of NOAC therapy and
      socioeconomic factors.

The validity of the Morisky Adherence Scale had already been demonstrated with regard to medication adherence in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists. An extended 8-item Morisky scale was used instead of the original 4-item Morisky scale in order to better identify the situations and the conditions that could affect medication adherence and to better assess the psychometric features.The reliability and the validity of the 8-item Morisky Adherence Scale translated into Turkish had been demonstrated in Turkish population by previous studies.</description>

          <description>This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2015 and February 2016 in 45 centers encompassing all the geographical regions of Turkey. A total of 3150 patients were evaluated in this study. The 163 patients with a sociocultural level inadequate to fill the questionnaire and the 249 patients who received new oral anticoagulant for less than 3 months were excluded from the study. This study was conducted with the remaining 2738 patients.</description>

          <description>This multicenter cross-sectional study was consisted of patients who with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) receiving Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants NOACs), older than 18 years, who were followed up in cardiology clinics, and who received dabigatran (110-150 mg), rivaroxaban (15-20 mg), or apixaban (2.5-5 mg) for the last 3 months with &gt;30 days of supply due to NVAF.
The patients were categorized into 2 groups as adherent patients who had high and medium adherence (Morisky score 6 or more) and non-adherent patients who had low adherence (Morisky score 5 or less).</description>
