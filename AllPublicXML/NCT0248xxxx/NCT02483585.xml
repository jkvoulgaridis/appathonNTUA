    <textblock>
      Adults with a history of migraine with or without aura for ≥ 12 months and who experience ≥ 4
      to &lt; 15 migraine days per month with &lt; 15 headache days per month will be randomized 1:1 to
      placebo or erenumab. Double-blind erenumab or placebo will be administered during the 12-week
      double-blind treatment phase and open-label erenumab will be administered during the 28-week
      open-label treatment phase.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Monthly Migraine Days at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week baseline phase and the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine day was any calendar day in which the participant experienced a qualified migraine headache (onset, continuation, or recurrence of the migraine headache). A qualified migraine headache was defined either as a migraine with or without aura.
The change from baseline in monthly migraine days was calculated as the number of migraine days during the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase - the number of migraine days during the 4-week baseline phase.</description>

    <description>A migraine day was any calendar day in which the participant experienced a qualified migraine headache (onset, continuation, or recurrence of the migraine headache). A qualified migraine headache was defined either as a migraine without aura or a migraine with aura. Monthly migraine days were calculated as the number of migraine days in the 4-week baseline phase and during the last 4 weeks of double-blind treatment.
At least a 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days was determined if the change in monthly migraine days from the 4-week baseline phase to the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase * 100 / baseline monthly migraine days was less than or equal to -50%.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Monthly Acute Migraine-specific Medication Treatment Days at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week baseline phase and the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>Monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days is the number of days on which migraine specific medications were used between monthly doses of study drug. Migraine-specific medications includes two categories of medications: triptan-based migraine medications and ergotamine-based migraine medications.
The change from baseline in monthly acute migraine-specific treatment days was calculated as the number of migraine-specific treatment days during the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase - the number of migraine-specific treatment days during the 4-week baseline phase.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 5-point Reduction From Baseline in Average Impact on Everyday Activities Domain Score Measured by MPFID at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week baseline phase and the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>The Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) is a self-administered 13-item instrument measuring physical functioning. It has two domains, Impact on Everyday Activities (7 items) and Physical Impairment (5 items), and one stand-alone global question. Participants completed the MPFID daily in an electronic diary based on the past 24 hours. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale, with difficulty items ranging from &quot;Without any difficulty&quot; (1) to &quot;Unable to do&quot; (5) and frequency items ranging from &quot;None of the time&quot; (1) to &quot;All of the time&quot; (5). For each domain, the scores were calculated as the sum of the responses and rescaled to 0 - 100, with higher scores representing greater impact of migraine.
Achievement of at least a 5 point reduction from baseline in the monthly average domain score was calculated as (monthly average domain score during the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase - baseline monthly average domain score) was ≤ -5.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to 12 weeks after the last dose. The double-blind treatment phase was 12 weeks and the open-label treatment phase was 28 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4, where:
Grade 1 = Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; Grade 2 = Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL; Grade 4 = Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 = Death related to AE.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Antibodies to Erenumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (the period prior to the first dose erenumab 70 mg) and post-baseline (the period after the first dose of erenumab 70 mg until 12 weeks after last dose, up to 48 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were first tested in an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against erenumab. Samples confirmed to be positive for binding antibodies were subsequently tested in a cell-based bioassay to determine neutralizing activity against erenumab (Neutralizing Antibody Assay).
Developing antibody incidence indicates participants with a negative or no result at baseline and a positive result at any time post-baseline.
If a sample was positive for binding antibodies and demonstrated neutralizing activity at the same time point, the sample was defined as positive for neutralizing antibodies.
Transient indicates a negative result at the participant's last time point tested, for those participants with a positive binding/neutralizing result post-baseline.</description>

        <description>The Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) is a self-administered 13-item instrument measuring physical functioning. It has two domains, Impact on Everyday Activities (7 items) and Physical Impairment (5 items), and one stand-alone global question. Participants completed the MPFID daily in an electronic diary based on the past 24 hours. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale, with difficulty items ranging from &quot;Without any difficulty&quot; (1) to &quot;Unable to do&quot; (5) and frequency items ranging from &quot;None of the time&quot; (1) to &quot;All of the time&quot; (5). For each domain, the scores were calculated as the sum of the responses and rescaled to 0 - 100, with higher scores representing greater impact of migraine.
Achievement of at least a 5 point reduction from baseline in the monthly average domain score was calculated as (monthly average domain score during the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase - baseline monthly average domain score) was ≤ -5.</description>

        <description>The Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) is a self-administered 13-item instrument measuring physical functioning. It has two domains, Impact on Everyday Activities (7 items) and Physical Impairment (5 items), and one stand-alone global question. Participants completed the MPFID daily in an electronic diary based on the past 24 hours. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale, with difficulty items ranging from &quot;Without any difficulty&quot; (1) to &quot;Unable to do&quot; (5) and frequency items ranging from &quot;None of the time&quot; (1) to &quot;All of the time&quot; (5). For each domain, the scores were calculated as the sum of the responses and rescaled to 0 - 100, with higher scores representing greater impact of migraine.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
