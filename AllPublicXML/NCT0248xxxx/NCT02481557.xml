    <measure>Change From Baseline Air Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Schiff Sensitivity Scale was assessed for each test tooth via an evaporative air challenge. The examiner recorded the Schiff Index score corresponding to the response to the air challenge. The Schiff Index Sensitivity scale is scored as follows- 0: tooth/subject did not respond to stimulus, 1: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2: tooth/subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves form stimulus, 3: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A negative change from Baseline score represents a decrease in sensitivity from baseline. The mean change from Baseline was calculated for this measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline for Yeaple Probe</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile Threshold was measured using a Yeaple probe. Testing was performed beginning at 10 g. The examiner recorded tactile scores for responding teeth. After treatment, testing began at 10 g and increase by 10 g to a maximum of 50 g. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. Each successive challenge increased until a &quot;yes&quot; response was repeated. If a second &quot;yes&quot; was not obtained, the force setting was increased to the next step and continued until a force was found which elicited two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses and was recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form. The mean change from Baseline was calculated for this measure.</description>

The examiner recorded the Schiff Index score corresponding to the response to the air challenge. The Schiff Index Sensitivity scale is scored as follows- 0: tooth/subject did not respond to stimulus, 1: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2: tooth/subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves form stimulus, 3: tooth/subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A negative change from Baseline score represents a decrease in sensitivity from baseline. The mean change from Baseline was calculated for this measure.</description>

        <description>Tactile Threshold was measured using a Yeaple probe. Testing was performed beginning at 10 g. The examiner recorded tactile scores for responding teeth. After treatment, testing began at 10 g and increase by 10 g to a maximum of 50 g. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. Each successive challenge increased until a &quot;yes&quot; response was repeated. If a second &quot;yes&quot; was not obtained, the force setting was increased to the next step and continued until a force was found which elicited two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses and was recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form.

          <title>Change From Baseline for Yeaple Probe</title>
          <description>Tactile Threshold was measured using a Yeaple probe. Testing was performed beginning at 10 g. The examiner recorded tactile scores for responding teeth. After treatment, testing began at 10 g and increase by 10 g to a maximum of 50 g. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. Each successive challenge increased until a &quot;yes&quot; response was repeated. If a second &quot;yes&quot; was not obtained, the force setting was increased to the next step and continued until a force was found which elicited two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses and was recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form. The mean change from Baseline was calculated for this measure.</description>
