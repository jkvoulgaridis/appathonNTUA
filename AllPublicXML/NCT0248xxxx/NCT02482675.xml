  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Short-term
      increases in blood sugar, or postprandial hyperglycemia (PPH), affect blood vessel function
      and increase the risk of CVD. Greater intakes of dairy foods have been associated with a
      lower risk of CVD, but whether these effects occur directly or indirectly by displacing foods
      in the diet that might increase CVD risk is unclear. The health benefits of dairy on heart
      health are at least partly attributed to its ability to limit PPH and resulting PPH-mediated
      responses leading to vascular dysfunction. This provides rationale to further investigate
      dairy as a dietary strategy to reduce PPH and risk for CVD. The objective of this study is to
      define the extent to which dairy milk, and its whey and casein protein fractions, protect
      against postprandial vascular dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress responses that limit
      nitric oxide bioavailability to the vascular endothelium in adults with prediabetes.

      This study consists of four, 3-hour postprandial trials in response to consuming the
      following dietary treatments: 1. oral glucose challenge, 2. oral glucose challenge in
      combination with non-fat milk, 3. oral glucose challenge in combination with whey protein
      isolate, and 4. oral glucose challenge in combination with sodium caseinate. For three days
      preceding each trial, participants will be provided all meals to standardize physiologic
      responses to test meals. On each trial day, vascular function will be assessed and blood
      samples collected prior to and at 30 minute intervals for 3 hours following test meal
      ingestion.
