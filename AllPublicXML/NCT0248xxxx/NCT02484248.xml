  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acid reduction remains the most common treatment prescribed empirically by pediatric
      gastroenterologists for children with functional dyspepsia (FD). When acid reduction therapy
      fails to provide patients with a therapeutic effect, ketotifen and cromolyn, mast cell
      stabilizers, represent an attractive potential therapy given data implicating mast cells in
      the generation of dyspeptic symptoms. Although there have been no adult or pediatric studies
      on the use of mast cell stabilizers in patients with FD, benefit has been demonstrated in
      adults with IBS and children with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Additionally, previous
      studies show mucosal eosinophilia is highly correlated with functional dyspepsia. Our usual
      current treatment pathway for functional dyspepsia in association with duodenal mucosal
      eosinophilia is as follows: acid-reducing medication/montelukast → addition of H1 antagonist
      → addition of budesonide → addition of oral cromolyn. If ketotifen is effective, it offers
      the advantage of being able to replace both the H1 antagonist and the oral cromolyn at a
      substantially reduced cost (approximately 10% of the cost of cromolyn alone). This study aims
      to introduce ketotifen earlier in the treatment pathway to examine its efficacy on children
      with functional dyspepsia in association with duodenal eosinophilia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of ketotifen in children
      ages 8 through 17 inclusive that have a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia and have had
      continued abdominal pain despite acid reduction therapy in combination with montelukast. The
      primary aim is to assess the symptomatic response to ketotifen as compared to placebo in
      children with functional dyspepsia in association with duodenal eosinophilia who have
      previously had worsening, no clinical change, or only a partial response to acid-reduction
      therapy in combination with montelukast.

      The study lasts 147 days for subjects responsive to ketotifen and 63 days for those who are
      not. For those who respond to ketotifen, there are 4 clinic visits and 3 phone interviews.
      Clinic visits include a physical, blood draws, questionnaires, review of medical history and
      medications; phone interviews involve answering a few questions. For those who do not respond
      to ketotifen, there are 3 clinic and 2 phone visits. Subjects who enroll in the study are
      randomly assigned to Group A or Group B. The subject, subject's parents, and study staff will
      not know to which group the subject is assigned. Group A will be given a placebo, an inactive
      pill with no medication in it, for days 1-28, and switched to ketotifen for days 36-63. Group
      B will be given ketotifen for days 1-28 and switched to placebo for days 36-63. The group
      assignment will be unblinded at day 63, at which point initial ketotifen responders will
      undergo an open-label twelve week trial of ketotifen to assess sustainability.

      Secondary aims of this study include assessing the impact of ketotifen on quality of life,
      state and trait anxiety, and whether baseline trait anxiety is predictive of clinical
      response to ketotifen. The study will also assess whether functional dyspepsia subtype is
      predictive of response to ketotifen, the sustainability of response to ketotifen in initial
      responders, and the pharmacokinetics of ketotifen in this patient population.
